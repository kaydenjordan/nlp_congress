 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 601, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4) to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise  the criteria for determining which States and political subdivisions  are subject to section 4 of the Act, and for other purposes, and ask  for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 4.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  Act of 2021, would revitalize and strengthen the Voting Rights Act of  1965 to confront the onslaught of discriminatory voting laws and  practices that have emerged in recent years across the country.   In 2013, the Supreme Court, in Shelby County v. Holder, gutted the  Voting Rights Act's most important enforcement mechanism, the Section 5  preclearance regime, which required jurisdictions with a history of  discrimination against racial and ethnic minority voters to seek  approval of any changes to their voting laws before they could go into  effect.   Almost immediately after the decision, many of these jurisdictions  unleashed a raft of voter suppression measures, knowing that these laws  now could only be challenged after the fact and only through a costly  and time-consuming process that made such challenges unlikely and when  people's votes had already been improperly invalidated.   When the Court struck down the coverage formula that determined which  jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, it explicitly invited  Congress to devise a new formula to meet the current need to remedy  voting discrimination.   H.R. 4 answers that call.   This legislation would create a new geographic coverage formula that  is fine-tuned to capture only those places with longstanding and  persistent discrimination. At the same time, it targets only recent  discrimination and does not leave jurisdictions frozen in time.   The bill also requires preclearance of certain practices that are  historically associated with voting discrimination; it responds to the  recent Supreme Court decision in Brnovich v. DNC, which severely  limited enforcement of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; and it  provides other important tools to strengthen enforcement of the VRA.   H.R. 4 rests on a substantial record that documents the myriad ways  that  [[Page H4392]]  the right to vote, the most fundamental right in a democracy, remains  under threat for too many Americans.   I want to thank Terri Sewell for introducing this bill,   Steve Cohen  for the 13 hearings he held on voting rights in the Constitution  Subcommittee, as well as our colleagues on the Subcommittee on  Elections and the Committee on House Administration for their work.   I urge all Members to join me in honoring the legacy of our beloved  colleague, the late John Lewis, who shed his blood to secure passage of  the Voting Rights Act, by supporting this vital legislation.

Lewis Voting Rights Advancement               Act of 2021 for the 117th Congress as Amended         Section 1. Short Title. Section 1 sets forth the short       title of the bill as the ``John R. Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act of 2021'' (``VRAA'').        Section 2. Vote Dilution, Denial, and Abridgement Claims.       Section 2 of the bill would amend Section 2 of the Voting       Rights Act of 1965 (``VRA'') in response to the Supreme       Court's decision in Brnovich v. Democratic National       Committee. VRA Section 2(a) prohibits states and localities       from imposing a voting rule that has the purpose or effect of       denying or abridging citizens' right to vote because of race,       color, or language minority status. VRA Section 2(b)       currently lays out a test for determining when such a       violation has occurred, providing that a violation is       established if, ``based on the totality of the circumstances,       it is shown that the political processes leading to       nomination or election in the State or political subdivision       are not equally open to participation by members of a class       of citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its members       have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to       participate in the political process and to elect       representatives of their choice.''        In response to the Brnovich Court's narrowing of Section       2(b) in vote denial cases (and with potential risk for vote       dilution cases), the bill creates a bifurcated test, one that       would apply to vote dilution claims (e.g., challenges to       redistricting or changes in district or jurisdictional       boundaries) and vote denial claims (e.g., challenges to       changes in voting rules).        Section 2(a) of the bill would amend Section 2(a) of the       VRA by making technical amendments to clarify that subsection       (b) and new subsections (c), (d), or (e) apply when       determining a violation under Section 2(a) of the VRA.        Section 2(b) of the bill amends Section 2(b) of the VRA to       preserve the existing ``totality of the circumstances'' test,       and expressly adopt the list of non-exhaustive factors       applied by federal courts considering Section 2 vote dilution       claims that were outlined in the Supreme Court's 1986       decision in Thornburg v. Gingles. Section 2(b) of the bill       requires a plaintiff to establish as a threshold matter that       1) the members of the protected are sufficiently numerous and       geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single       member district; 2) the members of the protected class are       politically cohesive; and 3) the residents of that district       who are not the members of the protected class usually vote       sufficiently as a bloc to enable them to defeat the preferred       candidates of the members of the protected class.        Section 2(b) of the bill also provides that once the       plaintiff establishes the required threshold showing, a court       must consider a totality of the circumstances analysis with       respect to a claim of vote dilution to determine whether       there has been a violation of Section 2(A) of the VRA, which       must include consideration of the following factors:        (1) The extent of any history of official voting       discrimination in the state or political subdivision that       affected the right of members of the protected class to       register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the       political process.        (2) The extent to which voting in the elections of the       state or political subdivision is racially polarized.        (3) The extent to which the state or political subdivision       has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance       the opportunity for discrimination against the members of the       protected class, such as unusually large elections districts,       majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or       other qualifications, prerequisites, standards, practices, or       procedures that may enhance the opportunity for       discrimination against the members of the protected class.        (4) If there is a candidate slating process, whether the       members of the protected class have been denied access to       that process.        (5) The extent to which members of the protected class in       the state or political subdivision bear the effects of       discrimination, both public or private, in such areas as       education, employment, health, housing, and transportation       which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the       political process.        (6) Whether political campaigns have been characterized by       over or subtle racial appeals.        (7) The extent to which members of the protected class have       been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.        Section 2(b) also provides that in conducting a totality of       the circumstances analysis under this subsection a court may       consider such other factors as the court may determine to be       relevant, including 1) whether there is a significant lack of       responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the       particularized needs of the members of the protected class,       including a lack of concern for or responsiveness to the       requests and proposals of the members of the protected class,       except that compliance with a court order may not be       considered evidence of responsiveness on the part of the       jurisdiction; and 2) whether the policy underlying the state       or political subdivision's use of such voting practices is       tenuous. In making this second determination, Section 2(b)       further requires a court to consider whether the       qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure       in question was designed to advance and materially advances a       valid and substantiated state interest.        Section 2(b) of the bill also amends Section 2 of the VRA       to create a new subsection 2(c) to govern claims of vote       denial. Under new subsection 2(c) , a violation of Section       2(a) is established if a voting standard, practice, or       procedure 1) results or will result in members of a protected       class facing greater costs or burdens in participating in the       political process than other voters and 2) that the greater       costs or burdens are, at least in part, caused by or linked       to social and historical conditions that have or currently       produce on the date of such challenge discrimination on the       basis of race, color, or language minority status. Section       2(b) further states that in determining the existence of a       burden, the absolute number or the percent of voters affected       or the presence of voters who are not  [[Page H4418]]       members of a protected class in the affected area is not be       dispositive, and the affected area may be smaller than the       jurisdiction to which the qualification, prerequisite,       standard, practice, or procedure applies. Additionally,       Section 2(b) provides that the challenged voting rule need       only be one ``but-for'' cause of the discriminatory result.        Section 2(b) also expressly outlines for courts the factors       that are relevant to the totality of the circumstances       analysis in a vote denial claim under new subsection 2(c).       The factors that are relevant include the following:        (1) The extent of any history of official voting-related       discrimination in the state or political subdivision that       affected the right of members of the protected class to       register, to vote, or otherwise to participate in the       political process.        (2) The extent to which voting in the elections of the       state or political subdivision is racially polarized.        (3) The extent to which the state or political subdivision       has used photo ID requirements, documentary proof of       citizenship requirements, documentary proof of residence       requirements, or other voting practices or procedure beyond       those required by federal law that impair the ability of       members of the minority group to participate fully in the       political process.        (4) The extent to which minority group members bear the       effects of discrimination both public or private, in areas       such as education, employment, health, housing, and       transportation, which hinder their ability to participate       effectively in the political process.        (5) The use of overt or subtle racial appeals either in       political campaigns or surrounding adoption or maintenance of       the challenge practice.        (6) The extent to which members of the minority group have       been elected to public office in the jurisdiction, provided       that the fat that the minority group is too small to elect       candidates of its choice shall not defeat a vote denial       claims.        (7) Whether there is a lack of responsiveness on the part       of elected officials to the particularized needs of minority       group members including a lack of concern for or       responsiveness to the requests and proposals of the group,       except that compliance with a court order may not be       considered evidence of responsiveness on the part of the       jurisdiction.        (8) Whether the policy underlying the state or political       subdivision's use of the challenged voting practice is       tenuous. In making a determination under this clause, a court       shall consider whether the qualification, prerequisite,       standard, practice, or procedure in question was designed to       advance and materially advances a valid and substantiated       State interest.        (9) Such other factors as the court may determine to be       relevant subject to the limitations set forth in this       subsection.        Section 2(b) also outlines the factors that are not       relevant to the ``totality of the circumstances'' in a vote       denial claim under new subsection 2(c). The factors that are       not relevant include the following:        (1) The degree to which the challenged voting practice has       a long pedigree or was in widespread use at some earlier       date.        (2) The use of an identical or similar voting practice in       other states or jurisdictions.        (3) The availability of other forms of voting unimpacted by       the challenged voting practice to all members of the       electorate, including members of the protected class, unless       the jurisdiction is simultaneously expanding such other       practices to eliminate any disproportionate burden imposed by       the challenged voting practice.        (4) Unsubstantiated defenses that the qualification,       prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure is necessary       to address criminal activity.        Section 2(b) creates new subsection 2(d) which clarifies       that 1) a violation of Section 2(a) of the VRA for the       purpose of a vote denial or abridgement is established if the       challenged voting practice is intended, at least in part, to       dilute minority voting strength or to deny the right of any       citizen to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a       language minority group; 2) that racial discrimination need       only be one purpose behind the challenged voting rule in       order to establish a violation of Section 2(a) of the VRA; 3)       that a voting practice intended to dilute minority voting       strength or make it more difficult for minority voters to       cast a ballot that will be counted violates this subsection       even if an additional purpose of the voting practice is to       benefit a particular political party or group; 4) that the       context for the adoption of the challenged voting practices,       including actions by official decisionmakers, may be relevant       to a violation of this subsection; and 5) that claims under       this subsection require proof of a discriminatory impact but       do not require proof of a violation of new subsection 2(b) or       new subsection 2(c).        Lastly, Section 2(b) creates new subsection 2(e) which for       the purposes of Section 2 defines the term `affected area' to       mean any geographic area in which members of a protected       class are affected by a qualification, prerequisite,       standard, practice, or procedure allegedly in violation of       this section, within a State (including any Indian lands).        Section 3. Retrogression. Section 3 of the bill would add       after Section 2 of the VRA as amended by the Act a new       Section 2(f). Section 2(f) effectively imports Section 5's       retrogression standard into Section 2 by establishing that a       violation of Section 2(a) occurs where a r voting law or rule       makes minority citizens worse off than the status quo in       terms of their ability to vote. Specifically, such a voting       rule would violate Section 2(a) if it had the purpose or will       have the effect of diminishing the ability of any citizen to       participate in the electoral process or elect a candidate of       their choice on account of their race, color, or membership       in a language minority group. The subsection applies       retroactively to any action taken on or after January 1,       2021.        Section 3 also creates a new subsection 2(g) which       clarifies that the decisions of the United States District       Court for the District of Columbia preclearing any state or       political subdivision's change to a voting law or practice       supersedes new subsection 2(f).        Section 4. Violations Triggering Authority of Court to       Retain Jurisdiction. Section 4(a) amends Section 3(c) of the       VRA to strengthen the ``bail-in'' provision by permitting       courts to bail in jurisdictions where there have been       violations of the VRA and other federal prohibitions against       discrimination in voting, in addition to instances where       there have been violations of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth       Amendments. Section 3(c) of the VRA, known as the ``bail-in''       provision, currently allows courts to retain jurisdiction to       supervise further voting changes in jurisdictions where the       court has found violations of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth       Amendments. If a jurisdiction is ``bailed in,'' it must       submit any changes to its voting procedures for approval       either to a U.S. district court or to the Attorney General.       Section 4(a) strikes ``violations of the Fourteenth and       Fifteenth amendment'' and inserts ``violations of the       Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments, violations of this Act,       or violations of any Federal law that prohibits       discrimination in voting on the basis of race, color, or       membership in a language minority group.''        Lastly, Section 4(b) of the bill also makes technical and       conforming amendments to Section 3(a) of the VRA.        Section 5. Criteria for Coverage of States and Political       Subdivisions. Section 5(a)(1) of the bill amends Section 4(b)       of the VRA by inserting a new coverage formula intended to       meet the requirements set out in Shelby County. Formerly,       Section 4(b) provided the coverage formula for determining       which jurisdictions were subject to the Section 5       preclearance requirement. The coverage formula was triggered       if a state or political subdivision, as of various points in       the 1960s or early 1970s, (1) employed prohibited ``tests or       devices'' used to limit voting and (2) had fewer than 50       percent voter registration or turnout among its voting-age       population. In Shelby County, the Court held that Section       4(b) was unconstitutional because it imposed current burdens       that were no longer responsive to the current conditions in       the voting districts in question.        Under the new coverage formula in Section 5(a)(1), ``a       State and all political subdivisions within the State''       during a calendar year would be covered if, during the       previous 25 calendar years, there were 1) 15 or more voting       rights violations occurred in the state; 2) ten or more       voting rights violations occurred in the state and at least       one violation was committed by the state itself, rather than       a political subdivision (e.g., county, town, school       district); or (3) three or more voting rights violations       occurred in the state and the state itself administers       elections in the state or in political subdivisions in which       the voting rights violations occurred. In addition, Section       5(a)(1) provides that a political subdivision would be       covered if three or more voting rights violations occurred in       that subdivision during the past 25 years. Section 5(a)(1)       specifies that the 25-year coverage period ends 10 years       after a jurisdiction is covered.        Section 5(a)(1) provides that if a state or political       subdivision obtains declaratory judgment and the judgment       remains in effect, coverage under preclearance shall no       longer apply unless voting rights violations occur after the       issuance of a declaratory judgment.        Section 5(a)(1) defines several types of events or       incidents as ``voting rights violations.'' The definition       includes:        (1) a final judgment or any preliminary, temporary, or       declaratory relief that was not reversed on appeal in which       the plaintiff prevailed or a federal court found that the       plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits       or raised a serious question with regard to race       discrimination, in which any federal court determined that a       state or political subdivision denied or abridged the right       to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a       language minority group, or that a voting qualification or       prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure       with respect to voting, created an ``undue burden'' in       connection with a claim that the challenged rule unduly       burdened minority citizens in violation of the Fourteenth or       Fifteenth Amendment anywhere in the state or subdivision;        (2) a final judgment or any preliminary, temporary, or       declaratory relief that was not reversed on appeal in which       the plaintiff prevailed or a federal court found that the       plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits       or raised a serious question with regard to race       discrimination, in which any federal court determined that a       voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,       practice, or procedure with respect to voting was imposed or       applied or  [[Page H4419]]       would have been imposed or applied anywhere in the state or       subdivision in a manner that denied or abridged or would have       denied or abridged minority citizens' right to vote, in       violation of various VRA provisions;        (3) a final judgment, that is not reversed on appeal, by a       federal court denying a state or political subdivision's       lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment under Section 3(c) or       Section 5 of the VRA that its proposed change does not have       the purpose or effect of denying citizens the right to vote       on account of race, color, or language-minority status and       thereby prevented a voting practice from being enforced       anywhere within the state or subdivision;        (4) an objection by the Attorney General under Section 3(c)       or Section 5 of the VRA, which thereby prevent a voting       practice to be enforced anywhere within the state or       subdivision. A violation does not occur if the Attorney       General has withdrawn an objection unless the withdrawal was       in response to a change in the law or practice that served as       the basis of the objection. A violation also does not occur       where the objection is based solely on a state or political       subdivisions' failure to comply with a procedural process       that would not otherwise constitute an independent violation       of this act; or        (5) a consent decree, settlement, or other agreement that       was adopted or entered by a federal court or contained an       admission of liability by the defendants, which resulted in       the alteration or abandonment of a voting practice anywhere       within the territory of the state or subdivision that had       been challenged as discriminatory under the VRA. An extension       or modification of such consent decree, settlement, or other       agreement that has been in place for 10 years or longer       constitutes an independent violation. If a court finds that       an agreement itself defined by this subsection denied or       abridged the right to vote of any citizen on account of race,       color, or membership in a language minority group, violated       the provisions of the VRA, or created an undue burden on       minority citizens' right to vote in connection with a claim       that the consent decree, settlement, or other agreement       unduly burdened voters of a particular race, color, or       language minority group, that finding shall count as an       independent violation.        (6) in the case of multiple violations committed by a       jurisdiction, each violation is to count as an independent       violation, and within a redistricting plan, each violation       found to discriminate against any group of voters based on       race, color, or language minority group shall count as an       independent violation.        Section 5(a)(1) sets forth the timing of determinations of       voting rights violations by the Attorney General and requires       that the determinations are made ``[a]s early as practicable       during each calendar year . . . including updating the list       of voting rights violations occurring in each State and       political subdivision for the previous calendar year.'' This       section also provides that the determination or certification       of the Attorney General shall be effective upon publication       in the Federal Register.        Section 5(a)(2) of the bill makes conforming amendments to       Section 4(a) of the VRA. Section 4(a) of the VRA provides the       mechanism by which a covered jurisdiction can ``bail out'' of       the preclearance requirement. Essentially, a jurisdiction       must demonstrate to a court that it has not engaged in       discriminatory practices and has complied with the       preclearance process in the preceding 10 years.        Section 5(b) of the bill amends Section 4(a)(1) by striking       ``race or color,'' and inserting ``race, color, or in       contravention of the guarantees of subsection (f)(2),'' which       protects the voting rights of a member of a language       minority.        Section 5(c)(1) of the bill amends Section 4 of the VRA by       adding a new subsection (g), New subsection (g) provides an       administrative bailout process for local jurisdictions       without a history of discrimination that might be captured by       geographic preclearance coverage.        New subsection (g)(1)(A) requires the Attorney General       after making the determination as to which states are subject       to geographic preclearance to also determine which political       subdivisions of those states are eligible for an exemption       under subsection (g) and to publish the list of any such       political subdivisions in the Federal Register. Furthermore,       any political subdivision so listed is not subject to any       requirement under Section 5 until the date on which any       application under this section has been finally disposed of       or no such application may be made.        New subsection (g)(1)(B) creates a rule of construction       that states that determinations made pursuant to inclusion on       the published list under subsection (g)(1)(A) does not have       any binding or preclusive effect nor does inclusion       constitute a final determination by the Attorney General that       a listee is eligible for an exemption; that a listee has       satisfied eligibility requirements (A) through (F) provided       under new subsection (g)(2); or that the listee is entitled       to an exemption under new subsection (g).        New subsection (g)(2) sets forth the eligibility       requirements for an exemption under this new subsection. New       subsection (g)(2) states that a political subdivision that       makes an application under new subsection (g)(3) is eligible       for an exemption under this subsection provided that during       the ten years preceding the filing of the application, and       during the pendency of such application:        (A) no test or device referred to in subsection 4(a)(1) of       the VRA has been used within the political subdivision with       the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to       vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language       minority group;        (B) no final judgement of any court of the United States,       other than the denial of declaratory judgment under this       section, has determined that denials or abridgements of the       right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a       language minority group have occurred anywhere in the       territory of such political subdivision and no consent       decree, settlement, or agreement has been entered into       resulting in any abandonment of a voting law or practice       challenged on such grounds; and no declaratory judgment under       this section has been entered during the pendency of an       action commenced before the filing of an action under this       section and alleging such denials or abridgements of the       right to vote;        (C) no federal examiners or observers under the VRA have       been assigned to such political subdivision;        (D) such political subdivision and all governmental units       within its territory have complied with Section 5 of the VRA,       including compliance with the requirement that no change       covered by Section 5 has been enforced without preclearance       under Section 5, and have repealed all changes covered by       Section 5 to which the Attorney General has successfully       objected or as to which the United States District Court for       the District of Columbia has denied declaratory judgment;        (E) the Attorney General has not interposed any objection       (that has not been overturned by a final judgment of a court)       and no declaratory judgment has been denied under Section 5,       with respect to any submission or by or on behalf of the       plaintiff or any governmental unit within its territory under       Section 5, and no such submissions or declaratory judgment       actions are pending; and        (F) such political subdivisions and all governmental units       within its territory have eliminated voting procedures and       methods of election which inhibit or dilute equal access to       the electoral process; engaged in constructive efforts to       eliminate intimidation and harassment of persons exercising       rights protected under the VRA; and engaged in other       constructive efforts, such as expanded opportunity for       convenient registration and voting for every person of voting       age and the appointment of minority persons as election       officials throughout the jurisdiction and at all stages of       the election and registration process.        New subsection (g)(3) establishes the application period       for the exemption provided under new subsection (g). Not       later than 90 days after the publication of the list under       new subsection (g)(1)(A), a political subdivision included       under such a list may submit an application containing such       information that the Attorney General may require, and the       Attorney General must provide notice in the Federal Register       of such an application.        New subsection (g)(4) requires the Attorney General to       establish a comment period during the 90 days beginning on       the date that notice is published under new subsection (g)(3)       to give interested persons an opportunity to submit       objections to the Attorney General regarding the issuance of       an exemption under this subsection to a political subdivision       on the basis that it may not meet the eligibility       requirements under new subsection (g)(2). New subsection       (g)(4) also requires the 90-day period to be extended for an       additional 30 days during the 1-year period beginning on the       effective date of this subsection. Additionally, the Attorney       General must notify the political subdivision of each       submitted objection and afford the political subdivision the       opportunity to respond.        New subsection (g)(5) sets forth requirements for the       Attorney General when making a determination as to the       objections submitted during the 90-day comment period       established under new subsection (g)(4). Under this       subsection, the Attorney General must consider and respond to       each objection (and any response of the political       subdivision) during the 60-day period beginning on the day       after the comment period under new subsection (g)(4)       concludes. If the Attorney General determines that any       objection is justified, the Attorney General must publish       notice in the Federal Register denying the application for       an exemption. If the Attorney General determines that no       objection submitted is justified, no later than 90 days       after the 60-day comment period established under this       subsection concludes, each person that submitted an       objection may filed in the District Court of the District       of Columbia, an action for judicial review of such       determination in according with 5 U.S.C. Ch. 7.        New subsection (g)(6) provides the Attorney General the       authority to issue an exemption under this subsection by       publication in the Federal Register from the application of       the preclearance formula in Section 4(a) with respect to a       political subdivision that is eligible under new subsection       (g)(2) and to which no objection submitted under new       subsection (g)(4) or determined justified under new       subsection (g)(5).        New subsection (g)(7) states that, unless explicitly       provided in this subsection, no determination under this       subsection shall be subject to judicial review, and that all       determinations under this subsection are committed to the       discretion of the Attorney General.        New subsection (g)(8) exempts a political subdivision from       geographic preclearance  [[Page H4420]]       coverage under Section 4(a) if that political subdivision       obtained a declaratory judgment entered prior to the       effective date of this subsection ``bailing out'' the       political subdivision and the political subdivision has not       violated any of the eligibility requirements set forth in new       subsection (g)(2) any time thereafter.        Section 5(c)(2)(A) of the bill makes several technical and       conforming amendments to Section 4(a)(1) of the VRA.        Section 5(c)(2)(B) of the bill creates a self-executing       amendment to the VRA, establishing that 1 year following the       effective date of new subsection (g), Section 4(g)(3) of the       VRA (new subsection (g)(3) in this document) is amended by       striking ``During the 1 year period beginning on the       effective date of this subsection, such 90-day period shall       be extended by an additional 30 days.'' Section 5(c)(2)(B)       also provides that for the purposes of any periods under such       section commenced as of such date, the 90-day period shall       remain extended by an additional 30 days.        Section 6. Determination of States and Political       Subdivisions Subject to Preclearance for Covered Practices.       Section 6 of the bill would add after Section 4 of the VRA a       new ``Section 4A'' that would provide a new ``practice-based       preclearance'' formula for known practices that would apply       nationwide and cover voting law changes that have       historically been used to discriminate against voters.        New Section 4A(a)(1) provides that each state and political       subdivision must identify all new laws, regulations, or       policies that include voting qualifications or prerequisites       to voting covered by subsection (b) and ensure that no       covered practice is implemented unless it has been       precleared.        New Section 4A(a)(2)(A) provides that the Attorney General,       in consultation with the Director of the Bureau of Census and       the heads of other relevant governmental offices, must       determine as early as possible each calendar year the voting-      age populations and characteristics of those populations, and       publish a list of the states and subdivisions to which a       voting-age population characteristic described in the       ``Covered Practices'' section. Section 4A(a)(2(B) of the bill       sets forth that a ``determination or certification of the       Attorney General under this paragraph shall be effective upon       publication in the Federal Register.''        New Section 4A(b) defines the following as ``covered       practices'' and includes additional protections for Native       American voters:        (1) any change to the method of election to (a) add seats       elected at-large or (b) convert one or more seats elected       from a single-member district to one or more at-large seats       or seats from a multi-member district in a state or       subdivision where ``2 or more racial groups or language       minority groups each represent 20 percent or more of the       political subdivision's voting-age population'' or ``a single       language minority group represents 20 percent or more of the       voting-age population on Indian lands located in whole or in       part in the political subdivision'';        (2) any change or series of changes within a year to the       boundaries of jurisdictions that reduces by 3 or more       percentage points the proportion of the jurisdiction's       voting-age population that is comprised of members of a       single racial group or language minority group in a state or       subdivision where ``2 or more racial groups or language       minority groups each represent 20 percent or more of the       political subdivision's voting-age population'' or ``a single       language minority group represents 20 percent or more of the       voting-age population on Indian lands located in whole or in       part in the political subdivision'';        (3) any change to redistricting in a state or subdivision       where any racial group or minority language group that is not       the largest racial group or language minority group in the       jurisdiction and that represents 15 percent or more of the       jurisdiction's voting age population experiences a population       increase over the preceding decade of at least 20 percent of       its voting-age population in the jurisdiction;        (4) any change to requirements for documentation or proof       of identity to vote or to register to vote such that the       requirements will exceed or be more stringent than those       under state law on the day before the date of enactment of       the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021, and,       where a state imposes an identification requirement for       receiving and casting a ballot in a federal election, if the       State does not permit the individual to meet the requirement       and cast a ballot in the election in the same manner as an       individual who presents identification by permitting the in-      person or vote by mail voters to submit a sworn statement       attesting to their identity and eligibility to vote in lieu       of identification;        (5) any change that reduces multilingual voting materials       or alters the manner in which such materials are provided or       distributed, where no similar reduction or alteration occurs       in materials provided in English; or        (6) any change that reduces, consolidates, or relocates       voting locations, including early, absentee, and election-day       voting locations, including early, absentee, and election-day       voting locations, or reduces days or hours of in person       voting on any Sunday during a period occurring prior to the       date of an election during which voters may cast ballots       in such election, or prohibits the provision of food or       non-alcoholic drink to persons waiting to vote in an       election except where the provision would violate       prohibitions on expenditures to influence voting: (a) in       one or more census tracts wherein two or more language       minority groups or racial groups represent 20 percent or       more of the voting-age population of the political       subdivision; or        (b) on Indian lands wherein at least 20 percent of the       voting-age population belongs to a single language minority       group.        (7) any change to the maintenance of voter registration       lists that adds a new basis for removal from the list of       active registered voters or that incorporates new sources of       information in determining a voter's eligibility to vote,       wherein such a change would have a statistically significant       disparate impact on the removal from voter rolls of members       of racial groups or language minority groups that constitute       greater than 5 percent of the voting-age population. This       would apply only to political subdivisions where (a) two or       more racial groups or language minority groups comprise 20       percent each of the voting age population or (b) on Indian       lands, a single language minority group comprises at least 20       percent of the voting age population located within the       subdivision. With respect to states, this provision would       apply to those states with where at least 20 percent of the       voting age population of the state or of a political       subdivision within a state is composed of two or more racial       groups or language minority groups, except the preclearance       requirement apply only with respect to each such political       subdivision.        New Section 4A(c)(1) sets forth a preclearance process for       the covered practices described above. A state or political       subdivision may institute an action in the United States       District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory       judgment that the covered practice ``neither has the purpose       nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to       vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language       minority group.'' The covered practice cannot be implemented       unless and until the court enters such judgment. A state or       subdivision can forego pursuing the described court action       and implement the covered practice if the Attorney General       has not interposed an objection within 60 days. Section       4A(c)(1) provides that the Attorney General or any aggrieved       citizen may file an action in a U.S. district court to compel       any state or political subdivision to satisfy the       preclearance requirements. The court must provide injunctive       relief as a remedy unless the ``voting qualification or       prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure       with respect to voting'' is not a covered practice or the       State or political subdivision has complied with the       preclearance requirements.        New Section 4A(c)(2) provides that any covered practice       defined in New Section 4A(b) that has the purpose of effect       of diminishing the ability of citizens to elect their       preferred candidates of choice on account of race, color, or       language minority status is considered a denial or       abridgement of the right to vote for purposes of this       practice-based preclearance provision.        New Section 4A(c)(3) defines ``purpose'' as used in Section       4A to include any discriminatory purpose.        New Section 4A(c)(4) defines the purpose of Section       4A(c)(2) to protect the ability of citizens to elect their       candidate of choice.        New Section 4A(d) grants authority to the Attorney General       or a private party to file a civil action in federal district       court to compel any state or locality to comply with this       section. Such actions are to be heard before a three-judge       panel. This subsection requires such a court to enjoin the       challenged voting practice unless the challenged practice is       not a covered practice or the jurisdiction has precleared the       challenged practice.        New Section 4A(e) specifies that the calculation of the       population of a racial or language minority group must be       carried out using the methodology outlined in regulatory       guidance.        New Section 4A(f) provides that Census Bureau data, whether       estimates or actual enumerations, cannot be subject to       challenge or review in court for purposes of any       determinations under this section.        New Section 4A(g) defines ``multilingual voting materials''       as used in this section to mean ``registration or voting       notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials       or information relating to the electoral process, including       ballots, provided in the language or languages of one or more       language minority groups.''        Section 7. Promoting Transparency to Enforce the Voting       Rights Act. Section 7 adds after Section 5 of the VRA a new       Section 6. New Section 6 imposes new notice and disclosure by       states and political subdivisions for three voting-related       matters, including: (1) late breaking voting changes       involving federal elections (e.g., changes in voting       standards or procedures enacted 180 days before a federal       election); (2) polling resources involving federal elections       (e.g., information concerning precincts/polling places,       number of voting age and registered voters, voting machines,       and poll workers); and (3) redistricting, reapportionment,       and other changes in voting districts involving federal,       state, and local elections. Section 7 of the bill provides       that public notice for each of these matters must be in a       format that is accessible to voters with disabilities,       including persons who have low vision or who are blind.       Section 7 also provides that the right to vote of any person       shall not be abridged or denied because that person failed to       comply with any voting law change if the state or  [[Page H4421]]       political subdivision involved did not meet the applicable       requirements of this section with respect to that change.        Section 8. Authority to Assign Observers. Section 8 of the       bill amends Section 8 of the VRA. Section 8 of the VRA       currently allows the Attorney General to certify the need for       federal election observers in jurisdictions covered by the       VRA's coverage formula where the Attorney General has       received ``meritorious complaints'' from residents, local       officials, or organizations that voting violations are likely       to occur, or where the Attorney General determines that       assignment of observers is ``otherwise necessary'' to enforce       the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment. These observers must       be authorized to enter polling places to observe whether       people who are entitled to vote are being permitted to do so,       and to observe the processes in which votes are tabulated.       VRA Section 8 gives the Director of the Office of Personnel       Management the authority to designate and assign individuals       to be observers.        Section 8 of the bill would expand the set of circumstances       under which the Attorney General may seek to assign election       observers and would transfer control of the observer program       from OPM to DOJ. Section 8(a) of the bill would amend Section       8(a)(2)(b) of the VRA to allow the Attorney General to       certify the need for observers in instances where doing so is       considered necessary to enforce statutory provisions of the       VRA and other federal law protecting citizens' voting rights,       rather than solely to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth       Amendments. Section 8(b) would amend Section 8(a) of the VRA       to permit the Attorney General to assign election observers       in response to written meritorious complaints by residents,       elected officials, or civic participation organizations that       bilingual election requirements are likely to occur and if in       the Attorney General's judgment, it is necessary to enforce       those requirements. Finally, Section 8(c) of the bill would       amend Section 3(a) of the Voting Rights Act to transfer the       authority to assign and terminate election observers from OPM       to DOJ.        Section 9. Clarification of Authority to Seek Relief.       Section 9 amends several provisions of the VRA to add an       explicit private right of action. Section 9(a) of the bill       amends Section 10(b) of the VRA. Section 10(b) currently       provides that the Attorney General may institute a civil       action to enforce Section 10's prohibition on the enforced       payment of poll taxes as a device to impair voting rights.       Section 9(a) amends this provision to provide that, in       addition to the Attorney General, there is a private right of       action for anyone who has been injured by a violation of       Section 10.        Section 9(b) of the bill amends Section 12(d) of the VRA.       Section 9(b) of the bill adds a new section 12(d)(1) that       provides, in addition to the Attorney General, for an       aggrieved person to file an action for preventive relief,       ``[w]henever there are reasonable grounds to believe that any       person has implemented or will implement any voting       qualification or perquisite to voting or standard, practice,       or procedure that would deny any citizen the right to vote''       in violation of the 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, or 26th       Amendments, the VRA (except for Section 4A), or another       federal law that prohibits discrimination in the voting       process on the basis of race or membership in a minority.        Section 9(c) of the bill amends Section 204 of the VRA to       provide an explicit private right of action whenever       ``[t]here are reasonable grounds to believe that a State or       political subdivision has engaged in or is about to engage in       any act or practice'' prohibited by the VRA's provisions       prohibiting the denial of the right to vote because of       failure to comply with any test or device, durational       residency requirements, or language-minority status.        Section 9(d) of the bill amends Section 301(a)(1) of the       VRA to provide an explicit private right of action to enforce       the 26th Amendment, which prohibits states and the federal       government from denying the right to vote to anyone aged 18       and older.        Section 10. Preventive Relief. Section 10 of the bill       amends Section 12(d) of the VRA to provide a new standard for       preliminary relief in any action for preventive relief       described in this subsection.        Specifically, Section 10 adds new section 12(d)(2)(A) would       require that a court grant relief if it determines that the       complainant has raised a serious question as to whether the       challenged voting practice violations the VRA or the       Constitution and, on balance, the hardship imposed on the       defendant by the grant of the relief will be less than the       hardship which would be imposed on the plaintiff if the       relief where not granted.        Section 10 also adds new Section 12(d)(2)(B) would require       the court to examine a number of factors in making the       determination under new section 12(d)(2)(A), including (1)       whether the voting act or practice in effect prior to the       change was adopted as a remedy for a federal court judgment,       consent decree, or admission regarding race discrimination in       violation of the 14th or 15th Amendment, a violation of the       19th, 24th, or 26th Amendments, a violation of the VRA, or       voting discrimination on the basis of race, color, or       language-minority status in violation of any other federal or       state law; (2) whether the voting act or practice in effect       prior to the change served as a ground for dismissal or       settlement of such a claim; (3) whether the change was       adopted fewer than 180 days before the date of the election       with respect to which the change is to take effect; and (4)       whether the defendant failed to provide timely or adequate       notice of the adoption of the change as required by federal       or state law.        Finally, section 10 would also amend section 12(d) by       adding new section 12(d)(3) which deems that a jurisdiction's       inability to enforce its voting or elections laws,       regulations, policies, or restricting plans, standing alone,       shall not constitute irreparable harm to the public interest       or to the interest of a defendant in an action arising under       the Constitution or any federal law that prohibits       discrimination in the voting process on the basis of race or       membership in a language minority group, for the purposes of       determining whether a stay of court or an interlocutory       appeal is warranted.        Section 11. Relief for Violation of Voting Rights Laws.       Section 11 provides a fix for federal courts' misapplication       of the Purcell doctrine.        Under that doctrine, federal courts are cautioned not to       issue decisions that would change election rules ``too       close'' to an election. In practice, federal courts have       applied that doctrine to consistently deny preliminary       injunctions for voting rights plaintiffs even when they may       have enough evidence to demonstrate a substantial likelihood       of success on the merits.        Section 11(a)(1) of the bill defines a ``prohibited act or       practice'' as one that violates 1) the 14th Amendment by       creating an undue burden on the fundamental right to vote or       by violating the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause; 2)       violates the 15th, 19th, 24th, or 26th Amendment or a number       of specified federal voting statutes; 3) or one that violates       any federal law prohibiting voting discrimination, including       the Americans with Disabilities Act.        Section 11(a)(2) of the bill provides a rule of       construction stating that noting in this section shall be       construed to diminish the authority of any person to bring an       action under any federal law.        Section 11(a)(3) of the bill provides for the attorneys'       fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec.  1988.        Section 11(b) prohibits courts from denying, granting,       staying, or vacating the issue of equitable relief sought       pursuant to an action brought under any law listed in       subsection 11(a) because of proximity of the action to an       election. Under Section 11(b), the exception to this default       rule is when the party opposing relief demonstrates,       through clear and convincing evidence, that issuance of       the relief would be so close in time to the election that       it would cause irreparable harm to the public interest or       impose serious burdens on the party opposing relief.        Section 11(b)(1) requires a court to give substantial       weight to the public interest in expanding access to the       ballot when reviewing whether to issue, stay, or vacate the       grant of equitable relief and provides that state's       generalized interest in enforcing its enacted laws is not a       relevant consideration in determining whether relief is       warranted.        Section 11(b)(2) also creates the presumption that the       grant of equitable relief close to an election would not harm       the public interest or burden an opposing party if such       relief is sought within 30 days of the adoption or reasonable       public notice of the challenged voting policy or practice, or       more than 45 days before an election.        Section 11(c)(1) requires a court, when reviewing an       application for a stay or vacatur of equitable relief sought       pursuant to a law listed in subsection 11(a), to give       substantial weight to the reliance interests of citizens who       acted pursuant to the order for equitable relief under       review. It would also prohibit a court from issuing a stay or       vacatur order that has the effect of denying or abridging the       right to vote of any citizen who acted in reliance on the       underlying order being stayed or vacated.        Section 11(c)(2) prohibits a court from issuing a stay or       vacatur unless it finds that the public intertest will be       harmed by the continuing operation of the equitable relief       that has been granted or that compliance with such relief       will impose serious burdens on the party seeking a stay or       vacatur such that the burdens substantially outweigh the       benefits to the public interest. In issuing a stay or vacatur       of equitable relief, a court can set aside any factual       findings in support of such relief only for clear error.        Section 12. Enforcement of Voting Rights By Attorney       General. Section 12 of the bill amends Section 12 of the VRA       by adding at the end a new subsection (g). New Subsection       12(g)(1) provides that whenever the Attorney General or a       designee has reason to believe that any person may be in       possession, custody, or control of any documents relevant to       an investigation under the VRA or other federal voting rights       statute, he or she may, prior to commencing an action, issue       in writing and serve on such person an order requiring the       production of such information.        New subsection 12(g)(2) set forth the contents of any order       issued by the Attorney General under new subsection 12(g)(1).        New subsection 12(g)(3) sets forth the contents of any       response to an order issued by the Attorney General under new       subsection 12(g)(1).        New subsection 12(g)(4) sets forth judicial proceedings       related to an order issued by the Attorney General under new       subsection 12(g)(1).        Section 13. Definitions. Section 13 of the bill amends       Title I of the VRA by clarifying several definitions related       to the Native American voting population. The defined terms       include ``Indian,'' ``Indian Lands,'' ``Indian Tribe,''       ``Tribal Government,'' and  [[Page H4422]]       ``Voting-Age Population,'' which are referred to in amended       Section 4 of the VRA.        Section 14. Attorneys' Fees. Section 14 of the bill adds at       the end of Section 14(c) of the VRA, which provides       definitions for the Act's attorneys' fee provision, a       definition for ``prevailing party'' to mean ``a party to an       action that receives at least some of the benefit sought by       such action, states a colorable claim, and can establish that       the action was a significant cause of a change to the status       quo.''        Section 15. Other Technical and Confirming Amendments.       Section 15 of the bill makes technical and conforming       amendments to Sections 3(c), 4(f), and 5 of the VRA.        Section 16. Severability. Section 16 adds a severability to       clause to the bill, providing that if any part of the VRAA or       any amendments made by the Act, or any application of any       part of the Act or amendments made by the Act, is held to be       unconstitutional or is otherwise enjoined or unenforceable,       the rest of the VRAA, and the remainder of the Act and any       amendments made by this Act, and the application of the       provisions and amendment to any person or circumstance, and       any remaining provisions of the VRA, shall not be affected by       the holding.        Section 17. Grants to Assist with Notice Requirements Under       the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Section 17(a) requires the       Attorney General to make grants each fiscal year to small       jurisdictions who submit applications for financial       assistance to comply with the VRA's notice requirements.        Section 17(b) requires a small jurisdiction seeking such a       grant to file an application to the Attorney General       containing such information as the Attorney General requires.        Section 17(c) defines a small jurisdiction to mean any       political subdivisions with a population of 10,000 or less.                                   ____   Memorandum Regarding the Inclusion of Certain Provisions in H.R. 4, the    ``John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021''--August 24,                                    2021                               I. INTRODUCTION         The following is an analysis of key provisions included in       H.R. 4, the ``John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of       2021.'' This legislation will strengthen and revitalize the       Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) in the wake of the Supreme       Court's decisions in Shelby County v. Holder and Brnovich v.       Democratic National Committee in light of the record       developed before the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee       on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties       (Constitution Subcommittee) over the course of six hearings       this year and seven hearings in the 116th Congress as well as       the Committee on House Administration's Elections       Subcommittee.        H.R. 4 includes provisions addressing the following: (1) a       geographic coverage formula to determine which jurisdictions       should be subject to the VRA's preclearance requirement that       is broad enough to accurately capture the full extent of       contemporary voting discrimination while accounting for the       federalism and state sovereignty concerns expressed by the       Court in Shelby County; (2) a practice-based coverage formula       to complement the geographic coverage formula in order to       cover jurisdictions where, because of demographic changes,       the risk of voting discrimination is heightened even in the       absence of a history of voting discrimination and to cover       practices that are historically associated with voting       discrimination; (3) a statutory standard for vote denial       claims under Section 2 of the VRA in light of the Supreme       Court's recent decision in Brnovich; (4) the inclusion of a       non-retrogression standard in Section 2; (5) the creation of       an explicit private right of action under the VRA; (6) the       expansion of the causes of action available under the VRA to       include violations of a broader spectrum of voting       discrimination-related constitutional and statutory       provisions; (7) a revision of the preliminary injunction       standard applicable to actions under the VRA to make it       easier for plaintiffs to obtain such relief; (8) a fix for       federal courts' misapplication of the Purcell doctrine, which       counsels courts against granting preliminary injunctions or       making other changes to election rules too close to an       election; (9) greater notice and transparency requirements;       (10) expanded bases for the assignment of federal election       observers; and (11) expanded bail-in preclearance       jurisdiction for federal courts. Congress's constitutional       authority to adopt these provisions remains broad even when       accounting for the terms of the Supreme Court's decisions in       Shelby County and Brnovich.         II. THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT: A BRIEF SUMMARY OF KEY PROVISIONS         Below is a brief summary of the VRA's key provisions to       provide context for understanding the legislation's       provisions described later in this memorandum.        Section 2(a) of the VRA applies nationwide and prohibits       any state or political subdivision from enacting any ``voting       qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,       practice, or procedure . . . in a manner which results in a       denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the       United States to vote on account of race or color,'' or on       account of ``member[ship] [in] a language minority group.''       Section 2 thus prohibits measures that are discriminatory in       purpose or in effect. Prohibited measures can include       practices that affect the ability to cast a vote (such as       through photo ID laws or by closing polling places) as well       as redistricting that dilutes the voting power of minority       citizens.        Section 2(b) of the VRA clarifies how to determine when       there is a violation of Section 2(a) by providing that: ``A       violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the       totality of the circumstances, it is shown that the political       processes leading to nomination or election in the State or       political subdivision are not equally open to participation       by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a)       in that its members have less opportunity than other members       of the electorate to participate in the political process and       to elect representatives of their choice.''        Section 3(a) of the VRA provides that a federal court may       authorize the appointment of federal election observers by       the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to       enforce the voting guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth       Amendments in the context of an enforcement proceeding.        Section 3(c) of the VRA, known as the ``bail-in''       provision, allows courts to retain jurisdiction to supervise       further voting changes in jurisdictions where the court has       found violations of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments.       If a jurisdiction is ``bailed in,'' it must submit any       changes to its voting rules and procedures for approval       either to the court or to DOJ.        Section 203 was added to the VRA by Congress in 1975 and       contains a number of protections for members of ``language       minorities'' (i.e., non-English speakers). It supplements       Section 2 to prohibit voting discrimination against language       minorities, including by requiring provision of language       assistance to voters. It also added to the preclearance       coverage formula to include jurisdictions that provided       English-only voting materials where 5% or more of voting-age       citizens were from a single language minority.        Section 4(b) of the VRA, known the ``coverage formula,''       determined which states or political subdivisions are       required to submit changes to any voting laws for       preclearance under Section 5 prior to their implementation.       If a state is subject to preclearance, all of its political       subdivisions are as well. As described in detail below, in       2013 the Supreme Court invalidated the coverage formula as       unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder.        Section 5 of the VRA, known the ``preclearance provision,''       requires prior approval or preclearance of a proposed change       to any voting law in any states or political subdivisions       covered under Section 4(b). The Supreme Court's decision in       Shelby County effectively rendered Section 5 inoperative. A       covered jurisdiction can comply with Section 5 by preclearing       a proposed voting law change via two methods: administrative       or judicial review.        Under administrative review, a covered jurisdiction can       submit a proposed voting change to DOJ. If DOJ affirmatively       indicates no objection to the proposed change, or if after 60       days DOJ has interposed no objection, the covered       jurisdiction can implement the change.        Under judicial review, a covered jurisdiction can file suit       against the United States or the Attorney General in the U.S.       District Court for the District of Columbia for declaratory       judgment, whereby a three-judge panel must be convened to       hear the case (and with direct appeals to the Supreme Court).       Unlike in a Section 2 case, in an action brought under       Section 5, the burden is on the covered jurisdiction to       establish that it does not violate the substantive       prohibition in the preclearance provision.        Section 5 prohibits covered jurisdictions from implementing       any changes to voting rules that have the purpose or effect       of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race,       color, or membership in a language minority group. This       standard is referred to as the ``retrogression standard.''       The Supreme Court has interpreted this substantive       prohibition to mean that a proposed voting rule change cannot       place minority citizens in a worse position to participate in       the electoral process or elect a candidate of their choice       than under the status quo. In this way, the standard for       establishing whether a proposed change must be precleared       differs from the standard for establishing a violation under       Section 2 of the Act, even though the wording appears       similar. Under the retrogression standard, a proposed voting       change is entitled to preclearance, even if the current       electoral system is potentially discriminatory under Section       2, so long as the change does not further increase the degree       of discrimination against minority voters.        Sections 4(b) and 5 were originally set to expire after 5       years, but Congress reauthorized them several times since the       VRA's original enactment in 1965. Congress last reauthorized       the VRA in 2006, when it extended these provisions for an       additional 25 years.        Section 8 of the VRA allows DOJ to certify the need for       federal election observers in covered jurisdictions where the       Attorney General has received ``meritorious complaints'' from       residents, local officials, or organizations that violations       of the VRA are likely to occur, or where the Attorney General       determines that assignment of observers is ``otherwise       necessary'' to enforce the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment.       These observers must be authorized to enter polling places to       observe whether people who are entitled to vote are being       permitted to do so, and to observe the processes in which       votes are tabulated.  [[Page H4423]]         Section 12(d) of the VRA provides the Attorney General with       the authority to institute a legal action for preventive       relief, including temporary or permanent injunctions,       restraining orders, or other relief, whenever any person has       engaged in, or there are reasonable grounds to believe that       any person is about to engage in, any violation of the VRA.       This provision has also been interpreted to provide an       implied right of action for private plaintiffs.   III. CONGRESS'S CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO DEVISE PROTECTIONS AGAINST                      RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN VOTING         Congress has broad constitutional authority to protect       voting rights. Specifically, this authority is derived from       its powers to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth and       Fifteenth Amendments. Additionally, Congress has the       authority to ultimately determine the time, place, or manner       of congressional elections under the Elections Clause.        The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution       confer authority on the Congress to pass laws that regulate       federal, state, and local elections to protect voting rights.       Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that ``[a]ll       persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject       to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United       States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall .       . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal       protection of the laws.'' Section 2 requires members of       Congress to be apportioned among the states ``according to       their respective numbers, counting the whole number of       persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.'' Section       5 vests Congress with the ``power to enforce, by appropriate       legislation, the provisions of this article.''        The Fifteenth Amendment prohibits racial discrimination in       the right to vote. Section 1 of the Amendment provides that       ``[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall       not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any       state on account of race, color, or previous condition of       servitude.'' Like the Fourteenth Amendment, Section 2 of the       Fifteenth Amendment provides Congress with the ``power to       enforce this article by appropriate legislation.''        The Elections Clause also provides Congress additional       authority to adopt voting rights protections. Article I,       Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitution provides that ``[t]he       Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators       and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the       Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law       make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of       chusing Senators.'' While the Elections Clause grants the       States the authority to regulate the time, place, and manner       for holding elections for Representatives and Senators, it       vests Congress with the ultimate authority to determine the       election ``Regulations'' for those offices, with only one       explicit textual exception. As the Supreme Court, in an       opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, noted, the ``Clause's       substantive scope is broad. `Time, Places, and Manner,' we       have written, are `comprehensive words,' which `embrace       authority to provide a complete code for congressional       elections.' ''        The Supreme Court's earlier decisions upholding the       constitutionality of the VRA appear to have understood       Congress's constitutional authority to protect voting rights       in broad terms. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the first       case to uphold the VRA and its preclearance regime, the Court       appeared to apply a ``rationality'' test for measures enacted       to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment, noting that Congress need       only show that it had a legitimate end in adopting that law       and that the means to achieve that ``are plainly adapted to       that end.'' The Supreme Court decided Katzenbach in 1966 and       maintained the same standard of review for the VRA's       preclearance provisions, despite several challenges, and, at       least as to the scope of Congress's Fifteenth Amendment       authority, Katzenbach remains in effect.        One caveat as to the scope of congressional authority over       voting rights legislation has arisen due to Supreme Court       interpretations of Congress's authority under the Fourteenth       Amendment. In a series of cases starting in the late 1990's       that were unrelated to voting rights, the Court began to       place limits on Congress's ability to adopt legislation       enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantees. In City of       Boerne v. Flores, the Court struck down as unconstitutional       as applied to states the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a       statute that Congress passed to enhance protections for       religious minorities and other minority groups. It did so       based on an interpretation of Section 5 of the Fourteenth       Amendment that viewed Congress's authority to enact       legislation as primarily remedial in nature. Given this       remedial nature, the Court concluded that congressional       action in this area had to be congruent and proportional to       the injury being addressed. The ``congruence and       proportionality'' test adopted by the Court has raised some       question as to the scope of Congress's authority to adapt       voting rights legislation--particularly with respect to       language minorities--given the similarities in wording       between Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 2       of the Fifteenth Amendment.        Nonetheless, existing precedent continues to establish       Congress's broad authority to adopt legislation to protect       voters against racial discrimination. As noted, the Court has       not overturned Katzenbach or related cases upholding the       VRA's preclearance scheme and the substantial deference that       the Court gave to Congress's exercise of its authority to       pass legislation enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment. Thus,       Congress can continue to adopt legislation that is rationally       related to its authority to protect against voter       discrimination.        The Elections Clause also remains an oft-overlooked source       of congressional authority to prescribe voting rights       protections--though its reach is limited to federal       elections. Professor Franita Tolson previously testified       twice on the subject of Congress's authority to protect       voting rights under the Elections Clause. In her testimony,       Professor Tolson argued that enacting protections pursuant to       the Elections Clause provides several benefits as it ``avoids       many of the traps that have constrained congressional power       under the Reconstruction Amendments.'' She observed that       because it ``depriv[es] states of the final policymaking       authority that is the hallmark of sovereignty, the       [Elections] Clause is impervious to the federalism concerns       that have constrained congressional action under the       Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.'' Moreover, Professor       Tolson noted that the Elections Clause is further       distinguished from the Reconstruction Amendments because it       ``does not require any evidence of discriminatory intent in       order for Congress to intervene, providing further       justification for a legislative record that shows that states       acted with discriminatory effect or in ways that otherwise       abridge or deny the right to vote.''        Finally, Article IV's Guarantee Clause may provide Congress       additional authority to protect minority voting rights as a       means of ensuring the guarantee that every state has a       republican form of government. That Clause requires that the       ``United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union       a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of       them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature,       or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened)       against domestic Violence.''                      IV. KEY ISSUES ADDRESSED BY H.R. 4       A. New Geographic Coverage Formula to Revitalize Section 5           Preclearance Post-Shelby County        On June 25, 2013, in Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme       Court struck down as unconstitutional the coverage formula in       Section 4(b) of the VRA, effectively neutering the Act's       Section 5 preclearance provision. Citing its decision in an       earlier case called Northwest Austin Municipal Utility       District One v. Holder, the Supreme Court held that Congress       must justify the unequal burdens placed on state sovereignty       by the VRA's preclearance regime based on ``current needs''       and that it had to demonstrate that the coverage formula was       ``sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.'' The       Court emphasized the principle of ``equal sovereignty'' of       the states, highlighting that ``a departure from the       fundamental principle of equal sovereignty requires a showing       that a statute's disparate geographic coverage is       sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.'' In       other words, the Court believed that Congress was required to       further justify the coverage formula because it applied the       burden of the VRA's preclearance requirement to some states       but not others.        The Court struck down the VRA's coverage formula based on       its conclusion that Congress had failed to demonstrate that       the coverage formula--first enacted in 1965--was sufficiently       connected to the present condition of voting rights in the       covered states, and because Congress could not justify the       disparate burdens placed by VRA's preclearance provision on       the sovereignty of some states and not others.        Significantly, the Court invited Congress to ``draft       another formula based on current conditions.'' The Court went       on to note that, ``[o]ur country has changed, and while any       racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must       ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem       speaks to current conditions.''        To that end, H.R. 4 includes a geographic coverage formula       that would cover jurisdictions as follows. A state and all       political subdivisions in that state would be covered for 10       years if, looking back 25 years, there were 15 or more       violations in that state, or if there were 10 or more       violations in that state if at least one of those violations       was committed by the state itself (as opposed to a political       subdivision). A state is also covered if there are 3 or more       violations in that state when the state itself controls       elections in the state or its political subdivisions.       Separately, a political subdivision could be covered for 10       years if it committed 3 or more violations in the preceding       25 years. Drawing from Shelby County, any coverage formula       must reflect current needs, though the Court left unanswered       the question of how ``current'' is sufficiently ``current.''       The formula in H.R. 4 reasonably meets this test because it       is a dynamic and self-updating formula, and preclearance       coverage would only last for 10 years for any given       jurisdiction, thereby always reflecting contemporary       conditions. Moreover, the 25-year lookback period reflects       two redistricting cycles and six presidential elections,       enough to ensure that the coverage formula only captures       jurisdictions that have engaged in a pattern of voting       discrimination, rather than those that may have committed a       ``one-off'' violation.      B. Practice-Based Coverage        ``Known practices coverage,'' also known as practice-based       preclearance, is a form of  [[Page H4424]]       preclearance coverage formula that applies to certain voting       law changes that have historically been associated with       racial discrimination. This is distinct from geographic-based       preclearance, under which coverage is determined based on a       jurisdiction's history of voting rights violations. One       potential drawback of a geographic-based coverage formula is       that it does not cover jurisdictions with significant       emerging minority populations, where the risk of voter       suppression efforts against such populations is heightened       but there is no documented history of voting rights       violations.        This has proven to be problematic as jurisdictions that do       not have a documented history of voting rights violations       have nonetheless responded to surges in the minority       population by turning to practices historically utilized to       discriminate against or disenfranchise minority voters.       Practice-based preclearance addresses this gap in coverage by       subjecting certain specific practices with a proven       historical association with discrimination to preclearance.       Moreover, such a practice-based coverage formula could be       limited in some instances to those jurisdictions that, based       on demographic changes, are most likely to engage in voter       suppression efforts. Unlike the VRA's currently defunct       preclearance coverage formula, practice-based preclearance       would apply to states and localities nationwide and not just       to certain states and political subdivisions.        As such, H.R. 4 includes a practice-based preclearance       regime to supplement geographic-based preclearance.       Specifically, H.R. 4 includes a practice-based preclearance       provision that covered jurisdictions engaged in one of       several categories of practices, including changes to voter       ID requirements to be more stringent and changes to       multilingual voting materials when no such similar change       occurs in materials provided in English. Other categories of       voting procedures and practices are subject to preclearance       only in political subdivisions where certain demographic       thresholds are met. For instance, changing from single member       districts to at-large elections, redistricting, and the       consolidation or relocation of polling places could be       covered practices subject to preclearance in jurisdictions       where two or more racial groups or language minority groups       make up 20 percent or more of a political subdivision's       voting-age population.      C. Clarifying Section 2 In Response to Brnovich v. Democratic           National Committee        Prior to 2013, Section 2 had largely been used to challenge       state and local efforts that resulted in the dilution of the       effectiveness of minority citizens' votes, rather than in the       outright denial of the ability to vote. These ``vote       dilution'' cases mostly concern challenges to the drawing of       legislative districts or at-large voting systems. In       Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court outlined a non-      exhaustive list of factors that a court should consider in       determining whether, under the totality of the circumstances,       a challenged voting rule violated Section 2's ``results       test'' as established under subsection 2(b). In evaluating       these ``vote dilution'' claims, courts were required to apply       the Gingles factors, which were geared toward consideration       of such ``vote dilution'' claims.        Since 2013, in the effective absence of preclearance in the       wake of Shelby County, voting rights plaintiffs have been       forced to rely on Section 2 litigation to challenge       discriminatory voting rules after they had been implemented.       These kinds of claims were ``vote denial'' claims--i.e.,       those claims alleging that the discriminatory effect of a       voting rule or practice was such that it effectively denied       minority citizens the equal opportunity to vote compared to       non-minority citizens. Until the Brnovich decision, the       Supreme Court had never addressed how a court should assess       ``vote denial'' claims under Section 2's results test, partly       because there were relatively few such cases while       preclearance was in effect.        In the absence of Supreme Court guidance, a number of       federal appeals courts had attempted to articulate how the       results test would apply to vote denial claims under Section       2. For example, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Circuits       articulated a two-part test: (1) the challenged voting rule       must impose a discriminatory burden on members of the       protected class, meaning that they have less opportunity than       other members of the electorate to participate in the       political process and to elect representatives of their       choice; and (2) the burden must in part be caused by or       linked to social and historical conditions that have or       currently produce discrimination against members of the       protected class.        On July 1, 2021, the Supreme Court decided the consolidated       case of Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee and Arizona       Republican Party v. Democratic National Committee. In a       divided 6-3 opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito and       joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence       Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett,       the Court upheld two Arizona measures challenged under       Section 2 of the VRA. One challenged measure required that       voters cast their ballots in their assigned precinct, and any       ballots cast out of precinct had to be discarded. The other       measure at issue was a criminal statute making it a felony       for a third party to collect early ballots from voters       (described by some as ``ballot harvesting''). Plaintiffs had       alleged that these voting rules violated Section 2's results       test and that the third-party ballot collection statute also       was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.        At issue in the case was not just the legality of the two       challenged Arizona measures, but the impact that the Court's       decision may have on future Section 2 vote denial claims       alleging that a facially neutral voting practice governing       the time, place, or manner of an election denied the right of       minority citizens to vote. The full impact of the Court's       decision on these types of Section 2 vote denial claims       remains to be seen, but it appears from initial analyses that       the Brnovich decision will significantly curtail plaintiffs'       ability to bring or prove such claims, which could be       especially problematic in the effective absence of       preclearance.        Although the majority in Brnovich expressly disclaimed the       notion that it was creating a new and narrow results test for       assessing Section 2 vote denial claims, it set forth what it       characterized as ``guideposts'' for considering such claims,       all of which, individually and taken together, significantly       narrowed the scope of Section 2 for vote denial claims and       will make it harder for future Section 2 vote denial claims       to prevail using the existing results test. In the majority's       view, the interpretive touchstone for Section 2's statutory       language is the term ``equally open'' as used in Section 2       and that in evaluating whether a plaintiff has established a       violation under Section 2 (i.e., that the challenged practice       ``results in'' discrimination), a court must examine the       jurisdiction's entire election system from a holistic       perspective to determine whether voting is ``equally open''       to minorities.        In her dissent, Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices       Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, sharply criticized the       majority opinion, writing that ``Section 2 of the [VRA]       remains, as written, as expansive as ever'' and accusing the       Court of crafting ``its own set of rules, limiting Section 2       from multiple directions'' and giving ``a cramped reading to       broad language.'' Justice Kagan further found it ``tragic . .       . that the Court has (yet again) rewritten--in order to       weaken--a statute that stands as a monument to America's       greatness, and protects against its basest impulses.''        In Justice Kagan's reading, Section 2: (1) applies to any       voting rule; (2) prohibits both denial and abridgement of a       citizen's voting rights based on race; (3) requires a court       to focus its inquiry on the effects of a challenged voting       rule and whether that rule results in racial discrimination,       not on the reasons why public officials enacted that rule;       (4) concerns itself with discrimination that results in       inequality of the opportunity to vote, which can arise from       facially neutral rules and not just targeted ones; (5) is       violated when an election rule, operating against the       backdrop of historical, social, and economic conditions,       makes it harder for minority citizens to vote than for       others; and (6) requires the state or locality imposing the       challenged rule to show that any strong governmental interest       justifying the challenged rule is the least discriminatory       rule necessary to satisfy the state interest. In short,       Justice Kagan wrote, Section 2 directs courts ``to eliminate       facially neutral (as well as targeted) electoral rules that       unnecessarily create inequalities of access to the political       process.''        Although Brnovich is a deeply troubling decision, one       silver lining to the decision is that it left Congress with       the authority to respond with a legislative fix for the       damage that the Court has inflicted on Section 2. Because the       Court's decision is based on its interpretation of a statute       drafted by Congress, rather than on constitutional principles       restricting Congress's authority to legislate, Congress can       amend Section 2 to reverse the Court's decision in Brnovich.        There were at least three potential approaches to       ``fixing'' the issues created by the Brnovich decision that       were considered. All three would essentially create a       separate standard for courts to apply when evaluating vote       denial (the situation in Brnovich) and vote dilution claims       under Section 2.        Under the approach ultimately included in H.R. 4, Congress       clarifies that as to vote dilution claims, courts must       continue to apply the framework of the Gingles decision to       such claims. The legislation then creates a separate test for       courts to apply to vote denial claims that would require a       plaintiff to prove a violation of Section 2(a) by       establishing that the challenged voting practice imposes a       discriminatory burden on members of a class of citizens       protected by Section 2(a). Under this standard, the bill       codifies a separate set of detailed factors that courts must       consider when evaluating whether, under the totality of the       circumstances, the challenged voting practice ``results in''       a discriminatory burden--while also precluding courts from       considering the ``guideposts'' described by the court in       Brnovich.        Other possible approaches that were considered but not       ultimately included would have involved creating a burden-      shifting test for vote denial claims under Section 2. Like       the previous approach, this approach would have largely       preserved Section 2(b) as applied to vote dilution claims,       which were not at issue in Brnovich. Under one potential       burden-shifting approach for vote denial claims, a plaintiff       could establish a prima facie case by demonstrating that a       challenged voting rule or practice interacts with historical       and socioeconomic factors to ``result in'' a disparate burden       on the opportunities enjoyed by members of a class of       citizens  [[Page H4425]]       protected by Section 2(a) to participate in the political       process relative to other members of the electorate. The       burden then shifts to the defendant jurisdiction to       demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the       challenged rule is specifically tailored to materially       advance an important and particularized government interest.       If the state or political subdivision meets its burden, the       burden would then shift to the plaintiff to show by a       preponderance of the evidence that the state or political       subdivision could have implemented a procedure that furthered       the government's interest through a less burdensome means.        Similarly, a third potential approach that was considered       but not ultimately included was suggested by Professor Nick       Stephanopoulos, who appeared before the Constitution       Subcommittee at its hearing held on July 16, 2021. His       proposal would import the disparate impact standard used in       other areas of civil rights law for vote denial claims. Under       his proposed standard for vote denial claims, a plaintiff       would have to show that an electoral practice causes a       statistically significant racial disparity. If the plaintiff       meets that burden, then the burden would shift to the       jurisdiction that imposed the challenged practice to       demonstrate that the practice is necessary to achieve a       strong state interest. The burden would then shift back to       the plaintiff to demonstrate that the interest could be       achieved through less discriminatory means, suggesting that       the state's asserted interest was pretextual.      D. Section 2 Retrogression Standard        As noted earlier, the substantive standard applied when       assessing a proposed voting change under the Section 5       preclearance regime is the retrogression standard--i.e.,       whether the proposed voting change makes minority citizens       worse off than the status quo in terms of their ability to       vote. If the proposed change is retrogressive, then it cannot       be precleared.        H.R. 4 imports this substantive standard into Section 2 to       apply to cases where an already-enacted voting law or rule       has a retrogressive effect. In such cases, a Section 2       retrogression standard would help to prevent the harm of       retrogression in the absence of preclearance in non-covered       jurisdictions. This measure also provides an additional basis       for finding a Section 2 violation.      E. Enhancing Section 3(c) Bail-in Jurisdiction        Section 3(c) of the VRA, known as the ``bail-in''       provision, allows courts to retain jurisdiction to supervise       further voting changes in jurisdictions where the court has       found violations of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments.       If a jurisdiction is ``bailed in,'' it must submit any       changes to its voting procedures for approval either to the       court or to the DOJ. In practice, however, plaintiffs face a       high, perhaps insurmountable, burden in proving violations as       federal courts have determined that Section 3(c) requires a       finding of intentional discrimination. Thus, a jurisdiction       may have a history of VRA violations due to implementing       voting laws with a discriminatory effect, but because there       may not have been a constitutional violation, which requires       a showing of discriminatory intent, courts cannot invoke       Section 3(c) to subject a jurisdiction to preclearance as a       remedy. Additionally, even when there is substantial evidence       that government officials were motivated by discriminatory       intent, courts have proven reluctant to find that such       officials engaged in purposeful discrimination. Moreover,       since the Shelby County decision, some courts have suggested       that not all violations of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth       Amendments support Section 3(c) bail-in coverage. For these       reasons, courts have rarely invoked their authority under       Section 3(c) to impose bail-in preclearance on a       jurisdiction.        As a result, H.R. 4 enhances the ``bail-in''' provision in       Section 3(c) of the VRA by permitting courts to impose a       preclearance requirement on a case-by-case basis on       jurisdictions where there have been violations of the VRA and       other federal statutory prohibitions against discrimination       in voting--in addition to instances where there have been       violations of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment. This       gives federal courts more flexibility and opportunity to       impose bail-in preclearance on a jurisdiction while avoiding       the federalism concerns that the Supreme Court articulated in       Shelby County, given the remedial and case-by-case nature of       bail-in coverage.      F. Promoting Transparency to Enforce the Voting Rights Act        Beyond effectively gutting the VRA's preclearance       mechanism, the Shelby County decision also undermined the       ability of DOJ and the general public to have notice of any       changes to voting laws, policies, or procedures. In addition       to being an effective enforcement mechanism, preclearance had       functioned as an effective notice regime. To address this       lack of transparency post-Shelby County, the legislation       imposes a notice and disclosure requirement on states and       political subdivisions for three voting-related matters,       including: (1) late breaking voting changes involving federal       elections (e.g., changes in voting standards or procedures       enacted 180 days before a federal election); (2) polling       resources involving federal elections (e.g., information       concerning precincts/polling places, number of voting age and       registered voters, voting machines, and poll workers); and       (3) redistricting, reapportionment, and other changes in       voting districts involving federal, state, and local       elections. The legislation also ensures that public notice       for each of these matters must be in a format that is       accessible to voters with disabilities such as those who have       low vision or who are blind. This type of reporting       requirement imposes a low burden on states and plainly bears       a logical relation to facilitating Congress's ability to       ensure proper enforcement of the law.      G. Expanding the Authority to Assign Federal Elections           Observers        Under Section 8, the Attorney General can certify the need       for OPM to assign federal observers to jurisdictions covered       by Section 5 of the VRA when the Attorney General ``received       written meritorious complaints . . . that efforts to deny or       abridge the right to vote . . . on account of race or color .       . . are likely to occur'' or when the Attorney General       considered the assignment of observers ``necessary to enforce       the guarantees of the 14th or 15th amendment.'' These       observers are authorized to ``(1) enter and attend at any       place for holding an election in such subdivision for the       purpose of observing whether persons who are entitled to vote       are being permitted to vote; and (2) enter and attend at any       place for tabulating the votes cast at any election held in       such subdivision for the purpose of observing whether votes       cast by persons entitled to vote are being properly       tabulated.'' They are also authorized to conduct       investigations and report to the Attorney General.       Additionally, under Section 3(a) of the VRA, federal courts       are also currently empowered to authorize the appointment of       federal observers by OPM to enforce the voting guarantees of       the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.        As Jon Greenbaum, Chief Counsel for the Lawyers' Committee       for Civil Rights Under Law, noted in his testimony before the       Constitution Subcommittee at a hearing in May 2021, an oft       overlooked side effect of the Shelby County decision is the       reduced number of federal observer appointments under Section       8 of the VRA. DOJ has interpreted the Shelby County decision       as barring the use of the coverage formula to send observers       under Section 8 of the VRA. In place of full-fledged       observers, DOJ has relied on ``monitors'' to ensure that       jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting       practices hold elections in a fair manner that does not       disenfranchise minority voters. Unfortunately, these monitors       do not possess the same authority as an observer, and as such       jurisdictions are not required to provide them the same       access to the voting process as observers. Moreover, when       operating as intended, the authority of the Attorney General       and federal courts to appoint observers under the VRA is       generally limited to circumstances where such observers are       necessary to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.        In order to address this problem, H.R. 4 expands the       circumstances under which both federal courts and the       Attorney General could certify the need for federal election       observers under Sections 3(a) and 8 of the VRA, respectively.       Section 3(a) is amended to permit federal courts to have       observers assigned where there are violations of the VRA or       any other federal law prohibiting discrimination in voting on       the basis of race, color, or language minority status,       supplementing its authority to do so to enforce the voting       guarantees of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.       Similarly, the Attorney General's authority to certify the       need for observers is expanded to include instances when they       are considered necessary to enforce statutory provisions       prohibiting race, color, or language-minority discrimination       in voting and for the purpose of enforcing bilingual election       requirements.        The legislation also amends the VRA so that the Attorney       General, rather than OPM, is authorized to control the       appointment and termination of federal election observers.       This is intended to ease administrative burdens on OPM and       improve the appointment process, given that DOJ possesses the       voting rights expertise necessary to evaluate candidates'       suitability to act as observers      H. Strengthening the Effectiveness of VRA Enforcement Actions        As noted by many Majority witnesses at most of the hearings       before the Constitution Subcommittee regarding the VRA,       Section 2 litigation has many drawbacks, including the time,       expense, and drain on resources that such litigation entails.       Most significantly, these witnesses noted that the biggest       drawback to Section 2 litigation is that it is difficult, if       not impossible, to stop the harm to voters that a       discriminatory voting law, policy, or practice can inflict       before such a measure is implemented. Being able to stop harm       to voters before a discriminatory voting measure took effect       was one of the primary benefits of preclearance.        Part of the problem for those seeking to vindicate their       rights under the VRA using Section 2 litigation is that       because courts are reluctant to grant a preliminary       injunction and voting rights litigation is often lengthy,       several elections for federal, state, and local offices could       occur under voting laws or procedures that are later found by       the court to be discriminatory. Thus, thousands of minority       voters often remain disenfranchised before a court renders a       decision on the merits of a case brought under Section 2.        For example, one witness testified during the 116th       Congress that ``Section 2 cases take a substantial amount of       time to litigate, leaving discriminatory voting practices in       place for months or years before they are  [[Page H4426]]       ultimately blocked or rescinded,'' with the average time to       fully litigate a case to resolution being more than a year       and a half. Furthermore, he testified that because elections       take place during the time that Section 2 litigation is       pending, ``government officials are often elected under       election regimes that are later found to be discriminatory--      and there is no way to adequately compensate victims of       voting discrimination after-the-fact.'' As an example, he       cited the ACLU's litigation challenging a sprawling North       Carolina voter suppression law, which took 34 months to       litigate from filing the complaint to a ruling by the U.S.       Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, with the 2014       general election taking place in the interim. As he noted,       ``almost 200 federal and state officials in North Carolina       were elected under a discriminatory regime that the Fourth       Circuit found `target[ed] African Americans with almost       surgical precision' '' and that although the law was       ultimately struck down, ``there is no way to now compensate       the African-American voters of North Carolina--or our       democracy itself--for that gross injustice.''        To address these drawbacks inherent to Section 2       litigation, H.R. 4 strengthens the ability of Attorney       General and private parties to bring enforcement actions by       amending the VRA to enhance the standard for preliminary       injunctions; to address federal courts undue reliance on the       Purcell principle when considering whether to grant equitable       relief; to expand the scope of the existing cause of action       available under the VRA; and to grant private parties an       explicit private right of action to obtain equitable relief.        1. Enhancing the Standard for Preliminary Injunctions        The legislation amends the VRA to enhance the standard for       preliminary injunctions by requiring a court considering a       preliminary injunction motion in Section 2 cases to grant       injunctive relief to the plaintiff if the court determines       that the plaintiff has raised a ``serious question''       regarding the lawfulness of the challenged voting rule or       practice, and if the court determines that the balance of       interests and hardships favors the plaintiff.        This standard departs from the traditional standard for       obtaining a preliminary injunction, under which a plaintiff       must show that he or she ``is likely to succeed on the       merits'' and is likely to suffer ``irreparable harm'' absent       an injunction and must demonstrate that the overall balance       of interests tilts in his or her favor. The Supreme Court,       however, has repeatedly held that Congress may alter common-      law standards for seeking equitable relief so long as the       ``alternative comports with constitutional due process,''       particularly in cases presenting issues of public interest.        2. Addressing the Purcell Principle        Compounding the difficulties and relative ineffectiveness       of relying solely on Section 2 litigation are some federal       courts' undue reliance on what is known as the Purcell       principle, named for the Supreme Court decision in which it       was articulated, Purcell v. Gonzalez. Briefly stated, the       Purcell principle holds that courts should not change       election rules in the time period close to an election       because it could cause voter confusion or problems for       election administration officials.        As Professor Justin Levitt noted in his September 2019       testimony, ``[r]esponsive litigation often features       substantial discovery battles and extended motion practice,       all of which often precedes the awarding of even preliminary       relief. Such preliminary relief, according to experienced       litigators, is itself quite rare in affirmative voting rights       litigation, under the existing standard.'' Professor Levitt       further noted that the rarity of preliminary injunctive       relief ``only increases in the period shortly before an       election--when immediate rulings are most necessary to       prevent harm--based in part on the Supreme Court's       admonishment that the judiciary should be particularly wary       of enjoining enacted electoral rules under traditional       equitable standards when there is `inadequate time to resolve       . . . factual disputes' before the election proceeds.''        The legislation addresses this problem by amending the VRA       to require a court evaluating any action for equitable relief       under Section 2 to shift the burden on to the jurisdictions       opposing the requested relief to prove that compliance with       such relief would be too burdensome. Courts are required to       not consider the proximity of the action to an election to be       a valid reason to grant or deny such relief, unless the party       opposing the relief--typically a State or political       subdivision thereof--meets the burden of proving by clear and       convincing evidence that the issuance of the relief would be       so close in time to the election as to cause irreparable harm       to the public interest or that compliance with such relief       would impose serious burdens on the opposing party.        3. Empowering Private Parties by Providing an Explicit             Cause of Action        Currently, the VRA expressly authorizes only the Attorney       General to seek preventive relief, including preliminary       injunctions. Although federal courts have interpreted the VRA       to provide private parties the ability to seek such       preventive relief, some courts have begun to express doubt       about whether such a cause of action exists, including       Justice Gorsuch in a concurring opinion in the Brnovich case.       To address this problem, the legislation explicitly provides       for a private right of action under the VRA, as H.R. 4 from       the 116th Congress did.          V. THE CONTINUING NEED FOR A REVITALIZED VOTING RIGHTS ACT       A. Congressional Consideration of Voter Suppression Efforts           Post-Shelby County        During the 116th Congress, two subcommittees, the Committee       on the Judiciary's Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil       Rights, and Civil Liberties and the Committee on House       Administration's Subcommittee on Elections, conducted a       series of hearings to examine the landscape of voting in       America following the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby       County v. Holder, current barriers to voting, and potential       remedies. During these hearings, Congress heard testimony       from leading civil rights advocates and organizations that       described a process akin to evolution whereby State and local       efforts to discriminate against minority voters have changed       over time in response to federal efforts to provide a remedy.       Accordingly, witness testimony described these barriers to       voting in terms of ``generations'' to best capture the fact       that voter discrimination continues to persist over time       despite changing form.        ``First generation'' barriers: These barriers include poll       taxes, literacy tests, and other devices meant to overtly       disenfranchise racial minorities by preventing them from       registering and voting. States and localities enacted them       following the end of the Reconstruction Era. The VRA was       initially passed to address these barriers.        ``Second generation'' barriers: These barriers include       racially gerrymandering electoral districts, adopting at-      large election districts instead of smaller, single-member       individual electoral districts, and annexing another       political subdivision. States and localities enacted these       barriers to blunt the impact of minority voters on the       outcome of an election by diluting or underrepresenting the       strength of minority voters. The VRA was amended by Congress       to forbid these practices, though they remain a threat to       voting rights today.        ``Third generation'' barriers: These barriers include       adopting procedures to make registering to vote more       difficult for language minorities, placing burdensome       restrictions on third-party voter registration activities,       moving or closing down polling places to increase the       difficulty for minorities to vote, and enacting voter ID       laws. These barriers are designed to make voting more onerous       for minority voters.        Over the course of these hearings, the witnesses presented       extensive evidence supporting the conclusion that voter       discrimination remains a persistent problem. Furthermore, the       Constitution Subcommittee heard testimony that the Supreme       Court's decision in Shelby County has allowed these evolving       barriers to minority voting to proliferate further.        At the time of the hearings, at least 23 states had enacted       restrictive voter laws since the Shelby County decision       including strict voter ID laws; barriers to voter       registration, such as requiring proof of citizenship       documents, allowing challenges of voters on the voter rolls,       and unfairly purging voters from the voter rolls; reductions       in early voting; and the moving or elimination of polling       places. Witness testimony particularly highlighted ongoing       efforts at voter discrimination in several states that were       previously covered by the VRA's preclearance formula: Texas,       Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama.        In Texas, within just hours of the Shelby County decision,       the state announced it would implement its voter ID law       despite a federal court having ruled that the same law could       not receive preclearance due to its effects on minority       voters. Other examples of voting barriers in Texas included       the reinstatement of at-large voting districts; criminal and       civil penalties for so-called ``voter fraud,'' including for       errors on voter registration forms; widespread purging of       voters from the rolls, including a policy targeting       naturalized citizens; a failure to comply with the National       Voter Registration Act; election judges and polling officials       engaging in discrimination against and hostility toward       minority voters; not processing voter registration of       minority voters; last-minute changes to polling sites and       assigning inconvenient polling sites to minority voters; long       lines; nonfunctioning voting equipment; elimination of       straight-ticket voting; and intimidation by state troopers       and harassment of African American voters by vigilante       groups.        In Georgia, following Shelby County, discriminatory       barriers to voting included attacks on third party       registration; restrictive voter ID laws; the closure of       hundreds of precincts; database challenges that impacted       legitimate registrations; voter purges of more than a million       voters; a flawed process of ``exact match'' that impacted       53,000 people's registrations; undertrained and under-      resourced election staff who could not meet the needs of       voters; long lines; policies that resulted in naturalized       citizens having to go to court for their voting rights; lack       of ballots in languages other than English for language       minority voters; broken voting machines; inadequate       distribution of voting machines; disparate application of       state laws between counties and inconsistent application of       the provisional ballot system; misapplied or miscommunicated       district lines (forcing do-over elections and disqualifying       candidates who would have otherwise been  [[Page H4427]]       eligible); and high rates of rejecting absentee ballots.        In North Carolina, after the Shelby County decision, the       legislature passed an omnibus voter restriction law that the       U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit would later       describe as ``the most restrictive voting law North Carolina       has seen since the era of Jim Crow'' with ``provisions [that]       target African Americans with almost surgical precision.'' It       included a ban on paid voter registration drives, the       elimination of same-day voter registration, a reduction of       early voting by a week, the elimination of the option of       early voting sites at different hours, and the reduction of       satellite polling sites for voters with disabilities and       elderly voters. Other examples of barriers to voting included       gerrymandering, voter roll purges, a voter ID constitutional       amendment, reductions to early voting, long lines, issues       with voting machines and curbside voting, and poll worker       misconduct.        In Alabama, after the Shelby County decision,       discriminatory barriers to voting included a photo ID law,       the closure of DMV offices--which were needed to acquire the       necessary photo ID--in areas with the highest proportions of       Black Americans, restrictive absentee ballot rules, the       requirement of documents to prove citizenship to register to       vote, polling site closures, untrained poll workers, and       felon re-enfranchisement issues.        In describing these voting barriers in specific states, the       witnesses' testimony pointed to a pattern demonstrating that       certain voting practices, enacted across multiple states in       the post-Shelby County era, consistently resulted in minority       voter disenfranchisement, including:        Restrictions on voter registration, early voting, and       voting by mail;        Restrictive voter ID laws;        Voter roll purges;        Issues with polling sites, such as the closure and       relocation of polling sites, long lines, intimidation of       voters primarily in communities of color, locating polling       places extremely far from where a resident lives--especially       in Native American communities, and denying limited English       proficient voters the right to language assistance;        Vote dilution through redistricting plans, transitions to       at-large voting systems, and by other means; and        Obstacles to restoring the right to vote for formerly       incarcerated individuals        One witness summarized the numerous impacts of Shelby       County on voting rights as including the following:        A resurgence of discriminatory voting practices, including       practices motivated by intentional discrimination, especially       in jurisdictions that were once covered by Section 5 of the       VRA;        The institution and re-institution of discriminatory voting       policies with impunity by recalcitrant and hostile elected       officials;        The lack of notification to the public of voting policy       changes that could have a discriminatory effect, which is       especially significant considering most of these actions       occur in small towns where constant oversight would be       difficult;        The inability of the public to participate in reviewing       practices before they take effect;        The elimination of the preclearance process' deterrent       effect;        An unsustainable status quo where civil rights       organizations are attempting to fill the gaps created by the       Shelby County decision at huge expense; and        The first redistricting cycle in decades without the full       protections of the Voting Rights Act.        The record accumulated during the 116th Congress clearly       established that voter discrimination persists and continues       to evolve more than five decades after the passing of the       VRA. The Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County has       effectively permitted these laws to flourish across the       states unimpeded. The evidence highlights the need for the       Voting Rights Act's preclearance regime--both in areas where       voting discrimination has been substantial and persistent and       based on particular voting practices that are likely to       result in unconstitutional discrimination--and to update and       clarify other provisions of the VRA.        During the 117th Congress, the Constitution Subcommittee       built upon the record from the previous Congress, holding six       additional hearings during which witnesses again presented       documented evidence of widespread discrimination in the       voting process. As one witness described at a hearing held in       May 2021, these ``direct burdens on the right to vote''       include discriminatory voter purges; significantly longer       wait times at the polls for minority voters as compared to       white voters, disparities ``that discriminatory state and       local practices are at least partially responsible for''; new       strict voter ID laws; restrictions on voter registration such       as ``exact match'' laws ``mandating that voters' names on       registration records must perfectly match their names on       approved forms of identification''; cutbacks to early voting;       and new laws restricting access to mail in voting and       absentee ballots.        The record compiled over the past two Congresses indicates       that states and political subdivisions have intensified their       efforts to suppress minority voters through the enactment of       facially neutral yet discriminatory voting practices and       procedures in the eight years since the Supreme Court's       Shelby County decision. As discussed in greater detail below,       President Trump and his allies' campaign to spread the       falsehood that his loss in the 2020 presidential election was       due to widespread fraud has further catalyzed state and local       efforts to enact discriminatory changes to voting laws under       the guise of ``election integrity protections.''      B. Changes to State Voting Laws Since the 2020 Election        Particularly salient to demonstrating the current need to       revitalize the VRA is the renewed effort by many states to       enact additional voting restrictions following former       President Trump's efforts to discredit the 2020 election       results by publicly promoting baseless claims that the vote       was marred by fraud and irregularities. As previously noted,       even before the 2020 election, states formerly subject to the       VRA's preclearance requirement enacted a series of new voting       restrictions in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in       Shelby County. Taking cues from the baseless allegations       promoted by President Trump and his allies, several state       legislatures have proposed or enacted restrictive voting laws       in the name of protecting so-called ``election integrity       protection'', including in states previously subject to the       VRA's preclearance regime.        According to a July 22, 2021 Brennan Center for Justice       report, as of July 14, 18 states have enacted 30 laws that       restrict the right to vote. The Brennan Center report also       observes that these restrictive voting laws target mail in       and absentee voting, ``make faulty voter purges more       likely'', and impose stricter voter ID requirements. As of       August 23, 2021, the non-partisan organization Voting Rights       Lab was tracking 495 anti-voter bills in the states.        The recent voting law changes enacted by Georgia exemplify       many of the most restrictive voting measures adopted       following the 2020 election. Notably, the entire state of       Georgia was subject to preclearance under the VRA at the time       of the Shelby County decision. Signed into law by Governor       Brian Kemp (R-GA) on March 25, 2021, SB 202 incorporated       several restrictive voting proposals into a single omnibus       elections law. Several of SB 202's provisions are designed to       limit absentee voting. It requires absentee voters to provide       a Georgia driver's license or state identification card       number or photocopy of another identifying document with       their absentee ballot application; prohibits election       officials from providing ballot applications unless requested       by the voter; and reduces the time period in which a voter       can apply for an absentee ballot. Instead of allowing       municipalities and counties some discretion to set the hours       and days for early voting as was permitted previously, SB 202       standardizes early voting periods, effectively reducing many       voters' opportunities to vote early. One particularly       notorious provision of SB 202 criminalizes as a prohibited       ``gift'' the giving food or water to those standing in line       at a polling place.        There is evidence in the public domain to suggest that       Georgia's recent changes to its election laws are more about       preserving partisan political advantage by burdening minority       communities' exercise of the right to vote than protecting       the integrity of elections. For example, a Gwinnett County       Republican official was quoted saying ``I was on a Zoom call       the other day and I said, `I'm like a dog with a bone. I will       not let them end this session without changing some of these       laws.' They don't have to change all of them, but they've got       to change the major parts of them so that we at least have a       shot at winning.''        Other states that have enacted restrictive voter laws       include Florida and Arizona. On May 6, Florida's Republican       Governor, Ron DeSantis, signed into law an omnibus voter       suppression bill that makes voter registration and vote by       mail more difficult, changes rules for observers in ways that       could disrupt election administration, and restricts the       ability to give water and food to people waiting in line to       vote. On May 11, Arizona's Republican Governor, Doug Ducey,       signed into law a bill to make it harder for Arizonans to       vote by mail by purging voters who do not regularly vote from       Arizona's early voting list (which, before enactment of the       law, had previously been known as the state's permanent early       voting list).        In July 2021, the Texas Legislature began a special session       to pass a new restrictive voting omnibus measure. Texas       Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 3 each would create new ID       requirements for voting by mail and clamp down on new voting       rules instituted by Harris County--the state's most populous       county and one of its most diverse--designed to increase       voter access, including banning drive-thru voting, and new       regulations for early voting hours. Senate Bill 1 passed on       August 12, 2021.  Statement of Wade Henderson, Interim President and CEO, the Leadership                    Conference on Civil and Human Rights      U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,    SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION, CIVIL RIGHTS, AND CIVIL LIBERTIES  HEARING ON ``OVERSIGHT OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT: POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE                         REFORMS''--AUGUST 16, 2021         Chairman Cohen, Ranking Member Johnson, and members of the       subcommittee: Thank you for holding this important hearing       today to highlight the ongoing crisis of racial       discrimination in our voting system and the urgency to       fulfill the promise of our democracy. My name is Wade       Henderson, and I am the interim president and CEO of The       Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  [[Page H4428]]       Rights, a coalition of more than 220 national organizations       working to build an America as good as its ideals.        The Leadership Conference was founded in 1950 and has       coordinated national advocacy efforts on behalf of every       major civil rights law since 1957, including the Voting       Rights Act of 1965 and subsequent reauthorizations. Much of       our work today focuses on making sure that every voter has a       voice in key decisions like pandemic relief, access to       affordable health care, and policing accountability. At The       Leadership Conference, we aim to ensure that every voter can       cast a vote and have it counted. We are deeply grateful to       this subcommittee for its work to restore the Voting Rights       Act and for introducing voluminous evidence of racial       discrimination into the record with integrity, deliberation,       and due diligence.        In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act to outlaw       racial discrimination in voting. Previously, many states       barred Black voters from participating in the political       system through literacy tests, poll taxes, voter       intimidation, and violence. In the mid-1950s, only 25 percent       of African Americans were registered to vote, and the       registration rate was even lower in some states. In       Mississippi, for example, fewer than 5 percent of African       Americans were registered to vote. Those rates soared after       Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act. By 1970, almost as       many African Americans registered to vote in Alabama,       Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and South       Carolina as had registered in the century before 1965. The       Voting Rights Act became the nation's most effective defense       against racially discriminatory voting policies.        Only 15 years ago, this body reauthorized the Voting Rights       Act for the fourth time with sweeping bipartisan support. The       House of Representatives reauthorized this legislation by a       390-33 vote and the Senate passed it unanimously, 98-0. Given       the importance of the Voting Rights Act, Congress undertook       that reauthorization with care and deliberation--holding 21       hearings, hearing from more than 90 witnesses, and compiling       a record of more than 15,000 pages of evidence of continuing       racial discrimination in voting.        Then, in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court in Shelby County v.       Holder eviscerated the most powerful provision of the Voting       Rights Act: the Section 5 preclearance system. This provision       applied to nine states and localities in another six states.       These jurisdictions with histories of voting discrimination       were required to obtain preclearance from the U.S. District       Court for the District of Columbia or the U.S. Department of       Justice before implementing any change in a voting practice       or procedure. As discussed herein, Section 5 was incredibly       successful in blocking proposed voting restrictions in       certain states and localities with histories of racial       discrimination. It also ensured that changes to voting rules       were public, transparent, and evaluated to protect voters       against discrimination based on race and language. But, in       Shelby County, Chief Justice John Roberts, on behalf of the       majority, declared that ``Our country has changed.'' The       Court held that the formula that decided which jurisdictions       were subject to preclearance was based on ``decades-old data       and eradicated practices.'' It instructed Congress to assess       ``current conditions'' in order to require states and       political jurisdictions to preclear voting changes. Now that       this assessment has been conducted, there can be no question       of the persistent racial discrimination at the ballot box.       Congress must act.        Despite the best efforts of The Leadership Conference and       its many member organizations to protect voting rights and       promote civic participation, the eight-year impact of the       Shelby County ruling has been devastating to our democracy.       The Supreme Court's invalidation of the preclearance formula       released an immediate and sustained flood of new voting       restrictions in formerly covered jurisdictions. Without the       Voting Rights Act's tools to fight the most blatant forms of       discrimination, people of color continue to face barriers to       exercising their most important civil right, including voter       intimidation, disenfranchisement laws built on top of a       system of mass incarceration, burdensome and costly voter ID       requirements, and purges from the voter rolls. States have       also cut back early voting opportunities, eliminated same-day       voter registration, and shuttered polling places. The pattern       is familiar: Gains in participation in voting among       communities of color are met with concerted efforts to impose       new barriers in the path of those voters.        Attached to this testimony are reports covering several       states which document the ``current conditions'' surrounding       voting discrimination, the same conditions required by the       Supreme Court in Shelby County as the basis for Congress to       update a coverage formula. Additional reports will be       submitted into the congressional record. These reports       highlight the pervasiveness and persistence of voting       discrimination in its modern-day form. They demonstrate the       importance of reinstating Section 5 preclearance to stop       discriminatory voting changes from going into effect and       thereby ensuring that voters of color can fully participate       in the political process and have their voices heard.      Alabama        In reviewing the current state of voting discrimination, it       is only appropriate to begin with the State of Alabama, the       birthplace of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. From Selma to       Shelby County, Alabama has served as ground zero for the       struggle by Black voters to exercise the franchise. In 1982,       Congress had to explicitly add a results test to Section 2 of       the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court required proof       of intent in a Section 2 case challenging the City of       Mobile's at-large voting districts as a dilution of Black       voting power in City of Mobile v. Bolden. As the report       written by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund       indicates, ``racial discrimination in voting remains a       persistent and significant problem in Alabama today.'' The       Southern Poverty Law Center states in its report, also       attached to this testimony: ``The State of Alabama has never       rested in its efforts to undermine its Black citizens' right       to vote.''        Since the Shelby County decision, Alabama is the only state       in the nation where federal courts have ordered more than one       jurisdiction to submit to preclearance under Section 3(c) of       the Voting Rights Act. Plaintiffs in a longstanding school       desegregation case, Stout v. Jefferson County Board of       Education, challenged the hybrid system of electing school       board members in Jefferson County under which four were       elected at-large from a ``multi-member'' district and a fifth       was elected from a single-member district. No Black person       had ever been elected to an at-large seat. A federal court       ruled that at-large districts violated Section 2 of the       Voting Rights Act, finding that the state legislature created       the districts ``for the purpose of limiting the influence of       Black voters.'' It ordered that multi-member districts be       divided into four single-member districts and the county to       submit future voting changes for Section 3(c) preclearance       through 2031.        The City of Evergreen became the first jurisdiction in the       nation to be subjected to preclearance after Shelby County. A       lawsuit by Black voters challenged Evergreen's post-2010       Census redistricting plan for five single-member districts,       which retained three districts with white majorities even       though 62 percent of Evergreen's population is Black. The       lawsuit also challenged the city's system for determining       voter eligibility, which removed registered voters if their       names did not also appear on the list of utility customers, a       practice which disproportionately removed Black voters from       the voter list. Evergreen failed to obtain preclearance for       these changes before the Shelby County ruling, and a federal       court issued a preliminary injunction against the       redistricting plan. After Shelby County, the court granted       the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on their       intentional discrimination claims and ordered Evergreen to       submit future voting changes relating to redistricting and       voter eligibility for preclearance until December 2020.        The Alabama report reveals additional ``stunning evidence''       of intentional racial discrimination against Black voters by       the Alabama state legislature and local jurisdictions.       African-American state legislators filed a lawsuit alleging       that the Republican-led legislature intentionally sought to       dilute the Black vote in violation of the Voting Rights Act       and the Fourteenth Amendment by redrawing the state's       legislative districts to pack Black voters into majority-      Black districts, thereby reducing their influence in other       districts. The legislators also claimed that the       redistricting plan was an unconstitutional ``racial       gerrymander,'' where it deliberately segregated voters into       districts based on their race without adequate legal       justification. A three-judge district rejected the claims,       and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which vacated       the lower court ruling and remanded the case for       reconsideration. The Court concluded that the fact that the       legislature ``expressly adopted and applied a policy of       prioritizing mechanical racial targets above all other       districting criteria (save one-person, one-vote) provides       evidence that race motivated the drawing of particular lines       in multiple districts in the State.'' On remand, one of the       Eleventh Circuit's most conservative judges, William Pryor,       authored an opinion for the three-judge court, ruling that 12       of the majority-minority districts were unconstitutional       because the legislature relied too heavily on race in drawing       their boundaries.        Another glaring example of intentional discrimination by       Alabama arose in a federal bribery investigation in which       recordings by White Alabama legislators revealed a plot by       legislators to stop a gambling referendum from appearing on       the ballot because it would increase Black voter turnout. The       legislators were overheard calling Black voters       ``Aborigines'' and predicting that the referendum would lead       ``'[e]very black, every illiterate to be ``bussed [to the       polls] on HUD financed busses.'' A district court judge       presiding over the bribery trial ruled that these legislators       were not credible because they tried to ``increase Republican       political fortunes by reducing African American voter       turnout'' and because ``the record establishes their       purposeful, racist intent.'' The court concluded that the       ``recordings represent compelling evidence that political       exclusion through racism remains a real and enduring       problem'' in Alabama, and that overt racism ``remain[s]       regrettably entrenched in the high echelons of state       government.''        Finally, Alabama's efforts to enact photo ID laws, which       disproportionately burden voters of color, dates back several       decades. Although Alabama was required to seek preclearance       before enforcing a 2011 law enacted prior to the Shelby       County ruling, it did not. Instead, it waited until the       ruling and then allowed the law to go into effect.  [[Page H4429]]       The photo ID law was the subject of multiple lawsuits,       recounted by both the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the       Southern Poverty Law Center in their reports. A key issue in       the litigation was the limited ability of Black voters to       obtain photo ID. In 2015, the Alabama governor and a state       agency announced the closure of 31 driver's license offices,       many in majority Black counties. The U.S. Department of       Transportation opened a civil rights investigation under       Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and concluded that       the closures had a disparate impact on Black Alabamians in       violation of the law.      Alaska        There is a well-developed record of Alaska's discrimination       against the state's indigenous peoples, Alaska Natives, which       continues to this day and which was outlined in a 2017       article attached to the testimony. In 1975, the Section 4(b)       coverage formula was amended to address the ``pervasive''       problem of ``voting discrimination against citizens of       language minorities.'' Congress identified what it described       as ``substantial'' evidence of discriminatory practices       against Alaska Natives. That evidence came in four forms: (1)       Alaska Natives suffered from severe and systemic educational       discrimination. (2) Alaska Natives suffered from illiteracy       rates rivaling and even exceeding rates of Black voters in       the South. (3) The illiteracy of Alaska Natives was       exacerbated by their high limited-English proficiency       (LEP) rates and need for interpreters to understand even       the most basic voting materials written in English. (4)       Congress considered evidence of Alaska's constitutional       literacy test and its impact on Alaska Native voters.        When Section 4(b) was reauthorized in 2006, Congress       considered substantial evidence of the impact of past and       present educational discrimination on Native voters. Court       decisions found ``degraded educational opportunities'' for       Alaska Natives, resulting in graduation rates that lagged far       behind non-Natives. Alaska's continued failure to provide       equal educational opportunities profoundly affected the       ability of Native voters to read registration and voting       materials. Congress determined that because of Alaska's       discrimination, Native voters continued ``to experience       hardships and barriers to voting and casting ballots because       of their limited abilities to speak English and high       illiteracy rates . . . particularly among the elders.'' The       sad legacy of education discrimination remains. According to       the most recent census data from the 2016 language coverage       determinations under Section 203, approximately one in five       adult citizens of voting age in the Bethel Census Area is       Limited English Proficient in the Yup'ik language.        Alaska's record of voting discrimination has exacerbated       the continuing effects of its educational discrimination       against Alaska Natives. While Shelby County was being       litigated, Alaska was under a settlement agreement for       violating the language assistance provisions in Section 203       of the Voting Rights Act and the voter assistance provisions       in Section 208 of the Act. In 2009, a federal court issued a       preliminary injunction in Nick v. Bethel finding that the       State of Alaska had engaged in a wholesale failure to provide       language assistance to Yup'ik-speaking voters in the Bethel       Census Area. The court noted that ``State officials became       aware of potential problems with their language-assistance       program in the spring of 2006,'' but their ``efforts to       overhaul the language assistance program did not begin in       earnest until after this litigation.'' At that time, Alaska       had been covered under Section 5 for Alaska Natives since       1975. However, state officials had taken no steps ``to ensure       that Yup'ik-speaking voters have the means to fully       participate in the upcoming State-run elections'' in 2008, a       third of a century later.        Alaska Native villages outside of the Bethel region       expected that the fruits of the hard-fought victory in the       Nick litigation would be applied to other regions of Alaska       where language coverage was mandated. However, Alaska       officials made a ``policy decision'' not to do so. The state       directed its bilingual coordinator to deny language       assistance to other areas. The bilingual coordinator's last       day of employment was on December 31, 2012, the very day that       the Nick agreement ended. That led Alaska Native voters and       villages from three covered regions, the Dillingham and Wade       Hampton Census Areas for Yup'ik and the Yukon-Koyukuk Census       Area for the Athabascan language of Gwich'in, to file suit       just a month after Shelby County was decided. In Toyukak v.       Treadwell, Alaska Natives sued the state for again violating       Section 203 and for intentional discrimination in violation       of the U.S. Constitution because election officials       deliberately chose to deny language assistance to other       regions of Alaska even while the Nick settlement was in       effect. Alaska's recalcitrance to comply with the Voting       Rights Act is particularly noteworthy because it was the       first Section 203 case fully litigated to a decision in 35       years.        In defending the latter claim, Alaska argued that the       Fifteenth Amendment was inapplicable to Alaska Native voters.       State officials argued that Alaska Natives were entitled to       less voting information than English-speaking voters. The       Alaska Native voters prevailed, but only after nearly two       million dollars in attorneys' fees and costs, the passage of       14 months for the ``expedited'' litigation, and a two-week       trial in federal court. The court concluded that ``based upon       the considerable evidence,'' the plaintiffs had established       that Alaska's actions in the three census areas were ``not       designed to transmit substantially equivalent information in       the applicable minority . . . languages.'' The Toyukak       decision came just 14 months after Shelby County, which       refutes the majority's conclusion that ``things have changed       dramatically'' and ``[b]latantly discriminatory evasions of       federal decrees are rare.'' The norm in many areas like       Alaska in a post-Shelby world is defiance and deliberate       violations of federal voting rights law to suppress       registration and voting by American Indians and Alaska       Natives.      Florida        The combination of a large and racially diverse electorate,       two different time zones, and a history of razor-thin,       contested elections would be enough basis for any state to       become a focal point in an examination of voting rights.       Florida's place in the ongoing conversation about the need       for a renewed Voting Rights Act is well-deserved. Since       situating itself at the epicenter of a modern meltdown in the       2000 presidential election, the leaders who run the state's       government have been on the wrong side of policy reform       opportunities that would protect the right to vote. As a       result, communities of color, who comprise nearly half of       Florida's population in excess of 21 million voters, remain       unable to enjoy the franchise by participating fully in       deciding who represents them.        Since the entire nation witnessed its ballot counting       meltdown during a presidential election more than two decades       ago, Florida has not ceased to find its way into voting       rights controversy. The Florida report prepared by the       Advancement Project and submitted with this testimony       outlines a series of issues that have required careful       federal oversight and intervention in support of voting       rights. Prior to the Shelby County decision, the state had       crafted several policies that elicited multiple inquiries and       preclearance objections from the Justice Department. For       instance, the department interposed objections to Florida's       state legislative maps along with subsequence policies       purporting to ``reform'' its election administration system.       All of these objections demonstrated threats to voters'       ability to access the ballot due to the state's inattention       to the effect of language accessibility.        Since Shelby County, however, the scope of the loss of       voting rights has been exceedingly apparent. Florida has       moved quickly to adopt changes in its election system, and       challengers now must resort to court challenges in place of       the preclearance administrative review process. For example,       Florida's secretary of state was enjoined by the Northern       District of Florida from employing a ballot review process       based on a flawed signature mismatch examination due to a       lack of notice for people to cure perceived issues with their       signatures. At the same time, it should be noted that certain       policy decisions that had not reached disposition under the       preclearance regime slipped through the cracks, like       Florida's 2012 voter purge policy where the challenge was       dismissed due to the Shelby County decision in Mi Familia       Voter Education Fund v. Detzner.        Florida has sustained its habit of undermining the will of       the people, even when it was expressed clearly in a public       ballot measure. In 2018, more than 60 percent of Florida       voters approved a constitutional mandate to restore the       rights of its returning citizens. After moving slowly to even       review applications for pardons and clemency before Amendment       Four, state officials doubled down by severely curtailing       eligibility for rights restoration. Florida Senate Bill 7066,       signed into law in 2019, created a new barrier between these       citizens and the franchise: a modern-day poll tax. The new       rules require these citizens to resolve all fees and costs       associated with their prior convictions before becoming       eligible to register.        In practice, this policy is arguably worse than the classic       poll tax, because Florida acknowledges that it does not keep       reliable documentation to allow a person to pay outstanding       costs. Further, the impact of this law shows significant       racial effects in several counties, meaning that people of       color will be less likely than others to pursue the       restoration of their rights. While the federal challenge to       the law was not successful, the fact that the state still did       not understand the likely impact of its fines and fees policy       makes clear the work that preclearance review would address;       this provision would be more carefully researched and either       revised or eliminated due to the significant limits on the       franchise.        In multiple ways, Florida impeded efforts to enhance voter       accessibility during the 2020 election. Amidst a global       pandemic, where voters could not cast ballots in person       without risking life and health, the state did precious       little to provide more opportunities to vote from home. To       the extent the state took affirmative steps, officials made       the problems for voters worse, not better. Even though       Florida has an established record of allowing citizens to       vote by mail, the state limited the number of drop boxes and       locations to drop off ballots, and also curtailed the period       in which early voting would occur. These policies were       compounded by the troubling policy of signature matching for       ballots, an arbitrary methodology which placed doubts on many       cast ballots. All of this occurred against the backdrop of a       well-documented fiasco with delivery times in the U.S. Postal       Service. The results placed unnecessary pressures on       participation rates in low-income areas of the state, as well       as in communities of color.  [[Page H4430]]         Finally, Florida adopted S.B. 90 this year, following       efforts elsewhere to push back on many of the activities and       third party organizations working to address the above       problems with voting practices. The new law places       restrictions on the ability of organizations to assist with       voter registration, a bedrock activity for many groups whose       mission is to enhance participation among voters of color.       Additionally, the bill directs these organizations to warn       citizens who register through their systems that their       applications might not arrive in time, which sows doubt and       uncertainty into these private efforts to expand the       franchise. And focusing on election management by local       officials, the bill eliminates ballot drop-offs on Sundays,       which is widely used by churches in Souls to the Polls       programs. It is difficult to see these changes by Florida's       leadership as motivated by anything more than a hostile move       against threats to their power.      Georgia        Georgia is home to history. In 2021, Black voters in       Georgia turned out in record numbers, electing the state's       first Black U.S. senator, Reverend Raphael Warnock. These       voters were able to make their voices heard despite       tremendous obstacles enacted by the state to limit Black       Georgians' participation. Their ability to not just overcome,       but to triumph, is yet another example of Black Georgians'       achievements, including those of storied civil rights leaders       like Martin Luther King Jr. and the late Congressman John       Lewis. Black and Brown Georgians deserve a democracy that       allows for and encourages their full participation. Sadly,       the state remains relentless in its pursuit of racial       discrimination in voting.        The state has a long and sordid history of relentless       efforts to disenfranchise voters of color, beginning with       prohibitions against Black voting enshrined in the state's       first Constitution in 1777. As Fair Fight Action demonstrates       in its report, ``Georgia's Enduring Racial Discrimination in       Voting and the Urgent Need to Modernize the Voting Rights       Act,'' which is attached to this testimony, there is ``an       urgent and overwhelming need for Congress to bring the       preclearance formula found in the Voting Rights Act (``VRA'')       of 1965 . . . into the modern era, to reinstate robust       federal oversight over discriminatory voting practices, and       to strengthen and protect voting rights--for all eligible       voters in Georgia and nationwide.''        The glaring examples of current disenfranchisement take       many forms and are recounted, chapter and verse, in the Fair       Fight Action report. For example, the two recent objections       interposed directly against the State of Georgia arose in the       five years preceding the Shelby County ruling. In both cases,       the Department of Justice found that Georgia had attempted to       implement new laws that would have a retrogressive and       disproportionate impact on voters of color. Most recently, in       2012, Georgia submitted for preclearance an amendment to the       Georgia election code that required all nonpartisan elections       for members of consolidated governments to be held in       conjunction with the July primary, rather than in November.       The Department of Justice objected, finding the change would       affect Augusta-Richmond County, in which Black voters had       just become a majority. Because Black voters were less likely       to vote in July, the Department determined the change       depressed turnout for voters of color and further, that the       state had not sustained its burden of showing a lack of       discriminatory purpose or effect.        Three years earlier, in 2009, the Department of Justice       lodged an objection to a version of Georgia's voter       verification program. It found that the ``seriously flawed''       program, which improperly removed voters from the rolls,       disproportionately affected voters of color. It made this       finding based on the ``actual results of the state's       verification process'' because Georgia had violated Section 5       of the Voting Rights Act by not seeking preclearance before       implementing the program.        Fair Fight Action has collected the stories of thousands of       voters across the state who faced incredible barriers to       voting in the 2018 general election and the 2020-21 election       cycle. For example, a DeKalb County physician, one of the       country's leading infectious disease specialists, was       challenged at his polling location because there was a slight       discrepancy with the spelling of his last name on his       driver's license as compared with his registration       information. A Fulton County voter was initially refused a       ballot because he was classified as a non-citizen, despite       presenting his U.S. passport. Voters across the state       expressed frustration at the closing and moving of polling       locations, including a voter from Clay County, who was forced       to drive an hour to a new polling location because her old       polling location down the street closed.        Voter purges have also disenfranchised eligible and       properly registered voters whose only mistake was not voting       recently enough, like a voter in Warner Robins who has lived       at the same address for 50 years but did not vote in recent       elections. In 2019, he was placed on the state's purge list       impermissibly, with no notice. Georgia voters also       experienced unacceptably long lines when trying to vote, such       that many voters were forced to leave without voting or       experienced other adverse consequences. For example, a voter       from Cobb County left her home at 6:30 a.m. to vote on       Election Day in 2018. The line was too long, so she left and       came back on her lunch break at 2:20 p.m. She was not able to       cast her ballot until 5:30 p.m., and lost two hours of pay.       In the Fair Fight Action report, there are also powerful       examples of how the state abdicated its responsibility to       adequately train local officials and poll workers about       provisional ballots, which in turn, has resulted in       conflicting and incorrect information given to voters.        Despite the high standards applied to voter discrimination       claims by federal courts, at least two cases have resulted in       a final judgment that a practice within the State of Georgia       violated the Voting Rights Act. In a 2018 ruling, a federal       court found that Sumter County's redrawn school board       district map, which reduced the number of single-member       districts and added two new at-large districts, violated       Section 2. The plaintiff claimed the new map diluted the       voting strength of Black voters. The court agreed, finding       that the ``infringement of black voters' right to vote in       Sumter County is severe.'' The court specifically found there       was a ``glaring lack of success for African American       candidates running for county-wide office, both historically       and recently, despite their plurality in voting-age       population.'' And the low rate of Black turnout was       attributable to the indisputable history of discrimination in       Sumter County and in Georgia. A court made a similar finding       in 1997 after a bench trial on claims challenging the City of       LaGrange's at-large city council district plan. Noting that       LaGrange and Georgia had a long history of discrimination,       the court found the plan violated Section 2 of the Voting       Rights Act because it deprived citizens of color of the       opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.        For further proof that attacks on voting represent an       escalating threat to the rights of Georgians of color, one       need look no further than the state's recently enacted Senate       Bill 202. Georgia's Republican-led General Assembly hastily       passed S.B. 202 after a historic turnout for the 2020       election and the 2021 Senate runoff, in which record       participation among Black and Brown voters led to the       election of Senator Warnock, and in response to conspiracy       theory-fueled, groundless allegations of voter fraud.       Provisions such as the photo ID requirement, reduced minimum       early voting for runoff elections, limited access to drop       boxes, and prohibition of most out-of-precinct voting will       disparately impact voters of color, particularly those with       limited resources and time to navigate the complex       requirements. Private parties have filed seven suits against       Georgia's governor, the secretary of state, the State       Election Board and its members, and various county election       officials for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging       various provisions of S.B. 202. On June 25, 2021, the       Department of Justice sued the state, the secretary of state,       and the State Election Board, bringing the number of pending       lawsuits challenging S.B. 202 to eight.      Louisiana        Louisiana's record of racial discrimination in voting is       ever present and well-documented. As the Southern Poverty Law       Center demonstrates in its report attached to this testimony,       Louisiana officials have consistently developed methods of       denying or diluting the votes of Black Louisianans. The       tactics may have changed over time, but the outcome is the       same: Black voters disproportionately bear the impact and are       less able to participate in the political process.        Louisiana's population is nearly one-third Black. Since       Reconstruction, however, the state has not elected a Black       candidate to statewide office. Louisiana lawmakers continue       to reduce the power of Black communities through at-large       elections, proposed annexations, incorporation, and       redistricting plans. Louisiana currently unnecessarily       restricts registration, purges eligible voters from the       rolls, and makes registration onerous for people with felony       convictions. Since Shelby County, Louisiana has also       eliminated dozens of polling places, mostly in Black       communities. And while the state provides early voting, it       limits the number of sites, creating incredibly long lines in       the most populous parishes, including those with the most       Black residents. The state also banned early voting on       Sundays in 2016, which is a well-known tool for increasing       Black voter turnout. The state narrowly restricts access to       absentee ballots, erects barriers to ensuring that votes are       counted, and engages in voter intimidation. Despite myriad       barriers to voting placed in their path, Louisiana voters       persevere. Southern Poverty Law Center's report recounts more       than 70 Louisiana voters' stories demonstrating the personal       side of voter suppression.        In 2000, the Department of Justice sued Morgan City,       alleging that the at-large system for electing members to the       city council violated Section 2. After five private       plaintiffs filed a similar action, the cases were       consolidated and the parties settled. The court entered a       consent judgment, finding ``a reasonable factual and legal       basis to conclude that under the at-large system for election       of City Council in Morgan City, minority voters have less       opportunity than other members of the electorate to       participate in the political process and to elect       representatives of their choice.'' As a condition of the       settlement, the parties agreed that all future elections for       the city council would proceed according to a single-member       election system.        In 2002, a residents' association sued the St. Bernard       Parish School Board under Section 2 to prevent it from       adopting a redistricting plan that reduced the board's size  [[Page H4431]]       and created two at-large seats. The redistricting plan arose       from Act No. 173, which required St. Bernard Parish, upon the       collection of a sufficient number of petitions, to hold a       referendum to transform the parish school board from a body       composed of 11 members elected from single-member districts       to one composed of seven members, five elected from single-      member districts and two elected at-large. Parish voters       approved the ``5-2'' plan. Under the 11-member single-      district plan, it had been possible to create a majority-      Black district; indeed, prior to the referendum, the school       board had tentatively approved doing just that. But the 5-2       plan made a majority-Black district impossible. The court       invalidated the plan, finding that it diluted the voting       strength of the parish's Black voters in violation of Section       2.        In 2007, Black residents of Jefferson Parish filed suit       against the State of Louisiana, alleging that the method for       electing judges on an at-large basis to the First District of       the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals diluted Black voting       strength. On July 6, 2007, the Louisiana governor signed Act       261, dividing the First District into two single-member       ``election sections.'' The court entered a consent judgement,       confirming that Act 261 provided a framework for resolving       the litigation. The court ordered that the action be       dismissed, subject to preclearance and implementation of Act       261.        In 2021, the Department of Justice filed suit against the       City of West Monroe under Section 2, challenging the at-large       method of electing representatives to the West Monroe Board       of Aldermen. Although Black residents comprised nearly 30       percent of the voting-age population in West Monroe, no Black       candidate had ever been elected to the board. The court       entered a consent judgment adopting a ``mixed'' election       method that provided for three single-member districts and       two at-large seats.        As a harbinger of what is to come, in the latest       legislative session, state lawmakers passed five bills that       would have further restricted voting rights, including a bill       that would unnecessarily purge registered voters, a bill that       would add additional identification requirements to absentee       ballots, and a bill that would ban absentee ballot drop       boxes. Only fierce and persistent advocacy from dedicated       organizers and a veto from the governor prevented these bills       from becoming law. Louisiana's current conditions of racial       discrimination in voting are unequivocal. Without federal       preclearance, the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and the       Voting Rights Act to guarantee equal voting rights will slip       further away.      Mississippi        Home to voting rights heroes like Fannie Lou Hamer and       Medgar Evers and the site of Freedom Summer, Mississippi is       notorious for its exclusion and suppression of Black voters       throughout history. Mississippi enforced white supremacy       through explicit legal impediments to Black voting as well as       state-sanctioned murder, including more than 650 lynchings       from Reconstruction through 1950--the most of any state in       the country. Mississippi was the first state sued by the       Department of Justice after the Voting Rights Act was passed.       Between 1965 and 2006, the department objected to more than       169 proposed voting changes in Mississippi that       disenfranchised voters of color, including redistricting       plans, at-large election schemes, polling place changes,       candidate qualification requirements, and open primary laws.       The state has the highest percentage of Black residents in       the country--38 percent--yet no Black candidate has been       elected to statewide office since Reconstruction.        As documented in the Southern Poverty Law Center's report,       ``Freedom Summer, Shelby County, & Beyond: Mississippi's       Continued Record of Racial Discrimination in Voting, the       Tireless Mississippians Who Push Forward, & the Critical Need       to Restore the Voting Rights Act,'' the state and many of its       jurisdictions have made strident and continuous efforts to       prevent Black Mississippians from participating in the       political process. For example, instead of paying a ``poll       tax'' to vote, Black Mississippians are now required to incur       the burdensome expense of having certain absentee ballots and       applications notarized. Additionally, instead of being asked       to interpret complex legal provisions under the guise of       literacy tests, Black Mississippians are now subject to       unevenly applied voter ID requirements.        Voting rights litigation during the last 25 years       demonstrates the ongoing struggle of voters of color. In       1993, a nonprofit group sued the City of Quitman,       Mississippi, arguing that the city violated Section 2 of the       Voting Rights Act by electing its five aldermen from at-large       districts, thus diluting the voting strength of the city's       Black voters. A federal court granted a preliminary       injunction, enjoining the upcoming 1993 alderman elections.       The court later entered a final judgment, concluding that the       city's system of electing its aldermen from at-large       districts violated Section 2. In 1996, Black voters       challenged Calhoun County's redistricting plan. Rather       than drawing a ``geographically compact black majority       district,'' the county created a plan that divided Black       residents between five districts, where the Black       population ranged from 19 percent to 42 percent. A federal       appellate court held that the plan ``dilute[d] minority       voting strength'' and therefore violated Section 2 of the       Voting Rights Act. In 1997, a federal court found that       Chickasaw County's redistricting plan for its justice       court judge and constable elections violated Section 2 of       the Voting Rights Act. The court concluded that ``the       lingering effect of the past history of discrimination,       the racially polarized voting patterns, the substantial       socio-economic differences between black and white       citizens, and the lack of success of black candidates in       country-wide, county district and city-wide elections in       Chickasaw County causes black voters to `have less       opportunity than other members of the electorate in the       political process and to elect candidates of their       choice.' ''        It is harder to vote in Mississippi than in almost any       other state. Mississippi ranked 47 out of 50 in the 2020 Cost       of Voting Index--which considers election system features       that impact voting access, including registration deadlines,       availability of pre-registration and early voting, number of       polling places, poll hours, and voter ID laws. It was a       modest improvement from 2016 when it ranked dead last. There       is no online voter registration. No automatic or same-day       registration. No early voting. Mississippi has a strict photo       ID law for voting in person. One can only vote absentee by       qualifying for one of a narrow set of excuses. Even those who       qualify to vote absentee must have their absentee ballot       application and their absentee ballot notarized. During the       2020 election season, the state refused to lift these       burdensome requirements even amid a global pandemic,       endangering Mississippians wishing to avail themselves of       their rights and make their voices heard while keeping       themselves and their families safe.        In its report, the Southern Poverty Law Center documented       Mississippians' obstacles to cast their votes. On Election       Day 2012, a Hinds County resident arrived at the polling       location at which she had voted for years, only to be told       that her name was not in the register, and she was not able       to vote. After the election, she took time off from work to       go to the courthouse and ask why her name had been removed       from the rolls. She was eventually informed that her name had       been removed as part of a redistricting--the first time she       had ever been notified of this fact. In the 2016 presidential       election, a Grenada County resident and Ole Miss student       attempted to vote absentee but was charged $10 for each       document she needed to get notarized, for a total of $20. She       had to spend her last $20 on the notary and points out that       this notarization requirement is ``equivalent to charging a       poll tax.'' A Harrison County resident moved in fall 2020 and       promptly re-registered to vote at her new address. On       Election Day 2020, she was turned away from her nearest       polling place and was told she needed to vote at another       location 30 minutes away. Once there, however, she was       required to vote using a provisional ballot and later       received a letter indicating her ballot had not been counted.       It ultimately took her three attempts to update her address       before she was finally able to receive her voter card. In the       2020 election, a Hinds County resident encountered delays and       overcrowding at her polling location, which was located on       the corner of two roads with no sidewalks. She and other       voters had to wait in line on the side of the road for about       an hour, which was difficult for many disabled and elderly       voters, including the voter in front of her in line, whose       wheelchair broke while waiting in line due to the poor road       conditions.        Mississippi officials are relentless in curtailing the       right to vote for their constituents of color. Earlier this       year, House Bill 586 proposed that Mississippi direct its       voter registration system to identify registered voters who       may not be U.S. citizens by checking other unspecified       ``identification databases.'' Voters flagged as ``potential       non-citizens'' would have faced an immediate challenge to       their registrations: The bill ``mandated a 30-day period in       which flagged voters would have had to provide a birth       certificate, passport, or naturalization documents to the       relevant authority.'' Failure to do so would result in an       immediate purge from the registered voter roll. Under threat       of litigation by advocates, the bill ultimately failed, but       it demonstrates that many Mississippi lawmakers remain       determined to make it even more difficult to vote.      North Carolina        North Carolina's shameful history of racism in voting       includes the only successful violent municipal coup d`etat in       our nation's history in the Wilmington massacre of 1898;       enactment of a literacy test, poll tax, and felony-based       disenfranchisement; prohibitions on single-shot voting; and       discriminatory multi-member districts of 1982 that led to the       landmark Thornburg v. Gingles decision. Yet, as documented in       Forward Justice's report, ``The Struggle for Voting Rights in       North Carolina: 2006-2021,'' North Carolina's recent history       demonstrates the effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act prior       to Shelby County and the urgent need for its reinvigoration.        In the two decades before Shelby County, the Voting Rights       Act was working in North Carolina. Prior to 2013, 40 out of       100 counties were covered by Section 5, primarily located in       Eastern North Carolina. As the report describes, ``[w]hile       the impact of Section 2 litigation since 1965 cannot be       underestimated, Section 5 was the critical legal protection       undergirding the fragile, but notable, gains by Black voters       in the state.'' From 1982 to 2013, more than 49 Section 5       objection letters were issued by the Department of Justice to       North Carolina and its local jurisdictions. By  [[Page H4432]]       2012, African Americans were ``poised to act as a major       electoral force.''        After Shelby County, North Carolina became ``a national       testing ground for modern manifestations of Jim Crow-era       voter suppression strategies and epicenter for a renewed       voting rights movement to prevent discrimination at the       ballot box.'' In just a matter of hours after Shelby County       was handed down, leadership of the North Carolina General       Assembly announced that because the decision had rid them of       the ``headache'' of the Voting Rights Act's preclearance       protections, they could now move forward with the ``full       bill.'' H.B. 589 became known as the ``monster'' voter       suppression law--and was more restrictive than bills seen in       any other state. Among other changes, the law eliminated       same-day registration, pre-registration for 16- and 17-year-      olds, out-of-precinct ballots, and the first week of early       voting, and instituted one of the nation's most stringent       voter ID requirements.        More than three years after H.B. 589's passage, the U.S.       Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit invalidated the       omnibus suppression legislation, holding that the State of       North Carolina illegally and intentionally targeted the right       to vote of African Americans ``with almost surgical       precision'' in violation of Section 2 and the Fourteenth and       Fifteenth Amendments. The Court concluded ``in sum, relying       on . . . racial data, the General Assembly enacted       legislation restricting all--and only--practices       disproportionately used by African Americans'' and ``that,       because of race, the legislature enacted one of the largest       restrictions of the franchise in modern North Carolina.''        As described in Forward Justice's report, North Carolinians       have labored for close to a decade defending against an all-      out attack on voting rights. On top of the ``surgical       precision'' of the omnibus voter suppression legislation,       North Carolina's racially discriminatory redistricting       following the 2010 decennial census represents some of the       most egregious gerrymandering violations in the country to       dilute and suppress the power of voters of color. Two federal       decisions, Covington v. North Carolina and Cooper v. Harris,       held that, in drawing the state legislative districts, the       state manufactured one of the ``largest racial gerrymanders       ever encountered by a Federal Court'' and, in constructing       both Congressional District 1 and 12, the General Assembly       illegally used a ``racial target that subordinated other       districting criteria and produced boundaries amplifying       divisions between blacks and whites.'' These cases are among       the most prominent of the state's complex web of voting       rights violations since 2013, many documented in state and       federal court challenges, which dominated the past decade.        Voting rights litigation, voter outreach and education, and       voter protection work over the last decade yielded a detailed       body of evidence summarized in the Forward Justice report,       including in the form of coordinated third-party challenges       to voter eligibility, significant reductions to polling       locations and hours available in formerly covered counties,       and county-level efforts to change methods of elections from       single-member to at-large. As North Carolina's elections       developed into a federal battleground the state also       experienced continued racial appeals in campaigning, and       incidents of harassment and voter intimidation by both third-      party groups and partisan actors, particularly heightened in       the 2020 election cycle. One shocking incident took place on       the last day of early voting on October 31, 2020, when a       peaceful ``Souls to the Polls'' march in Graham, North       Carolina, organized by Black clergy, ended with those       gathered, including the elderly and children, being pepper-      sprayed and prevented from completing their walk to the early       voting site in Alamance County.        Without the preventative umbrella of Section 5, North       Carolinians were left working overtime to seek after-the-fact       remedies, and equal democracy in the state suffered. North       Carolina's General Assembly remains in legislative session       today, with legislation pending that threatens the right to       vote. Following the census data release, the 2021       redistricting process is officially underway. The state       produced remarkable leaders in the modern struggle for voting       rights, including elders Mother Rosa Eaton and Mother Grace       Hardison, who represent the best of America, as they fought       under the banner of the Forward Together Moral Mondays       Movement to realize the full promise of our democracy. But,       as Rev. Dr. William Barber, II, a leading architect of that       movement described, ``these battles should never have       occurred at all.'' Without urgent congressional action, North       Carolinians are bracing for another decade of struggle for       the equal ballot, recognizing that the state's past is a       harbinger of the scope and scale of voter suppression to       come.      South Carolina        South Carolina, where Black residents represent more than       one quarter of the state's population, has a long and deep       history of racial discrimination in voting. It was the first       state to challenge the constitutionality of the Voting Rights       Act, in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, almost immediately       after its passage in 1965. As the South Carolina report by       veteran voting rights lawyer Mark Posner makes clear, that       legacy of discrimination continues today, both in how the       state runs elections and in structural election practices.       The state has one of the most restrictive voter registration       deadlines in the country; one of the most restrictive systems       regarding the opportunity for voters to cast their ballot       ahead of Election Day, either by mail or in person; and one       of the worst recent records for wait times at the polls.        While some advances have been made in safeguarding the       freedom to vote, particularly for Black Americans, they have       largely been the result of Section 5 objections and       litigation. Between 1996 and the Shelby County ruling, the       Department of Justice issued 14 objections to voting changes       which jurisdictions, including the state itself, were seeking       to implement. The glaring example of the challenge to the       state's restrictive photo ID law is a case in point. It       illustrates the power and the efficacy of the Voting Rights       Act to block discriminatory voting changes and to deter       jurisdictions from seeking to implement such changes.        In 2011, South Carolina adopted an exceedingly onerous       photo ID law for voting in person and for in-person absentee       voting. It recognized only five limited forms of ID: a South       Carolina driver's license, another form of photo ID issued by       the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles, a voter       registration card with a photograph (issued only by visiting       a local board of registration office); a federal military       photo ID; and a passport. Voters without ID could cast a       provisional ballot by presenting a non-photo voter       registration card and signing an affidavit that ``the elector       suffers from a reasonable impediment that prevents him from       obtaining a photo ID.''        The Department of Justice blocked the new requirement from       being implemented on the basis that it would disenfranchise       tens of thousands of voters of color. It concluded that       ``[n]on-white voters were . . . disproportionately       represented . . . in the group of registered voters who . . .       would be rendered ineligible to go to the polls and       participate in the election.'' The state filed a Section 5       declaratory judgement seeking preclearance from a three-judge       court but failed to demonstrate that the limited roster of       acceptable IDs would not have a discriminatory effect.        Facing a likely denial of preclearance, South Carolina       reinterpreted the law to liberally construe the ``reasonable       impediment'' exception to the photo ID requirement in an       effort to neutralize the discriminatory effect. Under this       new subjective test, the reasonableness of the impediment was       ``to be determined by the individual voter, not by a poll       manager or county board.'' Based on this interpretation, the       district court precleared the revised photo ID provision for       elections after 2012 but denied preclearance for the 2012       general election on the ground that there was too little time       to properly implement the new provision.        In a concurring opinion, U.S. Judge John Bates famously       emphasized the key role Section 5 had played in South       Carolina ultimately putting forth a nondiscriminatory photo       ID provision: ``[O]ne cannot doubt the vital function that       Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act has played here . . . .       Congress has recognized the importance of such a deterrent       effect.  . . . Rather, the history of [the new law]       demonstrates the continuing utility of Section 5 of the       Voting Rights Act in deterring problematic, and hence       encouraging nondiscriminatory, changes in state and local       voting laws.''      Texas        They say that everything's bigger in Texas. The battle for       voting rights is no exception, as documented in the Texas       report submitted with this testimony. Last week's census       results illustrate that Texas gained more residents than any       other state since 2010, with people of color accounting for       over 95 percent of this growth. Non-Hispanic White Texans now       make up just 39.8 percent of the state's population--down       from 45 percent in 2010. Meanwhile, the share of Hispanic       Texans has grown to 39.3 percent. The state's growth of Black       and Asian populations also significantly outpaced that of the       White population since 2010. These changes will no doubt       affect the electorate for decades to come. Nearly half of all       Texans under age 18 are Latino, and two million more will       become eligible to vote in the next decade. Not surprisingly,       Texas added a record number of new voters between last two       presidential elections.        These dramatic demographic shifts in the electorate       coincide with continuing and harmful attacks on voting rights       in the state. At the end of last year, researchers examining       the time and effort required to vote in different states       ranked Texas as the worst for voting.The creation of--in       their words--``the state with the most restrictive electoral       climate'' in light of unparalleled expansion and       diversification of the electorate reflects the state's past       and foreshadows its future without federal oversight. Indeed,       the pattern here is familiar one: Gains in minority       participation in voting are met with concerted efforts to       impose new barriers in the path of those voters. As Justice       Kennedy observed in LULAC v. Perry,        ``Texas has a long, well-documented history of       discrimination that has touched upon the rights of African-      Americans and Hispanics to register, to vote, or to       participate otherwise in the electoral process. Devices such       as the poll tax, an all-white primary system, and restrictive       voter registration time periods are an unfortunate part of       this State's minority voting rights history. . . . [T]he       `political, social, and economic legacy of past       discrimination' for Latinos in Texas  [[Page H4433]]       may well `hinder their ability to participate effectively in       the political process.' ''        Tory Gavito, a minority politics movement builder and       founder of the Texas Futures Project and Way To Win,       described that: ``Texas is where the South meets the West. We       have a legacy of slavery in the state. We have a legacy of       stealing lands and killing Mexican landowners who lived here       from before the state was part of the United States of       America.'' Its shared history demonstrates how the expansion       or restriction of voting rights in Texas has implications       across the country. In 1944, Thurgood Marshall successfully       argued in Smith v. Allwright that the Texas Democratic       Party's policy of prohibiting Black people from voting in       primary elections violated the Fourteenth and Fifteenth       Amendments. Black voter registration markedly improved       immediately following the Court's ruling in Smith, causing       Marshall to recognize the case as ``a giant milestone in the       progress of Negro Americans toward full citizenship.'' Though       the white primary was struck down, several features of vote       denial and abridgement in Texas remain: redistricting, the       imposition of additional candidate qualifications, new at-      large voting arrangements, photo ID laws, onerous voter       registration procedures, voter roll purges, relocation,       closures and overcrowded polling sites, and hurdles related       to mail-in voting.        The wave of new voters of color in Texas have been met with       the ``most restrictive pre-registration law in the country.''       In particular, Texas has an in-person voter registration       deadline 30 days prior to Election Day and prohibits online       voter registration. Voters must print their registration and       bring it to the county voter registrar. Texas also does not       offer simultaneous registration for the 1.5 million Texans       who renew or update their driver's licenses online. In       contrast, other states permit an automatic voter registration       process, same-day registration during early voting, and       online registration options.        These same voters may need to journey to polling places       that are distant from minority neighborhoods. A report by The       Leadership Conference Education Fund recently noted that       Texas ``stands out for the volume, scale, and breadth of its       polling place closures since Shelby County.'' This study       shows that Texas has closed more polling places since Shelby       County than any other state. The 750 polls closed constituted       approximately 50 percent of the state's total polling places,       and 590 were closed before the 2016 presidential election--      the first presidential election after Shelby County.       Furthermore, five of the six largest county closers of       polling places are in Texas. Unsurprisingly, these counties--      Dallas, Harris, Brazoria, and Nueces--are all majority-      minority jurisdictions with significant Latino and Black       population.        Courts have previously found Texas' voting restrictions to       bear racial animus and hinder the ability of minorities to       effectively participate in the political process. One recent       example is from Texas' photo ID law. In 2011, Texas adopted a       voter ID law that courts later found to have been passed with       discriminatory intent. Senate Bill 14 required voters to       present one of the specified types of photo ID when voting at       the polls. The Justice Department successfully blocked the       implementation of the law in 2012 under its Section 5       preclearance authority. However, Texas began enforcing S.B.       14 shortly after the Shelby County decision. Although the       bill's proponents asserted that the law was necessary, both       the district court and Fifth Circuit held that it violated       Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by intentionally       discriminating against Black and Hispanic voters who were       less likely to hold a required photo ID.        The Texas House just passed what must be regarded as a       voter suppression bill, after Texas Republicans issued civil       arrest warrants for 52 of their Democratic colleagues who       refused to show up to legislative votes because they oppose       the legislation. If enacted, the bill would create stricter       vote-by-mail rules, add new requirements to the voting       process, ban drive-thru and 24-hour voting, bolster access       for partisan poll watchers, and curb local voting options       that would make voting easier. These requirements only build       on some of the most restrictive voting laws in the nation       from the last election cycle. That election night, Jolt       Action, a group aimed at building political momentum among       Latinos in Texas, held a get together at its headquarters.       Artwork of youth of color adorned the walls of the office.       One painting showed children holding hands before a wall,       with the caption ``They tried to bury us. They didn't know we       were seeds.'' The question remains: Will voting restrictions       scorch the earth upon which these seeds seek to grow, or will       we see a garden of vibrant democracy, one tended to by       federal and state protections, over decades to come?      Virginia        The post-Shelby County landscape in Virginia is devastated       by rollbacks of protections for the right to vote. The       Virginia report prepared by Campaign Legal Center details       ongoing discrimination exposed through litigation, as well as       anti-voter laws, voter intimidation and disinformation       campaigns, and other tactics that disproportionately burden       and disenfranchise voters of color.        Very recent litigation in Virginia Beach powerfully       demonstrates the toll that discrimination in voting takes on       communities of color in the state. In March 2021, a federal       court held that Virginia Beach's at-large system for electing       city council members violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights       Act because it dilutes the voting strength of Black, Latino,       and Asian American voters. The state's largest city had an       11-member city council, composed of the mayor and 10       councilmembers, each elected at-large for four-year staggered       terms. The city had relied upon an at-large system since       1966, but in 50 years, the city's racial composition had       changed dramatically: People of color now constitute 31.6       percent of the city's population. Despite sizable communities       of color, only six candidates of color have ever been elected       to Virginia Beach's city council, and barring special       circumstances triggered by the pendency of litigation under       the Voting Rights Act, no Black candidate has ever been re-      elected to serve a second term.        In enjoining the at-large system, the federal court       recognized that its discriminatory effects reflect a broader       culture of racial discrimination in the city and the state       that continues to impact residents of color today: ``[t]he       Commonwealth of Virginia and the City have histories of voter       discrimination as it pertains to registration, voter       suppression, gerrymandering, and other forms of       discrimination.'' The Campaign Legal Center powerfully       documents the many facets of this discrimination and       concludes: ``The vast evidence of racial discrimination this       case has uncovered alone demonstrates the need for       preclearance and other means of federal oversight to protect       the right of all Americans to vote.''        The Campaign Legal Center's report also sets forth       discriminatory barriers to in-person voting, such as the       closing, consolidating, and relocating of polling places       documented in The Leadership Conference Education Fund's       reports in 2016 and 2019. These changes no longer require       preclearance and disproportionately impact communities of       color. Because Virginia law caps the number of registered       voters each precinct can serve, localities must create new       precincts. But more precincts do not necessarily mean more       polling locations in communities of color. Some localities       opt for one polling location to serve multiple precincts,       increasing the voters assigned to a single polling place.       This increases poll wait times and transportation burdens to       and from the polls. During the November 2020 election,       Henrico County--30.9 percent of which is Black--consolidated       four polling places into existing sites. Because state law       allows multiple precincts to be assigned to the same polling       place, the county maintained separate precincts in the same       building: each had their own poll workers and entrances,       heightening voter confusion.     The Time Is Now to Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act         When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act       of 1965, he declared the law a triumph and said, ``Today we       strike away the last major shackle of . . . fierce and       ancient bonds.'' But 56 years later, the shackles of white       supremacy still restrict the full exercise of our rights and       freedom to vote.        For democracy to work for all of us, it must include us       all. When certain communities cannot access the ballot and       when they are not represented in the ranks of power, our       democracy is in peril. The coordinated, anti-democratic       campaign to restrict the vote targets the heart of the       nation's promise: that every voice and every eligible vote       count. Congress must meet the urgency of this moment and pass       the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This bill will       restore the essential portion of the Voting Rights Act that       blocks discriminatory voting policies before they go into       effect, putting a transparent process in place for protecting       the right to vote. It will also bring down the barriers       erected to silence Black, Indigenous, young, and new       Americans and ensure everyone has a voice in the decisions       impacting our lives.        On March 7, 1965, just a few months before President       Johnson would sign the Voting Rights Act into law, then 25-      year-old John Lewis led more than 600 people across the       Edmund Pettus Bridge to demand equal voting rights. State       troopers unleashed brutal violence against the marchers.       Lewis himself was beaten and bloodied. But he never gave up       the fight. For decades, the congressman implored his       colleagues in Congress to realize the promise of equal       opportunity for all in our democratic process. Before his       death, he wrote: ``Time is of the essence to preserve the       integrity and promises of our democracy.'' Members of this       body must now heed his call with all the force they can       muster.        Thank you for inviting me to testify today. I am pleased to       answer any questions you may have, and I look forward to       working with you to ensure all of us, no matter race or       place, have an equal say in our democracy.                                   ____      Testimony of Peyton McCrary, Professorial Lecturer in Law, George     Washington University Law School, Before the Subcommittee on the     Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties of the U.S. House                         Committee on the Judiciary     oversight of the voting rights act: potential legislative reforms--                             august 16, 2021         Chair Cohen, Vice Chair Raskin, Ranking Member Johnson, and       distinguished Members, thank you for inviting me to testify       before you today.  [[Page H4434]]         My name is Peyton McCrary. Although I have retired from 20       years of full-time university teaching and 26 years of       government service in the U.S. Department of Justice, I still       co-teach a course on voting rights law each fall at the       George Washington University Law School, where adjunct       faculty bear the title Professorial Lecturer in Law. My       testimony today is offered in my personal capacity as a       historian, not as a representative of any organization.        The focus of my testimony is evidence regarding the       jurisdictions that would be covered by a new form of federal       preclearance of voting changes, which I understand is being       contemplated by this chamber. Representatives of the Brennan       Center for Justice and the Leadership Conference Education       Fund asked me some months ago to investigate the preclearance       coverage formula that is being considered for inclusion in       the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA). An       earlier version of the VRAA passed the House of       Representatives December 6, 2019, as H.R. 4 and is now under       consideration in a new Congress. The VRAA is designed to       restore the preclearance provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights       Act by revising the coverage formula invalidated by the       Supreme Court in its 2013 decision in Shelby County v.       Holder. Preclearance refers to the process of receiving prior       federal approval from the Department of Justice or the U.S.       District Court for the District of Columbia before       implementing any change affecting voting. My task was to       identify the jurisdictions that would be subject to       preclearance should the VRAA become law. This task required       the use of research methods I have employed--both in my       scholarly publications and in expert witness testimony--over       the last four decades. For example, it calls among other       things for methodology I applied in my sworn Declaration       filed by the United States in Shelby County v. Holder in       2010.        The new formula for determining the jurisdictions that       would be subject to preclearance under the VRAA would be       triggered by the record of voting rights enforcement. My       analysis generally focuses on the last 25 years, currently       from 1996 through 2020, although the conclusions would change       if the review period changed. Under some circumstances entire       states would be covered; even if the entire state is not       subject to preclearance, any individual political subdivision       within a state could be covered if the record of voting       rights violations in that subdivision meets the criteria of       the VRAA.        My analysis derives from the last VRAA, which contained a       coverage formula in which an entire state would be subject to       preclearance if either of two patterns of violations applied:       a) if 15 or more voting rights violations occurred within the       state during the previous 25 years; or b) if 10 or more       violations occurred in the state during the last 25 years, at       least one of which was committed by the state itself, rather       than by local subdivisions within the state. I also       understand that even if an entire state were not subject to       preclearance, any political subdivision would be covered if       it had three or more violations during the previous 25 years.       Relying on that understanding, my count of violations       includes: a) final judgments of a voting rights violation by       the federal courts; b) objections to voting changes by the       Attorney General; and c) a consent decree or other settlement       causing a change favorable to minority voting rights.        I understand that Congress may consider other specifics for       the coverage formula. While I am not testifying as to any       approach Congress should take, I note that changes to the       formula could lead to different conclusions than those I have       reached.                                qualifications         I am an historian by training and taught history at the       university level from 1969 until 1990. During the 1980s I       served as an expert witness in numerous voting rights cases       in the South. I was employed as a social science analyst by       the Voting Section, Civil Rights Division, of the U.S.       Department of Justice, from 1990 until my retirement in       December 2016. My responsibilities in the Civil Rights       Division included the planning, direction, coordination, and       performance of historical research and empirical analysis for       voting rights litigation, including the identification of       appropriate expert witnesses to appear for the government at       trial. In some instances, I was asked to provide written or       courtroom testimony on behalf of the United States. Since       retiring from government service, I have served as an expert       in several voting rights cases brought by private plaintiffs.        I received B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of       Virginia in 1965 and 1966, respectively, and obtained my       Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1972. My primary training       was in the history of the United States, with a       specialization in the history of the South during the 19th       and 20th centuries. For 20 years I taught courses in my       specialization at the University of Minnesota, Vanderbilt       University, and the University of South Alabama. In 1998-99 I       took leave from the Department of Justice to serve as the       Eugene Lang Professor of Social Change in the Department of       Political Science at Swarthmore College. For the last       fourteen years, both during government service and since       retiring from the Department of Justice, I have co-taught a       course on voting rights law as an adjunct professor at the       George Washington University Law School.        I have published a prize-winning book, Abraham Lincoln and       Reconstruction: The Louisiana Experiment (Princeton, N.J.,       Princeton University Press, 1978), six law review articles,       seven articles in refereed journals, and seven chapters in       refereed books. Over the last three and a half decades my       published work has focused on the history of discriminatory       election laws in the South, evidence concerning       discriminatory intent or racially polarized voting presented       in the context of voting rights litigation, and the impact of       the Voting Rights Act in the South. One of these studies was       made part of the record before Congress regarding the       adoption of the 2006 Voting Rights Reauthorization Act. I       continued to publish scholarly work in my areas of expertise       while employed by the Department of Justice and expect to       continue my scholarly writing now that I have retired from       government service. A detailed record of my professional       qualifications is set forth in the attached curriculum vitae       (Attachment 1), which I prepared and know to be accurate.        Although I write about the history of voting rights law in       my scholarly publications and teach in a law school, I am not       an attorney. However, the findings reflected in court       opinions often provide valuable evidence for investigations       by experts. I routinely utilize the factual evidence provided       by court decisions in my scholarly writing. As I observed in       a recent journal article: ``The factual evidence presented in       court proceedings--in voting rights cases key evidence often       comes in through expert witness testimony by political       scientists or historians--is an invaluable resource for       historical and social science research.''            the methodology i have employed in this investigation         Identifying final judgments in reported cases--and Section       5 objections interposed by the Attorney General--was my first       task. In my files I already had both hard copies and       electronic copies of many of the Section 2 cases from 1982 to       the present, and of the voting rights cases decided under the       14th Amendment before the amendment of Section 2 in 1982. I       utilized the detailed study by Professor Ellen Katz and her       students at the University of Michigan Law School, which       became part of the record before Congress for the 2006       Reauthorization Act (and subsequently published as a law       review article). The website of the Civil Rights Division's       Voting Section--where I worked for 26 years--gave ready       access to the large number of final judgments and settlement       documents in cases involving the United States (under Section       2, Section 4(e), Section 5, Section 11(b), and Section 203).       Access to Westlaw through GW Law School facilitated       identification of other reported decisions brought on behalf       of private plaintiffs that I counted as violations. The       Voting Section's website also included links to all the       Attorney General's Section 5 objections from the 1960s       through the Shelby County decision in 2013.        Identifying consent decrees and other settlements in voting       rights cases was perhaps the most time-consuming part of the       investigation. The library resources of GW Law School gave me       access to LexisNexis Court Link, a database with a       comprehensive collection of dockets from voting rights       litigation. This was the same database I had used to identify       settlement documents in my 2010 declaration in Shelby County       v. Holder (cited in Note 2 above). Many Court Link dockets       included links to electronic copies of consent decrees,       consent orders, and other settlement documents. Where no       links were available through Court Link, I had to pursue       further research to locate the needed evidence of violations       (for which the internet proved invaluable). Numerous publicly       available reports and scholarly publications also helped       document court-ordered settlements of voting rights lawsuits.        I expect to finalize a more detailed report to the Brennan       Center and the Leadership Conference soon. In my testimony       today, however, I will summarize my findings and attach a       listing of each violation. I hope the subcommittee finds this       testimony useful in considering how to proceed with the VRAA.                                   findings         Let me begin by focusing on the eight states that--      according to my analysis--are most likely to be subject to       preclearance of voting changes. Recall that under my working       understanding of the coverage formula, an entire state would       be subject to preclearance if either of two patterns of       violations applied: a) if 15 or more voting rights violations       occurred within the state during the previous 25 years; or b)       if 10 or more violations occurred in the state, at least one       of which was committed by the state itself, rather than by       local political subdivisions within the state. I treated as a       violation, based on the last VRAA: a) a final judgment       that a jurisdiction has violated the 14th or 15th       Amendments, violated a provision of the Voting Rights Act,       or been denied preclearance by a three-judge federal       district court in the District of Columbia; b) an       objection to voting changes by the Attorney General; or c)       a consent decree or other settlement in a lawsuit where       the defendants agreed to change the challenged election       practice at issue in a manner that was favorable to       minority plaintiffs. The exhibits summarize the number and       type of violations that in my analysis would require       federal preclearance of states if the current version of       the coverage formula were enacted into law. Those states       are Alabama, Florida,  [[Page H4435]]       Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South       Carolina, and Texas. Exhibit 1 identifies the violations       in each of these states that I counted.        Although I believe they are likely to be covered, there are       several states that could drop out of coverage depending on       how Congress drafts the bill. Alabama, Florida, North       Carolina, and South Carolina are the closest to the minimum       threshold, so changes that limit what counts as a violation       could drop them below 10 violations. Additionally, shortening       the review period would cause many states to drop out. For       example, if the review period is shortened to 20 years, I       calculate that only Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas would       likely be covered. At 15 years, only Georgia and Texas would       likely qualify. This is not because the other states are       covered only by virtue of ancient violations. To the       contrary, most states I list here would still have numerous       violations in recent years but would not meet the high       numerical threshold under a shorter time period. This high       numerical threshold ensures only states with established       patterns of discrimination are covered, patterns that require       a sufficient review period to capture.        On the other hand, barring wholesale changes to the       coverage formula or review period, I have concluded that       Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas are highly likely       to be covered.        There are also several states that I do not think will be       covered--but they could be, depending on subsequent changes       in the formula. Virginia could meet the threshold of 10       violations where at least one was committed by the state, for       example, if multiple findings of independent violations       within one case are counted as multiple violations, although       I currently calculate that Virginia has only 8 violations.       New York and California are each between 10-15 violations,       but none were committed by the state. If either state were to       commit new violations, it would likely bring the state into       coverage.        As I understand the current formula, even if an entire       state would not be subject to preclearance, any political       subdivision of that state in which three or more violations       occurred in the preceding 25 years would be covered. The       relevant political subdivision under this provision is the       governmental unit responsible for voter registration--in most       instances a county. Five political subdivisions in non-      covered states which have three or more violations--which       would therefore need to preclear voting changes--are itemized       in Exhibit 3. The five counties are: Los Angeles County,       California; Cook County, Illinois; Westchester County, New       York; Cuyahoga County, Ohio; and Northampton County,       Virginia.                                  conclusion         I hope my analysis of the proposed coverage formula is       helpful to the subcommittee's current deliberations. My       testimony today has focused on empirical analysis of court       decisions, Section 5 objections, and consent decrees       favorable to minority voters. For a moment, however, I want       to emphasize the importance of the challenge Congress       currently faces. When the Section 5 preclearance process was       still functional--before June 2013--it was a powerful tool       for protecting minority voting rights. The bill you are       considering can play a key role in confronting current       efforts to limit voter registration and voting by minority       citizens, as well as diluting minority voting strength. Based       on my 41 years of experience in voting rights litigation, I       believe firmly that strengthening enforcement of the Voting       Rights Act is a critical need for our democracy.

The ACLU Voting Rights Project was established in 1965--the       same year that the historic Voting Rights Act (VRA) was       enacted--and has litigated more than 350 cases since that       time. Its mission is to build and defend an accessible,       inclusive, and equitable democracy free from racial       discrimination. The Voting Rights Project's recent docket has       included more than 30 lawsuits last year alone to protect       voters during the 2020 election; a pair of recent cases in       the Supreme Court challenging the last administration's       discriminatory census policies: Department of Commerce v. New       York (successfully challenging an attempt to add a       citizenship question to the 2020 Census), and Trump v. New       York (challenging the exclusion of undocumented immigrants       from the population count used to apportion the House of       Representatives); challenges to voter purges and documentary       proof of citizenship laws; and challenges to other new       omnibus legislation restricting voting rights in states like       Georgia and Montana.        In my capacity as Deputy Directory of the ACLU Voting       Rights Project, I assist in the planning, strategy, and       supervision of the ACLU's voting rights litigation       nationwide, which focuses on ensuring that all Americans have       access to the franchise, and that everyone is equally       represented in our political processes. I recently argued       successfully before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh       Circuit in League of Women Voters of Indiana v. Sullivan, a       case that challenged an Indiana purge program that failed to       follow the procedural safeguards mandated by the National       Voter Registration Act. I am currently litigating or have       litigated numerous cases challenging racially discriminatory       laws under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, including       Sixth District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church v.       Kemp, a challenge to Georgia's sweeping voter suppression law       enacted in the wake of the 2020 elections; Thomas v. Andino,       a challenge to South Carolina's absentee ballot witness       requirement and required ``excuse'' for absentee voting       during the COVID-19 pandemic; MOVE Texas v. Whitley, a       challenge to a discriminatory purge program in Texas;       Missouri State Conference of the NAACP v. Ferguson-Florissant       School District, a challenge to the discriminatory at-large       method of electing school board members; Frank v. Walker, a       challenge to Wisconsin's voter ID law; and North Carolina       State Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory, a challenge to       North Carolina's monster voter suppression law passed in the       immediate aftermath of Shelby County v. Holder.        More than a century ago, the Supreme Court famously       described the right to vote as the one right that is       preservative of all others. As Chief Justice John Roberts has       explained, ``[t]here is no right more basic in our democracy       than the right to participate in electing our political       leaders.'' We are not truly free without self-government,       which requires a vibrant participatory democracy, in which       everyone is treated fairly in the process and equally       represented. Unfortunately, our nation has a long and well-      documented record of fencing out certain voters--Black voters       and other voters of color, in particular--and today that       racial discrimination in voting remains a persistent and       widespread problem.        The landmark Voting Rights Act (``VRA''), one of the       signature achievements of the Civil Rights Movement, has been       critical in the efforts to combat this enduring blight.       Passed initially in 1965, and reauthorized and amended (with       bipartisan support) in 1970, 1975, 1982, 1992, and 2006, it       is one of the most effective pieces of federal civil rights       legislation. But eight years ago, in Shelby County v. Holder,       the Supreme Court struck down the formula used to determine       which jurisdictions were covered by a federal preclearance       regime. This meant that the heart of the VRA--the requirement       that jurisdictions with a long record of voter suppression       submit proposed changes to election laws to federal officials       before they went into effect--functionally ended. After       Shelby County, the main protection afforded by the VRA is       Section 2, which imposes a nationwide ban on the use of any       ``voting qualification or prerequisite to voting . . . which       results in a denial of abridgment of the right of any citizen       of the United States to vote on account of race or color.''       Section 2 provides only post-enactment relief, i.e., it       authorizes challenges that can be brought only after a law       has been passed or a policy implemented.        The inadequacy of Section 2 post-enactment relief as the       principal means to protect against discrimination in voting       cannot be overstated, and the ACLU and other civil rights       organizations have discussed the need for the restoration of       the prophylactic preclearance regime innumerable times. Even       if not sufficient on its own, however, Section 2 remains an       important and necessary tool to protect voting rights, and       its continuing vitality is critical. My written testimony       will focus on three issues that have substantially weakened       the force of post-enactment relief as a bulwark against       discrimination: the standard for obtaining preliminary       injunctive relief in voting rights cases, the use of the so-      called Purcell principle as an additional barrier to relief,       and the Supreme Court's recent decision in Brnovich v.       Democratic National Committee.        The Supreme Court's reasoning in Shelby County in       dismantling preclearance was premised in part on the idea       that plaintiffs could still challenge discriminatory voting       laws under Section 2 and win relief, including preliminary       relief, before an election occurs with a discriminatory       practice in effect. Unfortunately, this premise was deeply       mistaken. Section 2 cases are expensive, difficult to bring,       and frequently take years to litigate to completion--to say       nothing of the meritorious cases that are never brought at       all due to these costs. Theoretically, plaintiffs can win       preliminary relief while a case is being litigated--freezing       the status quo, while the court determines whether an       election practice violates federal law--but this too works       better in theory. In practice, the standard for winning a       preliminary injunction, which includes proving a substantial       likelihood of success on the merits, poses a particularly       high bar to relief in voting rights cases, due to their       complexity and fact-intensive nature. This means that       elections proceed under regimes ultimately found to be       discriminatory, with no way to compensate voters for that       harm, and with the victors of those tainted elections       enacting policy and accruing the benefits of incumbency.        Compounding the problem is the metastasization of the so-      called Purcell principle. Named after a short, unsigned       Supreme Court order from 2006, which reminded courts to       consider the potential confusion that may ensue if court       orders, especially conflicting ones, issue close to an       election, this restatement of common sense has grown into an       almost per se bar used to deny relief in voting cases. Over       the past decade, federal courts have applied Purcell ever       more aggressively, even when the putative concerns of voter       confusion or administrative burden on elections officials       that originally animated the doctrine are wholly absent, and       in a way that tends to work in one direction: against voters       and voting rights. Compounding the issue is the frequent lack       of explanation of a court's reasoning: applications of       Purcell often appear in the form of unsigned orders, leaving       the parties and the voting public with little clarity. In       short, the expansion of Purcell has made the already       difficult task of halting a discriminatory regime before it       can taint an election even harder, blocking relief even where       voting rights plaintiffs are ultimately successful--and even       when they have demonstrated as much early in their case.        Finally, the Supreme Court's recent decision in Brnovich v.       Democratic National Committee will make it significantly more       difficult for voters to bring successful lawsuits to block       discriminatory voting laws under Section 2. Under the guise       of interpreting the statute, the Supreme Court articulated       five ``guideposts'' that will inevitably make showing a       discriminatory burden more difficult for Plaintiffs, while       putting a thumb on the scale for government defendants by       allowing for the mere specter of voter fraud--without any       evidence--to justify discriminatory practices.        Fortunately, for all three of these issues, Congress has       the power to act to protect voting rights. It has the clear       authority to set standards for the issuance of preliminary       relief and injunctions in voting rights cases, and the clear       ability to correct the misinterpretation of the VRA contained       within Brnovich. Not only does Congress have the power to do       so, it also has the responsibility. Under both the Fourteenth       and Fifteenth Amendments, which promise equal protection       under the law and the right to vote free of racial       discrimination, respectively, Congress is expressly       authorized--and given the duty--to make these guarantees       real. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act       (``JLVRAA''), which passed the House of Representatives in       the 116th Congress, with additions to address the explosive       growth of Purcell in the 2020 election cycle and repair the       damage to Section 2 wrought by the recent Brnovich decision,       would fight the serious threats to voting rights that we see       today.      I. The Standard for Obtaining Preliminary Injunctive Relief        Following Shelby County, Section 2 of the VRA is the heart       of federal protections for the right to vote. Unlike the       VRA's preclearance regime, which applies before a law goes       into effect, a Section 2 claim can only be brought after a       law is already enacted or a policy announced. In the paradigm       course of civil litigation, plaintiffs will file a lawsuit,       and then after a trial on the merits, a court will impose       money damages or issue  [[Page H4439]]       an injunction, i.e., an order to take or forebear from taking       some action. Commonly in civil rights litigation, these       injunctions bar a government actor from enforcing a law found       to violate civil rights law or the U.S. Constitution. Thus,       under Section 2 plaintiffs must go to court and litigate       their claims--a process that costs hundreds of thousands, if       not millions, of dollars and often takes years--before a       judge will strike down the law or order the practice stopped.       In the interim, the law or practice remains in effect. In the       context of voting rights litigation, this means multiple       elections involving hundreds of elected officials may be       irrevocably tainted by taking place under a discriminatory       regime.        In some circumstances, however, plaintiffs can move for a       preliminary injunction, which is an order that preserves the       status quo while the lawsuit plays out. But these are       particularly difficult to win in voting rights cases. One       prong of the standard for the issuance of a preliminary       injunction is a showing of substantial likelihood of success       on the merits. This standard makes sense in many contexts:       before a court acts, prior to a full hearing of the evidence       at trial or a settlement, it should be confident that it has       a good basis to do so. But the difficulties in obtaining       preliminary relief under this standard in the voting rights       context have imperiled the ability to protect voters from       being irrevocably harmed by discriminatory electoral regimes.        Voting rights cases are extremely complex and fact       intensive, which is reflected in the significant expense in       money and time required to litigate these cases successfully.       And courts have required voting rights plaintiffs to make a       substantial showing of this full panoply of proof in order to       meet the likelihood of success on the merits standard before       it will grant preliminary relief. This is incredibly       difficult to do in a truncated time period, not least because       voting rights cases frequently involve extensive statistical       analysis of voting patterns and practices and plaintiffs have       limited access to the information necessary to meet this       showing. As a result, regimes that are ultimately found to be       discriminatory can irrevocably taint an election even where       plaintiffs do whatever they can to prevent that from       happening.        My prior written testimony before this subcommittee       identifies 15 Section 2 cases, brought after the Shelby       County decision, where plaintiffs sought a preliminary       injunction unsuccessfully--only to go on to win at trial or       reach a favorable settlement. On average, those cases took 27       months to litigate to the grant of relief (to say nothing of       unsuccessful appeals and disputes over attorneys' fees). In       the interim, multiple elections took place, millions of       voters cast ballots, and hundreds of elected officials took       office, under regimes courts ultimately found were       discriminatory or that were abandoned. For example, in a case       the ACLU and partners brought challenging an omnibus voter       suppression bill, North Carolina NAACP v. McCrory, despite       plaintiffs moving as quickly as possible and seeking a       preliminary injunction, voters in North Carolina chose 188       federal and state elected officials under election rules that       would be subsequently struck down.        The deficiencies of litigation, with the difficulty of       securing preliminary relief, are particularly acute in the       voting rights context because voting is different than other       civil rights litigation. In cases of employment or housing       discrimination based on membership in a protected class, at       least in theory, going through the legal process can restore       that person's job or apartment, or make them whole through       backpay or money damages. Elections are different: once an       election transpires under a discriminatory regime, it is       impossible to compensate the victims of voting       discrimination. Their voting rights have been compromised       irrevocably because the election has already happened and       cannot be re-run. While those voters may be able to freely       vote in future elections, winners of the elections conducted       under unlawful practices gain the benefits of incumbency,       making it harder to dislodge them from office. Those elected       officials will make policy while in office, and courts cannot       (and should not) dislodge those decisions, even if the       mechanism under which they took office is later found to be       unconstitutional or to violate the VRA.        The JLVRAA appropriately addresses these particular       challenges by creating a standard for the issuance of       preliminary relief in voting rights cases. First, plaintiffs       must ``raise[] a serious question'' as to whether the       challenged practice violates the VRA or the U.S.       Constitution. This standard appropriately seeks to balance       the needed prophylactic measures to protect the right to vote       without inviting frivolous litigation. Then, the court must       find that the hardship imposed on the defendant (generally a       government actor) is less than the hardship imposed on the       plaintiff (the voter), giving ``due weight to the fundamental       right to cast an effective ballot.'' This further ensures       that courts are not compelled to issue injunctions at the       drop of the hat: they must keep in mind, in addition to       whether the claims are meritorious, whether the relief would       be burdensome on the defendant.        Congress has the clear power to act here. The general       standard for issuing preliminary injunctions is a judicial       creation, which over time has developed from equitable       principles into a four-pronged test familiar to lawyers and       judges. However, the Supreme Court has made it clear--      repeatedly and unequivocally--that Congress has the authority       to alter the considerations for granting equitable relief,       which includes the issuance of injunctions. The Court has       further explicitly recognized that this reasoning covers       preliminary relief, and that Congress can even make the       issuance of certain injunctions automatic--an extreme measure       compared to the much more modest one contained in the JLVRAA.       In other words, ``Congress may intervene and guide or control       the exercise of the courts' discretion''--as long as it does       so clearly. This reasoning has been applied in federal court       cases acknowledging--and upholding--the legislatively       modified standard for the issuance of preliminary       injunctions. These cases interpret federal laws such as the       Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, Endangered Species Act,       National Labor Relations Act, Federal Trade Commission Act,       and the Securities Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934. All of       which is to say: there is a long-running history and       unambiguous precedent blessing Congress' ability to specify       the conditions under which a preliminary injunction issues.      II. The Purcell Principle        The current standard for obtaining a preliminary injunction       makes it difficult enough for plaintiffs to ensure that       discriminatory regimes are blocked before they can taint an       election. But the problem has worsened due to the expansion       of the so-called ``Purcell principle.'' As described in more       detail in my prior testimony, the Purcell principle stood at       one point for the commonsense idea that courts should be       cautious in issuing orders which change election rules in the       period right before an election. In recent years, however,       the use of Purcell to block relief has skyrocketed and the       doctrine has become something much broader, bearing little       resemblance to the guidance given in the brief, unsigned       order that is its namesake. The Purcell of today displaces       the case-specific analysis required for injunctions and       operates as an almost per se bar on granting relief in       voting rights cases, in some (nebulously defined) period       before an election. This has real effects: as outlined in       my prior testimony, injunctions are frequently blocked by       Purcell, even in cases where plaintiffs ultimately to go       on--after the lengthy process of litigation--to win       relief. The use of Purcell is only expanding, and left       unchecked, it threatens to kneecap voting rights       litigation nationwide.        First, Purcell today is invoked even when there is no risk       of voter confusion, zero or minimal administrative burden,       and where plaintiffs have acted quickly. An illustrative       example is Republican National Committee v. Democratic       National Committee. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread,       Wisconsin saw a last-minute deluge of absentee ballot       applications for primary elections held April 7, 2020, and       elections officials struggled to process them quickly.       Finding that the requirement for a witness signature as       applied to a subset of voters and the absentee ballot receipt       deadline were likely unconstitutional under the       circumstances, the court preliminarily enjoined the witness       requirement for those voters and extended the absentee ballot       receipt deadline by six days, requiring the state to count       ballots so long as they were received by April 13th (even if       postmarked after Election Day). Although elections officials       did not contest the injunction, private intervenors won       partial stays of the injunction at the Seventh Circuit (as to       the witness signature) and the Supreme Court (as to the       postmark requirement), with both courts relying on Purcell.       There was, however, no risk of voter confusion: voters were       merely waiting to receive their ballot, and the district       court's order would merely allow it to be counted. Nor was       there risk of administrative burden: instead, elections       officials had a few extra days to process an unprecedented       number of absentee ballot applications. Indeed, the two       applications of Purcell themselves imposed additional burdens       on elections officials--during the first weeks of an       unprecedented, deadly pandemic--and created the chaotic,       confusing dynamic that Purcell theoretically counsels       against. My prior written testimony includes several other       examples that, taken together, show how the Purcell principle       has been used to block relief frequently in cases where the       stated concerns of the Purcell decision itself--the need to       avoid confusing voters and imposing burdens on election       officials and the election system--are not present.        Second, the use of the Purcell principle appears to apply       primarily in one direction only: to bar efforts to expand       access to the ballot. Here, the cases in which Purcell does       not apply can be just as revealing as the situations in which       it does. For example, in Minnesota in the lead-up to the 2020       general election, voting rights plaintiffs and state       officials entered into a consent decree in state court that       allowed all ballots postmarked on or before Election Day, and       received within seven days after, to be counted. In Carson v.       Simon, a new set of plaintiffs sued, seeking a preliminary       injunction blocking implementation of the consent decree on       September 24--almost eight weeks after the decree was       entered--which was denied on October 12. On appeal, the       Eighth Circuit reversed, enjoining the state court order and       therefore moving up the absentee ballot deadline, in an       opinion issued five days before the general election. It is       hard to imagine a situation where Purcell is more applicable:       here, the requested order came at the eleventh hour, risked a       great deal of voter confusion, and imposed serious       administrative burdens as  [[Page H4440]]       state officials subsequently struggled to comply with the new       ballot receipt deadline. Nevertheless, the court declined to       apply Purcell. Other examples demonstrating this one-      directional application are described in my prior written       testimony.        Third, in some instances, too, appeals courts invoking       Purcell to stay relief granted by a district court (and the       increasing regularity of such stays) create the very voter       confusion and administrative burdens that the Purcell       principle in theory aims to avoid. For example, in Frank v.       Walker, the district court issued a preliminary injunction       against Wisconsin's voter ID law, and nearly 12,000 absentee       ballots were mailed to voters without instructions on       providing identification, hundreds of which were cast without       the required documents. The Seventh Circuit stayed this       order, without any mention of the voters who were merely       following instructions given to them by the state;       fortunately, the Supreme Court lifted the stay. But as       elections have become increasingly litigated, and Purcell has       become an increasingly prominent doctrine, these situations       will reoccur. Most concerningly, in a 2020 challenge to South       Carolina's absentee ballot witness requirement, the Supreme       Court stayed an injunction that had been affirmed by the en       banc Fourth Circuit, with three members of the Supreme Court       expressing the view that any votes that had already been cast       in reliance on the injunction should not be counted. It       should be beyond debate that voters who merely relied in good       faith on instructions from elections officials in casting       their ballots should not be disenfranchised due to Purcell.        Finally, all these problems are exacerbated by the fact       that in Purcell-based orders, courts have frequently failed       to explain their decisions; instead, the parties and the       public are made to guess at basic parameters of the doctrine,       such as how long the relevant period is, what counts as an       election rule, and how to factor in voters' reliance       interests. Typically, orders in federal courts follow full       briefing, oral argument (as need be), and judicial research       and drafting, a process which can often take months. The       product of this is a reasoned opinion that assures the       parties that their arguments got a fair hearing and provides       guidance as to the rules of the road going forward. Purcell       departs sharply from this practice, and in fact, the       development of the principle occurred almost entirely in a       series of four unsigned orders in the 2014 election. These       brief orders provide little guidance to voters or       litigations--and feed speculation that decisions are based on       political concerns. While the exigent nature of election       cases may sometimes leave courts with little time to craft a       lengthy opinion, courts can always issue an order and follow       up with an opinion explaining their reasoning. Instead, the       lack of written opinions means there is no way to ensure the       Purcell principle is being applied consistently--or even       define what the Purcell principle is.        As with the preliminary injunction standard, Congress'       ability to act here is clear. The manner under which       injunctions issue, the concerns courts should take into       consideration (and those they should not), and the way to       weigh competing interests are all matters within Congress'       power to define. In the context of Purcell, this could look       like defining a specific, measurable period in which changes       are disfavored, for legitimate reasons--to avoid the Purcell       window growing ever larger and even more unmoored from its       foundations. Congress could also clearly state the public's       interest in ensuring free and fair access to the ballot, and       how that interest should be weighed against administrative       concerns. It could specify exactly what forms of voter       confusion courts should keep in mind and how to best minimize       that confusion. Finally, it could provide guidance to courts       reflecting the reality that sometimes, unforeseen events--      whether an unprecedented pandemic or the actions of elections       officials--occur and that this is no reason to abdicate their       responsibility to safeguard the constitutional right to vote.      III. Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee and Potential           Fixes        On July 1, 2021, the Supreme Court released its decision in       Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, and in doing so,       weakened federal protections for voting rights even further.       The case concerned two Arizona restrictions that had a       disproportionate impact on Native American and other       communities of color, and which the plaintiffs challenged as       violating Section 2: a ban on the collection of early ballots       and a rule mandating that ballots cast in person at the wrong       precinct be discarded entirely, rather than counted for the       offices for which that voter is eligible to vote. In the       decision, reversing an en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit       striking down the two requirements under Section 2, the       Supreme Court set out five so-called ``guideposts''--      untethered to the actual text of the statute--in assessing       Section 2 claims. The decision and these guideposts will make       it harder to bring successful Section 2 claims.        The Court's decision in Brnovich undermines the purpose of       Section 2 to provide a powerful tool to root out       discrimination in voting--no matter how blunt or subtle--in       numerous ways. But broadly speaking, the Court's decision did       two things to make it harder to bring successful Section 2       claims.        First, the Court ratcheted up the bar for plaintiffs to       establish a discriminatory burden on the right to vote.       Section 2 calls for an inquiry based on ``the totality of the       circumstances,'' into whether ``political processes . . . are       not equally open'' to people of color--or, in other words,       whether a practice imposes a burden on voters of color.       Brnovich introduced into this inquiry whether the burden       imposed by a challenged practice is, in a court's view, akin       to the ``usual burdens of voting,'' finding those to be       essentially per se permissible under Section 2. Absent from       the analysis is a discussion of whether the so-called       ``usual'' burdens of voting are equally burdensome to all       voters, particularly to voters of different racial groups.       Though the decision refers to ``mere inconvenience,'' the       difficulty of, say, driving to a mail box is very different       on a remote Native American reservation where residents do       not receive postal service at their doors, and are also       much less likely to have access to cars than it is for       other voters. The Court also found relevant ``the degree       to which a voting rule departs from what was standard       practice . . . in 1982.'' But this ignores that the       reauthorization of the VRA in 1982, just as in 1965, was       motivated by a desire to change state election rules and       eradicate the racially discriminatory measures that       remained--not grandfather them into law. By introducing       these irrelevant considerations into the Section 2       analysis, Brnovich will make it more difficult for       plaintiffs to prove their cases.        Second, the Court also ratcheted down the bar for       jurisdictions to defend restrictions on voting with a       disparate impact. In particular, Brnovich imports into this       inquiry--without any grounding in text or history--a state's       asserted interest in preventing election fraud, even when       wholly unsubstantiated with actual evidence, which it       gratuitously referred to as ``strong and entirely       legitimate,'' before concluding that rules justified with       reference to these interests are ``less likely to violate       Sec.  2.'' The lower court in Brnovich found the offered       justification of voter fraud for the ban on ballot       collection--particularly important to Native American       communities, who often lack adequate transportation or       regular postal service--to be tenuous, due to the utter       absence of voter fraud in Arizona. On this point, the Supreme       Court again disagreed, and went further: holding that states       are under no obligation to provide any evidence of an actual       history or risk of fraud within their borders, or to show how       a challenged rule actually would prevent election fraud.        Fortunately, Brnovich was a decision based on a statutory       interpretation, rather than a constitutional holding. This       means Congress can correct the Court's misinterpretation of       Section 2 and restore the VRA's full protections against       discrimination in voting. We urge Congress to add such a       legislative response to the JLVRAA.        At a minimum, any efforts to respond to Brnovich should       make clear that any voting practice that interacts with       historical and socioeconomic factors to result in       discrimination against voters of color runs afoul of Section       2. This is the case whether or not the practice existed or       was widespread in 1982, or any other year. Further, whether       or not a court finds a burden to be one of the so-called       ``usual'' burdens of voting should not factor into the       analysis. A voting practice could well be a mere       inconvenience for some voters, but a serious burden for       others, to the point where they cannot meet it and are thus       disenfranchised.        Any statutory language addressing Brnovich should also       directly give courts guidance on how to weigh racially       discriminatory burdens against state arguments that a measure       is necessary to protect election integrity. Congress must       establish that jurisdictions must do more than simply       articulate unsubstantiated fears to justify discriminatory       restrictions on voting. If a law imposes a discriminatory       burden on voters of color, jurisdictions should, at a       minimum, be required to submit evidence that the restriction       actually advances a particular and important governmental       interest. But the analysis should not end there: voters       should also be allowed to prove how the challenged measure is       pretextual or how there are alternative means to get at the       same goal--without imposing the same racially discriminatory       burden.        There are different ways Congress can do this. Congress       could, for example, adopt an approach that codifies the       relevant factors (e.g., the practice's interaction with       historical and socioeconomic factors), and non-relevant       factors (e.g., whether the practice existed in 1982). It       could also adopt a burden-shifting approach modeled on the       frameworks for addressing employment discrimination in Title       VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965 or housing discrimination       in the Fair Housing Act, which could give guidance to courts       as to what evidence a state needs to support an asserted       interest, and how to weigh that interest against evidence of       a discriminatory result. But Congress should act to restore       Section 2 to the powerful weapon to combat discrimination       that it was intended to be.                                  Conclusion         For each of these three issues--the difficulty winning       preliminary relief, the aggressive expansion of Purcell, and       the misinterpretation of Section 2 in Brnovich--there is a       common thread: Congress has the power to act. Congress has       clear authority to set the standards for the issuance of       preliminary relief and has repeatedly done so in numerous       federal statutes to address different contexts. The JLVRAA       would make preliminary injunctions available if plaintiffs       raise  [[Page H4441]]       ``a serious question'' as to the merits, which would act as a       prophylactic to safeguard the right to vote, and is       appropriate given the impossibility of remedying voting       discrimination after the fact. Congress further has the power       to define the public interest to include the public's       interest in representative government, elected by the       broadest swath of eligible voters possible, and to provide       guidance to federal courts on the period in which election-      related injunctions can be issued. And finally, Congress has       the unquestioned authority to clarify its intent and fix       erroneous interpretations of its laws, such as the recent       Brnovich decision. In fact, the current version of Section 2       was enacted by Congress in 1982 to respond directly to a       Supreme Court case that similarly misgauged Congress'       meaning. The 1982 amendments to Section 2 thus provides a       model for Congress to act again to ensure that voting rights       are subject to robust protections consistent with this body's       intent.        These amendments to the VRA are not merely within Congress'       power--they are its responsibility. The Fourteenth and       Fifteenth Amendments, which respectively guarantee the right       to due process and equal protection under the law and the       right to vote without discrimination based on race, expressly       give Congress the power to enforce their guarantees. This is       no accident: the Reconstruction Amendments were passed in the       wake of a Civil War which was in part precipitated by a       Supreme Court decision. The drafters of the amendments were       well aware that the responsibility to protect voting rights       could not be left entirely with the court system, and       therefore purposely gave this duty to Congress. Although this       country has made incredible progress since the enactment of       those amendments, this obligation is ongoing. When other       institutions tasked with protecting constitutional rights,       such as courts and state governments, fail to do so, this       body has the responsibility to intervene.        I thank you again for the opportunity to testify in front       of this subcommittee on these issues.                                   ____   Testimony of Wendy Weiser, Vice President for Democracy at the Brennan                  Center for Justice at NYU School of Law    HEARING ON OVERSIGHT OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT: POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE   REFORMS BEFORE THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, SUBCOMMITTEE ON     THE CONSTITUTION, CIVIL RIGHTS, AND CIVIL LIBERTIES IN THE UNITED              STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES--AUGUST 16, 2021         Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of       strengthening the Voting Rights Act (``VRA''), a law that has       played a critical role in safeguarding American democracy       against pernicious, persistent threats of discrimination in       the election system. The Brennan Center for Justice at NYU       School of Law strongly supports this Committee's efforts to       restore and revitalize the VRA, through the John Lewis Voting       Rights Advancement Act (``VRAA'').        The VRA is widely considered the most successful civil       rights legislation in our nation's history. Unfortunately,       the Supreme Court has seriously hampered its effectiveness.       First, in Shelby County v. Holder, the Court rendered       inoperable the law's preclearance provisions, which had       stopped many discriminatory voting practices from ever going       into effect in selected jurisdictions with a history of       discrimination. More recently, in Brnovich v. DNC, the Court       sharply limited voters' ability to challenge discriminatory       practices under the nationwide protections against voting       discrimination in Section 2 of the law. Although these       decisions have seriously wounded the VRA, they also make       clear that Congress has the power to restore and bolster the       law.        The need to strengthen the VRA is especially urgent now, as       a decade's worth of efforts to restrict voting rights have       reached a fever pitch. As I previously testified, states       across the country are rapidly passing new laws rolling back       voting access--many of them targeting voters of color. These       new laws are being implemented on top of a host of other       discriminatory voting practices that have been put in place       or attempted in recent years. We are also headed into a       redistricting cycle, following last week's release of Census       data, that is expected to be characterized by racial       discrimination and severe gerrymandering targeting       communities of color.        The VRAA is designed to address these current problems and       meet current needs, while taking account of the concerns the       Supreme Court identified with the 2006 reauthorization of the       law. I submit this testimony to supplement the record of       persistent race discrimination in voting that creates the       need for the VRAA, and to explain how the VRAA is an       appropriate, carefully tailored exercise of congressional       authority to combat that discrimination.      I. New Evidence that Race Discrimination in Voting, and its           Effects, Persist        Despite the progress made in the decades following the       VRA's initial enactment, race discrimination in voting is       still a very real--and in some places a growing--problem. The       record this Committee has amassed in recent months, including       evidence submitted by the Brennan Center, shows overwhelming       evidence of contemporary voting discrimination. While the       evidence shows that race discrimination in voting is       widespread, it also shows that it is especially powerful and       persistent in certain geographic areas, including in a number       of states that were previously covered by Section 5 of the       VRA because of their past histories of discrimination in       voting.        Our recent and forthcoming research provides even more       evidence of the impact and persistence of discrimination in       voting, underscoring the acute need for the VRAA.        A. Persistent Racial Turnout Gaps        A recently published analysis by the Brennan Center's Kevin       Morris and Coryn Grange demonstrates that turnout among       nonwhite voters remains significantly lower than that among       white voters. Even with record overall turnout in the 2020       election, there was a significant turnout gap between white       and nonwhite voters. Overall, 70.9 percent of eligible white       voters cast ballots in the 2020 election, compared to only       58.4 percent of nonwhite voters. In fact, as the graph       below--reproduced from the Brennan Center's published       analysis--demonstrates, the turnout gap between white and       nonwhite voters has gone virtually unchanged since 2014, and       it has grown since its modern-era lows in 2008 and 2012. And       even when the gap between Black and white voters was       closing--a trend that has sadly reversed course in recent       years--Latino and Asian American voters lagged far behind       their white counterparts in participation. (This is true of       Native American voters as well, though their numbers are too       small for inclusion in the census data.)        While our research does not examine whether or the extent       to which voter suppression efforts caused this gap to       persist--and at some points, widen--it does demonstrate that       the temporary closure of the Black-white voting gap in 2008       and 2012 was anomalous. This is particularly significant in       light of the Shelby County Court's reliance on evidence that       this gap had supposedly closed by 2013 to question Congress's       justification for preclearance.        B. Larger Turnout Gaps in Previously Covered Jurisdictions        According to more recent census data, described in a       forthcoming Brennan Center analysis by Coryn Grange, Peter       Miller, and Kevin Morris, the racial turnout gaps are even       starker in the states likely to be subject to preclearance       under the VRAA. In recent years, white voter turnout has       vastly exceeded nonwhite turnout in virtually every state       previously subject to preclearance, and in some areas, the       progress made in the decades leading up to Shelby County has       all but vanished.        Our analysis finds that, after hitting historic lows       immediately before Shelby County in 2012, the white-Black       turnout gap has significantly grown in almost every state       previously covered by the VRA. In South Carolina, for       example, the white-Black turnout gap has grown by 21       percentage points since 2012, to 15 percent. In Texas and       Virginia, the gap has grown by 13 percentage points, to 11       percent and 13 percent, respectively. In Louisiana, the gap       has grown by 11 percentage points, to 7 percent. And in North       Carolina, which was not covered in its entirety but had a       number of covered political subdivisions, the gap has grown       by 17 percentage points, to 3 percent. These are dramatic       shifts in only eight years. In most of the states mentioned       here, the turnout gap between Black and white voters grew       from a slight gap in favor of Black voters to a significant       gap in favor of white voters.        The data also indicates that the post-Shelby County racial       turnout gaps are more than a Black and white issue. The total       white-nonwhite turnout gap has grown since 2012 in five of       the eight states likely to be covered under the VRAA. And the       racial turnout gap is especially large for Hispanics. In       Georgia and Virginia, for example, the non-Hispanic white-      Hispanic turnout gap was 26 percentage points in 2020. In       Texas, it was 19 percentage points.        C. Discriminatory Voting Barriers in 2020        In addition to a growing turnout gap among white and       nonwhite voters, the 2020 election saw a proliferation of       discriminatory voting barriers. A forthcoming report by the       Brennan Center's Will Wilder catalogs the wide range of       barriers, disparate burdens, and discrimination voters of       color faced during the 2020 election cycle. These included       new restrictive voting laws, racially discriminatory voter       roll purges, disparities in mail delivery and in mail ballot       processing times that were exacerbated by the Covid-19       pandemic, long lines and closed polling places, racially-      targeted voter intimidation, and targeted misinformation       campaigns.        Perhaps more than in any other year in recent history,       elected officials and political operatives were direct about       their intentions to shrink the electorate in 2020, at times       with explicit or thinly-veiled references to race. These       statements of discriminatory intent are important context       for the range of discriminatory results seen in 2020.        As we have previously testified, the push to disenfranchise       voters of color continued after the election, as the Trump       campaign and others filed frivolous lawsuits aimed at tossing       out the votes of Black voters in urban centers and other       voters of color. This litigation and the lies used to justify       it helped spur on violent attacks on the Capitol. The same       lies laid the rhetorical groundwork for a new wave of       restrictive voting legislation this year unlike anything we       have seen since the VRA's enactment in 1965. Our most up-to-      date research shows  [[Page H4442]]       that 18 states enacted 30 new laws restricting access to       voting between January 1 and July 14, 2021.        D. Discriminatory Plans to Reduce Representation        The Brennan Center's recent report, ``Representation for       Some,'' authored by Yurij Rudensky et al., offers additional       evidence of the growing risk of race discrimination in       voting. This study analyzes the impact of a voting change       that is being pushed in a number of states--namely, the       exclusion of non-citizens and children under 18 from the       population base used to draw electoral districts. Using data       from Texas, Georgia, and Missouri, the report finds that       adopting an adult citizen redistricting base would have a       substantial and disparate effect on communities of color,       particular Latino communities.        While to date no state has adopted an adult citizen       redistricting base, these findings are relevant to Congress's       inquiry because there is an ongoing effort to adopt such a       change, including in states that were previously subject to       preclearance and would likely be covered under the VRAA. This       change is being pursued with the express knowledge that its       principal impact would be to disadvantage communities and       voters of color. For example, Thomas Hofeller, a prominent       conservative redistricting strategist who helped draw maps       after the 2010 census in Alabama, Florida, North Carolina,       and Texas that were later struck down by courts as       discriminatory, indicated in a memo shared with conservative       strategists that changing the apportionment base would be       ``advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.'' The       substantial risk that states and localities will adopt a       discriminatory adult citizen redistricting base further       underscores the need for robust protections under the Voting       Rights Act.      II. The VRAA's Preclearance Provisions Effectively Target the           Problem of Voting Discrimination        The VRAA's preclearance provisions are well designed to       target the persistent problem of voting discrimination in a       manner consistent with constitutional requirements. The bill       includes a coverage formula that will effectively remedy and       deter illegal discrimination without casting the net so       widely that it imposes burdens on jurisdictions where       ordinary litigation is sufficient to stop discrimination. It       does so by carefully targeting coverage to jurisdictions and       conduct where discrimination is most prevalent, reflecting       current conditions and recent historical experience, as the       original formula did in 1965. It introduces a geographic       coverage formula that triggers only in jurisdictions with       recent histories of verifiable voting discrimination. It also       establishes limited nationwide preclearance for certain       practices that have been used frequently to discriminate       against voters of color.        A. The VRA's Preclearance Provisions Are Necessary and             Warranted        These preclearance provisions are well justified by the       extensive record before Congress.        First, the record before Congress makes clear that       preclearance is, unfortunately, still necessary to root out       persistent discrimination. As we have previously testified       (and as the Supreme Court previously recognized), litigation       is emphatically not enough to prevent discrimination where it       is repeated; preclearance is necessary. Litigation is costly,       slow, and often allows discriminatory rules to govern pending       a decision. In some cases, like our recently completed       lawsuit challenging Texas's strict voter ID law, multiple       elections occur under discriminatory practices before a       judicial resolution alters or eliminates them. A favorable       decision in such a case cannot un-suppress lost votes,       reallocate spent resources, or restore confidence in citizens       whose efforts to register and vote were wrongfully denied.       Preclearance, by comparison, is a fast process that prevents       certain discriminatory measures from taking effect in the       first place. The pre-Shelby regime showed the effectiveness       of cutting off discriminatory laws and practices at the pass       rather than leaving citizens to pick up the burden of       challenging them. The last eight years have shown the harm       that can be done without the specter of preclearance       deterring and blocking harmful laws. Indeed, in many       jurisdictions, as soon as a discriminatory law or practice       was successfully challenged, the legislature or other public       officials took steps to put another voting restriction in its       place. As voting barriers have proliferated, so have voting       rights lawsuits, reaching unprecedented highs in recent       years. Without congressional action, this trend shows no       signs of abating.        Second, the record before Congress shows the importance of       applying preclearance to elections at the federal, state, and       local levels. Discriminatory laws and practices do not just       plague federal elections. They also exist in school board,       county commission, and state house elections, as the       extensive testimony compiled by Professor Peyton McCrary       shows. These elections have significant consequences; they       can determine issues ranging from the educational resources       provided to minority voters' children to whether       representatives of minority communities are present at the       redistricting table. Unless all eligible voters are able to       participate in all elections free from discrimination, our       society is not achieving the promise of equal justice for       all.        Third, as discussed below, the record before Congress       supports the application of a geographic coverage formula to       target jurisdictions where voting discrimination is most       rampant. And while I do not cover this in my testimony, I       believe that the record also supports a practice-based       trigger to target practices that are frequently applied to       discriminate against minority voters. Requiring preclearance       for certain voting practices that are known to be inherently       discriminatory is an effective way to target the VRAA as       efficiently as possible at the worst forms of discrimination.        B. The VRAA's Geographic Coverage Formula Is Well Designed             to Target and Root Out Rampant Discrimination        While discrimination in voting is widespread overall, the       record before this Committee shows that certain jurisdictions       tend to perpetrate voting discrimination much more than       others. It is therefore appropriate for Congress to include a       geographic-based trigger for preclearance so as to focus       remedial attention on the places where discrimination is       persistent and pervasive.        The VRAA's geographic coverage formula is effectively       designed to target places where discrimination is recent,       widespread, and persistent.        i. The formula relies on the best evidence of       discrimination. The formula identifies those jurisdictions       where the problem of discrimination is the greatest by       focusing on the best evidence for determining where there is       a problem to remedy: a jurisdiction's recent violations of       laws prohibiting race discrimination. Specifically, the VRAA       looks to law violations reflected in court orders, DOJ       objection letters, or settlements that were either entered by       a court or contained an admission of liability and lead to a       change in voting practices. The volume of litigation in and       of itself is a probative way to identify where persistent       discrimination is taking place; where a jurisdiction is       repeatedly discriminating against its citizens, one would       expect those citizens to file repeated lawsuits.        But the mere filing of a lawsuit is not enough to trigger       coverage under the VRAA; there must also be formal findings       that a violation occurred. In other words, the bill looks to       objective indicia that discrimination actually occurred. Not       surprisingly, legal findings of voting discrimination are       more common in jurisdictions that were previously covered       under the VRA's preclearance regime. As Professors Morgan       Kousser and William Kenan testified, more than five out of       every six successful voting rights lawsuits between 1957 and       2019 occurred in places that were previously covered, even       though for most of that time preclearance prevented the       implementation of discriminatory laws in those jurisdictions.        ii. The formula's high numeric threshold for violations       over a 25-year review period identifies persistent patterns       of discrimination. The VRAA sets numeric thresholds to       capture only those states with an established pattern of       discriminatory conduct. Specifically, as previously       introduced, the bill would capture only those states with 10       violations, at least one of which was statewide, or 15 total       violations, over the prior 25 years. These high numeric       thresholds mean that the VRAA's geographic coverage for       preclearance will apply only to those jurisdictions that       continue to exhibit discrimination despite successful       litigation. In other words, the preclearance coverage formula       is specifically tailored to remedy race discrimination where       case-by-case litigation has proven ineffective or       inefficient. (While the bill's requirement of 10 separate,       independent findings of discrimination is helpful to identify       the states where the problem has been most difficult to root       out, it also means that some states with quite a bit of       discrimination will not be covered unless the discrimination       continues over time. In those states, voters will have to       rely on the other remedies in the VRA.)        The geographic coverage formula's 25-year review period is       necessary to assess which of those jurisdictions with current       records of discrimination also exhibit a persistent,       longstanding pattern of discrimination justifying       preclearance. This time period encompasses two redistricting       cycles and a sufficient number of electoral cycles to       identify patterns of discrimination. The length of the review       period justifies the high numeric threshold for violations,       and vice versa.        iii. The formula limits coverage to states with recent       discrimination. The geographic coverage formula is also       designed to ensure that only those states with a continuing,       current problem of discrimination are covered. As discussed       further below, the 25-year review period works in tandem with       other provisions of the bill to ensure that jurisdictions       will only be covered if they have committed violations       recently. First, states that meet the coverage threshold are       only subject to preclearance for 10 years, after which older       violations will no longer be considered. Second, as also       discussed below, states that do not have any violations       within the past 10 years can easily bail out of preclearance,       and Congress can streamline the bail-out process even       further.        As a factual matter, the formula will not cover       jurisdictions that only committed violations a long time ago,       nor will it cover jurisdictions that only committed a small       number of violations over a short period of time.  [[Page H4443]]         Based on Peyton McCrary's testimony submitted for this       hearing, the VRAA will likely cover eight states, all of       which were covered under the VRA pre-Shelby County: Alabama,       Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina,       South Carolina, and Texas. Assuming Congress also authorizes       coverage of political subdivisions with at least three of       their own violations, the following local jurisdictions would       also be covered, only one of which was previously covered       (because it was within a covered state): Los Angeles County,       California, Cook County, Illinois, Westchester County, New       York, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and Northampton County,       Virginia. Each of these states and political subdivisions has       large minority populations. (Mr. McCrary's testimony also       concludes that California, New York, and Virginia are close       to coverage. Were California or New York to have one       statewide violation, it would bring either state into       coverage. While Virginia only has eight violations by Mr.       McCrary's count, two statewide, that number could rise to 10       if Congress drafts the bill to count independent findings of       violations within one case or objection letter as independent       violations.)        Each of the covered states has at least one violation       within the past decade, and most have multiple violations. In       addition, each covered state has seen violations spread over       a long time period; in no state are the violations       concentrated in a time period shorter than 14 years. Each       state is treated equally, and each has an equal opportunity       to roll out of preclearance if it stops engaging in a pattern       of discrimination.        iv. The formula appropriately targets local jurisdictions       where discrimination is prevalent. The VRAA's geographic       coverage formula is designed to cover states with consistent       patterns of discrimination. Some have argued that subjecting       political subdivisions within states to preclearance based on       violations committed by the state itself and by other       subdivisions is not fair. However, as I explain here, doing       so is both reasonable on principle and consistent with past       practice.        Local jurisdictions do not exist in isolation. They are       embedded within larger communities and larger jurisdictions,       including states. From a legal standpoint, as I discuss       further below, political subdivisions are ``mere creatures of       the State''; as one court noted, ``no legal distinction       exists between State and local officials'' for the purpose of       preclearance. Our electoral system distributes election       administration responsibility between local and state       election officials. When a person votes, their selections for       local, state, and federal offices are often recorded on the       same ballot, and they are subject to the same policies and       burdens when casting each of these votes. Perhaps more       importantly, when a voter casts their ballot, they are       participating in and affected by a political culture that       does not necessarily stop at their town or county's borders.       When this political culture has a demonstrated record of       discrimination, it is not unreasonable to presume that all       jurisdictions within it should be subject to preclearance.       Indeed, state officeholders that engage in discriminatory       practices are elected by people within each of the state's       political subdivisions.        Past practice under the VRA demonstrates that state       coverage is a reasonable way to identify local jurisdictions       where discrimination is prevalent. The VRA previously       subjected states and all their political subdivisions to       preclearance based on statewide turnout figures and the use       of tests and devices, regardless of the specific figures and       practices within each subdivision. In practice, this       successfully identified those jurisdictions where       discrimination was most likely to occur. A quick review of       the Justice Department's objections to voting policies       demonstrates that the vast majority of objections were to       local-level policies in covered states. For example, the       Department of Justice objected to at least 104 voting changes       in Alabama while preclearance was in effect in that state;       all but 18 of these objections were to local- and county-      level policies spread across a wide variety of political       subdivisions.        Peyton McCrary's analysis of the states likely to be       covered under the VRAA shows that it is fair to conclude that       discrimination pervades the local jurisdictions in those       states as well. According to his testimony, every       jurisdiction likely to be covered by the VRAA has at least       one statewide violation, violations across at least five       local jurisdictions in a broad geographic area, and       violations distributed across the entire 25-year period. Take       Georgia for example. Professor McCrary estimates that Georgia       has 25 total violations over the 25-year period. These       include four statewide violations and violations involving 19       different cities, counties, and school boards. In other       words, the formula captures geographic areas where       discrimination is widespread, persistent, and continues to       the present day, regardless of the political subdivisions.        v. The VRA's bail-out provisions prevent over-inclusion.       The bail-out provisions in Section 4(a) of the VRA ensure       that local jurisdictions where discrimination is not       prevalent will not be unfairly subject to coverage. Political       subdivisions that have not engaged in discriminatory conduct       for ten years can petition for relief from the preclearance       process even if the state as a whole and its other       subdivisions are still covered.        The VRA's bail-out process is easy and efficient. Since       1997, 50 jurisdictions across seven states have successfully       bailed out of preclearance, according to the Department of       Justice. All but one of these jurisdictions (the Northwest       Austin Municipal Water District No. 1) did so via a consent       decree with the Department of Justice, without contested       litigation. Since the 1982 amendments to the VRA, every       jurisdiction that requested bailout succeeded. According to       election law expert Gerry Hebert, who represented the       majority of jurisdictions that bailed out between the       implementation of the 1982 amendments and Shelby County, the       bailout process became more efficient over time as more       jurisdictions used it.        Congress has an opportunity to make the bailout process       even more efficient by creating an administrative bailout       process that largely circumvents judicial review. We       recommend that Congress create an administrative process for       jurisdictions to seek bailout without having to file an       action in court. Political subdivisions without recent       violations could file requests directly with the Department       of Justice. If the Department of Justice agrees that the       jurisdiction qualifies for bailout under the VRA's criteria,       the Attorney General could publish a Federal Register Notice       that the jurisdiction is eligible for administrative bailout.       If there are no objections within a specified time period,       the jurisdiction could be bailed out automatically via a       second Federal Register Notice, without any judicial action.       Jurisdictions that are denied or face local opposition to       bailout would still be able to use the existing bailout       mechanism by filing an action in the District Court for the       District of Columbia. Because the objective bailout criteria       from the 1982 amendments closely mirror the preclearance       criteria in the VRAA, Congress could also automatically       ``grandfather in'' all jurisdictions that bailed out under       the 1982 amendments pre-Shelby County out of coverage, unless       they commit the requisite number of new violations to subject       them to future coverage.      III. The VRAA's Geographic Coverage Formula Is a           Constitutional Exercise of Congress's Powers        The VRAA's geographic coverage formula, updating Section       4(b) of the VRA, is constitutional under Supreme Court       precedent. As an initial matter, the Supreme Court has       repeatedly held that the preclearance regime in Section 5 of       the VRA is constitutional--and it remains constitutional       today. The Court has upheld preclearance under the Fourteenth       and Fifteenth amendments, which give Congress significant       leeway to craft broad remedial legislation to protect against       racial discrimination in voting. These amendments permit       Congress to remedy and to deter voting rights violations by       prohibiting conduct that is not itself strictly       unconstitutional. Although the Court has recognized that       preclearance is an extraordinary legislative approach that       stretches ordinary principles of federalism, it has also       affirmed that such ``strong medicine'' is necessary and       constitutionally justified to address pervasive and       persistent race discrimination in voting.        As I discuss above and as the record before Congress makes       clear, such discrimination remains pervasive today,       especially in the jurisdictions that would likely be covered       under the VRAA. In expressing doubt about the continued need       for preclearance roughly a decade ago, the Supreme Court       observed that ``[v]oter turnout and registration rates now       approach parity,'' ``[b]latantly discriminatory evasions of       federal decrees are rare,'' and ``minority candidates hold       office at unprecedented levels.'' Simply put, these       observations no longer hold true. Today, the registration and       turnout gaps between white voters and voters of color are       substantial and persistent, especially in jurisdictions       likely to be covered. Indeed, the gaps between Hispanic and       Non-Hispanic white voters rivals the registration and turnout       gaps between Black and white voters from 1965. It is not rare       to see states pile voting restriction after voting       restriction, even as earlier restrictions are struck down by       the courts in what amounts to judicial whack-a-mole. And       while there are more minority candidates than ever before,       minorities are still dramatically underrepresented relative       to their population in the halls of congress, state       legislatures, and state courts, with some states trending       toward less, not more, minority representation. In short, the       justification for preclearance remains powerful.        The VRAA's primary mode of imposing preclearance--its       geographic coverage formula--is likewise constitutional. In       Shelby County, the Supreme Court explained that there are       constraints on when and how Congress can adopt preclearance.       Most significantly, the Court said that any attempt to target       states for preclearance coverage ``must be justified by       current needs'' and the formula rationally related to the       problem it is trying to address. Relying on this principle,       the Shelby County Court struck down the prior geographic       coverage formula, finding that it was improper for Congress       to rely on obsolete practices, such as literacy tests, along       with outdated information, such as 1960s- and 1970s-era voter       registration rates, rather than current conditions and voting       rights violations. The old coverage formula, the Court       observed, bore no ``no logical relation to the present day.''       And the record of voting discrimination before Congress,       according to the Court, ``played no role in shaping'' the       coverage formula. But even as the Court struck down the prior       coverage formula, it invited Congress to craft an updated       coverage formula responding to these  [[Page H4444]]       concerns. Under the Court's recent precedents, therefore, a       formula that is justified by current needs and is       sufficiently related to the problem it targets should pass       constitutional muster.        The VRAA's updated coverage formula clearly meets that       test. It is ``rational in both practice and theory,'' as the       Shelby County Court explained was required, and its remedies       are ``aimed at areas where voting discrimination has been       most flagrant.'' The VRAA's preclearance regime draws on       recent history of racial discrimination in voting. The       updated formula looks to voting discrimination over the past       25 years, and it ensures that only states that have       violations in the past 10 years will be covered. This 25-year       time period, which covers two redistricting cycles and up to       five presidential elections, is tailored to identify those       jurisdictions with a persistent record of discrimination--      precisely what the Court requires to justify disparate       geographic coverage. A shorter period of review would not be       long enough to identify a sustained pattern of misconduct and       could risk subjecting to preclearance states and       jurisdictions with only sporadic violations. Indeed, as       discussed above, all the potentially covered jurisdictions       have a steady and consistent stream of violations, showing       that the formula is in fact well-tailored.        Critical features of the coverage formula, moreover, ensure       that the VRAA captures only current violators, not just       jurisdictions that had problems 25 years ago. Two particular       features of the VRAA make that so. First, the VRAA covers       jurisdictions for only ten years at a time. After ten years       of coverage, jurisdictions are automatically freed from       preclearance, unless their continuing violations merit       renewed coverage. So, jurisdictions that improve their recent       records of discrimination will systematically drop out of       coverage, while jurisdictions that have increased instances       of discrimination will enter it. Thus, the VRAA has an       implicit sunset provision: when a jurisdiction no longer       engages in a pattern of discrimination in voting, it will no       longer be subject to coverage. And should the day come when       voting discrimination no longer plagues our country, the VRAA       will become dead letter, no longer subjecting any states or       localities to preclearance. In addition to the ten-year       coverage period, the VRAA's bail-out regime ensures that any       jurisdiction without violations over the past decade will be       able to quickly and efficiently escape preclearance. And the       proposed modifications to the bail-out regime that I discuss       above would further ensure that the coverage formula is       laser-focused on present-day discrimination. This responsive       focus on current conditions is exactly what the Court asked       for in Shelby County.        The VRAA modernizes the coverage formula and, as the Shelby       Court requested, uses a ``narrowed scope'' to reflect both       current problems and progress made to date. While the states       that are likely to be covered under the VRAA's updated       formula were all previously covered, some states that were       previously covered--Alaska, for example--will likely not be       covered. And it is not surprising that the list of states       with a past history of discrimination overlaps substantially       with the list of states with current problems of persistent       discrimination. On the other hand, the local jurisdictions       that will be captured by this formula are largely       jurisdictions that were not previously covered. They are all       jurisdictions with large and growing minority populations.       This shows that Congress has indeed updated the law to be       dynamic and responsive to modern conditions. Clearly, the       record before this Congress is playing a substantial ``role       in shaping the statutory formula'' that will be included in       the VRAA.        The VRAA also tracks discrimination more directly than the       coverage formula struck down in Shelby County. The VRAA's       coverage formula ``limit[s] its attention to the geographic       areas where immediate action seem[s] necessary''--      specifically, areas where there is actual ``evidence of       actual voting discrimination,'' that are ``characterized by       voting discrimination `on a pervasive scale.' '' To that end,       the VRAA's touchstone is not registration and turnout       numbers--it is actual, proven acts of discrimination. Such       acts are self-evidently ``relevant to voting       discrimination.'' By linking coverage to objective findings       of discrimination, the VRAA targets only those places where       proven discrimination against voters of color persists. In       this regard, the VRAA's coverage formula is similar to the       uncontroversial bail-in provision found in Section 4 of the       VRA: covering those states and localities where there are, in       the words of the 1965 House Report, ``pockets of       discrimination.''        Concerns regarding the coverage formula's potential       overbreadth are misplaced. As noted above, the coverage       formula effectively targets geographic areas where       discrimination is prevalent, and the bail-out regime would       enable any political subdivision without discrimination to       escape preclearance. The prior geographic coverage formula       that the Supreme Court repeatedly upheld subjected all       political subdivisions to preclearance based on a statewide       inquiry. In any event, the Supreme Court has made clear time       and again that the benefits of state sovereignty do not       extend to its political subdivisions. This is because ``the       law ordinarily treats municipalities as creatures of the       State.'' On this basis, one district court held it reasonable       to bring all subdivisions and a state itself into       preclearance based on a pattern of violations by some of its       subdivisions. In reviewing a request to bail the state of       Arkansas and all its subdivisions into coverage for certain       electoral processes, that court found that because       ``[c]ities, counties, and other local subdivisions are mere       creatures of the State'' that the State may ``create or       abolish . . . at will,'' ``no legal distinction exists       between State and local officials'' for the purpose of       preclearance. The court also found that because the use of       the relevant voting practice was clearly a ``pattern'' and a       ``systematic and deliberate attempt to reduce black political       opportunity,'' it was reasonable to hold all other       jurisdictions in the state to the preclearance requirement.       The Supreme Court has never questioned this approach to sub-      state preclearance.        Although not the focus of my testimony, there are two other       points relevant to the VRAA's constitutionality. First, in       addition to the geographic coverage formula, the VRAA also       features a practice-based preclearance regime with nationwide       application. This practice-based preclearance regime singles       out often discriminatory practices--such as changes in       methods of election, annexations, polling place relocations,       and interference with language assistance--for federal       oversight. Because it has no specific geographic scope and       does not impose continuing coverage, it does not implicate,       much less offend, the principle of equal sovereignty       articulated in the Shelby County opinion.        Second, separate and apart from the Fourteenth and       Fifteenth Amendments, Congress has extremely strong powers       under the Elections Clause to set the ``times, places and       manner'' of federal elections--powers the Supreme Court has       said include ``authority to provide a complete code for       congressional elections.'' Congress has invoked those powers       to enact voting legislation like the National Voter       Registration Act, which the Supreme Court has determined       permissibly overlays a ``superstructure of federal regulation       atop state voter-registration systems.'' And just a few years       ago, the Supreme Court approvingly discussed how Congress has       used the Elections Clause to ``enact[] a series of laws to       protect the right to vote through measures such as the       suspension of literacy tests and the prohibition of English-      only elections.'' The Elections Clause, therefore,       independently justifies the VRAA to the extent that it       regulates federal elections. The Supreme Court's concerns in       Shelby County--which were based on Court's interpretation of       the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments--have no bearing on       the constitutionality of the VRAA as it pertains to federal       elections.      IV. Congress Should Restore and Strengthen Section 2 of the           VRA in the Wake of the Supreme Court's Recent Brnovich           Decision        As my colleague Sean Morales-Doyle recently testified at       length, we also strongly urge Congress to use this       opportunity to restore Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in       the wake of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Brnovich       v. Democratic National Committee. Section 2 is critical for       fighting voting discrimination in jurisdictions not subject       to preclearance (and for fighting certain forms of voting       discrimination in covered jurisdictions as well). The       Brnovich decision seriously diminished Section 2's strength,       making it much less effective a tool for rooting out modern       discriminatory voting laws and practices. In doing so, it       undermined Congress's clear intent in 1982 to create a       powerful remedy to attack electoral laws and practices that       interact with the ongoing effects of discrimination to       produce discriminatory results in the voting process.        There are a number of approaches to restoring Section 2 to       its full strength, but they all share two basic features.       First, they would codify the so-called ``Senate Factors''       that courts have long used to assess whether a voting law or       practice results in unlawful discrimination under Section 2,       and make clear that courts should consider those factors in       both vote dilution (redistricting) and vote denial (vote       suppression) cases. Second, they would disclaim the       artificial limitations the Brnovich opinion placed on courts       considering Section 2 claims--such as the suggestion that       voting practices that were in place in 1982 should be treated       as presumptively valid under Section 2, and the suggestion       that unequal access to one method of voting can be excused if       other methods of voting are freely available. These two fixes       would ensure that Section 2 comports with both Congress's       original intent in amending Section 2 in 1982 and with prior       practice in federal courts. The Supreme Court was clear in       Brnovich that its ruling was based in statutory       interpretation. Congress can therefore easily correct the       Court's misinterpretation and restore Section 2 to its       intended strength.        While the Brnovich decision applies only to ``vote denial''       claims, it is important that any statutory fix address ``vote       dilution'' or redistricting claims as well. Section 2 has       long been a vital tool for ensuring fair electoral maps.       According to a recent Brennan Center analysis, Section 2 has       played a critical role in addressing discrimination in       redistricting, as evidenced by the more than 20 successful       redistricting cases since the 2006 reauthorization of the       VRA.        The VRAA would work in tandem with another piece of       legislation, the For the People Act (H.R. 1). H.R. 1 sets       national standards for fair, secure, and accessible       elections; the VRAA targets jurisdictions and practices  [[Page H4445]]       with a history of discrimination. H.R. 1 would override       existing discriminatory state laws and practices and replace       them with a fair alternative; the VRAA would establish       preclearance for future such laws and practices. Both are       vitally needed to strengthen our democracy.      V. Conclusion        As the record before this Committee shows, the scourge of       voting discrimination has exploded across the country, and it       is especially acute and pervasive in selected jurisdictions.       The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act is carefully       crafted to target and root out that discrimination where it       is most persistent. The VRAA's preclearance provisions are       not only eminently reasonable, justified, and consistent with       the Constitution; they are also necessary to stem the       relentless rise of discriminatory voting changes. Those       preclearance provisions, coupled with new provisions to       strengthen Section 2 of the VRA, would restore the VRA to its       full strength before the Supreme Court dramatically weakened       the law in Shelby County and Brnovich. That strength is badly       needed now. We strongly urge Congress to enact the VRAA, as       well as the For the People Act, into law.                                   ____   Statement of Jon Greenbaum, Chief Counsel, Lawyers' Committee for Civil                              Rights Under Law                    U.S. HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY     SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES  Hearing on ``Oversight of the Voting Rights Act: Potential Legislative                         Reforms''--August 16, 2021                                 Introduction         Chairman Cohen, Ranking Member Johnson, and Members of the       Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil       Liberties of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on       the Judiciary, my name is Jon Greenbaum and I serve as the       Chief Counsel for the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights       Under Law (``Lawyers' Committee''). Thank you for the       opportunity to testify today on ways in which Congress can       remedy the damage to racial equality in voting caused by the       Supreme Court's decisions in Shelby County v. Holder, and       Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee.        In 2013, the Shelby County decision effectively immobilized       the preclearance provisions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights       Act by finding its underlying coverage formula       unconstitutional. The more recent Brnovich decision, while       not gutting Section 2, makes it unnecessarily more difficult       for plaintiffs to bring Section 2 vote denial ``results''       cases, running directly counter to Congress' intent in first       enacting the Voting Rights Act in 1965, and then in       broadening the scope of Section 2 of the Act in 1982. The       weakening of Section 2 protections by the Court in Brnovich       is particularly and sadly ironic, as the Court in Shelby       County had pointed to the continued existence of Section 2's       ``permanent, nation-wide ban on racial discrimination'' when       it eviscerated the Section 5 protections.        The harm caused by Shelby County has been well-documented.       The effects of Brnovich remain to be seen. However, it is not       too late for Congress to act. The full protections of the       Voting Rights Act are desperately needed today, particularly       given the steps already taken--or about to be taken--by       legislatures in states such as Georgia, Florida, and Texas in       the aftermath of the 2020 election to raise additional       barriers to the vote that will impact voters of color more       severely than white voters. Moreover, there is a legitimate       concern that some state legislatures will be emboldened by       their reading of Brnovich, as they were by the decision in       Shelby, and view it as a signal from the Court to take even       more suppressive action. Congress should immediately reassert       its intention to fully protect the voting rights of voters of       color in Sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act.        I come to this conclusion based on twenty-four years of       working on voting rights issues nationally. From 1997 to       2003, I served as a Senior Trial Attorney in the Voting       Section at the United States Department of Justice, where I       enforced various provisions of the Voting Rights Act,       including Section 5, on behalf of the United States. In the       eighteen years since, I have continued to work on voting       rights issues at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights       Under Law as Chief Counsel, where I oversee our Voting Rights       Project, and prior to that, when I served as Director of the       Voting Rights Project.        The Lawyers' Committee is a national civil rights       organization created at the request of President John F.       Kennedy in 1963 to pursue racial justice through mobilization       of the private bar. Voting rights has been an organizational       core area since the inception of the organization. During my       time at the Lawyers' Committee, among other things, I was       intimately involved in the constitutional defense of Section       5 and its coverage formula in Shelby County and its       predecessor case Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District       No. 1 v. Holder. I also staffed the National Commission on       the Voting Rights Act, which issued a report entitled The       National Commission on the Voting Rights Act, Protecting       Minority Voters: The Voting Rights Act at Work 1982-2005       (2006). The report and record of the National Commission on       the Voting Rights Act, which was submitted to the House       Judiciary Committee at the Committee's request, was the       largest single piece of the record supporting the Fannie Lou       Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act       Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 (``2006 VRA       Reauthorization'').        Our recommended responses to the Shelby County and Brnovich       decisions stem from the different scope and rationales of the       decisions themselves. The complete evisceration of Section 5       wrought by the Shelby County decision necessitates a       comprehensive remedy, but one that is instructed by the       reasoning of that decision and therefore considers both the       unfortunate history of discrimination in voting in particular       states and the current need for prophylactic measures to       ensure that no state or sub-jurisdiction can implement a       change in voting practices that discriminates against voters       of color. The more limited impact of the Brnovich decision       calls for a correspondingly focused response, one that zeroes       in on the specific deviations of the Court from the clear       intent of Congress in its 1982 amendments to Section 2.        Thus, our recommended response to the Shelby County       decision starts with our support for provisions similar to       those in the bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives       in the previous session of Congress: H.R. 4, 116th Congress,       the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, i.e., a       replacement coverage formula that would be applied to the       preclearance provisions of Section 5 and the federal observer       provisions of Section 8, and a transparency provision that       requires all jurisdictions--irrespective of any coverage       formula--to provide public notice of changes in voting       practices. But, we have an additional recommendation, tied to       the transparency provision: the creation of a ``retrogression       cause of action,'' that allows the Attorney General or       private parties an opportunity to stop changes in voting       practices anywhere in the country before they diminish the       voting rights of voters of color. As I will discuss more       fully in my testimony, the retrogression cause of action       would meet the current need to stop suppressive laws that       discriminate against voters of color, using a tried and true       standard, with limited interference with state sovereignty,       and without implicating issues relating to differentiation       among the states.        Our recommended congressional response to Brnovich is more       limited, as Congress does not have to completely rewrite       Section 2. It simply has to remove any ambiguity in the       statute caused by the Brnovich opinion, which gave short       shrift to a substantial legislative record and decades of       jurisprudence which run counter to the Brnovich majority's       constricted view of this remedial statute. Congress       originally enacted and later amended Section 2 to stymie not       only blatant, explicit discrimination, but also facially       neutral voting laws that, through ingenious, sophisticated       methods, had a significant impact on minority citizens' right       to vote. Consistent with this purpose, prior to Brnovich, the       Supreme Court and several of the Circuit Courts of Appeal had       adopted a standard to ensure the effective implementation of       those protections. That standard recognized not only that the       Act applies broadly to all voting procedures and policies       that abridge the right to vote--whether expressly or subtly--      but also that a challenged law cannot be viewed in isolation,       because a seemingly innocuous voting practice can interact       with underlying social conditions to result in pernicious       discrimination.        Under that standard, Section 2 has worked for decades as a       judicially manageable mechanism to stop voting       discrimination. There has been no flood of questionable       Section 2 vote denial ``results'' cases, and no widespread       invalidation of voting regulations. Indeed, Brnovich marked       the first time since the 1982 amendments to the Act that the       Supreme Court reviewed a pure vote-denial claim. The reason       is clear: The lower courts have taken seriously the Court's       guidance, and carefully assessed the effects of challenged       voting policies or procedures within each specific       jurisdiction, based on the totality of the circumstances.        Brnovich compels an immediate response from this Congress,       before some state legislators--intent on creating obstacles       that disproportionately result in a negative impact on the       rights of voters of color--hear it as a dog whistle to do       just that, and before lower courts apply the opinion in ways       that elevate unsubstantiated and untrue justifications for       new burdensome voting practices over genuine and proved       claims of racially discriminatory results.      I. Why and How Congress Must Respond to Shelby County        A. The State of Affairs Prior to the Shelby County decision        Prior to the Shelby County decision, the combination of       Section 2 and Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act provided an       effective means of preventing and remedying minority voting       discrimination. Section 2, which is discussed more fully       below, remains as the general provision enabling the       Department of Justice and private plaintiffs to challenge       voting practices or procedures that have a discriminatory       purpose or result. Section 2 is in effect nationwide. Section       5 required jurisdictions with a history of discrimination,       based on a formula set forth in Section 4(b), to obtain       preclearance of any voting changes from the Department of       Justice or the District Court in the District of Columbia       before implementing the voting change. From its inception,       there was a sunset provision for the formula, and the sunset       provision for the 2006 Reauthorization was 25 years.  [[Page H4446]]         Section 5 covered jurisdictions had to show federal       authorities that the voting change did not have a       discriminatory purpose or effect. Discriminatory purpose       under Section 5 was the same as the Fourteenth and Fifteenth       Amendment prohibitions against intentional discrimination       against minority voters. Effect was defined as a change which       would have the effect of diminishing the ability of minority       voters to vote or to elect their preferred candidates of       choice. This was also known as retrogression, and in most       instances was easy to measure and administer. For example, if       a proposed redistricting plan maintained a majority black       district that elected a black preferred candidate at the same       black population percentage as the plan in effect, it would       be highly unlikely to be found retrogressive. If, however,       the proposed plan significantly diminished the black       population percentage in the same district, it would invite       serious questions that it was retrogressive.        Except in rare circumstances, covered jurisdictions would       first submit their voting changes to the Department of       Justice. DOJ had sixty days to make a determination on a       change, and if DOJ precleared the change or did not act in 60       days, the covered jurisdiction could implement the change.       The submission of additional information by the jurisdiction,       which often happened because DOJ requested such information       orally, would extend the 60 day period once by sending a       written request for information to the jurisdiction. This       often signaled to the jurisdiction that DOJ had serious       concerns that the change violated Section 5. If DOJ objected       to a change, it was blocked, but jurisdictions had various       options, including requesting reconsideration from DOJ using       Section 5 Procedures, seeking preclearance from the federal       court and modifying the change and resubmitting it.        In the nearly seven years I worked at DOJ, I witnessed       first-hand how effective Section 5 was at preventing voting       discrimination and how efficiently DOJ administered the       process to minimize the burdens to its own staff of attorneys       and analysts, and to the covered jurisdictions. The Section 5       Procedures cited above provided transparency as to DOJ's       procedures and gave covered jurisdictions guidance on how to       proceed through the Section 5 process. Internal procedures       enabled DOJ staff to preclear unobjectionable voting changes       with minimal effort and to devote the bulk of their time to       those changes that required close scrutiny.        The benefits of Section 5 were numerous and tangible. The       2014 National Commission Report provided the following       statistics and information regarding DOJ objections:        ``By any measure, Section 5 was responsible for preventing       a very large amount of voting discrimination. From 1965 to       2013, DOJ issued approximately 1,000 determination letters       denying preclearance for over 3,000 voting changes. This       included objections to over 500 redistricting plans and       nearly 800 election method changes (such as the adoption of       at-large election systems and the addition of majority-vote       and numbered-post requirements to existing at-large systems).       Much of this activity occurred between 1982 (when Congress       enacted the penultimate reauthorization of Section 5) and       2006 (when the last reauthorization occurred); in that time       period approximately 700 separate objections were interposed       involving over 2,000 voting changes, including objections to       approximately 400 redistricting plans and another 400       election method changes.''        ``Each objection, by itself, typically benefited thousands       of minority voters, and many objections affected tens of       thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even (for objections to       statewide changes) millions of minority voters. It would have       required an immense investment of public and private       resources to have accomplished this through the filing of       individual lawsuits.''        In addition to the changes that were formally blocked,       Section 5's effect on deterring discrimination cannot be       understated. Covered jurisdictions knew that their voting       changes would be reviewed by an independent body and they had       the burden of demonstrating that they were non-      discriminatory. By the time I began working at DOJ, Section 5       had been in effect for several decades and most jurisdictions       knew better than to enact changes which would raise obvious       concerns that they were discriminatory--like moving a polling       place in a majority black precinct to a sheriff's office. In       the post-Shelby County world, a jurisdiction is likely to get       away with implementing a discriminatory change for one       election (or more) before a plaintiff receives relief from a       court, as the Hancock County, Georgia voter purge and Texas       voter identification cases detailed later illustrate.        The Section 5 process also brought notice and transparency       to voting changes. Most voting changes are made without       public awareness. DOJ would produce a weekly list of voting       changes that had been submitted, which individuals and groups       could subscribe to in order to receive this weekly list from       DOJ. For submissions of particular interest, DOJ would       provide public notice of the change if it believed the       jurisdiction had not provided adequate notice of the change.       But even more important, the Section 5 process incentivized       jurisdictions to involve the minority community in voting       changes. DOJ's Section 5 Procedures requested that       jurisdictions with a significant minority population provide       the names of minority community members who could speak to       the change, and DOJ's routine practice was to call at least       one local minority contact and to ask the individual whether       she or he was aware of the voting change and had an opinion       on it. Moreover, involved members of the community could       affirmatively contact DOJ and provide relevant information       and data.        B. The Shelby County Decision        In the Shelby County case, the Supreme Court decided in a       5-4 vote that the Section 4(b) coverage formula was       unconstitutional. The majority held that because the Voting       Rights Act `` `impose[d] current burdens,' '' it `` `must be       justified by current needs.' '' The majority went on to rule       that because the formula was comprised of data from the 1960s       and 1970s, it could not be rationally related to determining       what jurisdictions, if any, should be covered under Section 5       decades later. The four dissenting justices found that       Congress had demonstrated that regardless of what data was       used to determine the formula, voting discrimination had       persisted in the covered jurisdictions. The majority made       clear that ``[w]e issue no holding on Sec. 5 itself, only on       the coverage formula. Congress may draft another formula       based on current conditions.''        The effect of the Shelby County decision is that Section 5       is effectively immobilized as, for now, preclearance is       limited only to those jurisdictions where it is imposed by a       court after a court previously made a finding of intentional       voting discrimination. This special preclearance coverage is       authorized by Section 3(c) of the Act. Courts have rarely       ordered Section 3(c) coverage, and when they do, it is       typically quite limited. Indeed, the only jurisdictions I am       aware of that have been subject to Section 3(c) coverage       since the Shelby County decision are Pasadena, Texas and       Evergreen, Alabama.        As a result, Section 5 is essentially dead until Congress       takes up the Supreme Court's invitation to craft another       coverage formula. There are compelling reasons for Congress       to do so because voting discrimination has increased in the       absence of Section 5, and Section 2 cannot adequately       substitute for Section 5.        C. The Effect of the Shelby County Decision        The year after the Shelby County decision was issued, the       Executive Summary and Chapter 3 of the 2014 National       Commission Report discussed what was lost in the Shelby       County decision. We identified the following impacts:        Voting rights discrimination would proliferate,       particularly in the areas formerly covered by Section 5;        Section 2 would not serve as an adequate substitute for       Section 5 for numerous reasons:        The statutes are not identical but were instead intended to       complement one another;        Section 5 prevents a discriminatory voting change from ever       going into effect whereas discrimination can affect voters in       a Section 2 case prior to a court decision or a settlement;        Section 2 litigation is time-consuming and expensive       compared to Section 5 which is efficient and less-resource       intensive;        Section 2 is less likely to prevent discrimination than       Section 5 because:        Under Section 2 plaintiffs have the burden whereas under       Section 5, jurisdictions have the burden of proof;        Section 2 has a complicated multi-factor test that provides       numerous defenses for jurisdictions, whereas Section 5 has a       simple retrogression test.        The Shelby County decision, and DOJ's interpretation that       it also bars use of the coverage formula for sending federal       observers, has left voting processes vulnerable to       discrimination.        The subsequent years have demonstrated that all of the       negative impacts we anticipated have come to pass.        D. Voting Rights Discrimination has Proliferated Since             Shelby County, Particularly in the Areas Formerly             Covered by Section 5        The Lawyers' Committee's Voting Rights Project has never       been busier than in the post-Shelby County years, where we       have participated as a counsel to a party or as amici in more       than 100 voting rights cases. Because the Lawyers' Committee       has a specific racial justice mission, all of the cases we       have participated in implicate race in some fashion in our       view, even if there are no race claims in the case.        In my 2019 testimony before this Subcommittee, I did a       deeper dive into the 41 post-Shelby County voting rights       cases the Lawyers' Committee had filed up to that time. My       testimony reflected that voting discrimination remains alive       and well, particularly in the states formerly covered by       Section 5. The findings included the following:        In the thirty-seven cases where we sued state or local       governments, twenty-nine (78.3 percent) involved       jurisdictions that were covered by Section 5, even though far       less than half the country was covered by Section 5.       Moreover, we sued seven of the nine states that were covered       by Section 5 (Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana,       Mississippi, Texas, Virginia), as well as the two states that       had were not covered but had a substantial percentage of the       population covered locally (North Carolina and New York).        We achieved substantial success. Of the thirty-three cases       where there had been some result at the time, we achieved a       positive result in 26 of 33 (78.8 percent). In most  [[Page H4447]]       of the seven cases where we were not successful, we had filed       emergent litigation--either on Election Day or shortly       before--where achieving success is most difficult.        This data tells us that voting discrimination remains       substantial, especially considering that the Lawyers'       Committee is but one organization, and particularly in the       areas previously covered by Section 5.        In 2019, the Lawyers' Committee did a 25 year look back on       the number of times that an official entity made a finding of       voter discrimination. This analysis of administrative actions       and court proceedings identified 340 instances between 1994       and 2019 where the U.S. Attorney General or a court made a       finding of voting discrimination or where a jurisdiction       changed its laws or practices based on litigation alleging       voting discrimination. We found that the successful court       cases occurred in disproportionally greater numbers in       jurisdictions that were previously covered under Section 5.        E. Why Section 2 is an inadequate substitute for Section 5        Prior to the Shelby County decision, critics of Section 5       frequently minimized the negative impact its absence would       have by pointing out that DOJ and private parties could still       stop discriminatory voting changes by bringing affirmative       cases under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Indeed, in       the same paragraph of Shelby County where the Supreme Court       majority states that Congress could adopt a new formula for       Section 5, it also notes that its ``decision in no way       affects the permanent, nation-wide ban on racial       discrimination in voting found in Sec. 2.''        During the Shelby County litigation and the reauthorization       process preceding it, defenders of Section 5 repeatedly       pointed out why Section 2 was an inadequate substitute. Eight       years of experience demonstrate this.        This is hardly a surprise given that Section 5 and Section       2 were designed by Congress to complement one another as part       of a comprehensive set of tools to combat voting       discrimination. Section 5 was designed to prevent a specific       problem--to prevent jurisdictions with a history of       discrimination from enacting new measures that would       undermine the gains minority voters were able to secure       through other voting protections, including Section 2. The       Section 5 preclearance process was potent, but also efficient       and surgical in its limited geographic focus and sunset       provisions. It was also relatively easy to evaluate because       the retrogressive effect standard--whether minority voters       are made worse off by the proposed change--is simple to       determine in all but the closest cases. Section 5 is designed       to protect against discriminatory changes to the status quo.        Section 2 is quite different. It evaluates whether the       status quo is discriminatory and thus must be changed. The       test for liability should be, and is, rigorous because it is       a court-ordered change. Although Section 2 (results) and       Section 5 (retrogression) both have discriminatory impact       tests, they are distinct. As discussed above, the Section 5       retrogression test is quite straightforward in determining       whether a jurisdictional-generated change should be blocked--      will minority voters be worse off because of the change?        In contrast, the Section 2 results inquiry is complex and       resource intensive to litigate. As will be discussed in       greater detail below in the context of the Brnovich decision,       the ``totality of circumstances'' test set forth in the       statute is fact-intensive by its own definition. The Senate       Report supporting the 1982 amendment to Section 2 lists       factors that courts have used as a starting point in applying       the totality of circumstances test to include seven such       factors (along with two factors plaintiffs have the option to       raise). On top of the Senate factors, courts have introduced       additional requirements. For example, in vote dilution cases,       which typically involve challenges to redistricting plans or       to a method of election, the plaintiff must first satisfy the       three preconditions set forth by the Supreme Court in       Thornburg v. Gingles, before even getting to the Senate       factors. These Gingles preconditions require plaintiffs to       show that a minority group is compact and numerous enough to       constitute a majority of eligible voters in an illustrative       redistricting plan and whether there is racially polarized       voting (minority voters are cohered in large number to       support certain candidates and those candidates are usually       defeated because of white bloc voting) and are necessarily       proven by expert testimony. In vote denial cases, which       involve challenges to practices such as voter identification       laws, courts have also added an additional test, with the       developing majority view requiring that plaintiffs       demonstrate that the challenged law imposes a discriminatory       burden on members of a protected class and that this ``burden       must be in part caused by or linked to social conditions that       have or currently produce discrimination against members of       the protected class.        The result is that Section 2 cases are extremely time-      consuming and resource-intensive, particularly when       defendants mount a vigorous defense. For example, United       States v. Charleston County, which I litigated at the       Department of Justice, was a successful challenge to the at-      large method of electing the Charleston (South Carolina)       County Council. The litigation took four years, and it       involved more than seventy witness depositions and a four-      week trial, even though we had prevailed on the Gingles       preconditions on summary judgment, and needed to litigate       only the totality of circumstances in the district court.        Four specific examples from the Lawyers' Committee's       litigation record illustrate why Section 2 is an inadequate       substitute for Section 5. The first and most prominent       example is the Texas voter identification law, which       illustrates the time and expense of litigating a voting       change under Section 2 that both DOJ and the federal district       court found violated Section 5 prior to the Shelby County       decision. The afternoon that Shelby County was decided, then-      Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott announced that the State       would immediately implement the ID law. Several civil rights       groups, including the Lawyers' Committee, filed suit in Texas       federal court, challenging SB 14 under several theories,       including Section 2, and DOJ filed its own suit under Section       2, and ultimately all of the cases were consolidated. The       parties then embarked on months of discovery, leading to a       two-week trial in September 2014, where dozens of witnesses,       including 16 experts--half of whom were paid for by the civil       rights groups--testified. Prior to the November 2014       election, the District Court ruled that SB 14 violated the       ``results'' prong of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,       because it had a discriminatory result in that Black and       Hispanic voters were two to three times less likely to       possess the SB 14 IDs and that it would be two to three times       more burdensome for them to get the IDs than for white       voters. The District Court's injunction against SB 14,       however, was stayed pending appeal by the Fifth Circuit, so       the law--now deemed to be discriminatory--remained in effect.       Subsequently, a three-judge panel and later an en banc panel       of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, affirmed the District       Court's finding. As a result, elections that took place from       June 25, 2013 until the Fifth Circuit en banc opinion on July       20, 2016 took place under the discriminatory voter ID law.       Had Section 5 been enforceable, enormous expense and effort       would have been spared. The district court awarded private       plaintiffs $5,851,388.28 in attorneys' fees and $938,945.03       in expenses, for a total of $6,790,333.31. The fee award is       currently on appeal. As of June 2016, Texas had spent $3.5       million in defending the case. Even with no published       information from DOJ, more than $10 million in time and       expenses were expended in that one case.        Second, in Gallardo v. State, the Arizona legislature       passed a law that applied only to the Maricopa County       Community College District and added two at-large members to       what was previously a five-member single district board. The       legislature had submitted the change for Section 5       preclearance. The Department of Justice issued a more       information letter based on concerns that the addition of two       at-large members, in light of racially polarized voting in       Maricopa County, would weaken the electoral power of minority       voters on the board. After receiving the more information       letter, Arizona officials did not seek to implement the       change. Only after the Shelby County decision did they move       forward, precipitating the lawsuit brought by the Lawyers'       Committee and its partners. We could not challenge the change       under Section 2, especially because we would not have been       able to meet the first Gingles precondition. Instead we made       a claim in state court alleging that the new law violated       Arizona's constitutional prohibition against special laws       because the board composition of less populous counties was       not changed. Reversing the intermediate court of appeal, the       Arizona Supreme Court rejected our argument, holding that the       special laws provision of the state constitution was not       violated. Unsurprisingly, the Latino candidate who ran for       the at-large seat in the first election lost and the two at-      large members are white.        Third, in 2015, the Board of Elections and Registration, in       Hancock County, Georgia, changed its process so as to       initiate a series of ``challenge proceedings'' to voters, all       but two of whom were African American. This resulted in the       removal of 53 voters from the register. Later that year, the       Lawyers' Committee, representing the Georgia State Conference       of the NAACP and the Georgia Coalition for the Peoples'       Agenda and individual voters, challenged this conduct as       violating the Voting Rights Act and the National Voter       Registration Act, and obtained relief which resulted in the       placement of unlawfully-removed voters back on the register.       Ultimately, plaintiffs and the Hancock County Board agreed to       the terms of a Consent Decree that would remedy the       violations, and required the county's policies to be       monitored for five years. But after the purge and prior to       the court order, Sparta, a predominantly black city in       Hancock County, elected its first white mayor in four       decades. And before the case was settled, and the wrongly-      purged voters placed back on the rolls, at least one of them       had died.        The fourth matter is ongoing and reflects the significant       present-day impact of the Shelby County decision and the loss       of Section 5. It involves a law that Georgia, a previously       covered jurisdiction, enacted this year, SB 202, a 53       section, 98-page law that changes many aspects of Georgia       elections. It has spawned several federal lawsuits, most of       which include voting discrimination claims. The Lawyers'       Committee is counsel in the one of these suits.        The litigation will unquestionably be resource intensive       even if the various cases are fully or partially consolidated       and the Plaintiffs engage in substantial coordination. It  [[Page H4448]]       will require numerous experts and extensive fact discovery.       There will be elections--and possibly multiple cycles of       elections--that will occur before Plaintiffs will have the       evidence needed to establish a constitutional or Section 2       violation and the court will set aside the time to hear and       decide the claims. If Plaintiffs prevail, Georgia will       undoubtedly appeal and even more time will pass.        But for the Shelby County decision, there would be no SB       202, at least not in its current form, because at least some       aspects of SB 202 appear to be clearly retrogressive and       probably would not have been proposed in the first place.       This is perhaps most clearly demonstrated by Georgia       introducing several restrictions focused on voting by mail:        The new absentee ballot ID requirements mandate that voters       include a Georgia Driver's license number or Georgia State ID       number on their absentee ballot application. If they have       neither, voters are required to copy another form of       acceptable voter ID and attach the copies of ID documents       along with other identifying information to both their       absentee ballot applications and inside the absentee ballot       envelope when returning the voted ballot.        The bill also prohibits public employees and agencies from       sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications to voters,       yet threatens private individuals and organizations who are       not so prohibited with a substantial risk of incurring hefty       fines for every application they send to an individual who       has not yet registered to vote or who has already requested a       ballot or voted absentee.        SB 202 significantly limits the accessibility of absentee       ballot drop boxes to voters. While all counties would be       required to have at least one, the placement of drop boxes is       limited to early voting locations and drop boxes are       available only to voters who can enter the early voting       location during early voting hours to deposit their ballot       inside the box. Thus, drop boxes are essentially useless to       voters who can vote early in-person or who cannot access       early voting hours at all due to work or other commitments       during early voting hours.        The bill also mandates an earlier deadline of 11 days       before an election to request an absentee ballot, leaving       some voters who become ill or have to travel out of the area       in the lurch if they cannot vote during early voting and are       unable to meet the earlier deadline to apply for a ballot.        These restrictions were adopted right after the November       2020 election, where voters of color used absentee ballots to       an unprecedented degree, and in the cases of Black (29.4       percent) and Asian (40.3 percent) voters, at higher rates       than white (25.3 percent) voters. Given this seemingly       disproportionate impact on voters of color, I believe that if       Georgia were subject to Section 5, these provisions would       have been found retrogressive, and never would have been in       effect. Instead, these provisions will be contested through       time and resource intensive litigation under complex legal       standards.        F. The Impact of Shelby County on the Loss of Observer             Coverage        A less discussed impact of the Shelby County decision is on       the loss of federal observer coverage. Under Section 8 of the       Voting Rights Act, the federal government had the authority       to send federal observers to monitor any component of the       election process in any Section 4(b) jurisdiction provided       that the Attorney General determined that the appointment of       observers was necessary to enforce the guarantees of the 14th       and 15th Amendments. A federal district court can also       authorize the use of observers when the court deems it       necessary to enforce the guarantees of the 14th or 15th       Amendments as part of a proceeding challenging a voting       law or practice under any statute to enforce the voting       guarantees under the 14th or 15th Amendment.        In the 2014 National Commission report, we determined that       the Attorney General had certified 153 jurisdictions in       eleven states for observer coverage and that the Department       of Justice had sent several thousand observers to observe       several hundred elections from 1995 to 2012.        While officially not stating this, the practice of the       Department of Justice has been to apply the Supreme Court's       finding that the Section 4(b) coverage formula is       unconstitutional not just to preclearance, but to observer       coverage. The Shelby County decision has reduced observer       coverage to a trickle. The Department of Justice has instead       employed what it calls ``monitors.''        The difference between federal observers and monitors is       dramatic. Under the Voting Rights Act, ``Observers shall be       authorized to--(1) enter and attend at any place for holding       an election in such subdivision for the purpose of observing       whether persons who are entitled to vote are being permitted       to vote; and (2) enter and attend at any place for tabulating       the votes cast at any election held in such subdivision for       the purpose of observing whether votes cast by persons       entitled to vote are being properly tabulated.'' Monitors       have no such rights: a jurisdiction does not need to provide       any access to the voting process to any monitor.        It is not difficult to see the difference in how this plays       out in practice. In a year where legislatures in formerly       covered states like Arizona and Texas are conducting audits       of election results or considering restricting the ability of       election officials to limit the conduct of partisan poll       watchers, it becomes vitally important for the federal       government to have discretion to send observers to places       with a history of voting discrimination for the purpose of       ensuring that processes are fair and that voters of color are       not disenfranchised.        G. Proposed Congressional Response to Shelby County        In 2019, the House passed H.R. 4, also known as the John       Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named after one of the       true giants of our lifetimes, a person who literally put his       life on the line so that others could vote free of       discrimination on the basis of the color of their skin. Now       is the time for Congress to honor his memory with passage of       a bill that resuscitates Section 5.        H.R. 4 contains many beneficial provisions. It creates a       new formula that determines which states would be subject to       the preclearance provisions of Section 5, based on clearly       defined incidents of voting rights violations; it creates a       practice-based preclearance process applicable nationwide,       based on clearly defined covered practices that have been       shown to be particularly susceptible to use in a       discriminatory fashion; it clarifies the authority of the       Attorney General to assign observers to enforce       constitutional and statutory protections of the right to       vote; and it creates a ``transparency'' requirement for all       states and political subdivisions to provide public notice of       any change in voting practices or procedures.        We respectfully suggest that more is needed, and that the       ``transparency'' requirement provides the appropriate vehicle       for our recommendation. The ``transparency'' provision in the       prior H.R. 4, requires that any State or political       subdivision that makes any change in a voting practice or       procedure in any election for Federal office that results in       a difference with that which has been in place 180 days       before the date of the Federal election must provide       reasonable and detailed public notice of the change within 48       hours. Additional, specific requirements for notice are       provided as for polling place changes for Federal elections       and for the changes in the constituency that will participate       in any election through redistricting or reapportionment.        We agree that notice by any state or political subdivision       of changes in voting practices or procedures and to any       prerequisite to voting is essential to any effective response       to the Shelby County decision, but we see no reason to limit       the notice requirement to changes affecting Federal       elections.        Second, while notice is of overarching importance, more is       needed. There must be an opportunity for voters, and those       statutorily charged with protecting the civil rights of       voters, to analyze the proposed change, and, if necessary,       seek judicial relief if it appears that the change will be       discriminatory. Thus, we propose a relatively modest waiting       period of 30 days after notice is given before the change may       be implemented. This leads to our third, and most important,       recommendation. As is implicit in the creation of a waiting       period before a change in voting practices may take effect,       there must be the concomitant creation of a cause of action       that allows for a determination as to whether the change may       be implemented. For that, we recommend consideration of a       standard that has been time-tested in the context of the pre-      Shelby County Section 5 litigation: the retrogression       standard. We recommend that the United States or an aggrieved       party be granted the right to bring an action if the voting       change would have the effect of diminishing the ability to       vote of any citizens of the United States on account of race       or color on in contravention of the guarantees set forth in       the language minority provisions of the Voting Rights Act. It       has long been settled that `` `the purpose of Sec. 5 has       always been to insure that no voting-procedure changes would       be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of       racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of       the electoral [process].' '' However, compared with Section       5, which requires the state to prove a lack of discriminatory       purpose or effect, the cause of action we recommend would       require the Attorney General or an aggrieved party to prove       retrogression.        The ``retrogression cause of action'' provides an       additional, reasonable, and necessary weapon in the fight       against suppressive and discriminatory voting practices.       First, and most important, it responds to current needs,       which are not limited to those states and political sub-      divisions that may be subject to geographic coverage or which       attempt to implement practices known to be susceptible to       discriminatory applications. As of July 14, 2021, at least 18       states had enacted laws this year that made it harder to       vote. These laws were passed not only in states like Georgia       and Arizona, that were previously covered by Section 4 of the       Voting Rights Act, but also by states not previously covered,       such as Indiana, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma,       Utah, and Wyoming, and included provisions not captured in       the ``known practices'' category, including those that make       mail voting and early voting more difficult.        We believe that these amendments, individually and       collectively, are constitutional under the current       constitutional framework under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth       Amendments. These amendments would respond to the current       problems of jurisdictions enacting retrogressive voting       changes that may be difficult to challenge under other       provisions. In comparison to the needs addressed under this       proposal, the burdens created under this proposal are       relatively modest. The requirement of providing notice of       changes provides  [[Page H4449]]       almost no burden, as it would take little effort to provide       notice. The concept of a stand-still period before a       jurisdiction can implement a change is not unknown in our       laws, and is required when interests that have less or no       constitutional protection as compared with the right to vote,       are at stake. Given that most voting changes are not       instituted--and should not be instituted--too close to an       election, the 30-day stand-still would have limited adverse       impact on states and political subdivisions, but would       provide the substantial benefit of allowing voters time to       assess the potential effect of the change.        Furthermore, the burden of creating a cause of action       prohibiting retrogressive voting changes is constitutionally       acceptable under the circumstances. The Supreme Court has       stated that Congress has the enforcement authority to address       voting changes that have a discriminatory effect. In       addition, because numerous other civil rights laws allow for       discriminatory effect causes of action, including Title VII       of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, involving employment       discrimination, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, permitting       such a cause of action is hardly unusual.        Finally, creating a cause of action for retrogression       nationally does not implicate the concerns about the equal       sovereignty of the States, expressed by the majority in the       Shelby County decision. The retrogression cause of action       should not be a threat to those jurisdictions whose proposed       voting practices changes are intended to make it easier for       voters to vote, because a party would have to successfully       bring suit in order to stop the change, which seems       implausible under the circumstances. The burden is placed on       the party challenging the change. Proving retrogression is       not as complicated as proving discriminatory results under       Section 2, but it is a high standard, and history has taught       us that it is perfectly suitable to assess the discriminatory       effects of proposed changes in voting practices.      Why and How Congress Must Respond to Brnovich        A. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act        From the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870       through the 1960s, the federal government tried--and failed--      to defeat the ``insidious and pervasive evil'' of ``racial       discrimination in voting,'' which had been ``perpetuated . .       . through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the       Constitution.'' Although Justice Frankfurter wrote long ago       that the Fifteenth Amendment targeted ``contrivances by a       state to thwart equality in the enjoyment of the right to       vote'' and ``nullifie[d] sophisticated as well as simple-      minded modes of discrimination[,]'' prior to the VRA's       passage, this language proved largely aspirational.        Responding to the states' tenacious ``ability . . . to stay       one step ahead of federal law,'' Congress passed the VRA to       provide a ``new weapon[] against discrimination.'' The Act       ``reflect[ed] Congress' firm intention to rid the country of       racial discrimination in voting.'' The essence of the VRA's       protections was exemplified in Section 2, which provided:       ``No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or       standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied       by any State or political subdivision to deny or abridge the       right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account       of race or color.''        Notwithstanding Section 2's broad language, jurisdictions       sought to evade its reach by placing ``heavy emphasis on       facially neutral techniques.'' These ``techniques'' included       everything from ``setting elections at inconvenient times''       to ``causing . . . election day irregularities'' to ``moving       polling places or establishing them in inconvenient . . .       locations.'' In one Mississippi county, voters were forced to       ``travel 100 miles roundtrip to register to vote.'' In one       Alabama county, ``the only registration office in the county       [was] closed weekends, evenings and lunch hours.'' These       regulations ostensibly governed the time, place, and manner       of voting in a neutral way, but they ``particularly       handicap[ped] minorities.''        Against this backdrop, and responding to this Court's       plurality decision in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which had       read into Section 2 a ``discriminatory purpose'' element,       Congress expressly expanded Section 2, now codified at 52       U.S.C. Sec.  10301. As amended, Section 2 prohibits any       ``voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard,       practice, or procedure . . . which results in a denial or       abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States       to vote on account of race or color.''Congress further       specified that, under Section 2, a violation is established       if, ``based on the totality of [the] circumstances,'' the       political processes leading to an election are not ``equally       open to participation'' by minority voters so that they have       less opportunity than white voters ``to particpate in the       political process and to elect representatives of their       choice.'' By adopting this ``results test,'' Congress       captured the ``complex and subtle'' practices which ``may       seem part of the everyday rough-and-tumble of American       politics'' but are ``clearly the latest in a direct line of       repeated efforts to perpetuate the results of past voting       discrimination.''        Section 2 provides relief for both vote dilution--schemes       that reduce the weight of minority votes--and vote denial--      standards, practices, or procedures that impede minority       citizens from casting votes or having their votes counted.       Vote-denial cases were the paradigmatic, ``first generation''       cases brought under Section 2. Only later did the Supreme       Court ``determine[] that the Act applies to `vote dilution'       as well.''        Thirty-five years ago, in Gingles v. Thornburg, the Court       recognized that Congress inserted the words ``results in'' to       frame the Section 2 inquiry. Instead of asking whether, in a       vacuum, a voting practice facially sounds as if it denies or       abridges the rights of minority voters, the question is: in       context, does the practice ``interact'' with pre-existing       social and historical conditions to result in that burden?       Answering this question requires courts to examine the       challenged practice not as a theoretical postulate, but as a       law or regulation that interacts with real-world conditions       and must be evaluated through a fact-heavy, ``intensely local       appraisal,'' that accounts for the ``totality of [the]       circumstances.''        In Gingles, the Court explained the ``essence of a Sec.  2       claim is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure       interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an       inequality in the [voting] opportunities enjoyed by black and       white voters.''80 Recognizing Section 2's command that courts       consider the ``totality of circumstances,'' the Gingles Court       looked to the Senate Report accompanying the 1982 amendments       to compile a list of relevant ``circumstances.'' These nine       social and historical conditions--the ``Senate Factors''--      include considerations such as the history of official       discrimination in the jurisdiction (Factor One); the extent       of discrimination in the jurisdiction's education,       employment, and health systems (Factor Five); and whether the       challenged practice has a tenuous justification (Factor       Nine).        Since Gingles, four different Circuits addressing vote-      denial cases have used the foundation laid in Gingles to       analyze these matters. This formulation distills Section 2       liability into a two-part test: (1) there must be a disparate       burden on the voting rights of minority voters (``an       inequality in the opportunities enjoyed''); and (2) that       burden must be caused by the challenged voting practice (``a       certain electoral law, practice, or structure . . . cause[s]       an inequality'') because the practice ``interacts with social       and historical conditions'' of racial discrimination. No       other Circuit has put forth an alternative formulation.        B. The Facts of Brnovich        That was the situation until Brnovich. In Brnovich, the       Supreme Court reviewed two Arizona voting practices: one       mandated that votes cast out of the voter's precinct       (``OOP'') not be counted; the other prohibited the collection       of mail-in ballots by anyone other than an election official,       a mail carrier, or a voter's family member, household member       or caregiver. Plaintiffs had claimed that these practices       violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.        The United States District Court for the District of       Arizona had ruled against the plaintiffs on both claims, but,       applying the settled standards described above, the United       States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had reversed,       en banc, finding that the out-of-precinct policy violated the       ``results'' prong of Section 2 and that the limitations on       collections of absentee ballots violated both the ``results''       and ``intent'' prongs of Section 2.        As to the out-of-precinct policy, the Ninth Circuit       identified several factors, acknowledged by the district       court, leading to a higher rate of OOP voting by voters of       color than by white voters: frequent changes in polling       locations (polling places of voters of color experienced       stability at a rate 30 percent lower than the rate for       whites); confusing placement of polling locations (indigenous       populations in particular lived farther from their assigned       polling places than did white voters,); and high rates of       residential mobility. As a result, 1 in every 100 Black       voters, 1 in every 100 Latinx voter, and 1 in every 100       indigenous peoples voter cast an OOP ballot, compared to 1 in       every 200 white voters.        As to the absentee-ballot collection limitation, the Ninth       Circuit relied on the district court's finding that voters of       color were more likely than white voters to return their       early ballots with the assistance of third parties. The       disparity was the result of the special challenges       experienced by communities that lack easy access to outgoing       mail services, socioeconomically disadvantaged voters who       lacked reliable transportation, and voters who had trouble       finding time to return mail because they worked multiple jobs       or lacked childcare services, all burdens that       disproportionately fall on Arizona's minority voters.        Applying the ``totality of circumstances'' test, with       primary reliance on the Senate factors that demonstrated a       history of discrimination in Arizona that persists to this       day, the Ninth Circuit found that both the OOP policy and the       absentee-ballot collection law violated the ``results'' prong       of Section 2 of the VRA. The court also found that the       absentee ballot law had been enacted with discriminatory       intent, based on statements of the sponsor and a racist video       used to promote passage of the law.        C. The Brnovich Decision: Its Meaning, and Its Consequences        In Brnovich, a 6-3 Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's       decision. Had it done so by applying the settled standards,       we may not be here today. But, in writing for the Court's       majority, Justice Alito provided guidelines for future       treatment of Section 2 vote denial ``results'' cases that       were not only new, but also  [[Page H4450]]       contrary--or at least dilutive of--the decades-long accepted       standards.        I emphasize Brnovich does not spell the end of Section 2       cases. Rather, it unnecessarily and unreasonably makes it       more difficult for civil rights plaintiffs to win Section 2       actions, when they already were difficult to prevail. And it       does so in a way that flies in the face of congressional       intent. Further, it raises too many ambiguities in too many       important areas to leave it to the courts to fill in the       blanks. The greater difficulty and ambiguity threaten to       undermine the core purpose of the Voting Rights Act.        1. Brnovich is a solution in search of a problem        First, Brnovich purports to cure a non-existent problem.       One of the premises of Brnovich is that ``[i]n recent years,       [Section 2 vote denial claims] have proliferated in the lower       courts.'' In support of this statement, the Court relies on       the amicus curiae briefs of Sen. Ted Cruz, the State of Ohio,       and the Liberty Justice Center. However, those briefs       describe a total of perhaps 16 cases, dating back over 7       years, and only 3 of them led to a finding of Section 2       liability.        The fact is that since Congress amended Section 2 in 1982       and since the Supreme Court supplied its test for       adjudicating Section 2 violations, the Supreme Court has       never deemed it necessary to review a single Section 2 vote-      denial case. At the same time, there was absolutely no       evidence that courts were being overwhelmed by Section 2 vote       denial cases. And when such cases are brought, courts have       had no trouble applying the standard to separate       discriminatory voting practices from benign election       regulations. In short, the pre-existing standard had worked       well.        2. Brnovich reads a remedial statute narrowly        One of the most important canons of statutory       construction--and one that gives the greatest deference to       congressional intent--is that remedial statutes are to be       broadly construed, and there are few statutes in this       Nation's history more remedial than the Voting Rights Act of       1965. Yet, rather than read the Act expansively, the Court       created new stringent ``guideposts,'' most prominently       suggesting higher standards for both the size of the burden       and the size of the disparity, and a lower standard for the       State to meet to justify the burdens it is placing on the       right to vote.        The purported touchstone of the Brnovich opinion is the       Court's construction of the requirement in Section 2(b) that       the political process be ``equally open'' as the ``core''       requirement of the law. The concept of equal ``opportunity''       as used in the same statute, the Court acknowledged somewhat       grudgingly, ``may stretch that concept to some degree to       include consideration of a person's ability to use the means       that are equally open.'' In that context, the Court turned to       the ``totality of the circumstances'' test, and said that       ``any circumstance that has a logical bearing on whether       voting is `equally open' and afford equal `opportunity' may       be considered,'' and proceeded to list five ``important       circumstances'' that were relevant.        Some of these ``important circumstances'' seem fairly       innocuous on their face: e.g., the size of the burden, the       size of the disparity. Others not so much: e.g., the degree       of departure of the challenged practice from practices       standard when Section 2 was amended in 1982 or which are       widespread today, and the opportunities provided by the       electoral process as a whole. Another has never been deemed       relevant to Section 2 analysis: the strength of the state's       justification for the practice--except in connection with       assessment of the tenuousness of that justification. Overall,       however, the devil is in the details, and in the ambiguities       created by the Court's specific choice of language that may       pave the way for state legislatures to enact additional       discriminatory laws and for lower courts to apply Section 2       parsimoniously in vote denial ``results'' cases.        3. The size of the burden should include factors specific             to the affected community resulting from discrimination        The first factor that Justice Alito highlighted was the       ``size of the burden,'' emphasizing that voters ``must       tolerate the usual burden of voting.'' The application of       this ``guidepost'' by legislatures and lower courts might be       colored by a footnote at the end of the paragraph on burden,       where Justice Alito expounded on what ``openness'' and       ``opportunity'' might mean (as, say, with museums or school       courses that are open to all) as compared to the ``absence of       inconvenience'' (such as lack of adequate transportation or       conflicting obligations). The vagueness with which the Court       left this issue, and its relegation to a footnote, may limit       its precedential impact, but its practical impact may be       substantial.        What Justice Alito does not acknowledge is that some of       these indicia of what he calls ``inconvenience'' are       themselves not simply subjective to an individual, but, are       reflective of a group's socio-economic circumstances, that       are themselves the product of a history of discrimination. In       the Texas Photo ID case, for example, we were able to       demonstrate that not only were Black and Latinx voters more       likely than white voters not to possess the required photo       ID, but that they were more likely than white voters not to       be able to get the ID because of, among other reasons, lack       of access to transportation.        The same logic might apply to polling place location and       closure decisions that might make it just that much more       burdensome for voters of color than for white voters to vote.       Or, as in the new Georgia statute, SB 202, prohibiting line       relief--the provision of food and water to those waiting in       line to vote--particularly when voters of color are much more       often confronted with long wait-times than are white voters.        Mandating additional voter ID requirements in order to       submit an application for an absentee ballot or to return a       voted absentee ballot is another new hurdle voters will now       face in Georgia under its new omnibus bill. Under this       provision, voters requesting an absentee ballot must submit       with their application their driver's license number, their       personal identification number on a state-issued personal       identification card, or a photocopy of other specified forms       of identification. For voters who do not have a Georgia's       driver license or state ID card number, voting absentee will       now require access to photocopy technology. Voters without       such access to technology will face a higher burden in       complying with these ID requirements. Recent data shows that       Black Georgians are 58 percent more likely and Latinx       Georgians are 74 percent more likely to lack computer access       in their homes as compared to their white counterparts. Thus,       we can expect voters of color to face a significantly higher       burden than white voters in complying with the ID       requirements for requesting and returning absentee ballots.        If Brnovich is construed by state legislatures as       permitting them to impose barriers that affect different       racial or ethnic groups differently because of their relative       wealth--particularly when those differences are themselves       the product of historic discriminatory practices--it will       have a serious impact on the voting rights of persons of       color.        4. 1982 Standards and Widespread Practice Are Not Important        Second, Justice Alito said that other relevant factors       included the degree of departure of the challenged practice       from the ``standard practice when Sec. 2 was amended in       1982,'' a choice which is largely left unexplained, other       than in rebuttal to Justice Kagan's dissent, in which he       writes, somewhat tautologically, that ``rules that were and       are commonplace are useful comparators when considering the       totality of the circumstances.'' Although the Court       acknowledges that this would not apply to practices that       themselves were discriminatory in 1982, the fact is that such       benchmarks are neither necessary nor productive. If the       history of voter discrimination in this country has taught us       anything, it is that those who want to stop voters of color       from voting change their methods with the times, and with the       change in the ways voters of color are voting.        Again, Georgia is illustrative. In Georgia, state       legislators responded to the record-shattering turnout of       2020 by passing omnibus legislation that restricts the right       to vote at nearly every step of the process and       disproportionately affects voters of color. Among its       provisions, the law requires voter identification in order to       request an absentee ballot and vote absentee; severely limits       access to absentee ballot drop boxes; and significantly       shortens the period in which voters can apply for and cast       absentee ballots. These restrictions were adopted right after       the November 2020 election where voters of color used       absentee ballots to an unprecedented degree, and in the cases       of Black (29.4 percent) and Asian (40.3 percent) voters, at       higher rates than white (25.3 percent percent) voters. But,       Justice Alito's reasoning may be construed as supporting the       proposition that, if in 1982, Georgia did not make absentee       ballots universally available, that could be a ``highly       important'' consideration, even if voters of color are more       heavily impacted than white voters by these changes. State       legislatures should not be led to believe that they can get       away with erecting new barriers to vote based on what they       did 40 years ago.        Further, Justice Alito also observed that the       ``widespread'' present day acceptance of the voting practice       could justify its use. But it was precisely because certain       discriminatory practices were ``widespread'' that the Voting       Rights Act was necessary. It seems incongruous, if not       irrational, to justify discrimination by the majority       population against minority populations on the basis of       ``widespread'' acceptance.        5. So-called ``small differences'' can be important        Third, in explaining the importance of the size of the       disparities, Justice Alito indicates that ``small differences       should not be artificially magnified,'' again dealing       obliquely with the consequences of the differences being       caused by differences in wealth--which may themselves be the       result of historic racial discrimination. Specifically, the       Court criticized the Ninth Circuit for finding       disproportionate impact based on a relative comparison of the       percentage of voters whose votes were rejected because they       were cast out of precinct. In the case of Indigenous, Black,       and Latinx voters, the percentage was 1% for each group; in       the case of white voters, the percentage was .05.        The Court neglected to note that the discriminatory out of       precinct practice meant that almost 4,000 votes cast by       voters of color had been rejected--and that if their       circumstances were equivalent to those of white voters, 2,000       of their votes would have counted.  [[Page H4451]]         The Texas Photo ID case is illustrative. There, the court       found that, even though over 90 percent of all groups had the       required ID, Black voters were twice as likely as white       voters not to have the ID, and Latinx voters were about three       times as likely. In fact, the court found that 608,470 Texas       voters lacked the ID. Obviously, the Texas numbers are       meaningful no matter how viewed. But the point is that       smaller numbers may be too. Legislatures and lower courts       should not be led to believe that they can chip away at       electoral margins by reducing the likelihood of voters of       color being able to cast their votes, no matter how small the       effect. We need not dwell on the closeness of the 2020       presidential election in Arizona, Georgia, and Wisconsin to       underscore the importance of even small differentials in       impact.        6. Other opportunities to vote do not necessarily             ameliorate discrimination in particular methods of             voting        Fourth, Justice Alito explained that the opportunities       provided by the entire electoral system should be factored       into the equation, implying that, for example, access to       absentee ballots may be curtailed, as long as the voter can       still vote in person. But, if an advantageous means of voting       is curtailed as to one group more than it is to another, what       difference does it make that there may be other methods of       voting? If all methods of voting made voting equally       accessible, there would have to be only one method.       Obviously, expanding methods of voting makes it more likely       that people will vote. And, equally obviously, contracting       them makes it less likely that people will vote. Contracting       them in a way that affects some racial or ethnic groups more       than others is inconsistent with the language and       Congressional intent of Section 2. States should not be led       to believe that they have carte blanche to target specific       voting practices, when the effect is discriminatory, and try       to justify it by the availability of other means of voting.        7. Justification for discriminatory practices must be based             on reality        And, fifth, in explaining the state justification factor,       the Court seemed to open the door to a state's justifying       virtually any discriminatory action simply by parroting the       words ``fraud prevention.'' Again, while the Court did not       say so explicitly, the fear is that lower courts--and, worse,       state legislatures--may so interpret the Court's opinion.        The incongruity of the Court's approach is seen in       comparing the hundreds of thousands of voters who were       potentially deprived from voting under Texas's prior Photo ID       law, with the infinitesimally small number of persons even       accused of fraudulently voting. A state's choice to prevent       non-existent fraud at the expense of thousands of votes,       disproportionately of person of color, is not legitimate.       Again, permitting such choice, is inconsistent with the       language of Section 2 and Congressional intent.        8. The Senate Factors are relevant        The Brnovich majority went on to raise questions as to       whether the Senate Factors are relevant to a Section 2 vote       denial case, implying they are not, but leaving ambiguous       precisely what the Court means as to how the few Factors the       Court deems potentially relevant fit in, other than       superficially.        Although Gingles involved vote dilution, the decision       addressed Section 2 writ large, recognizing that ``Section 2       prohibits all forms of voting discrimination, not just vote       dilution.'' Further, Gingles recognized the applicability of       the various Senate Factors would naturally turn on the type       of Section 2 claim at issue. The Gingles Court's statement       that the Senate Factors will ``often be pertinent to certain       types of Sec.  2 violations,'' such as dilution, cannot be       reconciled with a conclusion that the Factors ``only'' inform       one specific type of Section 2 claim.        D. The Growing Present Need        As with the need for the resuscitation of Section 5, recent       events reflect the significant present-day need for an       immediate response to Brnovich. As detailed throughout this       testimony, for example, the recently enacted Georgia voter       suppression law, SB 202 increases the burdens for virtually       every aspect of voting from voting by mail through voting in       person. At least some aspects of SB 202 appear to be clearly       retrogressive and probably would not have been proposed in       the first place were it not for the decision in Shelby       County. The effect of the Brnovich decision on the challenge       to SB 202 remains to be seen, but already defendants have       moved to dismiss the complaints on the basis of Brnovich.       Although, we strongly believe that the complaints as drafted       fully and adequately plead a ``results'' claim under Section       2 even post-Brnovich, the very making of these arguments       demonstrates how those who support the erection of barriers       to vote intend on using that opinion.        Georgia, of course, is not the only state that is       considering or has passed laws with new barriers to voting       that disproportionately affect voters of color. Florida did       so with SB 90, a law that--similar to Georgia's--imposes new       and unnecessary restrictions on absentee ballots, the use of       drop-boxes, and line-warming. And Texas appears poised at       this writing to pass an omnibus voting bill that would, among       other things, empower partisan poll watchers with virtually       unfettered access in polling places, while at the same time       tying the hands of election officials to stop the poll       watchers from engaging in intimidating conduct. Texas has a       well-documented history of voter intimidation by poll       watchers that has disproportionately affected voters of       color. The courts have acknowledged this pattern before--in       2014, a federal district court described this very issue:       ``Minorities continue to have to overcome fear and       intimidation when they vote. . . . [T]here are still Anglos       at the polls who demand that minority voters identify       themselves, telling them that if they have ever gone to jail,       they will go to prison if they vote. Additionally, there are       poll watchers who dress in law enforcement-style clothing for       an intimidating effect to which voters of color are often the       target.''        As with Georgia's SB 202, some of these provisions might       have been stopped by an effective Section 5 and challenges to       some of them may be hampered by the effect of the Brnovich       decision. The bottom line, however, is that recent events       have only underscored the need for a robust Voting Rights       Act.        E. The Appropriate Congressional Response        The impact of Brnovich has yet to be measured, but common       sense and history instruct us that those who wish to target       voters of color will undoubtedly feel emboldened by a       decision that can be read as making it more difficult for       plaintiffs to prove a Section 2 violation, giving state       legislatures a ``Get Out of Jail'' card to pass voter       suppressive legislation and justify it simply by claiming       ``voter fraud.'' Although we firmly believe that the courts       should not apply Brnovich in such a manner, the threat is       there. Continued commitment to the core purpose of the Voting       Rights Act should not be left in the uncertainty created by       the ambiguous and problematic language of Brnovich. We       identify here a number of issues for consideration and would       be pleased to work with the Committee on legislative text.:        Clarify that the ``totality of the circumstances'' to       support a Section 2 violation entails an intensely local       appraisal.        Clarify that ``totality of the circumstances'' may include       any or all of the factors deemed relevant by Gingles,       including the Senate Factors, and that no factors are       exclusively pertinent to ``results'' claims or ``dilution''       claims. These include Factors 1 and 5, which are important,       not for the back-of-the-hand reading given them by Justice       Alito, but because they go to the core issue of the       interaction between historic socio-economic discrimination       and the voting practice in question.        Clarify that, in determining the extent to which a       challenged voting rule burdens minority voters, the absolute       number or the percent of voters affected or the presence of       non-minority voters in the affected area will not be       dispositive.        Clarify that in determining whether the policy underlying       the use of a voting rule is tenuous--one of the Senate       factors--the court should consider whether the voting rule in       question was actually designed to advance and in fact       materially advances a valid and substantiated state interest.       That preventing voter fraud may be a valid state interest       should not lead to a determination that any voting practice       alleged to have been enacted to protect fraud is valid,       particularly if the instances of voter fraud are rare, if not       virtually non-existent, and the means chosen to combat the       alleged fraud scarcely further that aim, and, further, do so       at the expense of preventing eligible voters from voting.        Clarify that a discriminatory law cannot be justified on       the basis that it was a standard practice at a particular       date, such as 1982, or is widespread today, but must be       judged solely on the totality of the circumstances in the       particular jurisdiction, as viewed at the time the action       under Section 2 is brought.        Clarify that the availability of other methods of voting       not impacted by the voting rule at issue cannot weigh against       finding a violation.        Put an end to any doubt, as raised by the concurring       opinion of Justices Gorsuch and Thomas in Brnovich, that       there is a private cause of action for a Section 2 violation,       as every Circuit Court of Appeals has held.        I am not in favor of employing a burden-shifting approach       because I believe that Section 2 vote denial claims should be       restored to their pre-Brnovich state and burden-shifting has       not been part of the Section 2 inquiry. In addition, burden-      shifting places the state's interest at the center of the       inquiry in the second and third prongs in the three-prong       analysis, whereas the focus should be on the impact on       voters.      III. Conclusion        The eight years since the Supreme Court's decision in       Shelby County v. Holder have left voters of color the most       vulnerable to voting discrimination they have been in       decades. The record since the Shelby County decision       demonstrates what voting rights advocates feared--that       without Section 5, voting discrimination would increase       substantially. The Brnovich decision--by creating new hurdles       for Section 2 claimants to overcome--raises the stakes       appreciably. Congress must act.  [[Page H4452]]                                          ____ Testimony of Professor Bernard L. Fraga, Emory University, Atlanta, GA,   Before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil           Liberties Of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary     The Need to Enhance the Voting Rights Act: Practice--Based Coverage                               July 27, 2021         Chair Cohen, Ranking Member Johnson, and distinguished       members of the committee, it is an honor to testify before       you today. My name is Bernard L. Fraga, and I am an associate       professor of political science, with tenure, at Emory       University in Atlanta, Georgia. My research focuses on the       quantitative analysis of elections in the United States, with       particular attention to the causes and consequences of       disparities in voter turnout. I received my B.A. in Political       Science and Linguistics from Stanford University and my Ph.D.       in Government and Social Policy from Harvard University.        The right to vote is the cornerstone of representative       democracy. In the majority opinion for Reynolds v. Sims,       Chief Justice Earl Warren noted that as ``the right to       exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is       preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any       alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be       carefully and meticulously scrutinized.'' The same year       Reynolds v. Sims was argued, however, John Lewis was arrested       for carrying a ``One Man, One Vote'' sign in Selma, Alabama       and Fannie Lou Hamer was beaten nearly to death by state       troopers in Montgomery County, Mississippi for her voting       rights activism. Less than a week after Chief Justice Warren       read the Reynolds v. Sims decision, Freedom Summer activists       James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were       murdered while trying to organize a voter registration drive.       Thus, at the same time voting can be recognized as central to       our system of government, the vote can be denied in places       where resistance to changing the existing power structure is       entrenched and unyielding.        It took federal action through the Voting Rights Act of       1965 to change this pattern. However, a powerful tool of the       act for combatting efforts to restrict the right to vote was       rendered inactive after Shelby County v. Holder. In that       decision, the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights       Act, which mandated federal oversight for election law       changes in a set of states and counties, were ruled       inoperable as the coverage formula was deemed       unconstitutional. Noting that while ``voting discrimination       still exists; no one doubts that,'' Chief Justice Roberts       called on Congress to ``draft another formula based on       current conditions.''        In the attached report, I outline a flexible, forward-      looking formula for practice-based preclearance that can       secure our rights far into the future. Drawing on a database       of over 3,500 legal cases or proceedings related to minority       voting rights, along with historical, theoretical, and       empirical evidence regarding where voting rights violations       are likely to occur, I show a strong relationship between the       racial/ethnic composition of a state or county and the       likelihood that that the jurisdiction will see a violation.       This pattern appears across racial/ethnic minority groups and       over time. Specifically, I find the following:        1. Historical evidence indicates a clear relationship       between attempts to restrict the franchise and the size of       the racial/ethnic minority population in the jurisdiction. In       states and counties with a larger minority population,       efforts to limit the participation of racial/ethnic minority       citizens are substantial and persist absent federal       intervention to protect the right to vote. (Pgs. 2-7 of the       report)        2. In recent years, voting rights-related litigation is       vastly more common in states and counties with sizeable       racial/ethnic minority populations. This pattern persists       even when isolating the analysis to litigation resulting in       successful prosecution of a voting rights case. (Pgs. 8-19 of       the report)        3. Combined with a practice-based approach to preclearance,       a population-limited trigger for preclearance coverage can       ensure an appropriate balance between protecting voting       rights and creating additional requirements for election       officials. The threshold that best balances this tradeoff is       20%, such that practice-based preclearance would be required       for states or counties where at least two racial/ethnic       groups each make up at least 20% of the jurisdiction's       population. (Pgs. 19-23 of the report)        I invite members of the committee to read the attached       report and the conclusions therein, and ask that the report       be officially entered into the record. In closing, I urge the       committee to reinvigorate the Voting Rights Act and renew the       promise of voting rights for all Americans. Indeed, no single       action taken by the members of this Congress may be more       consequential. It is up to you, and the other members of the       House and Senate, to heed the call.                                   ____   A Population-Limited Trigger for Practice-Based Preclearance Under the                             Voting Rights Act  (By Bernard L. Fraga, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Political Science,                       Emory University, Atlanta, GA)                               I. INTRODUCTION         In 2013, the Shelby v. Holder decision invalidated the key       formula used to determine which jurisdictions would be       subject to the Section 5 ``preclearance'' provisions of the       Voting Rights Act. Writing for the 5-4 majority, Chief       Justice Roberts stated ``a statute's current burdens must be       justified by current needs, and any disparate geographic       coverage must be sufficiently related to the problem that it       targets. The coverage formula met that test in 1965, but no       longer does so.'' Instead, the Court indicates ``Congress may       draft another formula based on current conditions . . . Our       country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in       voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation       it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current       conditions.''        In this report, I outline the rationale for a current       population-limited trigger for additional scrutiny of       election practices that could be used to violate the voting       rights of Black, Hispanic, Asian American, Pacific Islander,       and American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) populations. I first       demonstrate that there is strong historical, theoretical, and       empirical evidence for a relationship between the share of       the electorate that is minority and potential violations of       minority voting rights. Using a detailed database of recent       voting rights act-related litigation, I then show that in       counties and states where two racial/ethnic groups separately       compose at least 20% of the voting-age population, ``current       conditions'' justify additional scrutiny of covered election       practices via the Voting Rights Act.        By constructing a formula for coverage of specific election       practices based on contemporary demographics, I provide a       flexible trigger that both meets current needs and can adapt       to the changing conditions of the future. Combined with a       cogent analysis of which election practices should be subject       to additional scrutiny, and any further triggers based on       established, recent discriminatory practices, this formula       could be one part of a strengthened Voting Rights Act that       protects the voting rights of all Americans.    II. HISTORICAL AND THEORETICAL BASIS FOR A POPULATION-LIMITED TRIGGER         In this section, I discuss why a population-limited trigger       is justifiable based on the extant record of where minority       voting rights violations have occurred. I first begin by       outlining the history of federal oversight to protect racial/      ethnic minority voting rights. Then, drawing on theoretical       understandings of elections and extant empirical evidence, I       discuss the circumstances where federal oversight may be most       necessary to safeguard voting rights.      a. Reconstruction, Jim Crow, and the Role of Federal           Oversight in Ensuring Minority Voting Rights        For most of U.S. history, the voting rights of racial/      ethnic minority groups were curtailed by statutes and laws       restricting access to the franchise. At the start of the       Civil War, de jure exclusion of the African-American       population was nearly complete, as a handful of northern       states permitted African Americans to vote by law, but       whether enslaved or free, the much larger Black population of       the South was excluded from the franchise. Native       Americans on Indian lands and Asian Americans were de jure       barred from voting as they were ineligible for citizenship       or naturalization. Latinos held tenuous, but at times       electorally relevant voting rights, especially in the       former Mexican territories where nearly all Latinos       resided prior to 1900.        After the Civil War, the historical record of minority       voting rights indicates periods of expansion, contraction,       and then expansion that directly coincides with federal       action to prevent states from de jure or de facto racial/      ethnic discrimination in voting. The first notable expansion       of voting rights to African-Americans occurred with the       Reconstruction Acts of 1867 and 1868, which granted the vote       to formerly enslaved Black men and placed voter registration       under the control of Union (Northern) military commanders.       Over 700,000 African Americans registered to vote,       outnumbering White registrants in multiple Southern states       and ensuring election of a Congress and state legislatures       conducive to the 14th and 15th Amendments. However, the 14th       Amendment's de facto application to African-Americans alone       meant that most Native Americans, Latinos, and Asian       Americans remained barred from voting.        White resistance to enfranchisement of Black men was       immediate, severe, and concentrated in the South where the       relatively high proportion of Black voters relative to white       voters meant that Black men could exert significant influence       on election outcomes. The ``Redeemer'' movement, as it was       called, viewed ending Black suffrage as the proximate goal to       regain political power for former Confederates and       sympathizers, resorting first to violence and then de facto       disenfranchising policies implemented by local election       officials. These policies, including poll taxes, literacy       tests, and residency requirements, were administered in a       racially discriminatory manner but were ruled as beyond       federal oversight by the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Reese. The       removal of remaining federal troops from the South in 1877,       and Congress's failure to pass legislation designed to       counter U.S. v. Reese, directly resulted in heavily-Black       Southern states passing new constitutions between 1890 and       1910 with the specific, intentional goal of disenfranchising       African Americans.        The second period of expansion again indicates the       important role of federal oversight in places where racial/      ethnic minorities are a significant share of the population.       Through Supreme Court rulings outlawing Grandfather Clauses       (1915) and the final iteration of the White Primary (1944),       heavily-Black  [[Page H4453]]       and heavily-Latino (in particular, Texas) states of the South       were no longer able to de jure prevent African-Americans and       Latinos from voting statewide. However, the poll tax and       literacy test were still administered in a discriminatory       fashion by local officials in heavily-Black and Latino       counties, just as resistance to ending the White Primary was       strongest in heavily-Black parts of Southern states. Indeed,       by the 1950s, Black voter registration rates were relatively       high in Northern cities and rapidly increasing Southern       counties with smaller Black concentrations. In ending the ban       on naturalization for remaining Asian and Latin American       origin groups, the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act opened the door       to naturalization (and voting rights) for any legal resident       of the United States. Thus, by the mid-1950s federal action       had eliminated the explicit racially discriminatory barriers       to voting outside of heavily-minority counties.        Stronger federal action was necessary to ensure voting       rights in places with a large share of racial/ethnic minority       citizens. The Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964       sought to eliminate discriminatory voter registration       practices in the South by targeting the methods used by local       election officials to curb Black voter registration. Yet       resistance continued, culminating in the violent, ``Bloody       Sunday'' attacks by local officials in heavily-Black Selma,       Alabama. This spurred passage of the Voting Rights Act of       1965, mandating two key forms of federal oversight for       jurisdictions with a recent history of discriminatory       election practices: federal voting registrars and a       requirement that election law changes are ``precleared'' by       federal officials prior to implementation. While not       explicitly defining states and counties subject to federal       supervision on the basis of population size, each of the 7       states covered in whole or in part by the coverage formula       outlined in Section 4 were at least 20% African-American and       were the top 7 states in Black population percentage as of       the 1970 Census.        The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was amended and expanded to       include American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Asian       American/Pacific Islander populations through amendments in       1970 and 1975. Mirroring the situation for African-Americans       in the Deep South, discrimination was most severe in states       and localities with relatively large numbers of Latino and       Native American voters. For instance, testimony in favor of       the 1975 VRA Amendments by Latino witnesses focused on voting       rights violations in counties in Texas and California with       large shares of Latino citizens. Disenfranchisement of Native       American voters appeared in states and counties with tribal       lands and reservations concentrating potential Native       American voting strength.      b. Minority Population Size is Associated with Attempts to           Restrict Voting Rights        The history of minority voting rights briefly outlined       above indicates a generalizable relationship between minority       population size and attempts to restrict voting rights. While       at various times limitations on the franchise were quite       widespread (and impeded participation for non racial/ethnic       minority groups as well), the pockets of most determined       efforts to restrict minority voting rights were areas of the       country where racial/ethnic groups made up a larger than       average share of the population. Attempts to counter       continued disenfranchisement through federal intervention       thus also focused on these areas, during both the       Reconstruction Era and Civil Rights Era. The creation,       preservation, and reinstatement of minority voting rights       across the United States thus hinges on the actions of the       federal government.        This historical evidence aligns with theoretical       expectations about where incentives to disenfranchise should       be most acute. In an often-quoted section of the canonical       text Southern Politics in State and Nation (1949), political       scientist V.O. Key noted that ``in grand outline the politics       of the South revolves around the position of the Negro,'' and       due to the substantial size of the Black population in the       historic ``black belt'' region, ``the whites of the black       belt have the most pressing and most intimate concern with       the maintenance of the established pattern of racial and       economic relations.'' By the 1960s, disenfranchisement came       with significant costs to Southern states and counties,       including threat of sustained protests and federal action;       in theory, this cost should be borne only when white       dominance on election day would be threatened with Black       enfranchisement. Indeed, empirical evidence indicates that       the immediate impact of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on       Black enfranchisement was greatest in the heavily-Black       counties of the Deep South, precisely where electoral       incentives to disenfranchise were strongest. Thus, while       the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow may be associated with       efforts to disenfranchise, the key differentiator within       the South was minority population size. Where minority       groups could influence politics, even if only as       significant members of coalitions with White voters,       efforts to restrict voting rights followed.        These incentives remain most powerful in states and       counties with significant racial/ethnic minority populations       today. Just as in the past, where a racial/ethnic group is a       larger share of the population, they will be more likely to       have substantial influence on election outcomes. Different       from past trends, and speaking to the success of the Voting       Rights Act in eliminating the most egregious forms of       disenfranchisement, campaigns, candidates, and voters       themselves now seek to leverage the power that large and/or       growing racial/ethnic minority populations have when given       the opportunity to vote. Indeed, voter turnout for racial/      ethnic minority groups is now significantly higher in states       and counties where minority citizens make up a larger than       average share of the population. Officeseeking by candidates       from minority groups is also far more common in heavily-      minority states and legislative districts, as are opposing       efforts to dilute minority voting strength via manipulation       of electoral systems and district boundaries.        Further discussion of recent trends in potential voting       rights violations is provided in Section III of this report,       but in short, the relationship between a state or county's       minority population size and efforts to disenfranchise       minority voters has a solid historical, theoretical, and       empirical basis. Thus, there is a clear need for federal       oversight to protect minority voting rights in jurisdictions       with large shares of minority voters today, and to provide a       flexible coverage formula that can account for growing       racial/ethnic minority populations in the future. This need       is most acute in the protection of Latino and Asian American/      Pacific Islander voting rights, whose population growth often       occurs in areas that did not have a history of repressing       African-American voting rights.          III. DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE POPULATION-LIMITED TRIGGER         If a population size-based trigger is to be used to       determine which jurisdictions warrant additional scrutiny in       the application of certain election practices, what       population threshold or thresholds should trigger coverage?       Again we must turn to the patterns of past voting rights       violations, but be cognizant of the need to ``draft another       formula based on current conditions.'' In this section, I       demonstrate that the pattern of potential and actual VRA       violations from 1982 to the present indicates that a racial/      ethnic group population size threshold of 20% is justifiable,       that such a formula would provide flexibility to address both       current and future needs as racial/ethnic group populations       change over time, and that specifying two racial/ethnic       groups must each meet the threshold appropriately considers       where policies could reasonably impede the voting rights of       racial/ethnic minority groups.      a. Tracking Potential Violations of Minority Voting Rights        To track previous potential violations of minority voting       rights, I rely on a database constructed by Dr. J. Morgan       Kousser. Dr. Kousser is professor emeritus of history and       social science at the California Institute of Technology, and       a leading expert on voting rights. Dr. Kousser's research,       and specifically a previous version of the database I use,       were discussed by Dr. Kousser in testimony to the       Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil       Liberties of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary in       October 2019. In that testimony, Dr. Kousser remarked that       his effort to ``create a database of all voting rights       actions under any federal or state statutes or constitutional       provisions'' was designed to allow ``evaluations of the       adequacy of past and potential coverage schemes if Congress       wishes to replace Section 4 of the VRA.'' It is in this       capacity that I use his database.        Dr. Kousser's database has approximately 3,540 legal cases       or proceedings related to minority voting rights from 1965 to       2018. Of these cases, 2,510 focus on potential violations of       Black voting rights, 801 with potential violations of       Hispanic/Latino voting rights, 32 with potential violations       of Asian American voting rights, and 135 with American Indian       or Alaska Native voting rights. Table 1 shows the number of       cases by group and by decade from 1965 to 2018, the most       recent year with comprehensive data in Dr. Kousser's       database. In Table 1 we see that the total number of cases       per decade peaked in the 1980s and 1990s. Cases where Black       and Native American voters were the primary groups of       interest peaked in the 1980s, while cases where Hispanic or       Asian American citizens were principal groups peaked in the       1990s.        Table 1 also provides separate statistics for cases       involving counties or towns subject to the Voting Rights Act       Section 5 preclearance provisions from 1965 to 2013. A       similar pattern of cases by decade and by race appears for       these jurisdictions in isolation, as prior to the       invalidation of Section 5 coverage in Shelby v. Holder the       vast majority of cases were in preclearance-covered       jurisdictions. Of course, the nature of Section 5 coverage       pre-Shelby meant that the strongest predictor of a lawsuit or       other action being taken on behalf of minority plaintiffs was       whether or not the county was subject to preclearance.       However, in every decade after the 1970s at least 100       cases were filed outside of Section 5 preclearance       jurisdictions.        In the more detailed analyses below, I focus on the period       from 1982 forward, as the 1982 amendments to the Voting       Rights Act and Gingles decision clarified the intent of the       VRA of 1965 with an eye to policies with discriminatory       effect, not just discriminatory intent. The post-1982 period       is also when the vast majority of ``successful'' voting       rights actions occurred, and the bulk of potential violations       of minority voting rights overall, constituting 74% of cases       in all jurisdictions and 70% of cases in jurisdictions       covered by Section 5 from 1965-2013. Finally,  [[Page H4454]]       I examine all cases of potential minority voting rights       violations, not just cases that resulted in an outcome       favorable to minority plaintiffs. Given the different legal       standards used to make judgements about vote dilution versus       vote denial, Section 5 versus Section 2 claims, and voting       rights violations more broadly over time, the more complete       picture of where plaintiffs indicated a voting rights       violation may have occurred is one appropriate metric for       determining where, e.g., U.S Department of Justice resources       would need to be deployed.        Finally, this report focuses on counties and states as       units of analysis, as Dr. Kousser's database is organized at       the state and county level. American Indian lands are also       important political units from the perspective of American       Indian voting rights, and a key part of both the Voting       Rights Act Section 203 language assistance formula and the       proposed coverage formula. However, violations of voting       rights occurring in or for those with residence in Indian       reservations are generally directed to the state or county       whose territory overlaps with those reservations.      b. Geographic Pattern of Potential Voting Rights Violations        Compiling Dr. Kousser's data, we see wide dispersion in       potential voting rights violations when examining state-level       suits and legal actions. Figure 1 shows states with a       statewide potential voting rights violation during the period       from 1982-2018. Color indicates which racial/ethnic group's       voting rights were most clearly impacted in the first alleged       statewide violation. Broadly speaking, the distribution of       first cases by race/ethnicity often coincides with which       groups make up the largest share of the racial/ethnic       minority population in each state. In the Deep South,       African-American plaintiffs were the first to allege a       statewide violation. In most of the Southwest, Latino       plaintiffs were first. In Alaska and Arizona, both of which       came under Section 5 preclearance as a result of historical       discrimination against Alaska Native and American Indian       populations, respectively, these groups were first to allege       a statewide violation of their voting rights.        Figure 2 documents which counties that have ever had a       violation or potential violation via litigation. Again, this       does not include the DOJ's More Information Request process,       which may mask additional potential violations that were       averted in Section 5 covered counties. As with the statewide       map in Figure 1, Figure 2 shows only counties with potential       voting rights violations occurring between 1982 and 2018.       Shading indicates the first group to bring a suit at the       county level, and counties in white did not have a county-      level suit. Again, we see a pattern broadly consistent with       the known distribution of racial/ethnic groups in the United       States, though the map makes it more clear that potential       voting rights violations are concentrated in the Deep South,       heavily-minority urban counties of the North and Midwest, and       some heavily--Latino and Native American areas of the       Southwest and West.      c. Data on Racial/Ethnic Group Population Size        Figures 1 and 2 are suggestive of a pattern of recent       potential voting rights violations similar to the historical       record I discuss in Section II of this report. To provide       more firm evidence on this dimension, I rely on data from the       U.S. Census Bureau that is contemporaneous to each potential       violation in Dr. Kousser's database. Specifically, I rely on       yearly Intercensal estimates of the voting-age population by       race/ethnicity from 1982 to the present at both the state and       county level. Yearly intercensal estimates for racial groups       other than Whites and African-Americans are not available at       the county level until 1990. Thus, for years from 1982-1990,       I interpolated the 1980 to 1990 state or county-level change       in the voting-age population by race and ethnicity,       providing trends in the non-Hispanic White, Black,       Hispanic, and Asian American/Pacific islander voting-age       populations. For years from 2010-2018, I rely on data from       the U.S. Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program       (PEP), which is broadly similar to the Intercensal       estimates.        As the above indicates, one advantage of a coverage trigger       based on racial/ethnic population size is the fact that all       data necessary to enact the formula is already collected,       compiled, and analyzed by the U.S. Census Bureau. A       determinations file, similar to that provided every five       years for establishing coverage under the population-based       formula for language assistance in Section 203 of the Voting       Rights Act, could be constructed by the Census Bureau and       provided to the Department of Justice for publication in the       Federal Register.      d. Correlating Potential Violations with Population Size        A descriptive analysis of the relationship between racial/      ethnic minority group population share and potential voting       rights violations confirms the patterns suggested by Figures       1 and 2, and validates the historical and theoretical       foundations for a population-limited trigger for coverage as       outlined in Section II of this report.        Dr. Kousser's database indicates that a majority of states       have had at least one potential minority voting rights       violation since 1982. In the 12 states that have not, no       single racial/ethnic group was 10% or more of the state's       voting-age population at any point in time between 1982 and       2018. However, in every state where a single racial/ethnic       group has been at least 10% of the state's voting-age       population, at least one suit or action has been brought at       the statewide level. On average, the first statewide       potential violation in a state occurred when the group in       question was 12% of the voting-age population. For states       that have never had a statewide violation, the average size       of the single largest racial/ethnic minority group is only       5.2%.        A county-level analysis provides additional insights. As       with states, counties that have had a violation or potential       violation of minority voting rights since 1982 had larger       minority populations at the time of their first potential       violation, on average. Since 1982, at least 804 counties have       had at least one potential violation of minority voting       rights occur in their jurisdiction. 61% of counties with       violations had their first violations happen when a single       racial/ethnic minority group was 20% or more of the       jurisdiction voting-age population. Furthermore, only 321       counties where a single racial/ethnic minority group makes up       more than 20% of the population have not had a voting rights-      related lawsuit, approximately one-third of the counties with       a minority population reaching this threshold.        Table 2 also indicates that the likelihood of a violation       increases sharply as the county population shifts from having       a single racial/ethnic group making up less than 10% of the       county's voting-age population, to 10-20%, to 20-30%. Beyond       the 20-30% category, increases in the percentage of counties       with a violation are significantly smaller. Indeed, once a       single non-white racial/ethnic group makes up a majority of       the county (the final row in Table 2), the likelihood of a       voting rights violation decreases relative to jurisdictions       where a single racial/ethnic group is nearly a majority of       the voting-age population, dropping to roughly the rate we       see in the 20-30% category.        Another way of visualizing this pattern is presented in       Figure 3. Figure 3 plots the share of counties with a       potential violation as a function of the size of the racial/      ethnic group at the time the violation occurred (or the size       of the largest racial/ethnic group in the county today, if no       potential violation occurred between 1982 and 2018). The blue       line is the moving average of the share of counties with a       potential violation (left side of chart) given the racial/      ethnic group size specified (bottom of the chart). The red       line in the middle of the chart denotes the point where a       county has even (50% yes, 50% no) odds of a potential       violation.        Figure 3 again shows a very strong relationship between the       size of the racial/ethnic minority population and the       likelihood of a potential voting rights violation. We see a       roughly linear increase in the likelihood of a violation as       the population approaches roughly 20%, with diminishing       returns to further increases in single minority group       population size before the probability begins to decrease       after 50% minority. Furthermore, the point of equal       likelihood of having a potential violation versus not occurs       when the racial/ethnic group whose rights may have been       violated is approximately 20% of the overall voting-age       population in the jurisdiction. Beyond 20%, counties have       better-than-even chances of having had a potential violation,       until roughly 75% when the likelihood of a violation drops       below 50-50 once again.        A similar pattern is present for counties with successful       cases, where courts determined (or appeared set to determine       according to defendants, as they were settled out of court)       that a violation of a group's voting rights had occurred.       Figure 4 shows these patterns at the county level. In Figure       4, we see almost exactly the same rate of successful cases as       a function of minority group population share as we do for       the number of cases overall (successful or not). The chance       of a successful voting rights case is better than 50-50 when       a minority group is about 25% of the voting-age population in       a county. Of course, not all voting rights-related actions       result in an outcome in favor of plaintiffs. However, Figure       4's close match with Figure 3 indicates that the relationship       between voting rights suits and minority group size is       not attributable to an increased number of unsuccessful       cases brought by minority plaintiffs in heavily-minority       counties.      e. Ensuring equal treatment of counties based on probability           of a violation        The analyses above demonstrate that once a racial/ethnic       minority group grows large enough to make up 20% of a       county's voting-age population, the probability of at least       one potential voting rights-related legal action reaches 50%.       Given the nature of the election practices that would be       subject to preclearance, in that these are commonly used       practices that are often tarnished by those seeking to       discriminate against minority voters, this threshold may be       an appropriate benchmark for determining where additional       scrutiny is warranted. However, it is important to consider       how various population thresholds balance the need to protect       voting rights with the potential to add an additional layer       of review of state and county election practices.        In any process where some jurisdictions are going to be       subject to additional scrutiny, while others are subject to       conventional review, there will be instances where after the       fact we see that the additional scrutiny did not result in       finding a violation or the conventional review revealed a       violation on its own. Therefore while the goal is  [[Page H4455]]       to minimize such instances, it is not realistic to eliminate       them entirely. With this in mind, Table 3 examines the       suitability of various single-group relative population size       thresholds in terms of the recent history of potential voting       rights violations in counties nationwide. Under the       population thresholds listed in the first column of Table 3,       a county would gain practice-based preclearance if it had a       single non-white racial/ethnic group's population making up       the indicated percentage of the voting-age population in the       county. The ``False Negative Rate'', also called Type I       error, indicates the percent of counties that would not be       covered via the indicated population threshold formula, but       did have a potential violation. The false negative rates in       Table 3 indicate that with all population thresholds higher       than 20%, more than half of counties having potential       violations would not have triggered practice-based       preclearance based on the population at the time of their       first potential violation.        The ``False Positive Rate,'' also called Type II error,       indicates the percent of counties that are covered via the       listed population threshold-based trigger, but have never had       a potential violation in Dr. Kousser's database. While       generally lower than the false negative rate, we do see that       at both the high end of the potential thresholds and low end       of potential thresholds, a larger share of jurisdictions       would be subject to preclearance despite never having a       voting rights suit filed against the jurisdiction.        The final column of Table 3, titled ``Overall Error Rate''       aggregates Type I and Type II error and shows the percent of       counties nationwide that are either incorrectly excluded (not       covered despite having had a violation) or incorrectly       included (covered despite never having a violation). While       differences between coverage thresholds are relatively small,       we do see that the 20% threshold for coverage minimizes the       overall number of counties with violations that are missed       and covered counties that have not had suits filed against       them in the past.        At the highest racial/ethnic minority population       percentages, Figure 3 shows that the rate of potential       violations decreases drastically. Table 3 also indicates that       the number of false positives begins to increase with       thresholds beyond 30%, as in recent decades heavily-minority       counties have not had potential voting rights violations       despite many of these counties being subject to preclearance       under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. From a theoretical       perspective, this is logical: in such places contemporary       methods used to violate minority voting rights are unlikely       to change the underlying dynamic of which racial/ethnic group       holds power, so attempts to disenfranchise are rare.       Therefore, in places where a single minority group is more       than 80% of the population, and therefore (numerical)       minority racial/ethnic group is less than 20%,       disenfranchisement is similarly unlikely. Crafting a two-      group formula as such also accords with the reality that 15th       Amendment protections apply to all Americans, not just       members of specific racial/ethnic minority groups.        Table 4 documents the effect of using a two-group threshold       on false negative, false positive, and overall error rates.       Error rates are little changed from Table 3, as today, few       counties have a single racial/ethnic minority group at or       exceeding 80% of the county's population. However, the small       number of counties that do have such a high minority       population have no recent history of voting rights       violations, and with future demographic shifts more counties       will likely fall into this category in the future. Requiring       that two racial/ethnic groups are at least 20% of the voting-      age population in a jurisdiction thus both recognizes the       ``current conditions'' cited by C.J. Roberts in the Shelby       decision, and acknowledges how our country will ``change'' in       the future.        The 20% threshold proposed above also serves to allocate       legal resources as efficiently as possible. Due to the nature       of the election procedures that would be subject to       preclearance, where policies may be facially race-neutral but       used to discriminate under certain circumstances, it may be       useful to concentrate additional effort on places where       discriminatory effect is more likely to occur. Counties       unlikely to have a violation may not need extra scrutiny for       these commonplace practices. Of course, jurisdictions under       the threshold could still be subject to litigation under       Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as they are today. These       jurisdictions may also fall into coverage as their racial/      ethnic minority population grows.                                IV. CONCLUSION         For over 150 years, the federal government has played a key       role in preserving the voting rights of racial/ethnic       minorities. After the Civil War, the erosion of minority       voting rights was most severe in states of the former       Confederacy with large African-American populations; the       Voting Rights Act of 1965 targeted these states and counties       and secured the right to vote for all Americans. In the words       of C.J. Roberts, ``there is no denying that, due to the       Voting Rights Act, our Nation has made great strides,'' but       the changing demographic and political profile of the country       persuaded the Court to call for a formula based on ``current       conditions'' of racial discrimination in voting that ``no one       doubts'' still exist.        In this report, I provided the rationale for one such       formula. Tracking thousands of voting rights-related judicial       actions in recent decades, and buttressed by historical,       theoretical, and empirical evidence regarding where voting       rights violations are likely to occur, I show a strong       relationship between the racial/ethnic composition of a state       or jurisdiction and the likelihood that the jurisdiction will       see a violation of racial/ethnic minority voting rights.       Evaluating tradeoffs between various population size-based       thresholds, I also demonstrate that one threshold in       particular, 20%, ensures fairness in which jurisdictions are       subject to the added scrutiny of a tailored preclearance       provision.        The Voting Rights Act of 1965's special provisions were a       key tool in the federal government's arsenal to ensure all       Americans could participate in the electoral process. A       flexible, forward-looking formula will ensure that the Act       can continue to secure our rights far into the future. No       other action of the current Congress may be more       consequential than the reinvigoration of this commitment to       the American people.                                   ____                                                    August 23, 2021.      Please Support H.R. 4, John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement           Act         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 220       national organizations committed to promoting and protecting       the civil and human rights of all persons in the United       States, and the 96 undersigned organizations, we write in       strong support of H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act.        In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act to outlaw       racial discrimination in voting, and it became our nation's       most successful and consequential civil rights law.       Previously, many states barred Black voters from       participating in the political system through literacy tests,       poll taxes, voter intimidation, and violence. By outlawing       the tests and devices that prevented people of color from       voting, the Voting Rights Act and its prophylactic       preclearance formula put teeth into the 15th Amendment's       guarantee that no citizen can be denied the right to vote       because of the color of their skin.        Only 15 years ago, Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights       Act for the fourth time with sweeping bipartisan support. The       House of Representatives reauthorized the legislation by a       390-33 vote and the Senate passed it unanimously, 98-0. Given       the importance of the Voting Rights Act, Congress undertook       that reauthorization with care and deliberation--holding 21       hearings, hearing from more than 90 witnesses, and compiling       a record of more than 15,000 pages of evidence of continuing       racial discrimination in voting.                           Shelby County v. Holder         In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County       v. Holder eviscerated the most powerful provision of the       Voting Rights Act: the Section 5 preclearance system. This       provision applied to nine states and localities in another       six states. These jurisdictions were required to obtain       preclearance from the Justice Department or the U.S. District       Court for the District of Columbia before implementing any       change in a voting practice or procedure.        Section 5 was immensely successful in blocking proposed       voting restrictions in states and localities with histories       of racial discrimination. It also ensured that changes to       voting rules were public, transparent, and evaluated to       protect voters against discrimination based on race and       language. But, in Shelby County, Chief Justice John Roberts       on behalf of the majority, declared that ``Our country has       changed.'' The Court held that the formula identifying       jurisdictions subject to preclearance was decades-old and       outdated, functionally halting the preclearance requirement.       However, the Court invited Congress to assess ``current       conditions'' to update the formula for deciding which       jurisdictions should be covered by preclearance.        Despite the best efforts of The Leadership Conference and       its many member organizations to protect voting rights and       promote civic participation, the impact of eight years of       overt and covert anti-voter tactics has had a lasting impact.       The Supreme Court's invalidation of the preclearance formula       released an immediate and sustained flood of new voting       restrictions in formerly covered states. Without the Voting       Rights Act's tools to fight the most blatant forms of       discrimination, people of color continue to face barriers to       exercising their most important civil right, including voter       intimidation, felon disenfranchisement laws built on top of a       system of mass incarceration, burdensome and costly voter ID       requirements, and purges from the voter rolls. States have       also cut back early voting opportunities, eliminated same-day       voter registration, and shuttered polling places.        The Leadership Conference commissioned several state       reports that were prepared by our partner civil rights       organizations and allies to document the breadth and depth of       recent voting discrimination in ten states across the       country. These reports powerfully demonstrate that Congress       has an urgent imperative to restore the Voting Rights Act.       Individually and collectively, they reveal that voting       discrimination after Shelby County is pervasive, persistent,       and adaptive, sometimes taking new forms but no less       pernicious. The reports document voter restrictions passed       this year and cite the recent history of voting       discrimination in these states. This is the ``current       discrimination'' on which Congress must update the       preclearance formula and make several additional amendments       to the Voting Rights Act  [[Page H4456]]       so voters of color everywhere can fully participate in the       political process. All of the state reports have or will be       introduced into the congressional record of the August 16,       2021, House Judiciary hearing on Oversight of the Voting       Rights Act: Potential Legislative Reforms.                  Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee         Furthermore, just last month, the Supreme Court ruled in       Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee that two       discriminatory Arizona voting laws did not violate Section 2       of the Voting Rights Act. In its opinion in Brnovich, the       Court disregards the congressional purpose of Section 2,       which is to provide a powerful means to combat race       discrimination in voting and representation. The majority       departs from decades of precedent enforcing Section 2       according to Congress' intent, and it creates new       ``guideposts'' that will ineffectively identify and eradicate       discriminatory policies and practices. The decision relies on       a limited interpretation of the Voting Rights Act that will       make it more difficult to challenge discriminatory voting       laws. This decision reiterates the need for Congress to pass       the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore the       legislative purpose of Section 2.    Evidence of the Need for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act         Discriminatory voting practices are not merely the province       of those states with a long history of discrimination.       Pernicious practices such as voter purging and restrictive       identification requirements--which disproportionately affect       voters of color--occur in states throughout the nation. As we       commemorated the 56th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act       earlier this month, it is important to note that between       January 1 and July 14, 2021, at least 18 states enacted 30       new laws that restrict our freedom to vote, and more than 400       bills with restrictive provisions have been introduced in 49       states in the 2021 legislative sessions.        During the 117th Congress, the Senate Committee on the       Judiciary, House Committee on the Judiciary, and the       Committee on House Administration have held a total of 14       hearings and found significant evidence that barriers to       voter participation remain for people of color and language-      minority voters.        The Senate Committee on the Judiciary has held three       hearings on voting rights:        Restoring the Voting Rights Act after Brnovich and Shelby       County (July 14, 2021); Supreme Court Fact-Finding and the       Distortion of American Democracy (April 27, 2021); Jim Crow       2021: The Latest Assault on the Right to Vote (April 20,       2021).        The House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the       Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties has held six       hearings on voting rights:        Oversight of the Voting Rights Act: Potential Legislative       Reforms (August 16, 2021); The Need to Enhance the Voting       Rights Act: Practice-Based Coverage (July 27, 2021); The       Implications of Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee and       Potential Legislative Responses (July 16, 2021); The Need to       Enhance the Voting Rights Act: Preliminary Injunctions, Bail-      in Coverage, Election Observers, and Notice (June 29, 2021);       Oversight of the Voting Rights Act: A Continuing Record of       Discrimination (May 27, 2021); Oversight of the Voting Rights       Act: The Evolving Landscape of Voting Discrimination (April       22, 2021).        The House Administration's Subcommittee on Elections has       held five investigatory hearings with 35 witnesses, collected       numerous reports and documents, and released a comprehensive       report.        Voting In America: A National Perspective On The Right To       Vote, Methods Of Election, Jurisdictional Boundaries, And       Redistricting (June 24, 2021); Voting In America: The       Potential For Polling Place Quality And Restrictions On       Opportunities To Vote To Interfere With Free And Fair Access       To The Ballot (June 11, 2021); Voting In America: The       Potential For Voter ID Laws, Proof-Of-Citizenship Laws, And       Lack Of Multi-Lingual Support To Interfere With Free And Fair       Access To The Ballot (May 24, 2021); Voting In America: The       Potential For Voter List Purges To Interfere With Free And       Fair Access To The Ballot (May 6, 2021); Voting In America:       Ensuring Free And Fair Access To The Ballot (April 1, 2021).    The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act Restores and Modernizes                           the Voting Rights Act         The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed with leadership       from both the Republican and Democratic parties, and the       reauthorizations of its enforcement provisions were signed       into law each time by Republican presidents: President Nixon       in 1970, President Ford in 1975, President Reagan in 1982,       and President Bush in 2006. For more than half a century,       protecting citizens from racial discrimination in voting has       been bipartisan work.        The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act fills a       distinct and critical role in protecting the freedom to vote       and ensuring elections are safe and accessible. When it comes       to our elections, we all want an open and transparent process       we can trust, where Americans have equal freedom to vote,       whether we live in a small town or big city, or the coasts or       the Midwest. Passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act will fulfill part of that promise of a       democracy that works for--and includes--us all.        The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore       the VRA in the following ways:        The Act would update criteria under the ``geographic       trigger'' for identifying states and localities required to       obtain federal review of voting changes before they are       implemented.        Under the ``practice-based'' trigger, every state and       locality nationwide that is sufficiently diverse would be       required to obtain federal review before enacting specific       types of voting changes that are known to be discriminatory       in their use to silence the growing political power of voters       of color.        The Act would require all states and localities to provide       public notice to all voters of certain voting changes.        The Act would address the Brnovich decision by clarifying       factors that voters of color can use to prove a vote dilution       or vote denial claim under Section 2 of the VRA and restoring       voters' full ability to challenge racial discrimination in       voting in court.        The Act would allow the Department of Justice and voters of       color to challenge changes in a voting rule that would make       voters of color worse off in terms of their voting rights       than the status quo.        The Act would expand authority for courts to ``bail-in''       jurisdictions to the preclearance process and would update       the ability of jurisdictions to ``bail-out'' of the       preclearance process once they demonstrate a record of not       harming voters of color.        The Act would grant the Department of Justice authority to       compel the production of documents relevant to investigations       of potential voting rights violations prior to filing an       enforcement action.        The U.S. Attorney General would have authority to request       federal observers anywhere there is a serious threat of       racial discrimination in voting.        The Act would provide voters with additional protection by       easing the standard for when courts can temporarily block       certain types of voting changes while the change is under       review in court. This is important because once a voter is       discriminated against in an election, it cannot be undone.                                  Conclusion         When President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act       of 1965, he declared the law a triumph and said, ``Today we       strike away the last major shackle of . . .  fierce and       ancient bonds.'' But 56 years later, the shackles of white       supremacy still restrict the full exercise of our rights and       freedom to vote.        For democracy to work for all of us, it must include us       all. When certain communities cannot access the ballot and       when they are not represented in the ranks of power, our       democracy is in peril. The coordinated, anti-democratic       campaign to restrict the vote targets the heart of the       nation's promise: that every voice and every eligible vote       count. Congress must meet the urgency of this moment and pass       the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This bill will       restore the essential provision of the Voting Rights Act that       blocks discriminatory voting practices before they go into       effect, putting a transparent process in place for protecting       the right to vote. It will also restore other provisions to       help bring down the barriers erected to silence Black, Brown,       Native, young, and new Americans and ensure everyone has a       voice in the decisions impacting our lives.        On March 7, 1965, just a few months before President       Johnson would sign the Voting Rights Act into law, then 25-      year-old John Lewis led more than 600 people across the       Edmund Pettus Bridge to demand equal voting rights. State       troopers unleashed brutal violence against the marchers.       Lewis himself was beaten and bloodied. But he never gave up       the fight. For decades, the congressman implored his       colleagues in Congress to realize the promise of equal       opportunity for all in our democratic process. Before his       death, he wrote: ``Time is of the essence to preserve the       integrity and promises of our democracy.'' Members of this       body must now heed his call with all the force they can       muster and support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement       Act.

Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021--Rep.                      Sewell, D-AL, and 218 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.       4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2021       (VRAA).        The right to vote freely, the right to vote fairly, the       right to have your vote counted is fundamental. In the last       election, all told, more than 150 million Americans of every       age, of every race, of every background exercised their right       to vote.        This historic level of participation in the face of a once-      in-a-century pandemic should have been celebrated by       everyone. Instead, some have sought to delegitimize the       election and make it harder to vote, in many cases by       targeting the methods of voting that made it possible for       many voters to participate. These efforts violate the most       basic ideals of America.        Yet another massive wave of discriminatory action may be       imminent as we enter a new legislative redistricting cycle.       Unfortunately, incumbents too often cling to power by drawing       district lines to favor their own prospects at the expense of       minority communities, choosing their voters instead of the       other way around.        While anti-voter action undermines democracy for all       Americans, we know that communities of color often suffer the       worst effects of these measures--and all too often, that is       not by accident.        The sacred right to vote is under attack across the       country.        The VRAA will strengthen vital legal protections to ensure       that all Americans have a fair opportunity to participate in       our democracy. Among other things, it would create a new       framework for allowing DOJ to review voting changes in       jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to ensure that       they do not discriminate based on race. It would also clarify       the scope of legal tools designed to challenge discriminatory       voting laws in court, ensuring that the Voting Rights Act       offers protection against modern forms of voter suppression.        In an essay published shortly after he died, Congressman       John Lewis wrote, ``Democracy is not a state. It is an       act[.]'' This bill not only bears his name, it heeds his       call. The Administration looks forward to working with       Congress as the VRAA proceeds through the legislative process       to ensure that the bill achieves lasting reform consistent       with Congress' broad constitutional authority to protect       voting rights and to strengthen our democracy.                                   ____             [From the Brennan Center for Justice, Aug. 20, 2021]                         Voter Suppression in 2020                            (By William Wilder)                               I. Introduction         In key respects, the 2020 elections demonstrated the       strength and resilience of America's electoral system. Voter       turnout smashed records in almost every state, and despite       unprecedented challenges from the pandemic, we did not suffer       an election administration catastrophe. Opponents of voting       rights suggest that these successes mean that voting barriers       are no longer a significant concern and that our country has       moved past the era of voter suppression. However, a closer       look into turnout numbers reveals persistent and troubling       racial disparities that are due in part to racial       discrimination in the voting process. And in the 2020       election cycle, voter suppression was alive and well.        Overall, 70.9 percent of eligible white voters cast ballots       in the 2020 elections, compared with only 58.4 percent of       non-white voters. Despite significant gains in overall voter       participation, the turnout gap between white and non-white       voters has gone virtually unchanged since 2014 and has in       fact grown since its modern-era lows in 2008 and 2012,       according to a recent Brennan Center analysis.        During the same period, racially discriminatory voter       suppression entered a new age. After the 2010 elections, for       the first time since the peak of the Jim Crow era, states       across the country began to enact laws making it more       difficult to vote. This wave of voter suppression was       intertwined with race and the nation's changing racial       demographics and was, at least in part, a backlash against       rising turnout among communities of color contributing to the       election of the nation's first Black president. Efforts to       suppress the votes of communities of color accelerated in       2013, when the Supreme Court gutted a key part of the Voting       Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder. In the eight years       since, and especially in 2020, these trends continued.        Racial discrimination in voting takes many forms, ranging       from blatant and open attempts to restrict access to voting       among communities of color to more subtle policies that place       heavier burdens on certain communities. In 2020, voters of       color faced the full spectrum of racial voter suppression.       This report provides an overview of the various forms of       racially discriminatory voter suppression that took place in       the 2020 elections and their aftermath.        The purpose of this report is to catalog instances of       discriminatory voting changes and practices occurring in and       since 2020 and provide context for the broader political       movement behind many of these changes. In terms of voter       suppression, 2020 was a banner year, and not just because of       the volume of racially discriminatory changes and incidents.       Increasingly, the public officials and political operatives       behind these voting changes are acknowledging that the intent       of their new laws and policies is to exclude certain people       from the electorate and bring about particular outcomes.        For example, as Arizona legislators were debating new       restrictive voting bills, State Rep. John Kavanagh stated       that Arizona Republicans ``don't mind putting security       measures in that won't let everybody vote'' and that he was       more concerned with the ``quality of votes'' than with       overall voter turnout. When defending two of Arizona's       restrictive voting laws before the Supreme Court in March       2021, the attorney for the Republican National Committee       admitted that the party's interest in the laws was to avoid       being at ``a competitive disadvantage relative to       Democrats.'' And when discussing proposals to expand access       to mail voting, President Trump stated that an expansion of       early and mail voting would lead to ``levels of voting that       if you agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in       this country again.''        These statements do not represent judicial findings of       intentional discrimination. But when viewed alongside the       long list of instances of discrimination and racial       disparities in the 2020 election cycle, these statements       offer a window into discriminatory intent playing out in real       time. This public rhetoric provides important context for       understanding the full spectrum of discriminatory effects       discussed in this report.        Examples of discriminatory voting practices--including new       restrictive legislation, discriminatory voter roll purges,       long lines and closed polling places, voter intimidation and       misinformation, and efforts to overthrow elections through       litigation or by invalidating ballots cast by mail--must all       be viewed in the context of these obvious statements of       intent. All of these instances are evidence of the same       underlying problem: the persistence and evolution of       unconstitutional racial discrimination in our election       system.                                   ____             [From the Brennan Center for Justice, July 29, 2021]                          Representation for Some    The Discriminatory Nature of Limiting Representation to Adult Citizens   (By Yurij Rudensky, Ethan Herenstein, Peter Miller, Gabriella Limon,                               and Annie Lo)                                 Introduction         Every 10 years, political districts at all levels of       government are redrawn to make sure they are equal in       population as required by the U.S. Constitution. Currently       every state apportions representatives and draws       congressional and state legislative districts on the basis of       a state's total population. That is, when districts are       drawn, all people living in the state, including children and       noncitizens, are counted for the purposes of representation.        However, some Republican political operatives and elected       officials aim to unsettle this long-standing practice by       excluding children and noncitizens from the population       figures used to draw state legislative districts. Rather than       count everyone, states would draw districts based only on the       adult citizen population. This approach is rooted in an       explicitly discriminatory plan to disadvantage growing Latino       (and, to a lesser extent, Asian American and Black)       communities. It would enable states to pack children and       noncitizens, who are disproportionately Latino, Asian       American, and Black,  [[Page H4458]]       into sprawling, supersized legislative districts. Residents       of these districts would receive less representation than       they do under the total population approach that states       currently use, and this could have tremendous consequences       for the funding of crucial public goods--including schools       and transportation--that are used by everyone in a community       regardless of age or citizenship status.        Making such a break with current practice and precedent       would be of dubious legality and would leave states       vulnerable to a host of legal challenges. It also would have       major practical implications for redistricting. This study       looks at what such a change would mean for representation and       the allocation of political power in the United States by       focusing on its impact three demographically distinct states:       Texas, Georgia, and Missouri.        Our findings include the following:        Citizen children, not noncitizens, would account for the       overwhelming majority of those excluded in adult citizen-      based districts. Citizen children make up more than 70       percent of those who would be excluded in Texas, 80 percent       in Georgia, and 90 percent in Missouri.        Large portions of the population in all three states would       no longer be counted in adult citizen-based districts. Nearly       36 percent of the total population in Texas, 30 percent in       Georgia, and 25 percent in Missouri would be excluded from       the apportionment of legislative seats.        Communities of color would be disproportionately impacted.       Latino and Asian American communities in particular would       suffer substantially greater exclusion than their white       counterparts. While only about 20 percent of the white       population across the three states would be left uncounted,       nearly 30 percent of the Black population and more than 50       percent of the Latino and Asian American populations would be       excluded from legislative districts. The situation in Georgia       would be particularly stark, with nearly 70 percent of Latino       residents, most of whom are children, excluded.        Diverse metropolitan areas that support majority-minority       districts would cede representation to whiter, more rural       regions. The Houston, Dallas, and Rio Grande Valley regions       of Texas would see sharp reductions in representation. In       Georgia, the apportionment shift would hit metro Atlanta. And       in Missouri, the representational losses would flow from       areas around Kansas City and St. Louis. In all three states,       many of the current districts that provide Latino and Black       communities an opportunity to secure representatives of their       choice would no longer be viable or would need to be       significantly reconfigured.        Many of the areas that would be most impacted by an       apportionment shift face deep inequities and new challenges,       underscoring their urgent need for full representation. In       Missouri, losses in representation would be borne primarily       by Black neighborhoods in Kansas City and St. Louis that were       formally segregated during the Jim Crow era and that continue       to suffer from disinvestment. In Texas, under-populated       districts, which would need to expand to bring in additional       adult citizens, include much of historically Black Houston as       well as overwhelmingly Latino areas, including colonias near       the U.S.-Mexico border that increasingly face infrastructural       and climate-related environmental dangers. In Georgia,       representational losses would be concentrated in the rapidly       diversifying suburbs of Atlanta, where communities of color       are taking on historically white political establishments to       address urgent political needs around education and policing.                                   ____             [From the Brennan Center for Justice, Aug. 20, 2021]    Racial Turnout Gap Grew in Jurisdictions Previously Covered by the                             Voting Rights Act             (By Kevin Morris, Peter Miller, and Coryn Grange)         In 2013, when Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the       Supreme Court's majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder,       he argued that the Voting Rights Act of 1965's preclearance       requirement under Section 5 was no longer needed because       ``African-American voter turnout has come to exceed white       voter turnout in five of the six States [Alabama, Georgia,       Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina] originally       covered by Sec. 5 with a gap in the sixth State of less than       one half of one percent [Virginia].'' Although this was true       in 2012--and only 2012--the white-Black turnout gap in these       states reopened in subsequent years, and by 2020, white       turnout exceeded Black turnout in five of the six states.                Replicating the Shelby County opinion methods         Using the same source of census data that was used in the       Shelby County opinion, we show that the racial turnout gap       has increased in most jurisdictions that were previously       covered by preclearance. Racial turnout rates are calculated       by dividing the number of ballots cast by the estimated       citizen population above the age of 18. This analysis was       compiled from the past 24 years of general-election voter       data from eight states. The states used are based on the       eight states the Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA), as       introduced in 2019, will likely cover, according to recent       congressional testimony by George Washington University law       professor Peyton McCrary. Those states are Alabama, Florida,       Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South       Carolina, and Texas--all of which were covered in whole or in       part by the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act       before Shelby County.        Broad conclusions made about the turnout of eligible Latino       and Asian voters in states where they are underrepresented       can be imprecise due to the small sample size provided by       census data. We controlled for this deficiency in data by       only analyzing states' Latino and Asian American turnout for       years that had at least 30 Latino and Asian American eligible       voters accounted for. Overall, we found that the larger the       Latino and Asian American population of states, the closer       the size the white-nonwhite turnout gap mirrored the results       of the Brennan Center's examination of the same gap at a       nationwide level, due to the greater representation of these       undercounted groups. When this wasn't the case, the white-      nonwhite gap more closely mirrored the white-Black gap.        We also believe the white-nonwhite gap may be       underestimated, as the census data we use for analysis fails       to provide information on Native American voter turnout, a       group that is significantly impacted by discriminatory voting       laws. However, we do know from the National Congress of       American Indians that registered voters in this group have a       lower turnout rate than other racial groups, which provides       the basis for our assumption.   Racial turnout gaps in jurisdictions to be covered by the Voting Rights                              Advancement Act         While in 2012, just before the Shelby County decision, the       white-Black turnout gap was shrinking in the states we       analyzed, and in many instances even briefly closed, this       trend has reversed in the years since. In 2012, seven out of       the eight states had Black voter turnout higher than that of       white voters. In 2020, the reverse is true--in only one of       the eight states was Black turnout higher than white turnout.        In a few states, this reversal is especially alarming.       Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas had higher turnout gaps       in 2020 than at any point in the past 24 years. South       Carolina's white-Black turnout gap widened the most,       expanding by a staggering 20.9 percentage points within the       eight years since Shelby County. While Black turnout exceeded       white turnout in 2012, white turnout was more than 15       percentage points higher than Black turnout in 2020.        A similar trend can be seen in the gap between white voters       and all nonwhite voters. The total white-nonwhite turnout gap       has grown since 2012 in all of the eight states likely to be       covered under the VRAA. There is sufficient data to conclude       that the gap has increased for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians       in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and       Texas. In Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the sample       sizes in the available 2020 census data are too small for       Hispanic and Asian voters to make much of a difference in an       overall white-nonwhite turnout gap estimation that is       distinct from the white-Black turnout gap in those states.       Notably, North Carolina went from having a larger share of       nonwhite voters represented in 2012 with a white-nonwhite gap       of -9.3 percentage points to having a gap of 5.4 percentage       points, a jump of 14.7 percentage points, far greater than       the national average of 4.6 percentage points.        Overall, we see that the growth in the racial turnout gaps       between 2012 and 2020 were even starker in the states likely       to be subject to preclearance under the VRAA than those seen       nationwide. Seven out of the eight states had white-nonwhite       turnout gaps that grew more than the national rate of 4.6       percentage points between 2012 and 2020. And in four out of       the eight states to be subject to preclearance under the       VRAA, the white-Black turnout gap grew more than the national       rate of 10.3 percentage points from 2012 to 2020.        Expanding the analysis to other nonwhite groups also       reveals that, even in 2012, progress on closing racial       turnout gaps was not as significant as the Shelby County       decision suggested. The Court only examined the white-Black       turnout gap, which did temporarily close in many states in       2012, likely due to Barack Obama being on the ballot and       Black voter turnout subsequently surging. But with the       exception of Latino voter turnout briefly surpassing white       turnout in Florida in 2012 and Louisiana in 2012 and 2016,       Latino voter turnout has lagged behind white voter turnout       for the last 24 years in every state where those rates are       measurable.                          Shelby County's aftermath         In 2013, the Supreme Court suggested that the closing of       the racial turnout gap supported the conclusion that the need       for preclearance was over. As this analysis shows, in the       years following the Shelby County decision, these racial       turnout gaps widened once again. The reopening of the racial       turnout gap likely has many causes, and it is possible that       the ending of the preclearance condition has played a role.       What is clear, however, is that the trends identified by the       Supreme Court have reversed themselves with alarming speed.                                   ____             [From the Brennan Center for Justice, Aug. 6, 2021]            Large Racial Turnout Gap Persisted in 2020 Election                     (By Kevin Morris and Coryn Grange)         In the 2020 election, voter turnout surged as more       Americans cast ballots than in any  [[Page H4459]]       presidential election in a century, despite a global       pandemic. This was true for the entire electorate as well as       for each racial group--more Black Americans voted in 2020       than any presidential election since 2012, and Latino       Americans and Asian Americans also surpassed their previous       turnout records. (Unfortunately, we don't have comparable       figures for Native Americans.)        These successes have been and should be celebrated.       However, they must not be mistaken for signs that racial       discrimination in voting is no longer an enormous problem,       one that continues to advantage white voters to a degree that       must be remedied.        The 2020 election must also be remembered for another       turnout statistic: 70.9 percent of white voters cast ballots       while only 58.4 percent of nonwhite voters did. As the graph       below shows, 62.6 percent of Black American voters, 53.7       percent of Latino American voters, and 59.7 percent of Asian       American voters cast ballots in 2020.        There is ample evidence that the sorts of barriers being       introduced this year disproportionately reduce turnout for       voters of color. The gaps between white and nonwhite voters       are bound to get worse. That's why it's necessary to reverse       these new voting restrictions.                   Narrowing the gap, but only temporarily         The difference between white and nonwhite voter turnout has       remained relatively unchanged over the last six presidential       elections, with a few notable fluctuations. In 2008 and 2012,       Barack Obama was on the ballot, and turnout among Black       voters in those elections was higher than at any point since       1996. And in 2012, the gap between white and nonwhite voter       turnout narrowed to 8 percentage points, the lowest since       1996.        The graph below shows that after reaching that record low       in 2012, the turnout gap expanded once again between white       voters and nonwhite voters, reaching 12.6 percentage points       in the 2016 presidential election and 12.5 in 2020.        The graph also shows a decrease in nonwhite voter turnout       between the 2008 and 2012 elections. After the record turnout       in 2008, many state legislatures reacted by quickly passing a       spate of new restrictive voting laws that made it       disproportionately difficult for voters of color to cast       ballots.        In 2013, the Supreme Court used the narrowing of the       turnout gap between white and Black voters in 2008 and 2012,       as seen in the following graph, to justify gutting key       protections against racial discrimination in the Voting       Rights Act of 1965. That ruling in Shelby County v. Holder       made it easier for states to enact restrictive policies.          The gaps between white voters and individual racial groups         2021 looks like 2009 in that high nonwhite voter turnout in       the presidential election has been followed by restrictive       voting laws, but there's a crucial difference. As the graph       above indicates, the racial turnout gap narrowed between 2004       and 2008, but not between 2016 and 2020. The 2021 backlash is       coming at a point when the disparities in turnout between       racial groups are significantly larger than they were in 2008       and 2012.        While the gap between nonwhite voters and white voters has       stayed about the same in the 2016 and 2020 elections, the       gaps between white voters and voters of specific racial       groups have varied. As the graph below demonstrates, the       white-Asian gap narrowed significantly, from 16.3 percentage       points in 2016 to 11.3 points last year, even as the white-      Black turnout gap widened relative to 2016, going from 5.9       percentage points to 8.3 points. This is not to say that the       white-Asian gap closed. As the graph makes clear, the white-      Asian gap had previously been very large, and although the       white-Asian turnout gap reached its lowest level in at least       two decades in 2020, white voter turnout was still more than       10 percentage points higher than that of Asian Americans.        This narrowing of the white-Asian gap was offset by an       increase in the white-Black turnout gap from 2016 to 2020. As       the graph shows, the white-Black gap has consistently grown       since 2012. In 2020, it reached the highest point in a       presidential election since at least 1996.        The white-Latino turnout gap has previously been very       large, and the same was true in 2020. At 17.2 percentage       points, the 2020 white-Latino turnout gap was larger than the       gaps between white voters and other racial groups, and it       remained virtually unchanged from 2016.        As noted earlier, the Census Bureau data we draw on for       this analysis fails to give us insight into the relative       turnout of another group regularly impacted by discriminatory       voting laws: Native Americans. However, we do know from the       National Congress of American Indians that registered voters       in this group have a lower turnout rate than other racial       groups and face unique difficulties accessing the ballot box       along with the ones faced by other nonwhite Americans.                          2008 backlash versus today         Like the backlash after high turnout in 2008, we are now       experiencing another wave of restrictive voting laws, along       with Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, another       Supreme Court ruling that weakens the Voting Rights Act and       will make challenging racially discriminatory voting laws       even harder. This backlash, however, does not come on the       heels of the narrowest racial turnout gap in a generation.       This time, it follows a racial turnout gap that remained       steady and even grew for Black Americans.        Across the United States, political organizers successfully       mobilized communities of color in 2020. But the record-      breaking overall turnout was not enough to close the racial       turnout gap. And in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's       Brnovich decision in, the Voting Rights Act's protections for       racial minorities are weaker than ever. It is imperative to       stop the new restrictive voting laws and provide tools to       fight race discrimination in voting.                                   ____    [From the Committee on House Administration, Chairperson Zoe Lofgren     (D-Calif.), Subcommittee on Elections, 117th Congress, July, 2021]     Report on Voting in America: Ensuring Free and Fair Access to the                                   Ballot               (Prepared by Chair G.

The Subcommittee extends further thanks to the numerous       civil rights organizations, democracy and voting advocates       and organizations, and researchers whose work and reports       contributed to the body of work on access to the ballot; the       witnesses who testified before the Committee on House       Administration and who testified on behalf of the Committee's       Minority during the Subcommittee's hearings: and to each       witness who appeared before the Subcommittee in the 116th       Congress and whose testimony contributed to the writing of       this report.        Finally, the Subcommittee extends its deep thanks to Elvis       A. Norquay, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa       Indians, a veteran of this country, and a voter, whose       testimony before the Subcommittee in February 2020 on being       denied the ability to vote serves as a powerful reminder that       no person should be disenfranchised in America. Mr. Norquay       is no longer with us, but may his memory continue to be a       blessing and an inspiration.                             Executive Summary         Since our founding, Americans have not enjoyed equal access       to the ballot. Indeed, only a small fraction of the       population cast ballots in the election elevating George       Washington as our first president. Throughout our history,       the country has made strides forward, but that progress was       neither linear nor uncontested, and access to the ballot       remains unequal. Following nearly 100 years of suppression       and discrimination in the post-Civil War United States, and a       decades-long fight for equality and access to the vote, on       August 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting       Rights Act of 1965 into law. The purpose of the Voting Rights       Act was to, ``banish the blight of racial discrimination in       voting.'' And for nearly 50 years it served this purpose.        However, in 2013, the Supreme Court undercut a key       provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v.       Holder. In finding the Section 4(b) coverage formula       unconstitutional, the Section 5 preclearance provisions were       rendered essentially inoperable. States that were once       covered by the Voting Rights Act (``VRA''), and therefore       required to preclear their voting changes with the U.S.       Department of Justice to ensure they did not have a       discriminatory impact on minority voters, were now free to       enact changes without oversight, and with only the threat of       reactive litigation under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act       or the Constitution standing in their way. Since the Court's       decision in Shelby, states across the country have enacted       new, suppressive voting and  [[Page H4460]]       election administration laws that disproportionately and       discriminatorily impact minority voters.        On July 1, 2021, the Supreme Court undermined the Voting       Rights Act yet again in Brnovich v. DNC. Writing for the       majority, Justice Samuel Alito weakened the protections       Congress explicitly wrote into the statute in 1982 and       reauthorized in 2006, and instead set forth a new set of       guideposts that will arguably make it harder to combat       discriminatory restrictions on voting. In her dissent,       Justice Elena Kagan wrote, ``the majority writes its own set       of rules, limiting Section 2 from multiple directions.       Wherever it can, the majority gives a cramped reading to       broad language.''        Time and again, in courtrooms across the country, it has       been proven that racially polarized voting has existed at the       ballot box since 1870, when the Fifteenth Amendment was       ratified, and it persists today. Millions of Black, Latino,       Asian American, Native American, and other minority voters       have again become the targets of voter suppression.       COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION AND SUBCOMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS         The Committee on House Administration was established in       1947. Oversight of federal elections became one of the       Committee's chief tasks at its inception. After more than 70       years, the Committee's principal functions still include       oversight of federal elections. Under Rule X of the Rules of       the House, the Committee on House Administration has       jurisdiction over ``Election of the President, Vice       President, Members, Senators, Delegates, or the Resident       Commissioner; . . . and federal elections generally.'' Since       its creation, the Committee on House Administration has had a       hand in shaping legislation that touches on any and all       aspects of federal elections.        In exercising those powers, throughout the 116th and 117th       Congresses, the Subcommittee on Elections of the Committee on       House Administration has reviewed the state of voting in       America, collecting thousands of pages of testimony and       evidence--and the conclusion is clear: minority voters in       America face ongoing discrimination in voting and barriers to       the ballot box.        In writing for the majority in Shelby County, Chief Justice       John Roberts wrote that ``[t]he Fifteenth Amendment is not       designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a       better future.'' Moreover, the Chief Justice wrote that       Congress must craft a remedy that, ``makes sense in light of       current conditions.'' The Subcommittee endeavored to learn       and gather the most contemporaneous evidence available and to       identify the voting and election administration practices       that cause discriminatory harm to voters--that evidence is       summarized in the report that follows.        To collect this evidence, the Subcommittee on Elections       held eight hearings and a listening session in the 116th       Congress, calling more than 60 witnesses, gathering several       thousand pages of written testimony, documents, and       transcripts, and hearing hours of oral testimony. To begin       the process, the Subcommittee cast a broad reach, examining       all manner of voting rights and election administration       barriers. That process resulted in a report detailing a wide       range of issues in voting and election administration laws       implemented by states in the years following the Shelby       County decision.        Building upon the record gathered during the prior Congress       and continuing the collection of contemporaneous evidence to       establish the state of ``current conditions,'' during the       117th Congress the Subcommittee embarked on a series of five       investigatory hearings. Under the Chairmanship of Congressman       G. K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), the Subcommittee identified those       voting and election administration practices that the       Subcommittee observed previously, including those which       exhibited the most significant evidence of discriminatory       impact, and investigated further. In doing so, the       Subcommittee determined that a number of specific practices       warranted a more in-depth examination, specifically: (1)       voter list maintenance and discriminatory voter purges; (2)       voter identification (``voter ID'') and documentary proof of       citizenship requirements; (3) lack of access to multi-lingual       voting materials and language assistance; (4) polling place       closures, consolidations, reductions, and long wait times;       (5) restrictions on additional opportunities to vote; and (6)       changes to methods of election, jurisdictional boundaries,       and redistricting.        The Subcommittee heard hours of testimony from more than 35       witnesses and collected numerous reports and documents. The       testimony and data show definitively that the voting and       election administration practices examined can and do have a       discriminatory impact on minority voters and can impede       access to the vote.        Key findings of the Subcommittee include:        (1) Purging voters from voter rolls can disproportionately       flag for removal, mark as inactive, or ultimately remove       otherwise eligible minority voters from the rolls. Although       voter list maintenance, when conducted correctly, is       appropriate and necessary, misconceived, overzealous list       maintenance efforts have erroneously sought to remove       hundreds of thousands of properly registered voters and, in       doing so, disproportionately burden minority voters. In the       years following the Shelby decision, millions of voters have       been removed from the voting rolls--and states once subject       to the Voting Rights Act saw purges at a 40 percent higher       rate than the rest of the country. As Sophia Lin Lakin of the       ACLU testified before the Subcommittee:        ``Some of these troubling purge practices are based on       unreliable data and/or procedures or dubious proxies that       disproportionately sweep in, and ultimately disenfranchise,       voters of color. Oftentimes, such purges have occurred too       close to an election to permit corrective action, with voters       arriving at the polls only to discover they have been removed       from the rolls and unable to cast a ballot that will count.''        For example, mailers initiating a Wisconsin voter purge       effort were disproportionately sent to counties with       disproportionately large Black and Latino populations--over       one-third of mailers were sent to areas that are home to the       largest Black voting populations, while the Black voting       population comprises only 5.7 percent of the total       electorate. Additionally, Dr. Marc Meredith of the University       of Pennsylvania testified that research, ``demonstrates that       minority registrants are more likely than White registrants       to be incorrectly identified as no longer eligible to vote at       their address of registration.''        (2) Voter identification and documentary proof-of-      citizenship requirements disproportionately burden minority       voters. Discriminatory strict voter ID laws were some of the       first voting laws implemented in the wake of Shelby County--      in 2013, at least six states implemented or began to enforce       strict voter ID laws, some of which had been previously       blocked by the Department of Justice under Section 5 of the       Voting Rights Act. Studies have consistently demonstrated       that minority voters are disproportionately likely to lack       the forms of ID required by voter ID laws and are       disproportionately burdened by the time and expense of       acquiring the underlying documents and IDs. The consequence       is a negative impact on turnout amongst minority voters. A       recent study found that Latinos, for example, are 10 percent       less likely to turnout in general elections in states with       strict ID laws than in states without such laws. Even when       states offer ``free'' IDs, the actual cost of obtaining a       qualifying photo ID ranged from $75 to $368 due to indirect       costs associated with travel time, waiting time, and       obtaining necessary supporting documentation. The documents       required to establish proof-of-citizenship are also       particularly expensive to obtain for naturalized and       derivative citizens, sometimes costing in excess of $1,000.        The burden of these requirements disproportionately fall on       Black, Latino, Asian American, and Native American voters,       and newly naturalized citizens. Recent studies have       demonstrated that Black and Latino voters are less likely to       have access to birth certificates and passports--documents       often required to establish proof of citizenship--than White       voters. For example, Asian Americans will face greater       barriers to registration than White voters under proof-of-      citizenship laws. As Terry Ao Minnis, Senior Director of       Census and Voting Programs for Asian Americans Advancing       Justice, testified, ``76.7 [percent] of Asian American adults       are foreign-born and 39.5 [percent] of Asian American adults       have naturalized nationwide, compared to 4.6 [percent] of       White adults who are foreign-born and 3.8 [percent] who have       naturalized.'' Numerous studies also have demonstrated that       strict voter ID laws disproportionately decrease registration       and turnout of minority voters relative to White voters. Dr.       Nazita Lajevardi of the University of Michigan testified       that, ``strict voter identification laws are racially       discriminatory and have real consequences for impacting the       racial makeup of the voting population.''        (3) Access to multi-lingual voting materials and assistance       is critical to ensuring equal access to the ballot--failure       to do so can negatively impact millions of potential voters,       a disproportionate number of whom are minority voters. The       demographics of America are shifting, with millions of new       Latino and Asian American voters, for example, joining the       rolls every election. The number of eligible Asian Americans       grew by almost 150 percent from almost 5 million in 2000 to       over 11.5 million in 2020--this compared to a growth rate of       24 percent for the total population over the same period.       Furthermore, American Community Survey (ACS) data estimate       show that Latinos accounted for just over half the nation's       population growth between 2010 and 2019, and ACS data       estimate shows that Latinos made up over 44 percent of the       entire nation's growth in citizen, voting-age population,       between 2009 and 2019.        According to 2017 data, more than 85 percent of the voters       who likely require language assistance in voting were voters       of color. As of 2019, approximately 4.82 percent of the       citizen voting-age population needs to cast a ballot in a       language other than English. For example, over a quarter of       all single-race American Indian and Alaska Natives speak a       language other than English at home, almost three out of       every four Asian Americans speak a language other than       English at home, and almost one in three Asian Americans has       limited English proficiency. When limited-English proficient       (LEP) voters are provided with voting materials in their       native language the likelihood they will participate in the       political process increases. Dr. Matt Barreto of the UCLA       Latino Policy and Politics Initiative testified that studies       have found, ``between a 7 and 11 point increase in voter       turnout given  [[Page H4461]]       access to Spanish materials.'' Conversely, failure to provide       the proper non-English voting materials has, ``a tremendously       negative impact on those communities' ability to understand       and participate in our elections.''        (4) Polling place closures, consolidations, reductions, and       long wait times at the polls all disproportionately burden       minority voters and can be implemented in a discriminatory       manner. Issues related to polling place locations, quality,       accessibility, and the ensuing long wait times to vote are       pervasive. Over the past decade, it has been well documented       that racial minorities wait longer to vote on election day       than White voters. Additionally, disparities in polling place       accessibility and wait times are compounded by the disparate       impact of other discriminatory practices such as voter ID       laws, voter purges, and cuts to alternative opportunities to       vote. A lack of available polling place locations       necessitates traveling long distances to vote, which also       disproportionately burdens minority voters, in particular       Native American voters. A 2019 report by The Leadership       Education Fund found that between 2012 and 2018 a total of       1,688 polling places had been closed in the previously       covered jurisdictions examined, almost double the rate       identified in 2016. Polling place closures and long wait       times have been shown to reduce the likelihood a voter will       vote in a subsequent election, decreasing turnout. Minority       voters not only wait longer on average, but they are also       more likely to experience wait times exceeding 60 minutes, a       wait time largely recognized as unacceptable. Dr. Stephen       Pettigrew of the University of Pennsylvania testified that,       ``[a] voter's race is one of the strongest predictors of how       long they wait in line to vote: non-white voters are three       times more likely than White voters to wait longer than 30       minutes and six times as likely to wait more than 60       minutes.'' Additionally, long lines negatively impact voters'       confidence in the electoral system. Dr. Pettigrew testified       that, ``[v]oters who wait in a long line are less likely to       believe that their vote choices would be kept a secret, and       less likely to be confident that their vote was counted       correctly'' and that, ``[b]ecause voters' experiences at the       polling place have downstream consequences on their future       turnout behavior and their confidence in the electoral       system, policies that widen the wait time gap between White       and non-white voters have the potential to put a thumb on the       electoral scale by reshaping the electorate.''        (5) Restricting access to opportunities to vote outside of       traditional Election Day voting has a disproportionate and       disenfranchising impact on minority voters. Early voting, and       especially weekend early voting, is a critical tool to       ensuring access to the ballot and reducing wait times at the       polls. Specifically, Dr. Michael Herron of Dartmouth       College testified that, ``changes to early voting hours       that reduce pre-Election Day, Sunday voting opportunities       should be expected to disproportionately affect Black       voters'' and that, if a state were to eliminate Sunday       early voting, ``the cost of voting for Black voters would       disproportionately increase compared to White voters given       the relatively heavy use of Sunday early voting by Black       voters.'' However, permitting early voting opportunities       without providing meaningful access to them amounts to       essentially no access. In discussing access for Native       American voters, Professor Patty Ferguson-Bohnee, Director       of the Indian Legal Clinic at the Sandra Day O'Connor       College of Law testified that, ``[e]arly voting       opportunities located hours away effectively amount to no       access to in-person early voting in light of the practical       effects of requiring voters to travel such distances.''       Opportunities to vote such as in-person early voting,       mail-in voting, curbside and drive-thru voting, or the       ability to return a voted mail-in ballot at a drop box       have all been used with increasing frequency by minority       voters, making them a target for suppressive cutbacks and       restrictions by state legislatures that will       disproportionately burden those same minority voters.        (6) Changes to methods of election, jurisdictional       boundaries, and redistricting impact whether voters can elect       candidates that reflect their voices and communities.       Discriminatory redistricting, vote dilution, changing of       jurisdictional boundaries, and changes to methods of election       have all been utilized throughout American elections--from       local school board contests to Congressional races--to dilute       growing voting power in minority communities. The country is       entering the first redistricting cycle without the       protections of the Voting Rights Act in more than a half       century. According to a 2018 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights       report on minority voting rights access, ``overall data show       that there have been over 3,000 changes submitted due to       redistricting in every 10-year cycle since the 1965 VRA was       enacted.'' Without VRA protections, it can take years of       expensive, time consuming litigation to rectify these       discriminatory practices, all while elections are conducted       under district maps and voting structures that are later       found to be unlawful. Evidence and testimony presented to the       Subcommittee clearly illustrated that these practices are       enacted with discriminatory effect and intent.        Each of the chapters that follows details the evidence       gathered by the Subcommittee on each of these practices--      clearly demonstrating the findings of the Subcommittee that       each warrants a heightened level of scrutiny and attention       from Congress to ensure every American has equal, equitable       access to the ballot.        The increase in voter turnout in both the 2018 and 2020       elections has not been met with celebration in statehouses       across the country but has instead been met with backlash and       false claims of fraud--claims that are being used to justify       voter suppression and the passage of laws that will       disenfranchise minority voters. Investigations have       repeatedly found no evidence of widespread fraud in American       elections. Fraud in American elections is vanishingly rare. A       person is more likely to be struck by lightning than to       commit voter-impersonation fraud. Other analyses found just       31 credible instances of impersonation fraud from 2000 to       2014, out of more than one billion ballots cast.        In 2021, our democracy is under attack. According to the       Brennan Center for Justice, as of July 14, 2021, lawmakers       had introduced more than 400 bills in 49 states to restrict       the vote--at least four times the number of restrictive bills       introduced just two years prior. To date, at least 18 states       have enacted new laws containing provisions that restrict       access to voting.        June 2021 marked the eighth anniversary of the Shelby       County decision. That decision unleashed a torrent of voter       suppression bills, many in previously covered jurisdictions,       which continues today. Congress has the power--a power the       U.S. Supreme Court has called ``paramount'' for 142 years--      and duty to act. As detailed in this report, there is much       work to be done.   Chapter One--Introduction and the History of Discrimination in Voting              AMERICA'S LONG HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATING IN VOTING         Since the Founding, Americans have not enjoyed equal access       to the ballot. At her opening, the Declaration of       Independence said ``all men are created equal''--yet enslaved       persons, indentured servants, Native Americans, and women       were all denied the right to vote.        The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-      third, Twenty-fourth, and Twenty-sixth Amendments all       expanded access to the franchise not previously experienced       by millions of Americans despite the promise of equality.       This expansion did not come without bitter divides and       opposition. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth       Amendments--known collectively as the Reconstruction       Amendments--expanded access to the ballot for millions of       Black Americans in the post-Civil War era, and gave Congress       the power to enforce the rights granted in these Amendments       through appropriate legislation.        Yet, while the immediate post-Civil War era brought about       greater political representation for Black Americans,       following the electoral crisis of 1876, former Confederates       and their sympathizers seized control of southern state       governments by brutally suppressing Black voters and       eliminating the power of the Reconstruction Republican Party.       By the 1890s, suppression tactics led to most African       Americans having either been barred from or abandoned       electoral politics as violence and economic reprisals became       a constant threat to political participation and segregation       was legalized. Southern legislators passed laws such as poll       taxes, grandfather clauses, literacy tests, and felon       disenfranchisement, with the explicit intent of removing       Black voters from the rolls.        Indeed, the same barriers existed for Native Americans. In       1884, the Supreme Court held in Elk v. Wilkins that the       Fourteenth Amendment did not provide citizenship to Native       Americans. Not until passage of the Indian Citizenship Act in       1924 did most Native Americans gain full citizenship and       voting rights without undermining or negating their right to       remain a member of their tribe. Despite passage of the Act       and subsequent passage of the Nationality Act of 1940, many       states continued to deny Native Americans equal access to the       ballot, claiming they were ineligible to vote because they       were not residents of that state. Not until 1957 and 1958 did       Utah and North Dakota, respectively, become the last states       to afford on-reservation Native Americans the right to vote.        The Nineteenth Amendment granted women the right to vote       when it was ratified in 1920. The Twenty-third Amendment       allowed residents of the District of Columbia to vote for       President and Vice President (1961). The Twenty-fourth       Amendment outlawed poll taxes or any other tax to vote       (1964), and the Twenty-sixth Amendment lowered the voting age       to 18 and banned the denial or abridgement of the vote based       on age (1971).        The U.S. government also systematically denied citizenship       and voting rights to Asian Americans. Not until the repeal of       the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943 and the passage of the       McCarran-Walter Act in 1952 were all Asian Americans granted       the right to become citizens and therefore eligible to vote.                        A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO VOTE         To this day, scholars argue that the Constitution does not       guarantee the right to vote as a positive right--that the       amendments do not provide an affirmative grant but disallow       the government from restricting the franchise based on       protected criteria--race, sex, paying a poll tax, and age.       However, while the text of the Constitution does not       explicitly provide for and protect the vote as a fundamental       right, the Supreme Court has long recognized that voting is a       fundamental right.        Voting and equal, equitable access to the ballot are       cornerstones of creating a true democracy. Justice Hugo       Black, in Wesberry v. Sanders, stated that:        ``No right is more precious in a free country than that of       having a voice in the election of those who make the laws       under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights,       even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is       undermined.''  [[Page H4462]]         Professor Guy-Uriel Charles of Duke Law School noted in his       testimony before the Committee that, ``since at least 1886,       in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, the Supreme Court has recognized that       voting is a fundamental right of citizens and that its       availability is critical to sustaining representative       government.'' In 1964, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote,       ``[t]he right to vote freely for the candidate of one's       choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any       restrictions on that right strike at the heart of the       representative government.'' More recently, Chief Justice       John Roberts noted, ``[t]here is no right more basic in our       democracy than the right to participate in electing our       political leaders.''        THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, PRECEDENT, AND SHELBY COUNTY V. HOLDER         Despite the protections from racial discrimination in       voting afforded in theory under the Reconstruction       Amendments, for nearly 100 years after their passage, Black       Americans were ``systematically disenfranchised by poll       taxes, literacy tests, property requirements, threats, and       lynching.'' To address the systemic discrimination and       barriers in voting, on August 6, 1965, President Lyndon B.       Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law.        One of the pillars of the Civil Rights laws of the 1960s,       the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (``VRA'') was enacted to       address election laws and practices that discriminated on the       basis of race and ethnicity. In the decades following its       enactment, the VRA went a long way to addressing the       widespread racial discrimination in voting. The VRA was       designed to fight, ``an insidious and pervasive evil which       had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through       unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution.''       Prior to the passage of the VRA, when the U.S. Department of       Justice obtained favorable decisions striking down       suppressive, discriminatory voting practices, states would       merely enact new schemes to restrict access to the ballot for       Black voters.        The VRA placed a nationwide prohibition on states, or       political subdivisions, from implementing voting       qualifications or prerequisites, standards, practices, or       procedures to, ``deny or abridge the right of any citizen to       vote on the basis of race or color.'' Originally set to       expire five years after enactment, the VRA was subsequently       amended and extended by Congress on a bipartisan basis       several times. Congress continued to support the underlying       policy of the Voting Rights Act while voting to amend,       expand, and extend the law five times: in 1970, 1975, 1982,       1992, and 2006.        Each time, the law was reauthorized with overwhelming,       bipartisan support. Moreover, all of the multiple       reauthorizations were signed into law by Republican       Presidents. The 2006 reauthorization, the Fannie Lou Hamer,       Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act       Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 passed the House       of Representatives overwhelmingly following introduction by       Representative James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R-Wisc.), passed the       Senate unanimously, and was signed into law by President       George W. Bush.        Since the VRA's initial passage, and through the subsequent       amendments and reauthorizations, the Supreme Court repeatedly       affirmed Congress's authority to enact statutes that prohibit       states and localities from imposing voting laws that       intentionally discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity.       In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the Court held that the       Voting Rights Act was, ``a valid means for carrying out the       commands of the Fifteenth Amendment.'' The Court would later       uphold the Voting Rights Act again in cases such as City of       Rome v. United States (1980) and Lopez v. Monterey County       (1999). Furthermore, the Court has long upheld Congress's       broad authority under the Constitution to pass laws and       regulations governing federal elections.        The Supreme Court has long affirmed the breadth of       Congress's power to enact laws regulating elections. As       Professor Guy-Uriel Charles noted in his testimony before the       Committee, as early as 1880, the Supreme Court noted in Ex       parte Siebold that Congress's Elections Clause power to       regulate Congressional elections, ``may be exercised as and       when Congress sees fit to exercise it,'' and, ``necessarily       supersedes,'' conflicting state regulations. Professor       Charles further testified that, ``[t]hus, although the       Supreme Court has at times interpreted federalism as a       constraint on Congressional power derived from the Fourteenth       and Fifteenth Amendments, Congress' power to regulate federal       elections is uniquely unencumbered by federalism       constraints.''        Professor Franita Tolson of the University of Southern       California Gould School of Law testified before the Committee       that, despite the view by some that exercises of federal       authority under the Elections Clause as a somewhat unwelcome       intrusion on the states' authority to legislate with respect       to federal elections, ``Congress can disregard state       sovereignty in enacting and enforcing legislation passed       pursuant to the Elections Clause.'' Additionally, Professor       Daniel P. Tokaji of the University of Wisconsin Law School       testified that the Court's, ``most recent--and arguably most       important--explications,'' of Congress's power came in       Arizona v. ITCA, in which the Court noted that, ``the usual       presumption against federal pre-emption of state law does not       apply to legislation enacted under the Elections Clause . . .       While states historically enjoyed broad police powers over       other matters, their regulation of congressional elections       has always been subject to congressional revision or       reversal.''        The Supreme Court has also long held that Congress's power       to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments extends       beyond intentional discrimination. In City of Rome v. United       States, the Court considered a municipality's challenge to       the constitutionality of Section 5 of the VRA, to the extent       that it authorized invalidation of a state or local election       law based solely on evidence that the law had a       discriminatory effect. The Court rejected the municipality's       constitutional challenge, holding that Congress's power to       enforce the Reconstruction Amendments extended beyond       prohibiting intentionally discriminatory voting laws. The       Court reasoned that Congress's authority to enforce the       Reconstruction Amendments is coextensive with its authority       under the Necessary and Proper Clause, which empowers       Congress to enact any law that is, ``appropriate,'' ``adapted       to carry out the objects,'' of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth       Amendment, and not prohibited by another provision in the       Constitution.        Applying that test, City of Rome made clear that, ``under       the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress may prohibit voting       practices that have only a discriminatory effect.'' In       particular, ``under Sec.  2 of the Fifteenth Amendment       Congress may prohibit practices that in and of themselves do       not violate Sec.  1 of the Amendment [in that they are       intentionally discriminatory], so long as the prohibitions       attacking racial discrimination are `appropriate,' as that       term is defined in McCulloch v. Maryland and Ex parte       Virginia.''        Despite decades of precedent that uphold Congressional       power and the VRA, in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down       portions of the 2006 VRA reauthorization in Shelby County v.       Holder (``Shelby County'' or ``Shelby''), leaving American       voters vulnerable to tactics of suppression and       discrimination. In its ruling, the Court struck down Section       4(b) as outdated and not ``grounded in current conditions.''       The Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b)'s coverage formula       violated implicit equal sovereignty principles in the       Constitution because it treated states differently--requiring       certain states and localities, but not others, to obtain       preclearance--but relied on sometimes decades old data to       justify that differential treatment.        The Court found the data upon which Congress relied in       reauthorizing the VRA--evidence dating to the 1960s and 1970s       of differential registration rates between White and Black       voters and the use of literacy tests to depress minority       voting, for example--to be insufficient to meet that       standard, particularly in light of documented improvements in       minority voter registration rates and turnout. By       invalidating the coverage formula, Shelby County essentially       rendered Section 5 inoperable, allowing previously covered       states and localities to make changes to their voting laws       without seeking preclearance from the Department of Justice.        At the same time the Court upended the VRA, Chief Justice       Roberts conceded that discrimination in voting still exists,       writing, ``[a]t the same time, voting discrimination still       exists; no one doubts that.'' Despite this, Chief Justice       Roberts' majority opinion declared that the data before the       Court undergirding the reauthorization of the VRA was       outdated:        ``The question is whether the Act's extraordinary measures,       including its disparate treatment of the States, continue to       satisfy constitutional requirements. As we put it a short       time ago, ``the Act imposes current burdens and must be       justified by current needs.''        The Chief Justice did, however, expressly suggest that       Congress may remedy this and restore the effect of the       preclearance regime by updating the coverage formula,       providing a roadmap for Congressional action:        ``Striking down an Act of Congress `is the gravest and most       delicate duty that this Court is called on to perform.'       Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S. 142, 148 (1927) (Holmes, J.,       concurring). We do not do so lightly. That is why, in 2009,       we took care to avoid ruling on the constitutionality of the       Voting Rights Act when asked to do so, and instead resolved       the case then before us on statutory grounds. But in issuing       that decision, we expressed our broader concerns about the       constitutionality of the Act. Congress could have updated the       coverage formula at that time, but did not do so. Its failure       to act leaves us today with no choice but to declare       Sec. 4(b) unconstitutional. The formula in that section can       no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to       preclearance.''        ``Our decision in no way affects the permanent, nationwide       ban on racial discrimination in voting found in Sec. 2. We       issue no holding on Sec. 5 itself, only on the coverage       formula. Congress may draft another formula based on current       conditions. Such a formula is an initial prerequisite to a       determination that exceptional conditions still exist       justifying such an `extraordinary departure from the       traditional course of relations between the States and the       Federal Government.' Presley, 502 U.S., at 500-501. Our       country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in       voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation       it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current       conditions.''        Without the full protections of the VRA, states are free to       implement discriminatory  [[Page H4463]]       voting laws without preemptive Justice Department oversight.       While Section 2 of the VRA remains an avenue for combatting       discriminatory voting laws in the courts, Section 2 lawsuits       are reactive, filed only after laws have been enacted, often       take years and extensive resources to litigate, and all while       elections may be conducted under restrictions later found to       be unlawful. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby       County, nine states were covered by statewide preclearance       requirements under the VRA's coverage formula in Section 4(b)       and the preclearance regime of Section 5. Preclearance       required the states and localities captured under the       coverage formula to seek and receive administrative approval       from the U.S. Department of Justice (``DOJ'' or ``Justice       Department'') or judicial review by the U.S. District Court       for the District of Columbia prior to making changes to their       voting laws. At the time Shelby County was decided, Alabama,       Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South       Carolina, Texas, and Virginia were the states covered as a       whole. Additionally, counties in California, Florida, New       York, North Carolina, South Dakota, and townships in       Michigan, were previously covered under Section 5 though each       state itself was not covered as a whole. Throughout the       history of the VRA, counties have also ``bailed out'' of       coverage--meaning they were once subject to the preclearance       regime of Section 5, but successfully obtained a declaratory       judgment under Section 4 and thus were no longer subject to       preclearance.        Hours after Shelby County was decided, states moved to       enact restrictive voting laws. Texas revived a previously       blocked voter ID law. Within days, Alabama announced it would       move to enforce a photo ID law it had previously refused to       submit to the DOJ for preclearance. Within months, New York       broke from past practices and declined to hold special       elections to fill 12 legislative vacancies, denying       representation to 800,000 voters of color.        Less than two months after the Supreme Court struck down       the preclearance provisions, North Carolina state legislators       wasted no time passing an omnibus ``monster law.'' State       Senator Tom Apodaca (then-Chairman of the North Carolina       Senate Rules Committee) said the State did not want the       ``legal headaches'' of having to go through preclearance if       it was not necessary to determine which portions of the       proposal would be subject to federal scrutiny, ``so, now we       can go with the full bill,'' he added. He predicted at the       time that an omnibus voting bill would surface in the Senate       the next week that could go beyond voter ID to include issues       such as reducing early voting, eliminating Sunday voting, and       barring same-day voter registration.        This pattern continued, and in 2016, 14 states had enacted       new voting restrictions for the first time in a presidential       election, including previously covered states such as       Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, and       Virginia. In 2017, two additional states, Arkansas and North       Dakota, enacted voter ID laws. In 2018, Arkansas, Indiana,       Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Wisconsin enacted       new restrictions on voting, ranging from restrictions on who       can collect absentee ballots, to cuts to early voting,       restrictions on college students, and enshrining voter ID       requirements in a state constitution. In 2019, Arizona,       Florida, Indiana, Tennessee, and Texas enacted new       restrictions. As of the end of 2019, the Brennan Center for       Justice (``Brennan Center'') reported that, since 2010, 25       states had enacted new voting restrictions, including strict       photo ID requirements, early voting cutbacks, and       registration restrictions. A new wave of voter suppression       bills has emerged in the wake of the 2020 general election,       with restrictive voting bills being signed into law in at       least 18 states at the time of this writing.        Despite the Court's decision, several key provisions of the       VRA remain in place. For example, the language access       requirements contained in Sections 4(e), 4(f)(4), 203, and       208 remain intact. Section 2 is also a key enforcement       mechanism for the DOJ and outside litigators to protect       voting rights nationwide. Section 2 of the VRA applies a       nationwide prohibition against the denial or abridgment of       the right to vote on the basis of race or color and was later       amended to include language minorities.        Since the Shelby County decision invalidated the coverage       formula for preclearance, voting rights groups, litigators,       and the Department of Justice are left to file lawsuits       arguing that voting changes would discriminatorily reduce       minority citizens' ability to cast a ballot or elect       candidates of their choice--a remedy that is in many ways       inadequate to fully protect the right to vote. Voters and       advocates are forced to reactively fight to protect the right       to vote, rather than states and localities having to prove       prior to implementation that their laws will not discriminate       against protected classes of voters.        On July 1, 2021, the Supreme Court held in Brnovich v. DNC       that Arizona's laws restricting third-party ballot return and       out-of-precinct voting were lawful and did not violate       Section 2's ban on discriminatory effect in voting, nor were       they enacted with discriminatory purpose. In doing so,       Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, articulated       an entirely new standard for reviewing Section 2 vote denial       claims, weakening one of the last pillars of the VRA and       fail-safes against discriminatory voting laws. Justice Alito       held that, ``the mere fact that there is some disparity in       impact,'' is now no longer dispositive, but rather, ``the       size of the disparity matters.'' Further, Justice Alito       provided that, ``courts must consider the opportunities       provided by a State's entire system of voting when assessing       the burden imposed by a challenged provision''--rather than       evaluating the provision on its individual merits. Finally,       Justice Alito went a step further, stating that, ``prevention       of fraud'' is a ``strong and entirely legitimate state       interest,'' even if there is no evidence of fraud having ever       occurred, and that rules that are supported by strong state       interests are, ``less likely to violate'' Section 2.        In writing for the dissent in Brnovich, Justice Elena Kagan       admonished the majority for weakening a seminal statute and       creating its own standard and set of guideposts where one did       not exist in the statute. Justice Kagan stated:        ``Today, the Court undermines Section 2 and the right it       provides. The majority fears that the statute Congress wrote       is too ``radical''--that it will invalidate too many state       voting laws. So the majority writes its own set of rules,       limiting Section 2 from multiple directions. Wherever it can,       the majority gives a cramped reading to broad language. And       then it uses that reading to uphold two election laws from       Arizona that discriminate against minority voters . . . What       is tragic here is that the Court has (yet again) rewritten--      in order to weaken--a statute that stands as a monument to       America's greatness, and protects against its basest       impulses.''        Justice Kagan argued that the majority had strayed far from       the text of Section 2 in its ruling, its analysis permitting,       ``exactly the kind of vote suppression that Section 2, by its       terms, rules out of bounds.''    THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS INVESTIGATION OF CURRENT DISCRIMINATION                                 IN VOTING         In exercising Congress's authority and jurisdiction over       federal elections, the Committee on House Administration       (``Committee'') has broad jurisdiction under Rule X of the       Rules of the House to oversee the administration of federal       elections. In exercising that jurisdiction, Speaker of the       House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Committee Chair Zoe Lofgren       (D-Calif.) reconstituted the Committee on House       Administration's Subcommittee on Elections (``Subcommittee'')       at the outset of the 116th Congress.        Subsequently, spanning the leadership of then-Subcommittee       Chair Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio) and current Chair G. K.       Butterfield (D-N.C.), the Subcommittee embarked during the       116th and 117th Congresses to hold more than a dozen hearings       to collect the contemporaneous evidence and data called for       by Chief Justice Roberts and the Court's majority in Shelby.        In building upon investigatory hearings conducted in the       116th Congress, in the 117th Congress the Subcommittee       identified the practices with what appeared to be the most       abundant evidence of discriminatory impact on minority voters       and endeavored to examine those practices in greater detail.        Across the Subcommittee's five hearings, the Subcommittee       received testimony from more than 35 witnesses, gathering and       examining evidence of ongoing discrimination in the election       practices of: (1) voter list maintenance and voter purges;       (2) voter identification and documentary proof-of-citizenship       laws; (3) lack of access to multi-lingual voting materials       and assistance; (4) polling place closures, consolidations,       relocations, and long wait times; (5) restrictions on       opportunities to vote; and (6) changes to method of       elections, jurisdictional boundaries, and redistricting.       Furthermore, the Subcommittee examined the state of voting       rights enforcement and protection in the post-Shelby County       era.        The practices examined are perennial barriers faced by       voters. According to testimony from Marcia Johnson-Blanco of       the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law       (``Lawyers'' Committee''), during the 2020 General Election       cycle, the top issues raised through the organization's       nationwide, non-partisan voter protection program included,       ``questions and concerns about mail-in and absentee ballots,       as well as voter ID and registration . . . Election Day also       brought calls of polling place accessibility issues, and       concerning calls complaining of voter intimidation and       electioneering.'' The Subcommittee's lengthy proceedings and       examination revealed that each of the practices identified       impose significant, discriminatory burdens on minority       voters.        The evidence before the Subcommittee includes locality-and       state-specific, as well as nationwide, studies demonstrating       that the election practices examined impose a variety of       discriminatory burdens, ranging from disproportionately       decreased registration and turnout among minority voters,       disproportionately high costs to register and cast a ballot,       disproportionately increased risk that a ballot will be       thrown out, and a disproportionate dilution of voting power.       The record also includes extensive testimony from litigators       and voting rights practitioners who confront these       discriminatory voting laws and practices on a regular and       increasingly frequent basis in courtrooms, governmental       proceedings, and on voting days.        As Debo Adegbile, Partner at Wilmer Hale, LLC and Member of       the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, noted in his testimony       before  [[Page H4464]]       the Subcommittee, the expansion of the franchise has       routinely been met with resistance:        ``We currently stand at an inflection point, but it is not       unprecedented. The Fifteenth Amendment's expansion of the       right to vote was met with the creation of poll taxes and       literacy tests. The rise of minority voting power after the       Voting Rights Act was met with the expansion of at-large       elections. The National Voter Registration Act (i.e., the       Motor Voter Law) and the narrow margin of the 2000       presidential election were answered by a wave of spurious       voter ID laws. Now, record voter turnout, despite a pandemic,       is almost predictably sparking renewed efforts to make it       even harder to vote.''        While states have been enacting discriminatory, restrictive       voting laws in the years since Shelby County, that effort has       significantly increased in response to the largest voter       turnout in 120 years experienced in the 2020 General       Election.        According to the Brennan Center, as of July 14, 2021,       lawmakers had introduced more than 400 bills in 49 states to       restrict the vote. This is at least four times the number of       restrictive bills introduced just two years prior, with at       least 18 states having enacted new laws containing provisions       that restrict access to voting. A Brennan Center report from       May 2021 states that, ``[t]he United States is on track to       far exceed its most recent period of significant voter       suppression--2011. By October of that year, 19 restrictive       laws were enacted in 14 states. This year, the country has       already reached that level, and it's only May.''        Michael Waldman, President of the Brennan Center for       Justice, noted in his testimony before the Subcommittee that       these bills were introduced with the intention of rolling       back voting rights, observing that, ``[c]rucially, these are       not backbenchers tossing a bill in the hopper in the hope of       getting a good day on Twitter.'' Indeed, as of June 21, 2021,       17 states have enacted 28 new laws that restrict access to       the vote. Moreover, Mr. Waldman testified that ``[a]s in       previous eras, these laws and proposals purport to be       racially neutral,'' yet, ``[i]n fact, often they precisely       target voters of color.''        Congress has a long history of exercising its legislative       authority and constitutional powers to legislate to protect       access to the franchise. In the eight years since Shelby       County was decided, Congress has failed to act on what has       historically been a bipartisan endeavor--ensuring every       American has an equal and equitable opportunity to cast a       ballot and participate in democracy. As Justice Kagan notes       in her dissent in Brnovich, ``[i]ndeed, the problem of voting       discrimination has become worse since that time--in part       because of what this Court did in Shelby County. Weaken the       Voting Rights Act, and predictable consequences follow: yet a       further generation of voter suppression laws.''        This report and the record compiled by the Subcommittee       illustrate the urgent need for action.        Chapter Two--Discriminatory Practices in Voting: An Overview                                   OVERVIEW         Since the Supreme Court decided Shelby County v. Holder in       2013, states across the country have enacted voting laws and       election administration policies that restrict access to the       ballot in a discriminatory and suppressive manner, one that       disproportionately impacts minority voters.        Over the last two Congresses, the Subcommittee on Elections       of the Committee on House Administration undertook an       extensive fact-finding series of hearings to study and       understand the extent to which all voters across the United       States have access to, or face barriers to, the ability to       cast their ballot freely and fairly. Tellingly, with respect       to the voting and election administration practices examined       by the Subcommittee, the variety of sources examined, and       testimony gathered all point to the same conclusion--the       record demonstrates that the election administration laws and       practices at issue disproportionately burden minority voters,       denying many the free and equal access to the vote guaranteed       by Federal law and the Constitution.        During the 116th Congress, the Subcommittee cast a wide       evidentiary net, examining all manner of election       administration and voting laws to identify which, if any,       practices discriminate against minority voters. In doing so,       the Subcommittee held eight hearings and a listening session,       called more than 60 witnesses, gathered several thousand       pages of testimony, documents, and transcripts, and received       hours of oral testimony. Throughout those hearings, the       Subcommittee found extensive evidence of numerous practices       that do, or have the potential to, discriminate and suppress       access to the ballot, culminating in a report released in       November 2019 entitled Voting Rights and Election       Administration in the United States of America.        The barriers to voting faced by millions of Americans did       not subside in the 2020 election-- in many instances they       were, in fact, exacerbated. During the first six months of       the 117th Congress, building upon the record built in the       116th Congress, the Subcommittee on Elections, under the       leadership of Chairman G. K. Butterfield (D-N.C.) identified       a key subset of issues explored in the prior Congress that       exhibited the most substantial evidence of disproportionate       and discriminatory impact on voters, particularly minority       voters, for further, in-depth examination.        Over the course of five hearings, the Subcommittee       conducted a substantive examination of the issues of: (1)       discriminatory voter list maintenance practices and voter       purges; (2) the discriminatory impact of voter ID and       documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements; (3) the       ongoing lack of access to multi-lingual voting materials and       assistance; (4) the disparate impact of polling place       closures, consolidations, relocations, and wait times at the       polls; (5) restrictions on additional opportunities to vote;       and (6) changes to methods of election, jurisdictional       boundaries, and redistricting. In concluding the evidence       gathering process, the Subcommittee examined the national       landscape of voting rights in America in the eight years       since the Supreme Court struck down one of the key pillars of       the VRA.        Importantly, the evidence detailed in this report is       ``current,'' as called for by Chief Justice Roberts and the       Court's majority in Shelby. This report examines a       substantial body of evidence, the vast majority of which       derives from elections and legislative sessions conducted in       the last 10 years, with much of the evidence relating to       elections occurring within the years post-Shelby County.        Over the course of testimony received from more than 35       witnesses and numerous hours of hearings, not only did the       Subcommittee find substantial evidence that the election       administration and voting practices examined throughout the       hearings and in this report have a discriminatory effect on       minority voters, but Members also found substantial evidence       that there is a significant risk these discriminatory effects       are the product of a discriminatory purpose. The extensive       evidence recounted throughout this report, that the burdens       of the election administration laws and practices, ``bears       more heavily on one race than another,'' is illustrative of       the laws' and practices' discriminatory purpose.       Additionally, as is noted in the discussion of some voting       laws and practices later in this report, courts have looked       at whether voting is ``racially polarized,'' which provides a       controlling party disfavored by minority voters with, ``an       incentive for intentional discrimination in the regulation of       elections'' in determining when a practice is discriminatory       and have found some of the practice examined by to       Subcommittee to fit this set of circumstances.        However, consistent with the Court's admonition that       Congressional factfinders must consider a variety of facts       and circumstances in determining whether a law had its       genesis in its discriminatory purpose, the Subcommittee       looked beyond evidence of solely discriminatory effect in       finding that there is a high risk these laws and practices       are attributable to a discriminatory purpose. The background       and context of many of the laws were suggestive of a       discriminatory purpose. Many were enacted in the immediate or       near aftermath of the Shelby County decision on party-line       votes in previously covered jurisdictions with a well-      documented history of racially polarized voting--others had       already been rejected by the Department of Justice under the       Section 5 preclearance regime.        Further, public officials and election administrators made       troubling statements regarding some of the laws and practices       at issue that bear the hallmarks of discriminatory purpose.       The Subcommittee also found evidence that some states and       localities knew the laws would have discriminatory effects,       but enacted them nevertheless, without including safeguards       to protect the interests and rights of minority voters, as is       illustrated in some of the examples discussed throughout this       report. Additionally, states and localities provided       unsupported or pretextual race-neutral justifications for       many of the laws and practices. Several of the laws and       practices were enacted just as minority groups       disproportionately burdened by the voting laws or practices       were gaining political influence.        The Subcommittee is not alone in finding that there is a       significant risk that the laws and practices discussed in       this report pose a high risk of being enacted for a       discriminatory purpose. Based on some of the evidence       described above and throughout this report, courts have found       several of these laws were enacted with discriminatory intent       or otherwise violated Federal law or the Constitution.        Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act has proved a powerful,       but inadequate tool for protecting the right to vote and       access to the ballot in the post-Shelby era. Section 2       authorizes private actors and the Department of Justice to       challenge discriminatory voting practices in the federal       courts. As Janai Nelson, Associate Director-Counsel of the       NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. (``NAACP Legal       Defense Fund'' or ``LDF'') stated in testimony before the       Subcommittee:        ``Section 2 applies nationwide and places the burden on       voters harmed by voting discrimination to bring litigation to       challenge a law that has discriminatory results and/or       discriminatory purpose. Section 2's `permanent, nationwide       ban' on racially discriminatory dilution or denial of the       right to vote is now the principal tool under the VRA to       block and remedy these new discriminatory measures.''        Ms. Nelson testified that, ``there have been at least nine       federal court decisions finding that states or localities       enacted racially discriminatory voting laws or practices       intentionally, for the purpose of discriminating  [[Page H4465]]       against Black voters, Latino voters, or other voters of       color.'' Ms. Nelson testified further that, ``litigation is       slow and costly--and court victories may come only after a       voting law or practice has been in place for several election       cycles.'' The parties engaged in litigation often spend       millions of dollars litigating these cases, they take up       significant judicial resources, and the average length of       Section 2 cases is two to five years.        While court cases are ongoing, numerous elections for the       Presidency, Congress, state, and local government seats may       have come and gone. Thomas Saenz, President and General       Counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational       Fund (``MALDEF'') stated in his testimony that, ``[t]here is       simply no way that non-profit voting rights litigators, even       supplemented by the work of a reinvigorated Department of       Justice Civil Rights Division, could possibly prevent the       implementation of all of the undue ballot-access restrictions       and redistricting violations that are likely to arise in the       next two years.''        The evidence is clear: lawsuits filed under Section 2 and       other provisions of law and the Constitution cannot and do       not substitute for proactive protections of voting rights and       cannot serve as the sole vanguard against discriminatory       voting and election administration practices. Additionally,       the Supreme Court's recent decision in Brnovich v. DNC likely       makes it harder for voting rights litigators and the       Department of Justice to protect the right to vote through       Section 2 litigation.        The November 2020 general election saw record-setting voter       turnout, with over 158 million ballots cast and the highest       turnout as a percent of the voting eligible population in 120       years. While some may cite recent voter registration and       voter turnout numbers as alleged examples and evidence that       the effects of Shelby have been minimal, those numbers alone       do not tell the whole story. For example, Dr. Matt Barreto of       the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative stated in       testimony before the Subcommittee that, ``[s]ingular focus on       turnout without centralizing the real impact of such burdens       on access to the franchise is one-dimensional, operating       within the subtext of racial power to reproduce the       inequalities that demand the attention of political       scientists in the first place.'' As the evidence before the       Subcommittee clearly demonstrates, record turnout, and voter       turnout generally, does not discredit or discount the       existence of barriers to accessing the franchise.        Additionally, state legislatures across the country have       responded to the increase in voter participation not with       more or sustained access to the ballot, but with false claims       of fraud, election irregularities, and perpetuation of the       ``Big Lie'' that the 2020 election was somehow rigged and       stolen. The ongoing epidemic of misinformation and       disinformation in our elections does not only polarize the       electorate and fuel attempts to legislate voter suppression,       but it also targets and suppresses minority votes. As Spencer       Overton, President of the Joint Center for Political and       Economic Studies testified before the Subcommittee in 2020,       the disinformation targeted at Black voters, for example, on       social media platforms in the 2016 election cycle continued       in the 2020 cycle. Mr. Overton testified that both foreign       and domestic actors, ``used online disinformation to target       and suppress Black votes.'' Additionally, a report from NPR       in the final days of the 2020 election found that Black and       Latino voters were flooded with disinformation in the final       days of the 2020 election with an unmistakable intent to       depress turnout among minority voters.        The spread of mis- and disinformation only continued with       false claims of unlawful ballots being cast and widespread       fraud--much of which was alleged to be in areas where large       numbers of ballots were cast by minority voters. These claims       have all been repeatedly disproven, yet states are using them       as false pretenses to push forward an onslaught of new voting       laws designed to make it harder for voters to participate in       future elections, laws that will disproportionately and       discriminatorily impact the ability of minority voters to       cast a ballot.        As Wade Henderson, Interim President and CEO of the       Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights (``The       Leadership Conference'') testified:        ``The assault on our freedom to vote has only grown more       dire. After historic turnout, politicians peddled lies, tried       to discount the votes of communities of color, and attempted       to override the will of the people. . . . Now they have       doubled down on attempts to reshape the electorate for their       own gain. . . . These restrictions disproportionately burden       voters of color. They resemble the very strategies that led       Congress to adopt the Voting Rights Act in the first place.''        The evidence before the Subcommittee is conclusive--the       practices discussed below, and the manner in which they are       implemented, are wielded with both discriminatory intent and       effect, unlawfully erecting barriers to the ballot for       minority voters across the country. The voting discrimination       acknowledged by Chief Justice Roberts in Shelby does still       exist. It is the conclusion of the Subcommittee's hearings       and this report that these practices warrant stricter       protections to ensure every voter has unfettered access to       the ballot promised to them under the Constitution and       Federal law.    Chapter Three--Voter List Maintenance Practices and the Purging of                              Eligible Voters                                  BACKGROUND         Voter purging is often performed under the guise of routine       voter list maintenance. Some argue that opponents of voter       purges are preventing state and local election officials from       preforming necessary, mandated list maintenance. Proponents       of voter purging often raise the specter of deceased persons       or voters who have moved remaining on the rolls, of       ``bloated'' voter rolls, or insidious claims of non-citizens       being on the rolls, leading to voter fraud. However, there is       no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in American       elections. For example, a comprehensive analysis published by       the Washington Post found only 31 credible instances of voter       fraud between 2000 and 2014--out of one billion ballots cast.        List maintenance is the law of the land and the process by       which state and local governments remove ineligible voters       from their voting rolls. The National Voter Registration Act       (``NVRA''), or ``motor voter'' law, is the principal federal       statute governing state maintenance of voter registration       rolls. The NVRA was signed into law on May 20, 1993, by       President Bill Clinton, following decades of efforts to       establish a national voter registration system to address low       voter turnout and increase voter registration opportunities       that began soon after passage of the VRA in 1965. Enacted       pursuant to Congress's authority under the Elections Clause,       the NVRA governs voter registration procedures for federal       elections. Nevertheless, nearly all states use the NVRA-      prescribed process for maintaining their voter rolls for both       state and federal elections.        In addition to establishing voter registration procedures,       the NVRA provides that ``each State shall . . . conduct a       general program that makes a reasonable effort to remove the       names of ineligible voters from the official lists of       eligible voters by reason of--(A) the death of the       registrant; or (B) a change in the residence of the       registrant. . . .'' The NVRA provides that any, ``program or       activity to protect the integrity of the electoral process by       ensuring the maintenance of an accurate and current voter       roll for elections for Federal office'' must meet two       requirements. First, the program or activity must be,       ``uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the       Voting Rights Act of 1965.'' Second, the program or activity       must ``not result in the removal of any person from the       official list of voters registered to vote in an election for       Federal office by reason of the person's failure to vote,''       unless certain conditions are satisfied.        The NVRA describes one form of ``voter removal program[ ]''       that states may use to remove voters (referred to in the       statute as ``registrants'') who have moved to an address       outside of a jurisdiction. In particular, states can use,       ``change-of-address information supplied by the Postal       Service . . . to identify registrants whose addresses might       have changed.'' A state may not remove a registrant from its       voter rolls on grounds that the registrant has changed       residence unless the registrant does one of two things: (1)       confirms in writing that the registrant has changed residence       to a place outside the jurisdiction or (2) it ``appears''       from information provided by the Postal Service that the       registrant has moved to a different address in a different       jurisdiction and a ``notice'' procedure is used to       ``confirm'' that the registrant has, in fact, changed address       to a new jurisdiction. Under the notice procedure, a state       must send a postage pre-paid and pre-addressed return card       notifying the registrant of certain rights and obligations,       and allowing a registrant to provide the state with the       registrant's current address. If a registrant fails to       respond to the notice, the state may, but is not required to,       remove the registrant only if the registrant fails to vote in       two federal elections after the date of the notice.        A second federal law governing state voter registration       lists--the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (``HAVA''), passed       in the wake of the 2000 Presidential election--mandates the       creation of statewide voter registration databases for all       elections to federal office that include the ``name and       registration information of every legally registered voter in       the State.'' HAVA requires that the database be created and       maintained in a ``uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.''       HAVA requires that state or local officials perform ``list       maintenance'' on a ``regular basis'' in accordance with the       provisions in the NVRA. For the purposes of identifying       felons and deceased individuals subject to removal, HAVA       requires that the state coordinate with state agencies       maintaining records on felony status and death.        HAVA further requires that states implement, consistent       with NVRA, systems ``of file maintenance that make[] a       reasonable effort to remove registrants who are ineligible to       vote from the official list of eligible voters,'' under which       ``registrants who have not responded to a notice and who have       not voted in 2 consecutive general elections for Federal       office shall be removed from the official list of eligible       voters, except that no registrant may be removed solely by       reason of a failure to vote.''        When done improperly, voter list maintenance and voter       purges disenfranchise otherwise eligible voters, use       unreliable practices and data that disproportionately sweep       in, and ultimately disenfranchise minority voters, often       occurring too close to an election  [[Page H4466]]       for a voter to correct the error if registration deadlines       have passed. Practices of voter purging have raised serious       concerns in recent years.      THE DISPROPORTIONATE AND DISCRIMINATORY BURDEN AND IMPACT OF LIST                  MAINTENANCE PRACTICES ON MINORITY VOTERS         Evidence received by the Subcommittee demonstrates that       misconceived voter list maintenance efforts have erroneously       sought to remove hundreds of thousands of properly registered       voters and, in doing so, disproportionately burdened minority       voters.        Following the Shelby County decision, several states,       including those previously covered by Section 5 preclearance,       have removed millions of registered voters from their voter       rolls. As Michael Waldman, President of the Brennan Center       for Justice, stated in his testimony before the Subcommittee,       ``abusive purges can remove duly registered citizens, often       without their knowledge.'' Mr. Waldman further testified       that, ``purges have surged in states once subject to federal       oversight under the VRA . . . states once covered by Section       5 saw purges at a 40 percent higher rate than the rest of the       country.''        The Brennan Center reports that more than 17 million voters       were removed from the rolls nationwide between 2016 and 2018.       In testimony during the 116th Congress, Mr. Waldman noted       that the purge rate outpaced growth in voter registration (18       percent) or population (6 percent) and that the Brennan       Center had calculated that two million fewer voters would       have been purged between 2012 and 2016 if jurisdictions       previously covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act had       purged their voter rolls at the same rate as other non-      covered jurisdictions. Kevin Morris, Researcher with the       Brennan Center, stated in his testimony before the       Subcommittee that:        ``Put differently, this means that the end of the       preclearance condition did not result in a one-time `catch-      up' of voter list maintenance, but rather ushered in a new       era in which the voter list maintenance practices of formerly       covered jurisdictions were substantially more aggressive than       other demographically-similar jurisdictions that were not       covered under the VRA. . . . Simply put, Shelby County       allowed and effected increased voter purges in counties with       demonstrated histories of racially discriminatory voting       rules.''        In several recent cases, states were found to have       improperly sought to remove properly registered voters. For       example, after the State of Wisconsin identified 341,855       registrants as potentially subject to removal on the basis of       having moved, thousands of individuals showed up to vote in       the following election at their address of registration,       indicating that Wisconsin had improperly flagged such       registrants as likely movers. Joshua Kaul, Attorney General       for the State of Wisconsin testified that, of the voters       initially listed on the ``movers report,'' over 6,000 voters       responded to the postcards sent out to the potential       ``movers'' and therefore kept their registration active,       however, many more were erroneously deactivated and left off       the poll book even though they had not moved. Attorney       General Kaul further testified that, during the 2018 Spring       Primary, Wisconsin Elections Commission staff reported that,       ``while available data from the DMV implied many had moved,       some of the voters, in fact, had not moved,'' and that       ``[o]verall, 12,133 [voters] were proactively reactivated by       staff or were stopped from being deactivated due to these       data discrepancies.'' A study of Wisconsin's process found       that at least four percent of the registrants who were       identified as potential movers and who did not respond to a       subsequent postcard cast a ballot at their address of       registration, with minority registrants twice as likely as       white registrants to do so.        The State of Arkansas moved to purge nearly 8,000 voters       from the rolls on grounds that they were ineligible to vote       due to a felony conviction--in Arkansas, those who have been       convicted of a felony lose their right to vote until their       sentence is completed or they are pardoned. In actuality,       however, the list included a high percentage of voters who       were indeed eligible and, in fact, some had never been       convicted of a felony or had had their voting rights       restored.        Thomas Saenz of MALDEF noted in his testimony before the       Subcommittee that, ``MALDEF and others also had to challenge       an attempt to purge thousands of naturalized Texans, who were       targeted through Motor Vehicles data that the state knew were       outdated and would not reflect recent naturalizations.''       Texas erroneously tried to remove tens of thousands of voters       on grounds that they were non-citizens. Evidence subsequently       showed that virtually all the registrants targeted by the       effort were, in fact, citizens eligible to vote.        Additionally, an analysis conducted by a non-partisan group       found that, of the more than 300,000 registrants Georgia       purged in 2019 for having changed residence, 63.3 percent       still lived at the residence identified on the voter       registration. The analysis found the Georgia erroneously       purged nearly 200,000 voters from its rolls.        In many cases, the percentage of voters from racial or       language minority groups subject to removal under these       recent, large-scale, and often errant, voter roll purge       efforts exceeded such groups' representation in the overall       population. For example, in 2012 the State of Florida created       a list of 182,000 registrants potentially subject to purge on       the grounds that the registrants were non-citizens. The       percentage of registrants included in the list that were       Hispanic (61 percent) substantially exceeded the percentage       of Hispanics in Florida's overall population (16 percent).       Litigation in the case of Mi Familia Vota Education Fund v.       Detzner showed that this change should have been submitted       for preclearance as a statewide change impacting formerly       covered counties in Florida under Section 5. NAACP LDF's       Democracy Diminished report noted that a 2018 report found       that since 2016, Florida has purged more than seven percent       of voters.        Likewise, mailers initiating the Wisconsin voter purge       effort were disproportionately sent to counties with       disproportionately large Black and Latino populations.       According to Demos, while the Black voting population       comprises only 5.7 percent of Wisconsin's total electorate,       ``the highest concentrations of 2019 ERIC mailers were sent       to areas that are home to the largest Black voting population       in Wisconsin.'' Demos reported that over one-third of the       mailers sent to voters on the 2019 ERIC list went to the two       counties where the vast majority of Wisconsin's Black voters       reside--Milwaukee and Dane--two counties that are home to       three quarters of Wisconsin's Black voters.        A 2016 analysis of an Ohio removal effort found that the       effort disproportionately removed voters in in-town African       American neighborhoods relative to predominantly white       suburbs--``in predominantly African American neighborhoods       around Cincinnati, 10 percent of registered voters had been       removed due to inactivity in 2012, compared to just 4 percent       in the suburban Indian Hill.'' And a purge of registrants in       Brooklyn, New York, removed 14 percent of voters in Hispanic-      majority districts compared to 9 percent of voters in other       districts.        Several approaches states have taken to culling voter rolls       have been shown to disproportionately remove properly       registered minority voters. To begin, a number of states,       including Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Minnesota, Tennessee, and       Texas, have sought to remove registrants on the basis that       they were non-citizens, often using state and federal       databases that can contain inaccurate information. To       identify non-citizen registrants, for example, Florida used       its Department of Motor Vehicles (``DMV'') and the federal       Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (``SAVE'')       databases and sought to match citizenship information in       those databases with its voting rolls.        As explained in the Subcommittee's prior report, the SAVE       database is used at times to verify immigration status when       an individual interacts with a state--however, SAVE does not       include a comprehensive and definitive listing of U.S.       citizens and states have been cautioned against using it to       check eligibility. Drivers' license databases have also       proven to be inaccurate for verifying voter registration       lists.        According to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights'       (``USCCR'') 2018 report, the list of 182,000 registrants was       created by comparing the voting rolls to drivers' license       databases, ``which is an extremely faulty method as drivers'       license databases do not reflect citizenship,'' and was then       cut back to approximately 2,600. Because, among other       reasons, DMV records and SAVE databases are not generally       updated to remove subsequently naturalized individuals,       Florida's reliance on those databases to identify voters       subject to being purged erroneously identified numerous       registrants as non-citizens, the vast majority of whom       were Latino, Hispanic, or Black. For example, of the 1,572       individuals that were notified by Miami-Dade County that       they were potentially subject to purge as identified non-      citizens, 98 percent of the respondents (549 out of 562)       provided evidence that they were citizens and eligible to       vote.        Similarly, Texas used DMV records to try to identify non-      citizens to remove from its voting rolls. Texas officials       initially claimed that the DMV matching effort identified       95,000 non-citizens as registered to vote (58,000 of whom had       voted in the previous election). However, because the DMV       data did not account for subsequently naturalized citizens,       the effort erroneously flagged thousands of individuals who       were lawfully registered to vote. In Harris County, Texas,       alone, approximately 60 percent of the voters flagged for       removal produced evidence confirming their citizenship and       entitlement to vote.        An audit of a sample of the remaining registrants       identified by the DMV database matching effort as ``non-      citizens'' yielded no non-citizens. Because over 87 percent       of Texas' naturalized citizens are Black, Latino, or Asian,       these falsely identified non-citizens were overwhelmingly       minority voters. Sonja Diaz, Founding Executive Director of       the Latino Policy and Politics Initiative at the University       of California, Los Angeles (``UCLA LPPI'') notes in her       testimony that, ``[t]he disingenuous targeting of naturalized       voters was not unique to Texas, but also found in 16 states       where inaccurate immigration data identified and purged       rightfully registered Latino voters.''        The NAACP Legal Defense Fund's report Democracy Diminished       noted an additional example of attempts to wrongfully or       inaccurately purge voters from the voting rolls, such as in       Alabama when, in 2012, parties entered into a partial consent       agreement to resolve issues under Section 5 of the VRA and       blocked the City of Evergreen from continuing to implement an       un-precleared discriminatory voter purge based on utility  [[Page H4467]]       records that omitted eligible voters from a voter       registration list, ``including nearly half of the Conecuh       County registered voters who reside in districts heavily       populated by Black people.''        Additionally, several states have relied, or tried to rely,       on multi-state databases--Interstate Voter Registration       Crosscheck (``Crosscheck'') and Electronic Registration       Information Center (``ERIC'')--to identify registrants who       allegedly moved to a different state, and therefore were       allegedly subject to removal.        Crosscheck, a joint venture of as many as 29 states, was       created by former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach to       identify voters registered in more than one state. The       Crosscheck program sought to do so by comparing voter       registration lists from participating states and flagging all       records that have the same first and last name, and date of       birth.        Quantitative studies have shown that Crosscheck is an       unreliable basis for identifying voters registered in       multiple jurisdictions because of the small number of data       points it uses to identify ``duplicate'' registrations--many       people share the same first and last name and the same       birthday. In other words, ``a substantial share of the       pairings returned to states by Crosscheck [as duplicate       registrations] represented cases in which two different       registrants shared the same first name, last name, and date       of birth instead of the same person being registered in to       vote in two different states.''        The states which used Crosscheck to identify duplicate       registrants should have known this--Crosscheck's, ``user       manual specifically states that `a significant number of       apparent double votes are false positives and not double       votes.' '' The accuracy of Crosscheck was also undermined by       its use of unreliable registration dates and other data entry       errors. Sophia Lin Lakin, Deputy Director of the Voting       Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union       (``ACLU'') notes in her testimony that:        ``A study by a team of researchers at Stanford, Harvard,       the University of Pennsylvania, and Microsoft found that       using Crosscheck to purge the voter rolls in one state,       ``could impede approximately 300 legitimate votes for each       double vote prevented.'' In other words, the system       incorrectly flags people as potential double voters       (``matches'') more than 99% of the time because of false       positives resulting from poor matching protocols.''        Crosscheck's high error rate and heavy reliance on first       and last names to identify duplicate registrants increases       the likelihood that properly registered minority voters are       subject to removal proceedings at a higher rate than properly       registered white voters. As Ms. Lakin explained to the       Subcommittee:        ``Among some minority populations, first-name naming       conventions are more commonly used, and many individuals born       around the same historical periods are given the same name.       Many often share the same or similar last names. Latinx       voters, for example, are more likely than white voters to       have one of the most common 100 surnames in the country.       Indeed, existing studies show that incorrect matches using       such a methodology are disproportionately concentrated among       minority voters. Crosscheck flagged one in six Latinx       Americans, one in seven Asian Americans, and one in nine       African Americans as potential double registrants.''        Several states have aggressively sought to purge voters       using data they knew or should have known would errantly lead       to the removal of properly registered voters. For example, an       election official in Kansas--the State that created and       managed Crosscheck--contemporaneously admitted that most of       the ``duplicate'' registrations identified by Crosscheck were       not the result of fraud, but instead reflected data entry       errors, writing in an email disclosed in litigation that,       ``[i]n the majority of cases of apparent double votes, in the       end they do not turn out to be real double votes due to poll       worker errors, mis-assignment of voter history, voters       signing the wrong lines in poll books, etc.''        Other states participating in Crosscheck were also aware of       its high error rate. A 2013 report by the Virginia State       Board of Elections, for example, found that, after conducting       ``quality control for verifying . . . data matches . . . only       57,000 of the 308,579'' registrations identified by       Crosscheck as ``duplicates'' in fact warranted initiation of       cancellation efforts, meaning that Virginia independently       determined that Crosscheck's error rate likely exceeded 75       percent.        Likewise, Indiana twice used database records to purge       ``duplicate'' registrants from its voting rolls, and in doing       so failed to comply with the NVRA. Indiana's first voter       purge effort used data from Crosscheck--which, as explained       above, is known to include numerous errors and       disproportionately identify minority voters as having moved--      to purge voters without providing affected registrants notice       of the removal efforts. Empirical evidence presented to the       district court revealed that ``Indiana's use of Crosscheck       data likely triggered list- maintenance against thousands of       eligible registrants who continued to reside at their address       of registration, but who had the misfortune of sharing the       same first name, last name, and date of birth of a registrant       in another Crosscheck member state.''        The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that       Indiana's voter purge program violated the NVRA by removing       voters who were suspected of changing residence without       adhering to the NVRA's notice requirements. Notwithstanding       that its previous purge effort had been found to be unlawful,       Indiana embarked on a second voter purge effort using a       proprietary database that a federal court found was,       ``functionally identical to Crosscheck.'' The district court       again concluded that the renewed voter roll purge effort       violated the NVRA for the same reason--Indiana was seeking to       purge voters using database information without adhering to       the NVRA's notice-and-waiting procedure.        Crosscheck is no longer a widely used system amongst states       because of its abuses and inaccuracies. Ms. Lakin testified       that the system has been on hold since a 2019 settlement in a       case brought by the ACLU of Kansas, ``on behalf of 945 voters       whose partial Social Security numbers were exposed by Florida       officials through a public records request'' and it has not       been used since, ``a Homeland Security audit discovered       security vulnerabilities in 2017.'' The failures and abuses       of Crosscheck demonstrate how list maintenance processes and       databases can be abused and lead to erroneous and       disproportionate purging of minority voters from the voting       rolls.        ERIC is another voter list maintenance tool which is used       by 30 states and the District of Columbia to maintain their       voter rolls. Whereas Crosscheck used just two datapoints to       identify ``duplicate'' registrations, ERIC uses more       information to identify duplicates, including DMV information       and Postal Service change of address data. The 31       jurisdictions participating in ERIC have agreed to send       postcards to registrants flagged by ERIC as duplicates to       confirm their registrations, the first step in removing such       registrants from voting rolls.        Though ERIC is generally viewed as more reliable than       Crosscheck, it too has room for improvement and can       disproportionately impact minority voters. As first noted       above, a 2021 study of Wisconsin registrants flagged by ERIC       as potentially subject to removal based on a change of       address found that approximately four percent of the voters       flagged as having moved subsequently voted at their address       of registration, meaning that for every 29 registrations ERIC       identified as having moved, at least ``one registrant       continued to reside at their address of registration and used       that address to cast a ballot'' in the next election.        Notably, the study found that registrants who were Black       and Hispanic were significantly more likely to be falsely       identified by ERIC as having moved than White registrants,       meaning that, ``the lower bound on the false mover error rate       is more than 100% larger for minorities than for whites.'' In       other words, the study found that ERIC erroneously identified       Black and Hispanic voters as subject to removal at twice the       rate at which it erroneously identified White voters as       subject to removal. The authors identified minority       registrants' disproportionate likelihood of living in a       multi-unit or larger household dwellings (and, therefore,       a likely relatively more frequent rate of change of       residence within a single jurisdiction) as likely causes       for their erroneous identification as subject to purge.        Summarizing the literature on the use of databases to       identify duplicate registrants, Dr. Marc Meredith of the       University of Pennsylvania--who has published papers       analyzing both Crosscheck and ERIC--testified that research       ``demonstrates that minority registrants are more likely than       White registrants to be incorrectly identified as no longer       eligible to vote at their address of registration.'' Given       that the majority of states use databases like Crosscheck and       ERIC to identify voters for removal, the discriminatory       burdens imposed by use of the databases extend throughout       much of the United States.        Ms. Lakin also provided testimony to the Subcommittee on       the dangers of ``mass voter challenges.'' According to her       testimony, state ``challenger laws''--laws that allow private       citizens to challenge the eligibility of prospective voters       on or before Election Day--have also been used to remove       voters from the rolls en masse. These laws have been used to       target voters along race, class, and disability lines. As Ms.       Lakin explains, ``[m]ass challenges are tantamount to a       systemic purge, but can be exploited to avoid federal rules       governing purge programs, such as the prohibition of systemic       removals of voter registrations within 90 days of a federal       general election'' and can deprive or attempt to deprive       thousands of their voting rights.        Furthermore, a 2020 report published by the Native American       Rights Fund (``NARF''), Obstacles at Every Turn: Barriers to       Political Participation Faced by Native American Voters,       highlighted the impact voter purges have on Native American       voters. The NARF report details how the non-traditional       addresses many Native voters have, or failure to accept a       P.O. Box and an applicant's drawing on the voter registration       form, can result in them being purged from the voter rolls.       Under the NVRA, election officials cannot deny a voter's       registration or purge an existing application because the       applicant uses a non-traditional address or must be       identified by landmarks or geographic features.        Additionally, failing to provide language assistance and       information about voter purges in the covered Native       language, as provided for under Section 203 of the VRA, can       negatively impact Native language speaking voters. Wrongful       purges can impact  [[Page H4468]]       Native voters for many subsequent elections. According to       NARF's report:        ``Once purged, many Native voters will not vote again in       non-Tribal elections. Effectively, a voter purge can result       in permanent disenfranchisement. Far too often, that is       precisely what election officials intend to accomplish in       Indian Country.''        The various processes by which voters are removed from the       rolls can be and is abused, resulting in numerous cases in       which otherwise eligible voters were erroneously removed from       the voting rolls. The data gather by the Subcommittee       illustrates the disproportionate and discriminatory impact       borne by minority voters.        This record also demonstrates minority voters face a       significant risk of being disproportionately burdened through       voter roll purges which are attributable to discriminatory       intent. The facts and circumstances surrounding several state       and local voter list maintenance efforts and voter purges       demonstrate that there is a high risk that the demonstrated,       disproportionate burdens on minority voters of such efforts       are a product of discriminatory intent.        First, the ``historical background'' of many of these       widespread voter purge efforts raises concerns about       intentional discrimination. Several analyses have found that       jurisdictions previously covered by Section 5 of the VRA--      states that had a history of engaging in intentional       discrimination against minority voters--removed voters from       their rolls at a faster rate than jurisdictions that had not       been previously covered by Section 5. As noted in the       discussion above, the Brennan Center found that jurisdictions       previously covered by Section 5 would have removed two       million fewer voters during the 2012 to 2016 period had they       removed registrants at the same rate as jurisdictions not       previously subject to preclearance; they removed voters at a       significantly higher rate than previously non-covered       jurisdictions.        Similarly, a 2020 nationwide study by two researchers at       Columbia University's Barnard College found post-Shelby       County increases in purge rates of between 1.5 and 4.5 points       in jurisdictions formerly covered by Section 5 compared to       jurisdictions that had never been covered. In several of       these previously covered states, the rate at which voters       cast provisional ballots increased after the voter purges,       suggesting that voters were improperly purged.        The Subcommittee further found that several state efforts       to remove alleged ``non- citizens'' from their voting rolls       involved statements made by elected officials revealing of       discriminatory intent. When Texas errantly used DMV records       to identify ``non-citizen'' registrants, the Attorney General       of Texas sent the following tweet:        ``VOTER FRAUD ALERT: The @Txsecofstate discovered       approximately 95,000 individuals identified by DPS as non-      U.S. citizens have a matching voting registration record in       TX, appr 58,000 of whom have voted in TX elections. Any       illegal vote deprives Americans of their voice.''        The Texas Governor then issued a statement supporting       ``prosecution where appropriate'' of ``this illegal vote       [sic] registration.'' As noted above, these inflammatory       allegations proved to be entirely false. Kristen Clarke,       then-Executive Director of the Lawyers' Committee, testified       before the Subcommittee in 2019 that, ``the list was based on       DMV data that the state knew was flawed and would necessarily       sweep in thousands of citizens who completed the       naturalization process after lawfully applying for a Texas       drivers' license.'' Ms. Diaz testified that litigation work       ``led Texas officials to admit to knowing the discriminatory       impact of their citizenship review on naturalized citizens.''       A federal court described the state officials' communications       regarding the non-citizen purge effort as ``threatening'' and       ``exemplif[ying] the power of government to strike fear and       anxiety and to intimidate the least powerful among us.''        Florida's misconceived use of the SAVE database to identify       ``non-citizen'' registrants involved similarly troubling       evidence of discriminatory intent. The U.S. Department of       Homeland Security expressly advised Florida officials that       the SAVE database was not a reliable tool to verify       citizenship. The State was similarly warned in a letter from       the Justice Department. Despite these warnings, Florida       nevertheless moved forward with its effort to remove alleged       non-citizens using SAVE data--an effort that, as explained       above, disproportionately targeted minority voters. The State       was ultimately ordered to discontinue its purge based on the       use of SAVE data following litigation.        Additionally, many of these voter purges--such as the       errant and unlawful purges in Florida, Georgia, and Texas--      occurred in states that were previously covered jurisdictions       under the VRA and had longstanding histories of racially       polarized voting, which courts recognize provides Republican-      controlled state legislatures with an incentive to engage in       election administration practices that disproportionately       burden minority voters likely to support non-Republican       candidates. For example, between 2016 and 2018, Georgia       purged more than 10 percent of its voters.        In the context of mass voter challenges, a 2016 case in       North Carolina is illustrative of the way in which voter       purges based off challenges can be used to discriminate       against and suppress minority voters. As detailed in Ms.       Lakin's testimony, in the months and weeks before the       November 2016 elections, boards of election in three North       Carolina counties canceled thousands of voter registrations,       ``based solely on challengers' evidence that mail sent to       those addresses had been returned as undeliverable.'' Voters       were not provided notice, and in one of the counties,       ``voters who were purged were disproportionately African       American.''        In a court hearing on the case, the federal district judge       stated that she was ``horrified'' by the ``insane'' process       by which voters could be removed from the rolls without their       knowledge, and went on to say that the mass challenges at       issue, ``sound[ed] like something that was put together in       1901.'' As noted previously, the federal court recognized       that these challenges are essentially systematic voter purges       and thus require the same protections, and ultimately barred       the state from removing voters based on these challenges       unless the voters is given notice and a waiting period and       unless the removals comply with the NVRA's mandate of 90 days       before federal elections.        As also noted above, the voter purge efforts in Florida and       Texas were intended to combat registration and voting by non-      citizens, yet each state's alleged evidence of non-citizen       registration and voting proved wholly unsupported when       subjected to even minimal scrutiny. The Texas actions, which       largely targeted Latino voters, followed an election year       wherein Latino voters doubled their turnout.        Since the 2020 election, several states have enacted new       laws, along partisan lines, designed to purge voters more       aggressively from their rolls. These new laws are justified       by no more than unsupported claims of fraud or irregularities       in the 2020 election. Iowa enacted a new ``use-it-or-lose-      it'' voting list maintenance law requiring that the Iowa       Secretary of State move all registrants who did not vote in       the most recent general election to ``inactive'' status--the       first step toward removing the registrant from the state's       rolls. Among those moved to ``inactive'' status were hundreds       of 17-year-olds who were eligible to register but not yet       eligible to vote in the 2020 general election.        Arizona and Florida enacted laws making it easier to remove       voters from the states' vote-by-mail registration lists. And       Georgia's new voting law, which imposes a variety of       restrictions on voting, authorizes any individual Georgia       citizen to file an unlimited number of challenges to the       eligibility of particular voters.                                  CONCLUSION         The evidence before the Subcommittee leads to a clear       conclusion--voter list maintenance and voter purge processes       can be, and are, wielded in a discriminatory manner and have       a disproportionate impact on minority voters. Additionally,       as will be discussed later in this report, erroneously       removing voters from the rolls does not affect only the       individual voter, but can have rippling consequences at the       polling place, increasing wait times that also       disproportionately impact minority voters.        As Ms. Lakin of the ACLU stated in her testimony, ``the       integrity of our voter rolls--and thus our democratic process       itself--are threatened by overly aggressive practices that       wrongfully purge legitimate voters from the rolls--often       disproportionately voters of color, voters with disabilities,       and other historically disenfranchised voters.'' Also,       tellingly, because the claimed justifications for the purge       efforts have often been found to be unsupported or       pretextual, the evidence illustrates that this       disproportionate impact can be the product of discriminatory       intent. As such, the methods by which states maintain their       voter rolls and remove voters from active voter lists       deserves a heightened level of scrutiny and protection for       voters.  Chapter Four--Voter Identification and Documentary Proof-of-Citizenship                                Requirements                                  BACKGROUND         A variety of state laws require voters to provide       identification or attempt to require documentary proof-of-      citizenship to vote or register to vote. In recent years,       voter identification (``voter ID'') has been pushed forward       by many as a simple requirement necessary to combat alleged       voter fraud. This, again, is a false narrative.        As Catherine Lhamon, then-Chair of the U.S. Commission on       Civil Rights, testified before the Subcommittee in 2019,       ``[N]ot only was there no evidence given to the Commission       about widespread voter fraud, the data and the research that       is bipartisan reflect that voter fraud is vanishingly rare in       this country . . . [A]nd so, it is duplicative and also       harmful to initiate strict voter ID, among other kinds of       requirements, in the name of combating voter fraud.''        Michael Waldman of the Brennan Center testified that,       ``[v]oter fraud in the United States is vanishingly rare. You       are more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit in-      person voter impersonation, for example.'' Furthermore, AAJC,       MALDEF, and NALEO, note in their November 2019 report that,       ``[n]o proponent of strict ID requirements has ever produced       credible evidence of widespread impersonation fraud in the       registration or voting process that identification cards       would allegedly prevent.''        Despite a continuous lack of credible evidence that in-      person voter fraud--the only form of fraud voter IDs would       prevent--exists, these laws and polices continue to be pushed       for and implemented across the country. Voter ID and       documentary proof-of-citizenship laws can and do       disproportionately  [[Page H4469]]       impact minority voters and create discriminatory barriers to       the ballot box.        Across both this Congress and the last, the Subcommittee       heard substantial testimony about the financial burden of       voter IDs--effectively creating a new poll tax--and the       disproportionate impact this has on minority and low-income       voters. Even when states proport to offer ``free'' IDs, they       are not free. This was also borne out in the U.S. Commission       on Civil Rights' 2018 statutory report, An Assessment of       Minority Voting Rights Access in the United States. For       instance, the USCCR report observed that ``expenses for       documentation (e.g., birth certificate), travel, and wait       times are significant--especially for low-income voters (who       are often voters of color)--and they typically range anywhere       from $75 to $175.'' According to Professor Richard Sobel's       report on the high cost of `free' photo voter ID cards:        ``When legal fees are added to these numbers, the costs       range as high as $1,500. Even when adjusted for inflation,       these figures represent substantially greater costs than the       $1.50 poll tax outlawed by the 24th Amendment in 1964.''        In evaluating these costs, Professor Sobel's report       identified seven types of costs for individual voters in       obtaining a ``free'' voter ID: (1) direct costs (out of       pocket expenses); (2) time costs for correspondence and       waiting to receive documents; (3) postage, delivery, and       special handling expenses for documents; (4) travel costs to       and from various agencies in order to obtain documents and       apply for the ID; (5) travel time costs for making trips to       government offices; (6) navigating costs for having to       maneuver complex bureaucracies; and (7) waiting time costs at       government offices. Professor Sobel notes that there are       other possible expenses for some individuals--such as those       without driver's licenses and without access to public       transportation, and some may have to pay legal fees and court       costs to obtain required documents.        Voter ID laws were some of the first voting laws       implemented in previously covered states following the       Supreme Court's decision in Shelby. As Mr. Waldman stated in       his testimony, ``[i]n 2013, at least six states--Alabama,       Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Virginia, and       Texas--implemented or began to enforce strict photo ID laws,       most of which had previously been blocked by the Department       of Justice due to their discriminatory impact.''        Hours after Shelby County was decided, Texas revived a       previously blocked voter ID law-- one of the strictest in the       country at the time. Passed and signed into law in 2011, the       law did not go into immediate effect as Texas was subject to       preclearance. In 2012, the law was denied preclearance on the       grounds that it discriminated against Black and Latino       voters. Yet, despite the denial of preclearance because of       discriminatory effects, within two hours of the Shelby       decision Texas' Attorney General announced the law would       immediately go into effect.        Also, within days of Shelby, Alabama announced it would       move to enforce a photo ID law it had previously refused to       submit to the Department of Justice for preclearance. In       2011, before the Shelby decision, the Alabama state       legislature passed House Bill (HB) 19, a law requiring voters       to present a form of government-issued photo ID to vote. HB       19 also included a provision that would allow a potential       voter without the required ID to vote if that person could be       ``positively identified'' by two poll workers, a provision       Ms. Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund characterized as       one that, ``harkened back to pre-1965 vouch-to-vote       systems.'' Despite the bill being passed and sent to the       Governor's desk in 2011, it was not implemented until after       the Shelby decision was handed down--after the state was no       longer required to submit its voting changes to the DOJ for       preclearance review under the VRA.        Less than two months after the Supreme Court struck down       the preclearance provisions, North Carolina state legislators       wasted no time passing an omnibus ``monster law.'' The bill       included voter ID provisions (among others) and would later       be struck down as racially discriminatory. Records in the       case showed that the data the State Legislature consulted,       ``showed that African Americans disproportionately lacked the       most common kind of photo ID'' and that after Shelby, ``with       race data in hand, the legislature amended the bill to       exclude many of the alternative photo IDs used by African       Americans. As amended, the bill retained only the kinds of       IDs that white North Carolinians were more likely to       possess.''        State laws governing the provision of identification at the       time of voting can take several forms. Certain states require       that a voter present a photo ID to vote (often referred to as       ``strict photo ID laws''). Other states require that a voter       present an ID to vote, but do not require that the ID include       a photograph (often referred to as ``strict non-photo ID       laws''). Others do not require that voters present an ID to       vote, but nevertheless permit poll workers to request that       voters present either a photo ID (so-called ``Non-Strict       Photo ID Laws'') or a non-photo ID (so-called ``Non-Strict ID       Laws''). Presently, 35 states have laws that request or       require voters show some form of ID at the polls.        Furthermore, proof-of-citizenship laws require registrants       to provide documentary proof that they are United States       citizens to register to vote. States that have required       documentary proof-of-citizenship as a condition to register       to vote have required a variety of forms of       citizenship documents such as birth certificates,       passports, certificates of naturalization, or driver's       licenses that specifically identify the individual as a       citizen.        Because they involve conditions for applying to register to       vote, proof-of-citizenship laws implicate the NVRA. The NVRA       provides that driver's license applications and renewal       applications ``shall serve as an application for voter       registration with respect to elections for Federal office.''       Under the NVRA, the federal voter registration form and state       voter registration forms included with a driver's license       application and renewal form must require that the applicant       attest that they are eligible to vote (including on the basis       of citizenship).        States such as Alabama, Arizona, Kansas, and Georgia       attempted to enact laws requiring documentary proof of       citizenship when registering to vote. Additionally, former       Election Assistance Commission (``EAC'') Executive Director       Brian Newby attempted to unilaterally allow Alabama, Georgia,       and Kansas to require stringent proof-of-citizenship       instructions when registering using the federal voter       registration form--a move that was blocked by a federal       court.        Evidence presented before the Subcommittee and discussed       below shows that voter ID and documentary proof-of-      citizenship requirements can and do have disproportionate,       discriminatory, and suppressive impact on minority voters.    THE DISPROPORTIONATE AND DISCRIMINATORY BURDEN AND IMPACT ON MINORITY        VOTERS OF VOTER ID AND DOCUMENTARY PROOF-OF-CITIZENSHIP LAWS       Voter ID Laws        Scholars and stakeholders have highlighted a number of ways       in which voter ID and documentary proof-of-citizenship laws       can and do discriminate against minority voters. As Ms. Diaz       of the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative testified:        ``Racial/ethnic minorities are among those most sensitive       to changes in voting. As such, reforms that enact voter       identification laws to participate in an election have a       disparate impact on minority voters voting. . . . Recent       studies show that these effects are even more disastrous for       youth of color, who have even less access to valid forms of       identification.''        Additionally, a February 2020 report published by the UCLA       School of Law Williams Institute estimates that voters who       are transgender, particularly transgender voters of color,       may face additional barriers when required to show ID to       vote, especially if they have no ID documents that reflect       their correct name and/or gender.        Obtaining the required form of identification or supporting       documents is costly, which can disproportionately deter       minority voters who are, on average, less wealthy than White       voters and who disproportionately lack access to qualifying       IDs or documentation. A 2013 study by Harvard Law School's       Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race & Justice found       that, even in states that provide ``free'' ID cards, the       actual cost of obtaining a qualifying photo ID ranged from       $75 to $368 due to indirect costs associated with travel       time, waiting time, and obtaining necessary supporting       documentation.        The documents required to establish proof-of-citizenship       are particularly expensive to obtain for naturalized and       derivative citizens, sometimes costing in excess of $1,000.       Naturalized voters often must bear these costs in states that       require voter ID as well because documents necessary to       establish citizenship also are often necessary to obtain a       qualifying form of identification. For example, Terry Ao       Minnis, Senior Director of Census and Voting Programs for       Asian Americans Advancing Justice AAJC, testified before the       Subcommittee that:        ``If naturalized and derivative citizens need a replacement       certificate of citizenship or naturalization to register to       vote, they face a major hurdle: certificates of citizenship       presently cost upwards of $1,170 and replacement certificates       of naturalization cost upwards of $555. In addition, to       obtain a replacement, the average wait is between 8.5 to 11       months for the Department of Homeland Security to process and       to obtain a certificate of citizenship the average wait is       6.5 to 14.5 months.''        These burdens will disproportionately burden a growing       percentage of the U.S. population. Ms. Minnis testified that       Census data show that 62.8 percent of eligible Asian       American; 31.0 percent of eligible Latino voters; 23.9       percent Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander voters; and 10.3       percent of eligible Black voters were naturalized citizens as       of 2019, compared to just 3.8 percent of non-Hispanic white       voters.        The substantial cost of obtaining qualifying IDs or       supporting documentation is particularly high when, as is the       case in certain states, DMVs, or other government offices       where a voter can obtain a qualifying ID or other form of       documentation, are less accessible for minority voters. Voter       ID and proof-of-citizenship laws have become, in effect,       modern-day poll taxes for many voters.        For example, the implementation of Alabama's voter ID law       soon after the Shelby decision, ``was accompanied by the       closure of nearly half of the state's DMV locations, with       most of the closures in disproportionately poor and Black       counties.'' The day after the Shelby decision, Alabama       announced it would implement its 2011 photo ID law--a law it       had delayed implementing for two years--for the 2014       election. As a result of the DMV closures, Black voters had  [[Page H4470]]       to spend more time and money to travel to obtain qualifying       IDs. As noted in the Subcommittee's previous report, the U.S.       Department of Transportation (``DOT'') launched an       investigation into the DMV closures, which eventually       resulted in DOT and the State of Alabama entering into a       settlement agreement.        Similarly, DMV offices are not present on reservation       lands, meaning that Native American voters often must drive       at least an hour to obtain an ID. Indeed, Native American       voters in North Dakota had to travel, on average, twice as       far as non-Native American voters to visit a driver's license       office, with the average Standing Rock Sioux member having to       travel over an hour and a half to reach the nearest site to       obtain identification. As Matthew Campbell, Staff Attorney       with NARF, testified:        ``Today, many Native American reservations are located in       extremely rural areas, distant from the nearest off-      reservation border town. This was by design--official       government policies forcibly removed Native Americans and       segregated them onto the most remote and undesirable land. As       a result of these policies, travel to county seats for voting       services can be an astounding hundreds of miles away.       Services such as DMVs and post offices can also require hours       of travel.''        Various studies have also demonstrated a variety of ways in       which voter ID laws disproportionately burden minority       voters. To begin, studies have consistently demonstrated that       minority voters are disproportionately likely to lack forms       of identification required by voter ID laws, meaning that       minority voters are more likely to have to take the time and       bear the costs of obtaining a qualifying ID.        For example, one analysis found that in four states that       had adopted voter ID laws-- Wisconsin, Indiana, Pennsylvania,       and Texas--White voters were statistically more likely to       possess a valid form of ID than Latino and Black voters.       Numerous other state-specific and nationwide studies have       reached the same conclusion--minority voters       disproportionately lack qualifying IDs.        A meta-analysis using both state-level and national survey       data revealed ``that the magnitude of the negative impact of       race on the likelihood of having a valid ID is substantial,       outstripping other relevant variables like age, gender, and       having been born outside the United States.'' This       differential effect persisted even when the authors       controlled for other explanatory factors like education       level, home ownership, and income.        The Subcommittee also received evidence and testimony that       the discriminatory burdens associated with obtaining voter ID       and documentary proof-of-citizenship laws are particularly       pronounced for Native American voters. For example, a North       Dakota voter ID law required that qualifying IDs include the       voter's physical address. However, Native American voters who       live on reservations often lack a physical address, instead       using a post office box. Mr. Campbell testified that       ``obtaining a state issued ID is unreasonably difficult for       many Native voters.''        The cost of obtaining a qualifying ID is also       disproportionately burdensome for Native Americans, many of       whom live below the poverty line and far from offices where       they can obtain a qualifying ID. Mr. Campbell, who himself       served as one of the litigators on the North Dakota voter ID       case, testified that due to these and other issues, ``voter       identification laws can lead to the disenfranchisement of       American Indians and Alaska Natives.'' Mr. Campbell further       testified that ``[f] or impoverished Native Americans, the       cost of identification is often prohibitively expensive. Even       nominal fees can present a barrier.'' Likewise, Alysia       LaCounte, General Counsel for the Turtle Mountain Band of       Chippewa Indians, testified before the Subcommittee during       the 116th Congress that the unemployment rate on the Turtle       Mountain Reservation hovers near 70 percent: ``[u]nderstand       that the fee of $15 is not exorbitantly high, but $15 is milk       and bread for a week for a poor family.'' Drivers' licenses       are also often not required for everyday life on the       reservation.        Tribal IDs are also not automatically accepted for       registration and voting purposes, despite the barriers for       tribal members to get a state ID. Often, even when states do       accept a tribal ID, the state may require the ID contain       certain information to be sufficient that tribal IDs do not       contain--updating tribal IDs to contain specialized       information or security features can be expensive for       impoverished tribes. Additionally, housing insecurity is       pervasive among Native communities, as is a lack of regular       postal service, leading many Native individuals to use P.O.       Boxes instead of a residential address or omit an address       altogether. All of these factors lead to voter ID laws having       a disproportionate impact on Native American voters.        The Subcommittee also received substantial testimony in the       116th Congress from leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe,       the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, the Spirit Lake       Tribe, and the Mandan Hidatsa and Arikara Nation about the       significant and disproportionate burden North Dakota's voter       ID law had upon their tribal governments and members. Tribal       leaders testified as to the substantial resource burden their       tribes took on in order to provide their members with new IDs       that would qualify for voting under the new law--resources       their tribes did not necessarily have. Additional testimony       was gathered in the 116th Congress at a field hearing       conducted in Phoenix, Arizona, and the February 11, 2020,       hearing on Native American voting rights further detailing       how voter ID issues disproportionately impact Native voters.        Other studies have demonstrated that local officials       administer voter ID laws in a discriminatory manner. Dr.       Lonna Rae Atkeson of the University of New Mexico testified       that several studies of poll workers and voters suggest that       implementation practices can result in unequal application of       voter identification laws. A study of New Mexico's non-strict       voter ID law, for example, found that poll officials were       more likely to request that Hispanic voters show an ID than       non-Hispanic voters. Dr. Atkeson further testified that the       effects of voter ID laws may also be to affect voter       confidence and satisfaction in the election process, which       may have long-term consequences on voter turnout or lead to       increases in provisional voting. Additionally, Dr. Atkeson       testified that subsequent studies haves sometimes shown       various degrees of differences in implementation of voter ID       laws between Whites and Hispanics in New Mexico.        Similar studies in Michigan and Boston reached the same       result--poll workers are significantly more likely to request       that minority voters present ID than White voters. Relatedly,       a separate multi-state study found that (1) state and local       election officials were less likely to answer email questions       regarding voter ID requirements when the individual posing       the question had a Latino last name and that (2) election       officials provided less accurate information regarding voter       ID requirements to requesters with Latino last names. This       research demonstrates that even non-strict voter ID laws       impose discriminatory burdens on minority voters.        Numerous studies also have demonstrated that strict voter       ID laws disproportionately decrease registration and turnout       of minority voters relative to White voters. One study       focusing on Texas' strict voter ID law found that       ``registrants voting without ID in 2016 were 14 percentage       points less likely to vote in the 2014 election, when a       strict ID mandate was in place, and significantly more likely       to be Black and Latinx than the population voting with ID in       2016.'' Additionally, a 2014 report prepared by the       Government Accountability Office found that strict voter ID       laws in Kansas and Tennessee reduced turnout by larger       amounts among African American registrants than among White,       Asian American, and Hispanic registrants.        Nationwide and multi-state studies conducted by Dr. Nazita       Lajevardi of Michigan State University and her colleagues       compared political participation of minority voters in states       with strict voter ID laws and states without such laws. In       one set of studies, Dr. Lajevardi and her colleagues found       that strict voter ID laws ``have a differentially negative       impact on the turnout of racial and ethnic minorities in       primaries and general elections,'' estimating that Latinos,       for example, are 10 percent less likely to turnout in general       elections in states with strict voter ID laws than in states       without such laws.        Dr. Lajevardi and her colleagues further found that, in       primary elections, strict voter ID laws ``depress Latino       turnout by 9.3 percentage points, Black turnout by 8.6       points, and Asian American turnout by 12.5 points.'' These       turnout declines were associated with increases--in many       cases several-fold increases--in the gap in participation       rates between white and non-white voters. In another study       published several years later, Dr. Lajevardi and her co-      authors found a similar result using a different multi-state       dataset and methodology. The study found that ``turnout       declined significantly more in racially diverse counties       relative to less diverse counties in states that enacted       strict identification laws . . . than it did in other       states.''        Summarizing these and other studies analyzing the impact of       voter ID laws on the political participation of minority       voters, Dr. Lajevardi testified that ``strict voter       identification laws are racially discriminatory and have real       consequences for impacting the racial makeup of the voting       population.'' Dr. Lajevardi also testified that, ``[b]y       raising the cost of voting for some individuals more than       others, they affect who votes and who does not, and in doing       so, they substantially shape whose voices are represented in       our democracy.''        Dr. Matthew Barreto of the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics       Initiative agreed:        ``The best evidence available suggests that voter ID laws       have a negative, racially disparate impact on turnout across       the states . . . [and] that racial disparities in access to       identification appropriate for voting persist even after       accounting for important covariates like education and       income.''      Documentary Proof-of-Citizenship Requirements        While all states require proof of citizenship to register       to vote, an attestation of citizenship under penalty of       perjury has generally met the requirement. Similar to voter       ID laws, documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements have       purported to combat non-citizen voting--a claim that is       false.        Documentary proof-of-citizenship laws have also been shown       to have similar discriminatory effects on political       participation by minority voters as voter ID laws. For       example, evidence developed in the course of an investigation       by the Kansas State Advisory Committee to the USCCR found       that a  [[Page H4471]]       disproportionate number of Kansas voters who had incomplete       voting applications or were placed on the suspense voters       list were located in Census tracts with a disproportionately       high percentage of Black residents, younger voters, and       low-income voters, for whom the high cost of obtaining       proof-of-citizenship was disproportionately burdensome.       After Arizona's adoption of a documentary proof-of-      citizenship law, for example, ``the percent share of       Latino voter registration in the state fell.''        Recent studies have demonstrated that African American and       Latino voters are less likely to have access to birth       certificates and passports--documents often required to       establish proof of citizenship--than White voters. And Puerto       Rican-born voters face particularly significant difficulty       obtaining documents necessary to prove their citizenship as a       result of a 2009 change in birth certificate standards that       invalidated all birth certificates issued by Puerto Rico       prior to 2010--a change that potentially impacts       approximately 1.8 million Puerto Rican-born adults now living       on the mainland. Since the new standards were adopted, Puerto       Rican-born voters who seek to register to vote in a state       with a proof-of-citizenship requirement must either have a       U.S. passport, or go through additional procedures and pay       fees for a new birth certificate after July 2010.        Kira Romero-Craft, Director, Southeast Region for       LatinoJustice PRLDEF, testified that in July 2019, for       example, LatinoJustice and the Southern Center for Human       Rights filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern       District of Georgia on behalf of their client for       discrimination based on the Georgia Department of Driver       Services' (``DDS'') practice of ``confiscating original       identity documents from Puerto Rican-born applicants for       Georgia drivers' licenses and denying equal protection of the       laws and privileges due to Puerto Rican-born U.S. citizens.''       LatinoJustice's investigations found that the practice of       turning away U.S. citizens presenting Puerto Rican identity       documents, confiscating Puerto Rico birth certifications and       original Social Security cards for ``fraud'' investigations,       or denying them the opportunity to exchange their driver       licenses for a Georgia license had been going on as far back       as the 1990s and undoubtedly harmed U.S. citizens who were       otherwise eligible to vote.        As Ms. Diaz of the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics       Initiative testified, proof-of-citizenship laws ``give rise       to a presumption that the growing and diverse Latino       population is under attack; this was especially true of       Arizona, where a proof of citizenship law was overturned by       the Ninth Circuit.'' Andrea Senteno, Regional Counsel for       MALDEF, testified that there is a growing body of evidence       that:        ``[S]hows that proof of citizenship requirements in fact       prevent significant numbers of U.S. citizens from registering       to vote, and that ``[s]urveys show that millions of American       citizens--between five and seven percent--don't have the most       common types of documents used to prove citizenship: a       passport or birth certificate.''        Additionally, Terry Ao Minnis of AAJC testified that       documentary proof-of-citizenship, as well as voter ID       requirements, disproportionately impact Asian Americans due       to high rates of immigration and naturalization in the       community. Ms. Minnis testified that Asian Americans will       ``face greater barriers to registration than white voters       under these laws as 76.6 percent of Asian American adults are       foreign-born and 39.5 percent of Asian American adults have       naturalized nationwide, compared to 4.6 percent of white       adults who are foreign-born and 3.8 percent who have       naturalized.''                ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF DISCRIMINATORY PURPOSE         The Subcommittee was also confronted with evidence that the       discriminatory impact of voter ID and documentary proof-of-      citizenship laws are the product of state legislatures       enacting them with a discriminatory purpose. As noted above,       following the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County,       several states enacted or implemented particularly strict       voter ID laws, several of which were later struck down by       courts as intentionally discriminatory, and violative of the       Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. These restrictions       are examples of discrimination in voting that warrant       preemptive federal protections.        For example, as first discussed above, within days of the       Shelby County decision, Texas implemented a photo ID law that       had previously been denied preclearance by the Department of       Justice. As Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund       testified, the law was widely described as the most       restrictive voter ID law in the country as it permitted       concealed handgun license owners to vote with that ID--a form       disproportionately held by white Texans--but prohibited the       use of student IDs, and employee or trial state or federal       government-issued IDs in voting.        The Texas voter ID case took years to make its way through       the courts. A federal court found that the voter ID law was       unconstitutionally intended to discriminate against minority       voters, relying on evidence that the law selectively excluded       forms of IDs that were disproportionately likely to be used       by minority voters, that the legislature knew the law was       likely to disproportionately burden minority voters, and that       circumstantial evidence indicated that the legislature's       race-neutral justification for the law--preventing voter       fraud--was ``pretextual.'' Ms. Nelson testified further that,       while LDF was ultimately successful in the Texas voter ID       litigation, ``in the years after the trial and while the case       made its way twice to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and       back to the trial court, Texas elected numerous candidates to       state and federal office . . .''        A federal appellate court also struck down North Carolina's       voter ID law as intentionally discriminatory, a law which was       also was put forth within days of the Shelby County decision.       Evidence in the North Carolina voter ID case revealed that       legislators tailored the list of acceptable IDs to exclude       forms of identification disproportionately relied on by       minority voters. To support its finding of discriminatory       intent--that the state legislature drafted the law to       ``target African Americans with almost surgical precision''--      the court emphasized that North Carolina had a long history       of racially polarized voting, that the law required forms of       IDs that African Americans disproportionately lacked, that       legislators knew the law would disproportionately burden       minority voters but nevertheless enacted it, and that the       circumstances surrounding the passage of the law--that the       law was amended to become far more strict the day after       Shelby County was decided--indicated that the legislature       acted with discriminatory intent.        While the court ultimately struck down the North Carolina       law, litigation alone is a costly, time consuming, and       insufficient remedy. As Allison Riggs, Co-Executive Director       and Chief Counsel for Voting Rights at the Southern Coalition       for Social Justice (``SCSJ''), testified:        ``[I]t took us three years and millions of dollars to       finally secure a ruling from the Fourth Circuit Court of       Appeals that the law was intentionally racially       discriminatory, designed with almost ``surgical precision''       to change election rules in a way that would disadvantage       Black voters the most. More than the time and cost, there       were elections conducted with the photo ID requirement . . .       Thousands of voters, disproportionately Black, were denied       the franchise while we litigated that case, and those are       real injuries to those voters' fundamental right to vote that       can never be made whole.''        As the Texas and North Carolina cases illustrate, the risk       that voter ID and documentary proof-of-citizenship laws can       and will be enacted with discriminatory intent is       particularly significant because legislatures can tailor the       forms of acceptable IDs and documentation to       disproportionately burden minority voters.        For example, Dr. Barreto, who has conducted extensive       research into the discriminatory effects of voter ID laws,       explained in his testimony that ``[i]n Texas, hunting and gun       permits, which Whites are statistically more likely to       possess, are legitimate forms of ID but social service cards,       more often held by Blacks and Latinos, are not.'' Consistent       with that empirical evidence, a Texas legislator testified       ``that all of the legislators knew that [the voter ID law],       through its intentional choices of which IDs to allow, was       going to affect minorities most.''        Regarding discriminatory intent, Dr. Barreto further       explained that research shows that voter ID laws have been       adopted by partisan legislatures, often in states with a       history of racially polarized voting, to burden voters likely       to vote against the party with legislative control.       ``Existing research demonstrates that voter ID laws are       purposeful tools, designed with the marginalized fringe of       the electorate in mind, to shape who votes primarily in favor       of state Republican legislatures facing competitive       elections,'' Dr. Barreto explained.        Consistent with Dr. Barreto's summary of the literature,       Matthew Campbell testified that North Dakota's Republican       legislature--which had previously rejected voter ID laws--      enacted the state's strict voter ID law after Native American       voters were instrumental to the election of a Democratic       candidate to the United States Senate.        Using an atypical procedural process known as a ``hoghouse       amendment'' that ``expedited the bill's passage and stifled       debate,'' the legislature enacted the law knowing that Native       Americans, who often have P.O. Boxes rather than the physical       address required by the statute, would have a       disproportionately difficult time obtaining a qualifying ID.       A federal court subsequently struck down the law on grounds       that it imposed an unconstitutional burden on Native American       voters, relying on evidence that Native American voters       were disproportionately likely to lack a qualifying ID and       ruling that North Dakota could not enforce the laws       without providing a safety net for voters who ``cannot       obtain a qualifying ID with reasonable effort.''        Despite a lack of fraud and knowledge of the significant       impact on Native American voters, North Dakota adopted a       strict voter ID law again in 2017. Mr. Campbell testified       that, in considering the new voter ID law, ``the legislature       failed to study, in any way, the impact the law would have on       Native Americans. It did not consult any tribal governments       about whether its tribal members were negatively impacted by       the bill or whether they supported or opposed the bill.''        Following enactment, additional litigation ensued, and the       parties eventually settled the matter in a way that ensured       Native voters would have equal access to the ballot, but not       before the District Court found that the new law required       voters have one of the same forms of a qualifying ID that,       ``was previously found to impose a discriminatory  [[Page H4472]]       and burdensome impact on Native Americans.''        Similarly, in finding that the Texas voter ID law was       intentionally discriminatory, the court emphasized that the       voter ID law was passed ``in the wake of a seismic       demographic shift, as minority populations rapidly increased       in Texas, such that . . . the party currently in power [wa]s       facing a declining voter base and c[ould] gain partisan       advantage through a strict voter ID law.''        The Texas and North Carolina examples illustrate another       reason why there is a substantial risk that the       discriminatory effects of voter ID and proof-of-citizenship       laws are attributable to a discriminatory purpose: States'       proffered justification for the laws have been shown to be       pretextual or unsupported.        For instance, in the Texas voter ID case, the court found       evidence ``support[ing] a finding that the Legislature's       race-neutral reason of ballot integrity offered by the State       is pretextual.'' Among other evidence, the record showed that       ``the evidence before the Legislature was that in-person       voting, the only concern addressed by [the voter ID law],       yielded only two convictions for in-person voter       impersonation fraud out of 20 million votes cases in the       decade leading up to [the law's] passage.''        A case successfully challenging a Kansas documentary proof-      of-citizenship statute similarly turned on evidence that the       alleged justification for the law--preventing voter fraud--      lacked meaningful factual support. In finding that the law       violated the Equal Protection Clause, the U.S. Court of       Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that law's significant       burden on the right to vote (it prevented more than 31,000       qualified applicants from obtaining registration) far       outweighed the evidence supporting the state's claimed need       to prevent voter fraud by non-citizens (the state identified       only 30 non-citizens who registered to vote in the 10 years       leading up to adoption of the documentary proof-of-      citizenship law).        The record in a case successfully challenging an Arizona       proof-of-citizenship law similarly included a conspicuous       absence of evidence supporting the legislature's claimed       purpose of combatting voter fraud by non-citizens. Ms.       Senteno of MALDEF testified that, Arizona's Proposition 200       was enacted with the purpose of combatting undocumented       immigration and the provisions related to proof of       citizenship were in part an effort to ``combat voter       fraud''--but the State ``failed to identify a single instance       in which an undocumented immigrant registered or voted in       Arizona.'' Ms. Senteno testified that:        ``Proof-of-citizenship requirements have yet to prove       effective in making our elections more secure or to be more       effective than the safeguards against improper registration       and voting that already exist. Meanwhile, such requirements       have shown to significantly impede the political       participation of voters of color.''        Additionally, since the 2020 election, several states have       adopted bills expanding voter ID requirements, appealing to       unsupported claims that fraud occurred in the 2020 election       as justification. For example, the omnibus Georgia voting       bill requires voters requesting an absentee ballot provide an       ID. Under previous law, voters only had to sign the       application attesting to their eligibility to vote.       Similarly, Florida's omnibus voting law added a new       requirement that voters provide a form of ID to obtain a       mail-in ballot. Arkansas, Montana, and Wyoming also made       their voter ID laws more restrictive.                                  CONCLUSION         The evidence before the Subcommittee is overwhelming--voter       ID laws and requirements for documentary proof-of-citizenship       can and do have a disproportionate, discriminatory impact on       minority voters. The evidence presented shows that minority       voters are less likely than White voters to have the required       ID and are more likely to lack the documents required to       obtain these IDs. Voter ID and documentary proof-of-      citizenship requirements amount to modern-day poll taxes--as       the evidence shows, even when states claim to provide free       IDs, the cost to voters is not free.        The burden of voter ID and proof-of-citizenship laws is       borne disproportionately by Black, Latino, Asian American,       and Native American voters, and as the evidence shows, states       can and have enacted laws governing ID requirements to cast a       ballot that not only have a discriminatory impact but do so       with discriminatory intent. The discriminatory and       suppressive effects of voter ID and proof-of-citizenship       requirements warrant a heightened level of scrutiny and       protection to ensure every voter has equal and equitable       access to their right to vote.   Chapter Five--Access to Multi-Lingual Voting Materials and Assistance                                  BACKGROUND         As it was amended over the years, the VRA was expanded to       afford additional protections to language minority or       limited-English proficiency (``LEP'') voters. The language       access provisions were added after Congress recognized that       certain minority citizens experienced historical       discrimination and disenfranchisement due to limited English       proficiency and speaking ability. The 1975 amendments adding       Section 203 of the VRA came after ``Congressional findings of       discrimination and intimidation of voters with limited-      English proficiency, which had led to ongoing socioeconomic       disparities and low literacy rates.''        Sections 4(e), 4(f), 203, and 208 are considered the       ``language minority provisions'' of the VRA. These sections       were not overturned by the Shelby decision, and remain key       protections for LEP voters. However, significant gaps in       enforcement and implementation remain, and the Court's       decision in Shelby and subsequent removal of preclearance       hindered a key enforcement and monitoring mechanism, limiting       access for millions of LEP voters--a disproportionate number       of whom are minority voters.        Section 4(e) protects U.S. citizens educated ``in American       flag schools'' in a language other than English by barring       states and local governments from conditioning such citizens'       right to vote on their ability to read, write, understand, or       interpret English. In practice, this means that every state       and local government is required to provide language       assistance to such voters and it provides specific       protections to citizens educated in Puerto Rico in Spanish.        These protections extend to all 50 states, whether the       voter lives in a jurisdiction covered by the population       thresholds of Section 203's coverage formula or not.        Section 203 of the VRA, originally adopted as part of the       second reauthorization in 1975 and later amended and       expanded, requires jurisdictions where the number of U.S.       citizens of voting age in a single, covered language minority       group that is more than 10,000 or exceeds five percent of the       jurisdiction's total population, and their illiteracy rate       is higher than the national rate, to provide voting       materials in the language of the language minority. The       definition of permanently prohibited ``test[s] and       device[s]'' was expanded to include:        ``[A]ny practice or requirement by which any State or       political subdivision provided any registration or voting       notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials       or information relating to the electoral process, including       ballots, only in the English language, where the Director of       the Census determines that more than five per centum of the       citizens of voting age residing in such State or political       subdivision are members of a single language minority.''        The 1992 VRA amendments expanded the coverage formula for       language access to include not only the previously covered       formula of five percent of eligible voters who were LEP       voters and members of a language minority group, but also       those jurisdictions that did not have the high five percent       threshold, but had at least 10,000 LEP citizens who are       members of a single language minority group. This expansion       meant coverage would also reach Latino and Asian American       voters in some large cities. These amendments also expanded       the coverage formulas and access for Native Americans living       on Indian Reservations to include any Indian reservation       where the LEP population exceeded five percent of all       reservation residents. Under the VRA 2006 reauthorization,       the sunset date for language minority assistance required       under Section 203 was extended to August 5, 2032.        Which jurisdictions are covered under Section 203 is       determined by the Census Bureau based on the formula set out       in the VRA--the language minority groups covered are those       that speak Asian, American Indian, Alaska Native, and Spanish       languages. The most recent determinations for Section 203       coverage were made on December 5, 2016. In the 2016       evaluation, the Census Bureau found that 263 jurisdictions       met the threshold for coverage.        Between 2011 and 2016, 15 additional counties were added to       the list of localities required to provide language       assistance materials as well as four new states. Political       subdivisions within Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,       Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa,       Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi,       Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma,       Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virginia,       Washington, and Wisconsin currently fall under Section 203       coverage and are required to provide bilingual voting       materials. California, Florida, and Texas currently fall       under statewide coverage for Spanish language materials.        Added in the 1982 VRA reauthorization, Section 208 requires       that voters who require assistance to vote be provided the       assistance of their choice. Voters have the right to       assistance by a person of their choosing--other than their       employer, an agent of their employer, or an officer or agent       of the voter's union--whether they need assistance because of       blindness, disability, or inability to read or write.       According to the USCCR's 2018 Minority Voting Rights Access       Report, Section 208 litigation by the Justice Department       typically relates to the failure to provide language       assistance or a failure to allow a disabled person to choose       their assistance.        Prior to the Shelby County decision, covered jurisdictions       were required to obtain preclearance of any changes in laws       related to the provision of language access under Sections       4(f)(4) and Section 5. Following the Shelby decision, the       Justice Department stated that it believed it could no longer       require preclearance of changes in access to language       materials and support in the previously covered       jurisdictions.        When properly implemented, the language access provisions       increase engagement in the democratic process and access to       the ballot for millions of LEP voters. For example, John       Yang, President and Executive Director of AAJC, testified       before the Subcommittee in 2019 that ``Section 203 has been  [[Page H4473]]       one of the most critical provisions in ensuring Asian       Americans are able to cast their ballot.'' Jerry Vattamala,       Director of the Democracy Program at the Asian American Legal       Defense and Education Fund (``AALDEF'') testified that:        ``Section 203 has proven to be a clear and effective       measure to ensure access to LEP voters through language       assistance. . . . However, the Supreme Court's Shelby County       decision dismantling the coverage formula has left a large       gap in protections for Asian American voters that requires       Congressional action and renewed DOJ enforcement of remaining       VRA provisions.''        Failure to provide multi-lingual voting materials or       assistance can negatively impact millions of potential       voters. According to the 2018 Census data, more than 37       million American adults speak a language other than English       and more than 11.4 million of them are not yet fully fluent       in English. The 2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 5-      year Narrative Profile from the Census Bureau found that,       among people at least five years old living in the U.S. from       2015-2019, 21.6 percent spoke a language other than English       at home. Additionally, navigating the electoral process is       complex and can be overwhelming. Some LEP voters will have       immigrated from a country with a vastly different electoral       and voting process.        Evidence collected by the Subcommittee during the 116th and       117th Congresses, along with historical data, illustrates a       long history of jurisdictions' failure to comply with the       language access provisions, a failure to provide adequate       language assistance and translated materials, and the       discriminatory impact this failure has on minority voters'       access to the ballot.        Arturo Vargas, Chief Executive Officer of the National       Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials       Educational Fund (``NALEO'') testified in 2019 that,       ``Americans who depend upon language assistance are becoming       more diverse and more geographically dispersed, and these       factors heighten the importance of effective language       assistance.''    THE DISPROPORTIONATE AND DISCRIMINATORY BURDEN AND IMPACT OF LACK OF            ACCESS TO MULTI-LINGUAL VOTING MATERIALS AND SUPPORT         The failure to provide multi-lingual voting materials       disproportionately burdens minority voters. Sonja Diaz of       UCLA's Latino Policy and Politics Initiative testified that,       as of 2019, approximately 4.82 percent of the citizen voting-      age population needs to cast a ballot in a language other       than English. Data trends show that populations such as Asian       American and Latino voters will only continue to grow. While       the full 2020 Census data has yet to be released, Ms. Minnis       testified that, among Asian Americans ``[t]his growth will       continue, with Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI)       voters making up five percent of the national electorate by       2025 and 10 percent of the national electorate by 2044.''        According to 2017 data, more than 85 percent of the voters       who likely require language assistance in voting were voters       of color. For example, Ms. Diaz stated that an estimated six       million eligible Latino voters nationwide are not fully       fluent in English and require some form of language       assistance in order to vote. Additionally, Juan Cartagena,       President and General Counsel of LatinoJustice PRLDEF,       testified before the Subcommittee in 2019 that the population       on the island of Puerto Rico is roughly 65 percent Spanish-      language dominant. Furthermore, in Puerto Rico all government       proceedings happen in Spanish, making the language access       protections afforded Puerto Ricans educated on the island       under Section 4(e) critical to their ability to participate       fully in elections within the 50 states.        According to data collected by the Native American Rights       Fund, ``[o]ver a quarter of all single-race American Indian       and Alaska Natives speak a language other than English at       home,'' rendering multi-lingual voting materials particularly       important for Native American voters.        Ms. Minnis of AAJC testified that, because of historical       discrimination that denied Asian Americans the rights held by       U.S. citizens for most of the country's existence, and       because immigration from Asia was not reopened until 1965,       today ``almost three out of every four Asian Americans speaks       a language other than English at home and almost one in three       Asian Americans is limited English proficient (LEP)--that is,       has some difficulty with the English language.''        The provision of language access materials, or lack       thereof, extends to all facets of the voting process. Ms.       Minnis testified that, even basic information such as       election notices and voter registration forms or the       information requested on those forms ``is inaccessible to       millions of eligible American voters unless they have access       to multilingual translators, preventing the eligible voter       from even starting the process.'' Ms. Minnis further       testified that, even if the voter is able to get past the       registration phase, without language assistance they may have       issues navigating the voting process, with many voters forced       to use election websites that are English-only, or a       jurisdiction may attempt to use Google Translate or a       similar tool, which may produce incomplete or inaccurate       translations, the equivalent of providing no translation       at all.        Matthew Campbell of NARF testified to the disproportionate       impact the lack of language access and assistance has on       Native voters as well. According to his testimony, ``[t]wo-      thirds of all speakers of American Indian or Alaska Native       languages reside on a reservation or in a Native village,       including many who are linguistically isolated, have limited       English skills, or a high rate of illiteracy,'' and that a       lack of assistance or complete and accurate translations of       materials for LEP American Indian and Alaska Native voters       ``can be a substantial barrier.'' Thirty-five political       subdivisions in nine states are required to provide bilingual       written materials and oral language assistance for LEP       American Indian and Alaska Native voters under Section 203.       Mr. Campbell noted that, jurisdictions have often failed to       provide any language assistance at all, forcing Native voters       to file costly lawsuits.        Scholars and stakeholders have demonstrated that providing       LEP voters with voting materials in their native language       increases the likelihood they will participate in the       political process. Studies have shown, for example, that       language fluency correlates with political participation,       meaning that lowering language barriers should lead to       increases in turnout among LEP voters. Summarizing the       scholarly literature examining the impact of access to multi-      lingual voting materials on LEP voters, Dr. Barreto explained       that ``[r]esearch in political science has documented with       clear evidence that access to Spanish, Asian, and Native/      indigenous language voting materials increases voter       participation rates among impacted minority voters.''        Scholars and stakeholders have also analyzed the       registration and turnout effects associated with living in a       jurisdiction that provides language access materials, finding       that access to native language voting materials increases       political participation. For example, after San Diego County,       California, began providing language assistance to Latinos       and Filipinos, voter registration among those two groups       increased by more than 20 percent. Regarding turnout, one       multi-jurisdiction study found that turnout of voters who       speak only Spanish increased between seven and 11 percentage       points in counties that were required to provide language       access support relative to counties with similarly large       Latino populations not required to provide bilingual voting       support.        Another multi-state study found that, in the 2012 election,       coverage under the VRA's language access provisions was       associated with a significant increase in Latino voter       registration and a significant increase in Asian American       turnout. Earlier studies reached the same conclusion:       ``Section 203 language access resulted in higher voting rates       for Latinos, Asian Americans and other immigrant       communities.'' Surveying several of these studies, Ms. Minnis       of AAJC explained that ``[i]f the access to multilingual       support helps to eradicate language barriers, the withdrawal       or denial of multilingual support exacerbates language       barriers, interferes with free and fair access to the ballot       through the voting process, and leads to less voters       participating in American democracy.''        Empirical research also found evidence that coverage under       the VRA increases minority political participation. One study       found that coverage under the Voting Rights Act language       access provisions is associated with significantly higher       Latino representation on school boards relative to non-      covered jurisdictions. That empirical finding is consistent       with evidence presented to the Subcommittee. For example,       Orange County, California, and Harris County, Texas, saw the       election of Vietnamese American elected officials after they       began providing language assistance to Vietnamese American       voters.        Dr. Barreto testified that, ``similar to voter       identification laws, the research has demonstrated an       inconsistent application with many covered jurisdictions not       aware or not providing the proper non-English voting       materials. This has a tremendously negative impact on those       communities' ability to understand and participate in our       elections.''        Illustrative of the broad protections courts have read into       language protections such as Section 4(e), Kira Romero-Craft,       Southeast Region Director for LatinoJustice, testified that       courts have declined to read any numerical requirements into       Section 4(e)'s plain language and have ordered counties with       as few as two dozen Puerto Rican voters to offer some       bilingual assistance because, ``it is a `basic truth that       even one disenfranchised voter--let alone several thousand--      is too many.'''        Limits on language assistance also disproportionately       impacts minority voters. Ms. Senteno testified that, for       example, MALDEF is involved in a pending case in Arkansas       challenging a section of the state's election code that       limits the number of voters an individual may assist with       casting a ballot to six total, arguably restricting the       number of voters who may be able to receive language       assistance from the person of their choice.        The manner in which voting materials and ballots are       written can also negatively impact LEP voters. Ms. Minnis       testified that, even if an LEP voter is able to obtain a       ballot, it is often written in advanced English, which is not       accessible for LEP voters. In her testimony, Ms. Minnis notes       that an analysis of statewide ballot measures voters voted on       in 2018 found that the average grade level was between 19 and       20, meaning it would require a graduate-level degree to       understand them. The use of complex English on ballots and       other voter materials makes it difficult for LEP voters to       understand and  [[Page H4474]]       respond, which can also be compounded by higher levels of       illiteracy rates, whether in English or the voter's native       language.        Dr. Barreto testified that, where Section 203 and 208 have       been implemented fairly and fully,        ``[W]e have seen a higher voter participation rate, both       first-time voters as well as [] of returning voters, where       the most difficult things can be for a voter which has       language challenges to navigate the system, and if they don't       feel that they can do that, if they don't feel welcome, if       the language materials are not available [] they may just       leave and not come back. They may feel excluded from the       system. Where Section 203 is implemented, there have been       very robust increases in Spanish-speaking Latino voter       participation.''        Dr. Barreto noted that, where voters have a negative       experience at the polls and are challenged or are not able to       navigate the polling place, ``that leads to a rejection and       withdrawal.''        Several legal actions have successfully sought to compel       local election officials to provide language access       materials, often requiring years of litigation for plaintiffs       to obtain relief and involving troubling evidence of       discriminatory animus.        A district court found that Berks County, Pennsylvania, for       example, failed to adhere to language access provisions in       the VRA by failing to offer Spanish-language materials for       voters educated in Puerto Rico and failing to make available       bilingual poll workers. The court further found that local       election officials engaged in ``hostile and unequal       treatment'' of Hispanic and LEP voters, which ``intimidated''       such voters.        Additionally, Ms. Romero-Craft testified that the State of       Florida has been a covered jurisdiction for the Spanish       language under Section 203 since 2011 and that there are also       13 counties in the state which are subject to minority       language requirements for Spanish under the law. Yet, despite       the direct protections of the law:        ``Florida's language minority voters have continued to face       discrimination at the polls and frequently do not receive       adequate language assistance they critically need to be able       to cast a ballot for their preferred candidate of choice or       to make informed decisions when deciding how to cast their       votes on ballot initiatives.''        A district court recently entered an order barring dozens       of Florida counties from continuing to violate the VRA by       failing to provide bilingual voting assistance to voters of       Puerto Rican descent. The plaintiffs were repeatedly forced       to pursue further relief after a number of election officials       refused to comply with the order and make multi-lingual       assistance available, asserting, for example, that ``the       small number of voters requesting Spanish-language ballots       did not justify the cost.'' Florida was previously sued in       2000 by the Department of Justice for failure to provide       language materials and in 2009 by LatinoJustice for failure       to provide assistance to voters from Puerto Rico as required.       District Judge Mark Walker noted in his order that, ``[i]t is       remarkable that it takes a coalition of voting rights       organizations and individuals to sue in federal court to seek       minimal compliance with the plain language of a venerable 53-      year-old law.''        The Subcommittee also received widespread reports of non-      compliance with the VRA's language access requirements, in       numerous states and localities, and often involving troubling       evidence or inference of discriminatory intent. Ms. Romero-      Craft provided testimony of examples in Florida and Georgia,       such as Liberty County, Georgia's failure to provide Spanish-      language voting materials and services despite citizens of       Puerto Rican descent comprising nearly five percent of the       county's total population. In testimony provided in the       116th Congress, Sean Young of the ACLU of Georgia       testified that Hall County, Georgia was required to       provide Spanish language materials under Section 4(e), as       all counties are, but the board refused. One study found       that only 68.5 percent of jurisdictions fully complied       with the Voting Rights Act's language access requirements       with respect to the provision of Spanish language       materials.        Jerry Vattamala of AALDEF testified to several examples of       jurisdictions' failure to provide language access materials       to Asian American voters. For example, AALDEF filed a federal       complaint on June 3, 2021, against the City of Hamtramck,       Michigan, for its failure to comply with the requirements as       a covered jurisdiction under Section 203 for Hamtramck to       provide translations of all voting information and materials,       including election websites, and oral language assistance for       Bangladeshi voters in Bengali.        In another example, Mr. Vattamala highlighted       jurisdictions' failure to ensure equal access to interpreters       or through hostile treatment or discrimination by poll       workers such as AALDEF discovered when monitoring the primary       election in Malden, Massachusetts, in March 2020, a       jurisdiction covered under Section 203 for Chinese language       assistance. Ms. Minnis testified that, during the 2012       election, voters reported to the Election Protection       Coalition that ``they had been unlawfully prevented from       obtaining language assistance at polling places from Suffolk       County, New York, to New Orleans, Louisiana, and including an       incident ``in Kansas City, Missouri, where a poll worker       asked a voter's interpreter to leave the polling place and       threatened her with arrest.'' Marcia Johnson-Blanco of the       Lawyers' Committee testified that, in the 2020 election,       voters reported lack of or insufficient language assistance       in Berks and York counties in Pennsylvania. Ms. Johnson-      Blanco testified that:        ``The most egregious instance occurred in York County,       where election officials rather than provide needed language       assistance (1) spoke slowly and used hand gestures and       mimicry as a prerequisite to allowing voters to utilize an       interpreter, (2) impeded interpreters' conversations with       voters by hovering over conversations and interrupting       interactions telling voters that they could not use the       interpreter and (3) prevented voters from using their       assistance of choice with casting their ballot.''        Repeated failure to provide bilingual voting materials is       also, troublingly, particularly common in Native American       communities, and has led to litigation. Section 203 covers       357,409 American Indians and Alaska Natives who reside in a       jurisdiction where assistance must be provided in a covered       Native language. However, as Matthew Campbell of NARF       testified, jurisdictions have often failed to provide the       required translations or have failed to provide any language       assistance at all, forcing costly lawsuits. Mr. Campbell       testified that this is exactly what happened in Alaska, which       led to Toyukak v. Treadwell, ``the first Section 203 case       fully tried through a decision in thirty-four years.''        Even after plaintiffs in Alaska obtained a consent       agreement requiring Alaskan officials to provide adequate       language assistance to Yu'pik-speaking voters, the attorneys       had to repeatedly return to court to provide fulsome relief.       Documents produced in litigation showed that Alaskan       officials made a ``policy decision'' not to comply with       Section 203 in several jurisdictions, consciously choosing       not to provide required language assistance. In 2013, a group       of tribal councils and Alaska Native voters charged Alaska       state officials with continuing violation of the VRA and the       Constitution for their refusal to provide information in       Yu'pik that was available in English--in its ruling for the       plaintiffs, the court confirmed that ``officials'' negligence       had produced egregious results--Yu'pik voters were deprived       of any and all critical pre-election information.''        In Toyukak, Alaska election officials denied Native voters       language assistance despite a previous court finding in Nick       v. Bethel that all voting information provided in English       must be provided orally even if written translations are not       required. The court held in Toyukak that Section 203 should       be interpreted as ``merely changing the means by which voting       information and materials is communicated to LEP American       Indians and Alaska Natives, and Section 203 does not permit       election officials to diminish the content and extent of       information that must be provided.'' Mr. Campbell testified       that the parties ``worked together to produce a joint       stipulation that aimed to remedy Alaska's Section 203       violations and included strong relief such as federal       observers to document compliance efforts.'' Mr. Campbell       testified further that:        ``Reports filed by federal observers in 2016 suggest that       Alaska's efforts fell short of fully remedying the Section       203 violations and complying with the Toyukak Order. . .       During the 2016 primary, federal observers documented there       were no voting materials available in the covered Alaska       Native language in six villages, and the ``I voted'' sticker       was the only material in a Native language in two other       villages. Alaska has made some improvements since Toyukak       such as having bilingual poll workers available, but almost       forty years of Section 203 violations cannot be remedied       overnight and continued investment in language assistance for       American Indian and Alaska Natives is crucial to ensuring       Native voters have equal access to the election process.''        Alaska is not the only jurisdiction to have failed to       comply with requirements to provide Native voters with       language access. As Mr. Campbell's testimony notes, San Juan       County, Utah, is a covered county for the Navajo language,       but the County has failed voters by refusing to comply with       Section 203. Additionally, in 2014 the County removed all       language assistance by switching to a vote-by-mail system and       providing no translated ballot information to LEP Navajo       voters, many of whom received an English ballot they could       not read and so they simply did not vote. A settlement       reached between the County and litigators restored the closed       polling places and mandates the County provide the required       language assistance. Failure to provide access to Native       language services has also impacted Native American voters in       Arizona. Professor Patty Ferguson-Bohnee, Director of the       Indian Legal Clinic at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of       Law, testified before the Subcommittee in 2019 that in       Arizona, in 2016, only one of nine jurisdictions covered       under Section 203 for Native languages provided translated       voter registration information in the covered language.                                  CONCLUSION         Congress has, at multiple junctures in history and in       legislating, moved to protect the right to vote through       increased access to language assistance. Congress recognized       that access to multi-lingual voting materials and assistance       is critical to ensuring fair and equal access to the ballot.       While the language access provisions of the Voting Rights Act       remain intact following the Court's decision in Shelby       County, the evidence before  [[Page H4475]]       the Subcommittee in both this Congress and the last is       clear--significant gaps remain in adherence to the law and       the provision of fair access to multi-lingual voting       materials and assistance.        The failure to provide the required assistance is pervasive       and creates significant barriers to accessing the ballot,       barriers that fall disproportionately on LEP voters, who are       more likely to be minority voters. Additionally, as Jerry       Vattamala of AALDEF testified, protecting access to language       materials and assistance on a case-by-case basis is       unsustainable and insufficient:        ``Individual affirmative cases require a large amount of       human and financial resources which limit the reach and scope       of work that organizations like AALDEF can do. For example,       in the OCA v. Texas case that AALDEF brought against the       state of Texas for violating Section 208 of the Voting Rights       Act, it took more than three years to litigate from client       intake to final decision, and required hundreds of hours of       attorney time.''        The evidence presented before the Subcommittee demonstrates       that ensuring access to multi- lingual materials and       assistance warrants increased protections.   Chapter Six--Polling Place Closures, Consolidations, Relocations, and                        Long Wait Times at the Polls                                  BACKGROUND         Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County,       states and localities in covered jurisdictions were required       to notify voters well in advance of polling location       closures, to prove those changes would not have a disparate       impact on minority voters, and to provide data to the DOJ       about the impact on voters. In the years since Shelby County       was decided, states that were previously covered by the VRA       have closed hundreds of polling locations.        Issues related to polling place locations, quality,       accessibility, and ensuing long wait times to vote are,       unfortunately, well-documented and pervasive. For example, at       the Subcommittee's 2019 listening session in Brownsville,       Texas, Mimi Marziani, President of the Texas Civil Rights       Project (``TCRP'') testified that, ``long lines and late       openings are, unfortunately, such a common feature of Texas       elections that they are deemed `typical' by election       officials.''        Marcia Johnson-Blanco of the Lawyers' Committee reported in       testimony before the Subcommittee that, in Pennsylvania, two       of the top three issues reported to Election Protection on       Election Day 2020 were long lines, particularly in       communities of color, and late polling place openings. Ms.       Johnson-Blanco also noted issues of long lines being reported       in Georgia, Texas, California, and Wisconsin throughout the       2020 primaries and general election.        Polling location closures and movements can and do       disproportionately burden minority voters, whether by intent       or effect. Poor polling place locations, lack of       availability, and a lack of resources leads to minority       voters facing longer lines than White voters at the polls.       Polling place closures are harmful to voter turnout,       especially the turnout of minority voters--waiting in a long       line to vote can make a voter less likely to turn out in       future elections. Disparities in Election Day experiences       between minority voters and White voters are a persistent       problem. Kevin Morris of the Brennan Center noted in       testimony before the Subcommittee that ``[o]ver the past       decade, scholars have consistently noted that racial       minorities wait longer to cast their ballots on election day       than White voters.''        The disparity in polling place accessibility and wait times       is then compounded by the disparate impact of other practices       discussed in this report such as voter ID accessibility,       proper access to multi-lingual materials and assistance,       voter purges, and restrictions on alternative opportunities       to vote. As Ms. Marziani testified before the Subcommittee       this Congress, ``fewer polling places is one driver of long       lines, a symptom of polling place inefficiencies that is       compounded by other devices that make voting more onerous and       time-consuming, such as Texas' strict photo identification       law (the same one originally struck down under Section 5).''        While there may be legitimate reasons for closing,       consolidating, or moving polling locations, without the       disparate impact data, community consultation, and evaluation       to support these changes, there is no preemptive way to       ensure these closures do not discriminate against minority       voters. Polling place closures, consolidations, relocations,       and under-resourcing can and do lead to longer or extreme       wait times or can require voters to drive for miles to reach       a polling place.        In Georgia, for example, Gilda Daniels of the Advancement       Project testified at the 2019 field hearing that at the       Pittman Park voting sites in 2018 they received calls that       lines were ``reportedly 300 people deep with a wait time of       3.5 hours.'' The 2020 primary election in Georgia saw       extremely long wait times yet again--voters waited in hours-      long lines, some late into the night and the early hours of       the next day. Counties are regularly sued to extend the hours       of polling locations to ensure all voters can cast a ballot.       Voters in Georgia waited in lines so long they brought chairs       to wait for the opportunity to cast their ballot. Volunteers       provided food and water to people who had to wait in line for       hours.        Polling place locations that necessitate traveling long       distances are particularly burdensome, and unfortunately an       all-too-common occurrence, for Native American voters.       Movement toward mail-in voting, closure of polling locations,       lack of polling places located on tribal lands, and moves       toward consolidated vote centers can disproportionately       impact and possibly disenfranchise Native voters who face       barriers such as lack of access to transportation, lack of       traditional residential mailing addresses, lack of access to       reliable mail service and distance. When fighting to ensure       their communities have equal opportunities to vote, many       tribal communities are at the mercy or discretion of county       officials who choose where to place the polling locations and       the level of ballot access.        Evidence presented before the Subcommittee at hearings       spanning this Congress and the last, and discussed below,       shows that pervasive polling place location issues, long wait       times, and under-resourcing have a disproportionate,       discriminatory, and suppressive effect on the ability of       minority voters to freely and fairly exercise their right to       vote.    THE DISPROPORTIONATE AND DISCRIMINATORY BURDEN AND IMPACT OF POLLING   PLACE CLOSURES, CONSOLIDATIONS, AND RELOCATIONS, WAIT TIMES, AND LACK                      OF RESOURCES ON MINORITY VOTERS       Polling Place Availability and Accessibility        No matter the reason, polling place closures,       consolidations, or relocations, or a lack of adequate       resourcing can lead to long lines and extreme wait times or       can require voters to drive for miles to reach a polling       place. This burden often falls disproportionately on minority       voters. Without the disparate impact data and analysis       previously required under the Voting Rights Act preclearance       process, community consultation, and evaluation to support       these changes, there is no longer a preemptive mechanism to       ensure these closures do not discriminate against minority       voters.        As Jesselyn McCurdy, Managing Director of Government       Affairs for the Leadership Conference testified, ``[v]oting       discrimination and disenfranchisement takes many forms, but       one tangible way to quash Americans' voices is to physically       remove the very locations where ballots are cast and counted.       While they do not garner the attention that voter purges and       ID laws do, polling place closures can be just as       disenfranchising.''        One of the starkest examples of this occurred recently       during the 2020 primary election, when voters in Milwaukee,       Wisconsin, were forced to stand in line for hours at one of       only five polling places open across the city to cast their       ballot on Election Day, after failing to receive absentee       ballots in the mail and just weeks after officials shut down       175 sites. The make-up of Milwaukee is disproportionately       Black--Madison, a much less populous town with a whiter       population, boasted 66 polling sites to Milwaukee's 5.        According to an analysis by Demos and All Voting is Local,       Milwaukee is home to 60.32 percent of Wisconsin's Black       voters and 29.69 percent of the state's Hispanic voters.       These polling place closures had a measurable       disenfranchising effect. A peer-reviewed, journal article by       the Brennan Center's Kevin Morris and Peter Miller found that       the closures in Milwaukee depressed turnout by more than 8       percentage points overall--and by about 10 percentage points       among Black voters.        The disenfranchising effects of polling place closures or       movements have been documented by studies as well. Studies       have shown that the closure or relocation of a polling       location reduces turnout by one to two percentage points,       meaning that the closure of relocation of polling locations       that disproportionately serve minority voters also serves to       disproportionately reduce turnout of minority voters.        These burdens are attributable to the fact that the       closures or relocations force voters to travel farther to       vote, which can be particularly burdensome on Latino, Native       American, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black voters who       disproportionately lack access to a private vehicle.       Distances to polling locations can be particularly burdensome       for Native American voters living on rural, tribal lands,       with some voters being forced to travel tens of miles to       reach their polling location. Accessible polling locations       are also necessary for LEP voters to access the franchise, as       some voters who need language access materials or assistance       may need a physical polling place to best exercise their       right to vote.        The closures of polling locations ticked up dramatically in       states previously covered by the VRA following the Supreme       Court's decision in Shelby County. Ms. McCurdy testified       that, without a fully functioning VRA and consistent       oversight by the DOJ in reviewing proposed changes, election       officials ``have unfettered discretion to shut them down       without providing any valid reason.'' A September 2019 report       prepared by The Leadership Conference Education Fund found       that states and localities that were previously covered by       Section 5 of the VRA closed 1,688 polling places between 2012       and 2018, almost double the rate identified in 2016. The       Leadership Conference found that, in 2018 alone, there       were 1,173 fewer polling places than there were in the       previous 2014 midterm election. Another study found that       by 2020 approximately 21,000 polling places that served       voters on Election Day have been eliminated nationwide.        Through public records requests and data provided by the       Center for Public Integrity,  [[Page H4476]]       the Campaign Legal Center (``CLC'') has continued to document       polling place closures in Louisiana, Mississippi, and       Alabama. For example, Danielle Lang, Director of Voting       Rights at the Campaign Legal Center testified that:        ``Since Shelby County, Louisiana has seen a steady decline       in polling place access, especially for urban communities.       For example, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana's largest parish,       has seen an 8.7 percent increase in the number of Black       registered voters between 2012 and 2020 but a 15 percent       decrease in the number of polling places.''        CLC also found that counties in Mississippi and Alabama       displayed a similar pattern. For example:        ``Lauderdale County, Mississippi--which is 44 percent       Black--closed 20 percent of its polling places between 2012       and 2020, even though the county's citizen voting age       population increased by 3 percent. And Shelby County,       Alabama--namesake of the Supreme Court decision--closed       roughly 10 percent of its polling places between 2012 and       2020, despite an increase of almost 13 percent in the       county's citizen voting age population.''        Ms. McCurdy, of the Leadership Conference testified before       the Subcommittee that ``[p]olling place closures did not seem       to vary to meet the different demands of each type of       election; indeed, 69 percent of closures (1,173) occurred       after the 2014 midterm election in anticipation of the       presidential election, which would necessarily bring higher       turnout in communities of color.'' One would have reasonably       expected the number of available polling places to increase       to correspond to the anticipated higher turnout. Ms. McCurdy       further testified, however, that ``[t]his appears to be no       accident: as pollsters predicted greater turnout for the 2018       midterm, counties with a history of discrimination began       shutting down access to voting booths at an alarming rate.''        As noted previously, under Section 5, covered jurisdictions       were previously required to demonstrate that closures would       not have a discriminatory impact on voters, and to notify       voters of the closures when they were permitted to occur.       Now, post-Shelby, jurisdictions no longer need to notify       voters of the change, nor is the DOJ required to analyze the       impact of the proposed changes on minority voters. Ms.       McCurdy testified that:        ``All told, Shelby County paved the way for several       previously covered states to each shut down hundreds of       polling places: Texas shut down 750; Arizona shut down 320;       and Georgia shut down 214. Quieter efforts to reduce the       number of polling places without clear notice or       justification spread throughout Louisiana (126), Mississippi       (96), Alabama (72), North Carolina (29), and Alaska (6).''        Over both the 116th and 117th Congresses, the Subcommittee       heard testimony about how polling place closures can directly       target locations predominantly used by minority voters.        For example, in Irwin County, Georgia, the Board of       Elections attempted to close the only polling place in the       county's sole Black neighborhood, contrary to non-partisan       recommendations, while keeping open a polling place in a 99       percent white neighborhood. In 2019, the City Council of       Jonesboro, Georgia, voted to move the city's only polling       location to its police department without providing the       public notice required and without taking into consideration       the possible deterrent effect on minority voters. Ms. Romero-      Craft of Latino Justice testified that Hall County,       Georgia's, decision to only reopen half of its early voting       sites for the 2020 run-off election caused ``substantial       reductions and disproportionately burdened Latino voters.''        Mimi Marziani of the Texas Civil Rights Project testified       that, the best available evidence strongly suggests that many       of the polling place closures that have taken place across       Texas since Shelby County have disparately and negatively       impacted communities of color. Ms. Marziani testified that,       ``[i]n short, history and current data confirm that voters of       Texas are not evenly affected by the State's detrimental       changes to polling place locations, operations and hours.       Instead, Black and Latinx Texans will suffer a heavier       burden, as they have time and again.'' Texas, a state with a       population that is 39 percent Latino, 12 percent African       American, and 1.4 percent Asian American, has closed 750       polling places since Shelby.        The Texas example is particularly egregious. Ms. Marziani       provided data that hundreds of polling places were closed       before the 2016 presidential election, ``significantly more       in both raw number and percentage than any other state.'' In       Galveston, Texas, 16 percent of its polling locations were       closed in 2016, according to a plan that had initially been       rejected by the DOJ because it discriminated against Black       and Latino voters. Three Texas counties closed between 75 and       80 percent of their total polling sites, ranking among the 10       counties with the highest percentage of poll closures in the       country.        Texas is not the only example. Ms. McCurdy testified that       Arizona, a state where 30 percent of the population is       Latino, 4 percent is Native American, and 4 percent is       African American, has the most widespread reduction (-320) in       polling places--``almost every county (13 of 15 counties)       closed polling places after Shelby County--some on a       staggering scale.'' Ms. McCurdy's testimony noted that these       closures occurred despite national news coverage of ``the       adverse impact of polling place reductions in Maricopa County       in the 2016 presidential preference election, which forced       voters to stand in line for five hours to cast a ballot.''        Georgia--a state that is 31 percent African American, 9       percent Latino, and 4 percent Asian American--had 214 fewer       polling places for the 2018 election than it did before       Shelby. Ms. McCurdy stated that Georgia counties have closed       higher percentages of voting locations than any other state       the Leadership Conference reviewed for their Democracy       Diverted report.        Gilda Daniels, the Director of Litigation at the       Advancement Project, testified that her organization had       collected data that, since 2012, Ohio had closed more than       300 polling locations across the state, a disproportionate       number in urban areas. Furthermore, Ms. Daniels testimony       notes that, between 2016 and 2018, Cuyahoga County (Ohio's       second largest county) eliminated 41 polling locations and       nearly 16 percent of all precincts changed location, harming       a majority of Black communities.        While some states are closing polling locations in the       shift to the vote center model, the lack of preclearance       requirements means these shifts are happening without the       requisite analysis to ensure they do not discriminate against       minority voters. Additionally, the shift to a vote center       model does not necessarily explain all polling place       closures.        For example, in Texas, Somervell, Loving, Stonewall, and       Fisher counties all closed between 60 and 80 percent of their       polling places without converting to a vote center model.       According to Ms. Marziani's testimony, each of these counties       has a large Latinx population. Following the November 2018       General Election, TCRP conducted a comprehensive review of       county compliance with provisions of the state Election Code       and the Voting Rights Act--they found that many counties,       regardless of size or polling place model, were out of       compliance with elections laws. Texas was unlawfully short as       many as 270 polling places in a total of 33 counties that       contained four million registered voters collectively in       2018.        Additionally, Kevin Morris of the Brennan Center, testified       that although more than half of all states have statutes       detailing minimum standards for the number of polling places,       many states simply do not comply with their own laws. Mr.       Morris stated that, for example, his team uncovered evidence       that ``more than 40 percent of precincts in Illinois had more       registered voters assigned to than allowed under state law,       as did nearly a quarter of precincts in Michigan.''        Standards for polling place locations can also be crafted       in a way that is discriminatory toward minority voters. For       example, Ms. Marziani testified that an earlier version       Texas' State Bill (SB) 7, which moved through the State House       but has not been signed into law, included a provision that       would have created a formula to distribute polling places       that would pull polling places away from communities of       color. Ms. Marziani testified that the Texas Tribune       found that, of the 13 State House districts in Harris       County that would lose polling sites under this formula,       all but one has a majority non-white voting-age       population.        At the time of this report, the Texas state legislature has       returned for a special session, during which the Republican-      led legislature is attempting to once again take up       restrictive voting legislation. The bills moving through the       State House and Senate contain numerous provisions that       restrict access to the ballot and voting opportunities,       including, for example, putting limitations on polling places       so as to ban drive-thru voting options. Texas Democrats have       departed the state to deny a quorum at the legislature in       order to block the voting restrictions bill.        For Native American voters, the location of polling places,       consolidations, and the distance to polling locations is a       significant issue. In their 2020 Report, NARF wrote that       ``Native voters generally must travel greater distances to       get to their polling places than non-Native voters living in       the same counties.'' NARF goes on to report that often,       polling places are located in non-Native county seats or non-      Native communities, and in many cases the more populous       Native communities are denied in-person voting on tribal       lands, requiring them to travel off the reservation to vote.        According to testimony from Professor Ferguson-Bohnee,       Director of the Indian Legal Clinic at the Sandra Day       O'Connor College of Law, in a 2018 survey conducted by the       Native American Voting Rights Coalition found 10 percent of       respondents in New Mexico, 15 percent in Arizona, 27 percent       in Nevada, and 29 percent in South Dakota identified distance       from polling locations as one of the many problems associated       with in-person voting. When polling locations or voting       opportunities are located hours away it effectively amounts       to no access for Native American voters. Professor Ferguson-      Bohnee notes that the federal district court in Nevada       acknowledged this reality when it found that a polling       location 16 miles away from the Pyramid Lake Paiute       Reservation constituted an undue burden on voters.        Nevada is not the only state where Native American voters       face a disproportionate burden when it comes to polling place       access--in 2016, Native American voters in Nevada and Utah       had to travel over 100 miles to their nearest polling       locations. In Mohave County, Arizona, most residents in the       County lived near one of the 3 locations established for in-      person early voting, however, for the Kaibab-Paiute Tribe the       closest of the three locations was 285 miles away and       required on-reservation voters to travel for over 5 hours if       they wanted to vote early in person.  [[Page H4477]]         In October 2020, NARF and the ACLU of Montana filed suit       against Pondera County election officials on behalf of       Blackfeet Nation for failing to provide a satellite voting       location on the reservation, depriving Tribal members of the       same access to voting as White voters. According to the ACLU       of Montana, the County offered in person voting between 60 to       80 miles away for Blackfeet Nation residents in the county       seat--the suit resulted in a settlement agreement three days       after filing in which Pondera County agreed to establish a       satellite election office in Heart Butte.        At the Subcommittee's 2019 hearing in the Dakotas, Roger       White Owl, Chief Executive Officer of the Mandan Hidatsa and       Arikara Nation, testified that MHA Nation does not have       enough polling places, ``[w]ith only a couple of polling       places, many Tribal members had to drive 80 to 100 miles       round trip to cast their vote. This is unacceptable.''      Long Wait Times and Inadequate Resourcing at the Polls        When minority voters do cast their ballot at a polling       place, they are also more likely to face longer lines and       wait times to do so. Dr. Stephen Pettigrew of the University       of Pennsylvania testified before the Subcommittee that:        ``The most basic impact of waiting in a line is the time       burden placed upon the voter--what has been referred to as a       `time tax.' Compared to those who live in areas with       consistently short lines, voters who live in areas with       chronically long lines must sacrifice more of their time to       exercise their right to vote. This can be a particular burden       for people who have less flexibility in their schedule,       whether because they have constraints in their work schedule       or because they have childcare or eldercare       responsibilities.''        Furthermore, Kevin Morris of the Brennan Center testified       that, ``[o]ver the past decade, scholars have consistently       noted that racial minorities wait longer to cast their       ballots on election day than White voters.''        Not only do minority voters face, on average, longer wait       times, they also are more likely to experience wait times       exceeding 60 minutes, a wait widely recognized as       unacceptable, with one analysis finding that a voter living       in a non-white neighborhood is more than 6 times more likely       to wait 60 minutes or more to vote than a voter living in a       predominantly White neighborhood.        In testimony before the Subcommittee, Dr. Pettigrew stated       that, ``[a] voter's race is one of the strongest predictors       of how long they wait in line to vote: non-white voters are       three times more likely than White voters to wait longer than       30 minutes and six times as likely to wait more than 60       minutes.'' Dr. Pettigrew's testimony and research also find       that line length is a persistent and systemic problem--the       same places with long lines in one election are more likely       to have long lines in subsequent elections.        Furthermore, Dr. Pettigrew's research finds that the wait       times gap between White and non- White voters bridges the       simple explanation of a rural-urban divide, though that       divide also exists. Dr. Pettigrew testified that, even within       a given urban, suburban, or rural county, lines tend to be       longer in neighborhoods and precincts with higher       concentrations of non-White voters.        A report by the Brennan Center shows similar outcomes. Mr.       Morris testified that the gaps cannot be explained solely by       differences in income, age, or education, and that the gaps       are large, stating, ``our report showed that in 2018, Black       and Latino voters were more than one- and-a-half times as       likely to wait 30 or more minutes as White voters.''       According to the Brennan Center, in the 2018 election, for       example, 6.6 percent of Latino voters and 7 percent of Black       voters reported waiting 30 or more minutes or longer to vote       on Election Day, whereas only 4.1 percent of White voters       reported waiting 30 minutes or more.        Additionally, in a recent report on equity in our       democracy, the Brennan Center further reported:        ``A 2020 analysis by the Brennan Center reported that       Latino and Black voters were more likely to find themselves       in the longest lines on Election Day than their White       counterparts: ``Latino voters waited on average 46 percent       longer than White voters, and Black voters waited on average       45 percent longer than White voters.'' Stanford University       political science professor Jonathan Rodden analyzed data       collected by Georgia Public Broadcasting/ProPublica and found       that the average wait time after 7:00 p.m. across Georgia was       51 minutes in polling places that were 90 percent or more       nonwhite, but only six minutes in polling places that were 90       percent White.''        Ms. Marziani further highlighted this in her testimony,       stating that, in Texas for example:        ``Press reports indicated wait times as high as seven       hours, `particularly in communities of color and on college       campuses.' . . . Nationally, communities of color regularly       wait nearly twice as long to vote as White voters, and in       Texas, too, long lines disparately impact Black and Latinx       Texans.''        Additionally, Keith Chen of the University of California,       Los Angeles, found voters in Black neighborhoods waited       longer to cast a ballot than voters in White neighborhoods,       and were approximately 74 percent more likely to wait longer       than half an hour. Using data from the 2008 and 2012       elections, multi-state internet surveys of tens of thousands       of voters revealed that both African American and Hispanic       voters faced substantially longer wait times at the polls       than White voters. Other state-specific studies have shown       that minority voters face disproportionately long lines       relative to White voters.        According to a report in the New York Times, this disparity       continued in the 2020 election-- ``casting a vote typically       took longer in poorer, less white neighborhoods than it did       in whiter and more affluent ones.''        Ms. McCurdy of the Leadership Conference also testified to       this point. Ms. McCurdy stated that:        ``In previously covered jurisdictions, moreover, mass       closures similarly resulted in long lines: In 2020, voters       stood in line for hours in Phoenix, Arizona, and Atlanta,       Georgia; Texas' shuttering of 334 polling places--more than       any other state--in majority- Latino neighborhoods forced       voters to drive farther than White people from other areas.       Indeed, across the country Black and Latino voters       consistently reported longer wait-times than White voters.''        Scholars and stakeholders have demonstrated that the       disproportionately long wait times faced by minority voters       are often attributable to the differentially lower quality of       the polling locations that serve a disproportionately large       number of minority voters. For example, Dr. Pettigrew's       testimony states that ``one of the reasons why non-White       voters wait longer to vote is that fewer resources, such as       poll workers and voting machines, are allocated to precincts       with more non-white registrants.'' Studies have shown that       election officials provide more poll workers and voting       machines to disproportionately White precincts, relative       to precincts that serve minority voters. A study by the       Brennan Center showed that counties that saw a declining       population of White voters also saw declines in polling       location resources, with counties where the population       became whiter having 63 voters per poll worker, whereas       counties that were becoming less White had 80 voters per       poll worker.        Equal distribution of resources alone, however, is not       enough to address the disparate experience of minority       voters. Mr. Morris testified that        ``Equalizing the distribution of polling place resources,       in other words, is insufficient to equalize voters'       experience on Election Day. To ensure equitable Election Day       experiences and end the excessive lines and wait times faced       by minority voters, administrators need to distribute       relatively more and higher-quality resources to neighborhoods       of color.''        Mr. Morris further stated that, ``although voters of color       already face the longest lines, on average, they make up a       growing share of the jurisdictions with the fewest electoral       resources'' and that ``resource allocation patterns are on       track to exacerbate, not mitigate, the racial wait gap in       coming years.        Additionally, as noted elsewhere in this report, long wait       times can be compounded by the disparate impact of the other       practices discussed in this report. Mr. Morris testified for       example, that the dynamic of inadequate resources ``plays out       especially clearly when it comes to language access.'' Mr.       Morris testified that research at the Brennan Center       ``indicates that counties that have significant and growing       populations of voters whose first language is not English,       but have not met the threshold to provide language assistance       under Section 203 of the VRA, usually provide little-to-no       language assistance, leaving some communities under-       resourced.'' Voter purges that remove eligible voters from       the rolls may cause delays at the polling place as poll       workers take time trying to locate the voter's record, and       purged voters are often required to cast provisional       ballots--Mr. Morris testified that voters who cast a       provisional ballot can take twice as long to cast their       ballot as a traditional ballot.        In addition to imposing direct burdens on minority voters,       longer wait times also impact the likelihood that a voter       will vote in later elections, thereby disproportionately       impacting and suppressing participation among minority       voters. Voters who face long lines in one election are       disproportionately likely not to vote in a subsequent       election because of their adverse experience with the voting       process. This means that when minority voters face       disproportionately long wait times in one election, then       these same voters are disproportionately likely not to       turnout in subsequent elections.        Dr. Pettigrew testified that, ``[b]ecause voters'       experiences at the polling place have downstream consequences       on their future turnout behavior and their confidence in the       electoral system, policies that widen the wait time gap       between White and non-white voters have the potential to put       a thumb on the electoral scale by reshaping the electorate.''        For example, one study estimated that whereas African       American voters comprise 9.7 percent of the electorate, they       accounted for 22 percent of the voters who voted in 2012 but       did not turnout in the 2014 election because of their adverse       experience with long wait times.        Dr. Pettigrew testified that, ``[v]oters who waited between       30 and 45 minutes to vote were 1 percentage point less likely       to turn out to vote in the next election, compared to voters       who waited less than 15 minutes. When considering voters who       waited more  [[Page H4478]]       than 60 minutes, this impact increases to about 1.6       percentage points.'' Dr. Pettigrew notes that, ``[w]hile       these percentages may seem small, it is important to remember       that in many elections million or tens-of-millions of voters       experience long lines, meaning that future decreases in       turnout can be in the hundreds-of-thousands.''                                  CONCLUSION         The evidence before the Subcommittee clearly illustrates       the disproportionate, discriminatory effect polling place       closures, consolidations, and relocations and under       resourcing has on access to the ballot for minority voters.       The 2013 bipartisan Presidential Commission on Election       Administration set out a key recommendation that ``as a       general rule, no voter should have to wait more than half an       hour in order to have an opportunity to vote''--the evidence       presented to the Subcommittee clearly shows that states and       localities are falling far short of this, with minority       voters disproportionately bearing the burden.        As Danielle Lang, Director of Voting Rights at the Campaign       Legal Center stated, ``[t]he quality of polling places--their       number, location, accessibility, and resources--affects voter       participation and confidence, thereby affecting the health       and representative nature of American democracy.'' The       Supreme Court recognized as much, as Ms. Lang testified,       confirming that ``the location and accessibility of polling       places can have a direct impact on a voter's ability to       exercise their fundamental right to vote. Litigation is       simply an inadequate remedy to combat the scale of polling       place closures and to combat the significant harm borne       disproportionately by minority voters. The data shows these       issues are pervasive and have a significant suppressive       effect on voters, demanding heightened scrutiny and       protections to ensure every voter has access to the       franchise.              Chapter Seven--Restricting Opportunities to Vote                                  BACKGROUND         The 2020 general election was yet another proof point in       what we knew to be true about administering elections in       America--when voters are given a variety of options for when       and how to cast their ballot outside of traditional in-person       Election Day voting, they take advantage of those options.       These options include casting a ballot by utilizing early in-      person voting, curbside or drive-thru voting options, mail-in       voting, or placing a completed ballot in a drop box.       Undeniably, voting in-person on one Tuesday in November is       impractical or impossible for millions of Americans.        Each of these alternative options are also secure. Election       administrators across the country proved during the 2020 and       prior elections that they can be administered in ways that       reinforces the integrity of our elections even when utilized       at record levels. Cybersecurity and election security       officials, in fact, stated that the 2020 election was ``the       most secure in American history.''        Early voting, and especially weekend early voting, is a       critical tool to ensuring access to the ballot and reducing       wait times at the polls. Absentee or no-excuse/mail-in voting       is also crucial to providing voters with options for casting       a ballot. In testimony submitted before the Subcommittee,       Gilda Daniels of the Advancement Project stated, ``[i]t has       been proved that expanding early voting, vote by mail       ballots, and drop box return options decrease the cost of       voting'' and making these options widely available can assist       with turnout and smooth election administration.        Studies have shown that restrictions on a variety of       alternatives to voting in-person on Election Day have the       potential to disproportionately burden minority voters.       Moreover, restricting alternative opportunities to vote       burdens Latino and Black voters, who disproportionately lack       the ability to shift their working hours, and therefore are       less able to vote on Election Day. Restricting voting options       can also burden Native American voters, who have non-      traditional mailing addresses, long distances to travel to       polling locations, often lack transportation, and can have       inconsistent access to mail services. Failure to provide       adequate language assistance also impedes the ability of LEP       voters to fully understand and take advantage of voting       options such as absentee voting or assessing what early       voting options are available.        While a variety of options for casting a ballot outside of       the traditional Election Day are being utilized with       increasing frequency by all voters, including minority       voters, that increased use has also made these opportunities       to vote the subject of targeted, suppressive voting laws in       the post-Shelby era.        Michael Waldman of the Brennan Center testified that       multiple states have reduced early voting days or sites used       disproportionately by minority voters, such as in Ohio and       Florida, where legislatures eliminated early voting on the       Sundays leading up to Election Day after Black and Latino       voters conducted successful ``Souls to the Polls'' turnout       drives on those days. Federal courts struck down early voting       cutbacks in North Carolina, Florida, and Wisconsin because       they were intentionally discriminatory. Similar efforts are       underway today, cutting or restricting early voting, mail-in       voting, and ballot return methods, which will       disproportionately impact and burden minority voters.        Under the false flag of ``election integrity'' and       combating fraud, as of July 14, 2021, more than 400 bills       have been introduced by lawmakers in 49 states to curb access       to the vote. As of the writing of this report, at least 18       states have enacted new laws containing provisions that will       restrict access to voting and opportunities to vote.        The Brennan Center reports that at least 16 mail-in voting       restrictions in 12 states will make it more difficult for       voters to cast mail ballots that count and at least eight       states have enacted 11 laws that make in-person voting more       difficult. These laws come on the heels of an election in       which reports show that the share of voters casting mail-in       ballots far exceeded any other recent national elections, and       the share of voters who reported going to a polling place on       Election Day dropped to its lowest point in at least 30       years. According to a report by the Brennan Center:        ``Compared to 2016, Latino voters in 2020 quadrupled their       participation in early and absentee balloting--a 224 percent       increase, compared to a 165 percent increase for early and       absentee ballots cast by voters overall. In the 13 most       contested battleground states in the 2020 election, Asian       American and Pacific Islander voters saw their early and       absentee voting rise nearly 300 percent from 2016 levels.''        Laws enacted in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, and       Montana restricting access to the ballot are already being       challenged in court.        Evidence presented before the Subcommittee across numerous       hearings clearly illustrates that the cuts made to       opportunities to vote have a disproportionate and       discriminatory impact on minority voters and, in some cases,       are pursued with a provable discriminatory intent.         CUTBACKS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE AND THE     DISCRIMINATORY AND DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN AND IMPACT ON MINORITY                                   VOTERS         More than three-quarters of states offer some in-person       early voting, but the number of days of availability varies       across the nation. Despite the widespread, successful, secure       use of early in-person voting in states across the country,       early voting options have become the target of suppressive       restrictions in the post-Shelby era.        Cutbacks and restrictions on opportunities to vote outside       of what is considered traditional Election Day voting places       a disproportionate burden on minority voters. Options such as       early voting, mail-in voting, curbside voting, and drop boxes       for ballot return all increase voter participation and were       used at increasing rates by minority voters during the 2020       primary and general election.        Danielle Lang, Director of the Voting Rights Program at the       Campaign Legal Center testified that, in 2020, polls showed       that Black voters were the most likely to cast an early       ballot and in 2016, Latino voters were the most likely to       cast an early ballot. Yet, without the requirement of       preclearance to study and analyze changes in opportunities to       vote for disparate impact, each of these voting options have       become the target of suppressive and discriminatory cutbacks       by state legislatures across the country.        Dr. Pettigrew testified before the Subcommittee that the       number of options and opportunities voters have to cast their       ballots is also a major contributor to the length of lines at       the polls, a burden that the previous section of this report       clearly demonstrated falls disproportionately upon minority       voters. Increasing hours of operation at polling places,       increasing the number of days of early voting, and providing       broader access to mail-in voting all decrease line length and       provide voters with opportunities to participate in democracy       that meet them where they are in their daily lives.      Early In-Person Voting        Dr. Michael Herron of Dartmouth College testified before       the Subcommittee that options such as early in-person voting       are a form of ``convenience voting,'' the implementation of       which decreases the cost of voting for the voter. Dr. Herron       explains that ``cost'' in this sense ``refers not necessarily       to a monetary cost of participating in an election that would       be borne by an individual but rather to the time, effort, and       tasks that a voter must perform in order to vote.'' As he       explained further, ``[t]he higher the cost of voting in a       state, the lower the turnout tends to be, all things equal.''        Dr. Herron testified that early voting has expanded across       the United States over the past several decades and, in this       same time period, has been heavily used by minority voters.       Dr. Herron testified that, ``[c]ertain types of voters tend       to use different days of early voting,'' and for this reason,       ``changes to election administration procedures that affect       precisely when early voting is offered--i.e., on weekdays       only as opposed to on both weekdays and weekends--will affect       different racial groups differently.'' He testified further       that, ``changes to early voting hours that reduce pre-      Election Day, Sunday voting opportunities should be expected       to disproportionately affect Black voters'' and that, if a       state were to eliminate Sunday early voting, ``the cost of       voting for Black voters would disproportionately increase       compared to White voters given the relatively heavy use of       Sunday early voting by Black voters.''        One of the most striking examples of how changes and       cutbacks to opportunities to  [[Page H4479]]       vote can be wielded to disenfranchise minority voters comes       again from North Carolina's 2013 omnibus voting bill, dubbed       the ``monster law.'' A study co-authored by Dr. Herron       examining the discriminatory impact of the state's 2013       voting law, which, among other restrictions, cut 10 days of       early voting, eliminated same-day voter registration, and       eliminated out-of-precinct voting and was enacted within days       of the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County, found that       in virtually every election between 2009 and 2012, Black       voters disproportionately relied on early voting relative to       White voters. Accordingly, the law's restrictions on early       voting disproportionately burdened Black voters.        The North Carolina law specifically targeted one of two       ``Souls to the Polls'' Sundays, early voting events       traditionally held the Sunday before Election Day and heavily       utilized by Black faith communities to get voters to the       polls. The omnibus law was found by the courts to have       targeted African American voters with ``almost surgical       precision.'' As Ms. Lang noted in her testimony, the Fourth       Circuit Court of Appeals labeled the restriction on Sunday       voting ``as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in       modern times.''        Allison Riggs of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice       testified that North Carolina's attacks on early voting       access did not end with the 2013 law. In 2018, North       Carolina's legislature enacted a separate law requiring all       100 counties within the state to offer uniform voting hours.       While sounding innocuous in theory, in practice it:        ``[H]ad a terrible effect on the ability of voters,       particularly those of color, to get to a polling place. After       the enactment of the ``uniform hours requirement,'' 43 of       North Carolina's 100 counties eliminated at least one early       voting site, almost half reduced the number of weekend days       when early voting was offered, and about two-thirds reduced       the number of weekend hours, compared to 2014.''        Tomas Lopez of Democracy North Carolina testified before       the Subcommittee in 2019 that, ``this has produced several       consequences in practice . . . [o]f the eight counties where       a majority of voters are Black, four reduced sites, seven       reduced weekend days, and all eight reduced the number of       weekend hours during early voting. None saw increases in       sites or weekend options.''        Like North Carolina, Florida has engaged in a lengthy       effort to restrict voting options predominately used by       minority voters. A study co-authored by Dr. Herron, analyzing       differential use of early voting in Florida, found that Black       voters disproportionately voted early relative to White       voters. Ms. Lang testified that, in 2011, Florida's       legislature passed a bill eliminating Sunday voting on the       Sunday immediately preceding Election Day--the bill coming       after data from the 2008 Presidential election showed that:        ``Across all early voting days, the two days that featured       the lowest white participation rates . . . both were Sundays,       but on the first Sunday of early voting, the racial and       ethnic group with the highest relative participation rate was       African-American voters. And on the last Sunday, the group       with the highest relative participation rate was Hispanic       voters, followed by African-American voters.''        Because of Black voters' disproportionate reliance on early       voting, scholars found that Florida's restriction on access       to early voting in 2012 meant that ``racial and ethnic       minorities . . . were far disproportionately less likely to       vote early in 2012 than in 2008.'' That was particularly true       because African American voters were disproportionately       likely to vote on the final Sunday before Election Day, which       was among the early voting days eliminated by the law, as       part of ``Souls to the Polls'' get-out-the-vote efforts.        Also in Florida, in July 2018, a federal court struck down       a state ban on early voting at public colleges. Hannah Fried,       National Campaign Director of All Voting is Local, testified       before the Subcommittee in October 2019 that a post-election       analysis published by the Andrew Goodman Foundation found       that ``nearly 60,000 voters cast early in-person ballots at       campus sites that advocates, including [All Voting is Local],       helped secure'' in the aftermath of the court's decision,       however, Florida's only public historically Black university       was the only major public campus without an early voting       site.        An examination of on-campus early voting in the 2018       election performed by Professor Daniel Smith of the       University of Florida found high rates of campus early voting       among Hispanic and Black voters. Moreover, Professor Smith       found high rates of campus early voting among historically       disenfranchised groups, including:        ``[A]lmost 30 percent of campus early vote ballots were       cast by Hispanic voters, compared to just under 13 percent of       early ballots cast at non-campus locations, and that more       than 22 percent of campus early vote ballots were cast by       Black voters, compared to 18 percent of early ballots cast at       non-campus locations.''        Ms. Lang testified that, in 2014, data from Georgia and       North Carolina similarly showed that 53 percent of 25,000       early votes cast on the second Sunday before Election Day       were from Black voters, compared with 27 percent of the votes       cast by all early voters in the 2014 midterm elections.        In Texas, just before the 2018 election, the NAACP Legal       Defense Fund filed a motion for a temporary restraining order       on behalf of Black students at the historically Black       university Prairie View A&M University (``PVAMU'') in Waller       County, Texas. In 2018, the students sought to stop cuts to       early voting hours, which would have left Prairie View       without any early voting opportunities on weekends, evenings,       or during the first week of early voting.        Janai Nelson, Associate Director-Counsel of LDF, testified       to the Subcommittee that county officials refused the student       requests to provide adequate early voting sites or hours and       that County officials have ``long discriminated against Black       voters at PVAMU and in the majority--Black City of Prairie       View, dating back to at least the early 1970s.'' In response       to LDF's ongoing case, however, county officials agreed in       2018 to add several hours of early voting in Prairie View.       LDF continues to litigate this case under its Section 2,       Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Twenty-sixth Amendment claims on       behalf of PVAMU students who were still denied equal and       adequate voting opportunities in the election under the       modified plan and parties are awaiting the trial court's       decision.        In yet another example, in Dodge City, Kansas, voting was       limited in 2018 to one polling location, which was outside of       town and inaccessible via public transportation--Dodge City's       population is ``60 percent Hispanic, and the voter turnout       among Latinx voters is lower than the national average.''       Alejandro Rangel-Lopez, a high school student from Dodge       City, testified before the Committee in 2019 that:        ``Dodge City only had one polling place for nearly 13,000       voters and while that's bad enough to make it one of the most       burdened polling places in our state, it was at the very       least, centrally located, which can't be said about the       location chosen for the 2018 midterm election. That new       location was south of town, outside the city limits. Worse,       the county clerk sent out the wrong location address to new       voters. [T]his new site wasn't accessible by public       transportation before we raised concerns. We believed these       factors would negatively impact minority and low- income       voters . . . We rely on our elected officials to make the       right choices and for a county clerk, that job was to make       voting as easy as possible in the county she represents.       Unfortunately, that's not what happened. The clerk spent       nearly $100,000 of taxpayer money for legal fees fighting our       efforts to make polling places more accessible.''        In Ohio, in addition to other cuts to voting opportunities,       the state allows each county only one early, in-person voting       site, regardless of population size--meaning Franklin and       Cuyahoga Counties, home to Columbus and Cleveland, with       populations of more than 1.2 million people each and       significant populations of Black voters, are allotted the       same, single early voting site as the smallest counties in       the state, some of which are home to less than 15,000 people.       Inajo Davis Chappell, a Member of the Cuyahoga County Board       of Elections, testified before the Subcommittee in 2019 that,       ``[b]ecause of the limit to this one location, voting lines       are long, especially during the presidential election cycle.       During periods of heavy voting, long lines can be seen       wrapped around the building and down the street for several       blocks.''        LDF's report, Democracy Diminished, notes an example of a       Georgia state legislator making the intent behind his       opposition to certain early voting in minority communities       clear--when an early voting site was opening near a popular       mall in Dekalb County in 2014, a state senator responded that       ``this location is dominated by African American shoppers and       it is near several large African American mega churches,''       and that he would ``prefer more educated voters than a       greater increase in the number of voters.''        Cuts to early voting locations and opportunities to vote       also negatively impact the ability of Native American voters       to access the ballot. In NARF's 2020 report on obstacles       faced by Native American voters, they state that early voting       can be a positive force for Native voters, if it accounts for       the barriers that they face in participating in non-tribal       elections--when officials coordinate with tribal governments       and schools to provide information about voting locations and       schedule, it can improve turnout.        Professor Ferguson-Bohnee testified that, while some       election administrations are willing to work with tribes to       increase access, others are not. The Pascua Yaqui Tribe in       Arizona, for example, filed a lawsuit to restore the in-      person early voting location on the reservation--and       ``[w]hile Pima County noted that the voting location would       have cost $5,000 to operate, and the Secretary of State was       willing to cover the cost, the County denied the Tribe an       early voting location.'' Professor Ferguson-Bohnee stated       that, without the early voting location, ``on-reservation       voters who lacked a vehicle were required to take a two-hour       roundtrip bus ride to cast an early ballot.''        In South Dakota, a federal district court found that Pine       Ridge Reservation residents ``must travel, on average, twice       as far as White residents to take advantage of the voter       registration and in-person absentee voting services.'' In       another example, NARF reported that, in Oklahoma, there is       often only one early voting location per county--in the       county seat--which is often not accessible for Native voters       living in outlying areas, and ``in the poorest areas of       Nevada, where several reservations are located, no  [[Page H4480]]       early voting or satellite voting locations were       established.''        Furthermore, in the 2016 general election in Arizona, there       were a total of 89 early voting locations, only 23 of which       were on reservations. While off-reservation locations were       open for multiple days, in contrast, early voting locations       on the White Mountain Apache and San Carlos Apache       reservations had only one day to vote early in-person, and       only four hours on that one day.        Professor Ferguson-Bohnee's testimony stated that, in       Mohave County, Arizona, the county established three in-      person early voting sites, and while most residents of the       County lived near one of the locations, for the Kaibab-Paiute       Tribe, the closet of the three locations was ``located 285       miles away and required on-reservation voters to travel for       over five hours if they wanted to vote early in-person.'' In       Navajo County, off-reservation voters had access to more than       100 hours of in-person early voting--while members of the       Hopi Tribe living on-reservation in the County had access to       only six hours of in-person early voting. That represents       only six percent of the amount of in-person voting       opportunities on-reservation voters could access compared       with off-reservation voters.        Increasing the options for how voters can vote early in-      person can also increase voter participation and       participation of minority voters. For example, Isabel       Longoria, Elections Administrator for Harris County, Texas--      home to Houston and the third largest county in the country--      testified that the historic turnout of 1.68 million voters       Harris County experienced in the November 2020 election was       driven by innovative voting opportunities such as drive-thru       voting (128,000 votes), 24-hour voting (16,000 votes), and a       robust mail ballot program (179,000 votes), and that these       methods of voting ``helped promote voting in minority       communities, which helped create a more accurate       representation of communities in the county.''        Ms. Longoria testified that during the July 2020 and       November 2020 elections, Harris County also kept its polls       open until 10:00 p.m. on two evenings and open the entire       night one evening. Ms. Longoria testified that, of the Harris       County voters who used expanded hours, 45 percent came from       State House districts that are majority or plurality Black,       Hispanic, or mixed-race districts.        Harris County also opened multiple drive-thru voting sites       that provided voting on the same machines and in the same       manner as voting at all other in-person locations. Of the       voters who used in-person drive-thru voting, 60 percent came       from the majority or plurality Black, Hispanic, or mixed-race       State House districts. Though only 38 percent of early voters       in the 2020 Presidential election were Black, Latino, or       Asian, 53 percent of those communities used drive-thru       voting. However, instead of promoting and celebrating these       opportunities to vote, state legislators in Texas are also       pursuing a suppressive voting bill that would undermine many       of these alternative methods of voting.        Gilda Daniels, Director of Litigation at the Advancement       Project, testified that voting statistics show that, in the       November 2020 general election, Black voters in Georgia also       used early voting on weekends at a higher rate than White       voters in 43 of 50 of the state's largest counties. That is       86 percent of the largest counties. The state also recently       passed a restrictive bill that, among numerous troubling       provisions, takes aim at access to early voting.      Mail-in Voting and Ballot Return        Whether cast via the mail, returned via a ballot drop box,       or returned at a polling place, mail-in voting is another       opportunity to vote that gives voters control over when and       how to cast their ballot that increases access to the       franchise. Equitable mail-in voting practices increase voter       participation; however, both restrictions on mail-in voting       and mail-in voting implementation can be executed in a manner       that is discriminatory toward minority voters or       disproportionately burdens minority voters. Ms. Lang       testified that ``[a]bsentee voting is one of the most       accessible, equitable, and secure methods of voting that       states can implement.'' However, access to mail-in voting       options is highly uneven--from 5 states that conduct vote-by-      mail elections, to many who offer no-excuse absentee voting,       to the 16 states that continue to limit access to mail-in       voting options, locking many voters out of this option.        Use of mail-in voting increased significantly during the       November 2020 election-- approximately 43 percent of voters       cast mail-in ballots, roughly twice the percentage of voters       who cast mail-in ballots in the 2016 general election.        Dr. Herron testified that this increase was not uniform       across racial groups. For example, Dr. Herron noted that the       shift in the mail-in voting rate in Florida for Black voters       increased from almost 21 percent to around 39 percent, an 89       percent increase, while the rate for White voters went from       31 percent to 44 percent, a 43 percent increase. Dr. Herron       testified that, while it remains to be seen whether mail-in       voting usage will return to pre-pandemic levels, ``[c]hanges       to [vote-by-mail] voting procedures should not [be] expected       to be racially neutral any more than changes to early voting       procedures.''        The inequitable access to mail-in voting options and       different eligibility rules were put in stark relief during       the 2020 election, a presidential primary and general       election conducted during a once-in-a-century pandemic. For       example, Ms. Lang testified that Texas's restrictions on       eligibility for requesting and casting an absentee ballot       ``den[ies] the majority of Texans the ability to vote by       mail--particularly Latino and younger voters.'' Ms. Lang       testified that ``Latino voters in Texas are significantly       younger than the average Texas voting population, which means       they are disproportionately unable to avail themselves of the       over-65 exception to the absentee eligibility criteria.'' In       May 2020, in Texas, CLC moved to intervene on behalf of the       League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) in a lawsuit       filed by the Texas Democratic Party challenging Texas's vote-      by-mail eligibility restrictions--the case remains pending in       federal court.        Some states have also erected unduly burdensome       requirements for casting absentee ballots that make the       option illusory for many voters. For example, Alabama       requires voters to send an application for an absentee ballot       for every election to a special absentee election manager for       the county, including a photocopy of their voter ID, and then       return the ballot with a notary signature or the signature of       two witnesses. In Mississippi, the application to vote by       mail-in ballot must be notarized.        In another example, Ms. Lang testified that ``[f]rom start       to finish, Tennessee makes vote by mail unduly difficult and       inaccessible.'' CLC has several lawsuits pending in       Tennessee, two of them, Ms. Lang notes, particularly relevant       to minority voters' opportunities to vote. CLC is challenging       Tennessee's strict limitations on who can vote by mail and       the state's failure to allow voters to fix issues with their       absentee ballots after they are rejected due to a perceived       signature mismatch.        Additionally, Tennessee law does not allow most first-time       voters to vote by mail even if they otherwise qualify under       the state's strict eligibility criteria. Ms. Lang testified       that, ``[t]hus, new voters--who are disproportionately young       and of color--are locked out of absentee voting even when       they have no way to present themselves to vote in person.''       Allison Riggs of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice       testified that ``[t]he five states that did not allow       unfettered access to vote-by-mail in 2020--Tennessee, Texas,       Mississippi, Indiana, and Louisiana--were in the bottom 10 in       turnout countrywide.''        Additionally, when a voter does vote by mail-in ballot,       often there is no guarantee the ballot will be counted, as       election officials often have the discretion to reject a       ballot if they perceive discrepancies in the voter's       signature. Ms. Lang testified that ``signature matching'' has       been shown to ``disproportionately discount the ballots of       voters with disabilities, older voters, and voters who are       non-native English speakers or racial minorities.'' Ms. Diaz       of the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Initiative also       testified that, ``signature matching requirements for mail       ballots create a potential to disenfranchise Latino voters''       and ``[u]ltimately, mandatory signature matching is likely to       have a disproportionate effect on the young, elderly,       disabled, racial/ethnic minorities, and limited English       proficient voters.''        If not implemented in conjunction with in-person voting       options and in consultation with tribal governments, mail-in       voting can replicate many of the same barriers and distance       issues faced by Native voters. A lack of traditional       addresses, inconsistent access to postal services, and       distance all create barriers to fully accessing mail-in       voting for many Native American voters.        The use of drop boxes or allowing a third-party to return a       voter's mail-in ballot have also been the target of       restrictions in recent years. Ms. Lang testified that last       year, approximately 41 percent of voters who voted absentee       used ballot drop boxes, just 3 percent less than the       percentage of voters who returned their ballot using the       Postal Service. Yet, despite widespread, secure usage of drop       boxes, states such as Texas moved to restrict the ability of       voters to return their ballots via drop box--during the       election the Governor of Texas issued an order restricting       counties to one drop box per county and forcing counties that       had deployed more than one to remove them.        Ms. Lang testified that ``[t]his eleventh-hour decision to       limit access to safe ballot drop-off locations so close to       the election sowed mass confusion. Moreover, it       disproportionately affected Black and Latino voters living in       major metro areas and voters who were entitled to vote by       mail because they were older or had disabilities.'' The       Governor's order forced highly populous, majority-minority       counties like Harris County, which has 4.7 million residents       (more than 26 states) to cut their drop off locations from       the 12 they had set up over roughly 1,700 square miles to       one. These restrictions harmed minority voters in both       populous counties and rural counties like majority-minority       Brewster County on the Texas-Mexico border.        A lack of convenient access to drop boxes to return mail-in       ballots was a consistent barrier for Native voters, as noted       in NARF's 2020 report. All too often, drop boxes are       located off tribal lands, in some cases great distances       from Native American communities. Bans on ballot       returnalso disproportionately harm Native American voters.       Many Native Americans rely on P.O. boxes that are often       far from their homes. As detailed by NARF, families       commonly ``pool'' their mail, meaning ``one person who is  [[Page H4481]]       going to town would collect it for everyone else to drop       off at the post office.''        Also, some people who cannot afford a P.O. box will have       their mail sent to someone else who does have one, meaning if       the mail contains an early ballot, depending on the law, that       neighbor could be implicated in a banned ballot collection       practice. NARF, along with the ACLU and the ACLU of Montana       is currently challenging two new Montana laws that hinder       Native American participation in voting, including one that       attempts to block organized ballot collection on rural       reservations. In September 2020, a Montana court permanently       struck down a different state law, the so-called Montana       Ballot Interference Prevention Act (BIPA), which imposed       severe restrictions on ballot collection efforts critical to       Native Americans living on rural reservations. In its order,       the court held that the costs borne by Native American       communities associated with BIPA were ``simply too high and       too burdensome to remain the law of the State of Montana.''      Recent Attacks on Opportunities to Vote        Despite the record-setting voter turnout experienced in       2020 and the secure nature in which the election was       conducted, attacks on opportunities to vote are well underway       in many states. According to the Brennan Center for Justice,       at least 16 mail voting restrictions in 12 states will make       it more difficult to cast mail ballots that are counted and       at least 8 states have enacted 11 laws that make in-person       voting more difficult. According to the Brennan Center's       state law roundup:        ``Three states have limited the availability of polling       places: Montana permitted more locations to qualify for       reduced polling place hours; Iowa reduced its Election Day       hours, shortened the early voting period, and limited       election officials' discretion to offer additional early       voting locations; and Georgia reduced early voting in many       counties by standardizing early voting days and hours.''        In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill       that makes it more difficult to vote by mail-in ballot and       makes it harder for voters to access secure drop boxes. On       May 6, 2021, the NAACP LDF filed a lawsuit on behalf of the       Florida State Conference of the NAACP, Disability Rights       Florida, and Common Cause, challenging many of the provisions       in SB 90 (2021), including new ID requirements for requesting       mail-in ballots, new requirements for standing mail-in       applications, limitations on the use of drop boxes, and       others--this litigation is pending.        As noted earlier in this section, Republicans in the Texas       state legislature are pushing a bill that would put       limitations on early voting hours (including Sunday early       voting), increase restrictions on vote-by-mail, and curb       voting options such as drive-thru voting. This proposed law       comes after an election cycle in which, despite the ongoing       pandemic, the Governor limited the number of drop-off       locations for mail-in ballots to one site per county via       proclamation, forcing Harris County, for example, to cut       their drop-off locations from 12 to 1, Republicans attempted       to preemptively throw out more than 125,000 early voting       ballots from drive-thru polling sites in Harris County (the       state's most populous county) via court challenge; and       refused to expand eligibility for no-excuse absentee voting.        According to the Texas Tribune, Senate Bill (SB) 7 takes       aim at opportunities to vote used by minority voters,       ``[p]ortions of the bill were specifically written to target       voting initiatives Harris County used in the last election--      such as a day of 24-hour early voting, drive-thru voting, and       an effort to proactively distribute applications to vote by       mail--that were heavily used by voters of color. But under SB       7, those options will be banned across the state.'' Ms.       Longoria testified that SB 7 would have prohibited the       Elections Administrator from opening the polls before 6:00       a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. on weekdays or Saturday--a       prohibition that would ``disproportionately hurt voters of       color, particularly those who are Black and Hispanic.''        Despite failing to pass SB 7 in the regular legislative       session, the Texas Legislature began a special session on       July 8, 2021, in which both the House and Senate revived       separate proposals (Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 3) that       would enact restrictions on opportunities to vote such as       outlawing the drive-thru voting option utilized by Harris       County, regulating early voting hours to preempt expanded       early voting opportunities such as 24-hour voting, and       prohibiting local election officials from sending unsolicited       mail-in ballot applications, among others.        Ms. Riggs testified that, once again, under the guise of       ``election integrity,'' the North Carolina legislature is       responding to the 2020 election by introducing bills that       would restrict access to voting options. Ms. Riggs testified       that one troubling bill moving through the legislature is       Senate Bill (SB) 326, which would ``[w]ith no justification''       require voters to submit an absentee ballot request form       earlier than was required in 2020, and would require all       civilian absentee ballots to be received no later than 5:00       p.m. on Election Day to be counted-- currently ballots       postmarked by Election Day and received no later than three       days after Election Day are counted. In analyzing data from       the 2020 election, Ms. Riggs testified that, ``SCSJ internal       data show that in the first few days after Election Day in       2020, Black voters' ballots represented a significant       percentage of those ballots received when compared to White       voters' ballots (where race was designated)'' and ``[t]o be       clear, all these voters who relied on the United States       Postal Service would be disenfranchised under the new law.       But the harm to Black voters, whose participation rate has       dropped below the rate seen in 2008 and 2012, is very       troubling.''        In March 2021, on the heels of record voter turnout in the       November 2020 general election and January 2021 run-off       election, the State of Georgia also enacted a suppressive       voting law that makes cuts to voting opportunities, which       will disproportionately impact minority voters.        Ms. Nelson of LDF testified that LDF, along with several       partners, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the       Northern District of Georgia challenging Georgia's SB 202 for       intentional racial discrimination and discriminatory results       under Section 2 of the VRA, intentional racial discrimination       under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, as an       unconstitutional burden on the right to vote under the First       and Fourteenth Amendments, and as an unconstitutional burden       on the right to freedom of speech and expression under the       First Amendment.        The Justice Department has also filed suit against the       State of Georgia, the Georgia Secretary of State, and the       Georgia State Elections Board over the newly enacted law,       challenging provisions of the law under Section 2 of the VRA.       The Justice Department's complaint argues that several       provisions of SB 202 were ``adopted with the purpose of       denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race.''       The suit further alleges that ``the cumulative and       discriminatory effect of these laws--particularly on Black       voters--was known to lawmakers and that lawmakers adopted the       law despite this.''                                  CONCLUSION         Americans no longer vote solely on a single Tuesday. For       millions of Americans, Election Day-only voting is       impractical or inaccessible. Increasing access to       opportunities to vote benefits all voters and increases       participation in our democratic process--but targeted       restrictions on these opportunities disproportionately and       discriminatorily burden minority voters. As Ms. Lang       testified, ``[t]he early in-person voting options are wildly       uneven nationwide. While some Americans enjoy a broad range       of voting opportunities, others face increasing constraints       on their voting options.''        Cuts to early in-person voting, especially Sunday voting,       and a lack of adequate early voting sites serves to       disenfranchise minority voters and, in some cases, has been       shown to be enacted with discriminatory intent. Additionally,       mail-in voting is a safe, secure, and critical option for       many voters, but if enacted with unreasonable and       discriminatory barriers, can remain out of reach for many       minority voters. Finally, attacks on alternative       opportunities for returning a ballot have a discriminatory       impact of many minority voters.        The evidence before the Subcommittee is clear--cuts to       early voting, limiting the availability of early voting       options, undue restrictions on mail-in ballots, and unfounded       restrictions on ballot return options erect discriminatory       barriers to voting.       Chapter Eight--Changes to Methods of Election, Jurisdictional                       Boundaries, and Redistricting                                  BACKGROUND         Discriminatory practices in, and changes to, methods of       election, jurisdictional boundaries, and redistricting impact       whether voters can elect representatives that reflect their       voices and communities. Discriminatory redistricting, vote       dilution, annexations, deannexations, drawing of       jurisdictional boundaries, and changes to the method of       election all affect elections and representation ranging from       local-level school boards to state courts and Congressional       seats.        Shelby County v. Holder itself began as a change to       jurisdictional boundaries and the method of election for a       local city council seat. There, the city attempted to change       the district lines for the Calera City Council in Calera,       Shelby County, Alabama. In redrawing the district lines, the       voting population for Voting District 2 changed dramatically,       bringing in hundreds of White voters, cutting the proportion       of Black voters from more than two-thirds to one-third.        At the time, Alabama was subject to statewide preclearance       under Section 5 of the VRA and the new district map was       subject to review and approval by the Justice Department. The       DOJ was not persuaded that the new map would not discriminate       against Black voters and voided the new map. The day after       the DOJ struck down the map, Calera held a previously       scheduled city council election under the now-voided map in       which Ernest Montgomery, the District 2 representative and       the only African American on the five-member city council,       was voted out of office. The DOJ blocked certification of the       election results pending a new vote.        After a year of negotiation, Calera got rid of its district       map, moving instead to a six-seat ``at-large'' council and in       a new election, Ernest Montgomery won one of the seats. These       circumstances served as the predicate for lawyers to bring       suit challenging the constitutionality of the coverage       formula and preclearance regime of the VRA.        The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits not only       discrimination in the denial of access to the ballot, but       also in dilution of voters, such as the way district lines       are drawn to dilute the ability of voters of color to elect  [[Page H4482]]       their preferred candidate. Voting changes that were once       covered by Section 5 included, among others:        ``(d) Any change in the boundaries of voting precincts or       in the location of polling places. (e) Any change in the       constituency of an official or the boundaries of a voting       unit (e.g., through redistricting, annexation, deannexation,       incorporation, dissolution, merger, reapportionment, changing       to at-large elections from district elections, or changing to       district elections from at-large elections). (f) Any change       in the method of determining the outcome of an election       (e.g., by requiring a majority vote for election or the use       of a designated post or place system).''        Additionally, the redistricting process can and has been       used to deny political power and equal representation to       minority populations. As discussed below, without proactive       protections against discriminatory redistricting, it can take       years to litigate a redistricting case. While a case winds       its way through the courts, numerous elections can take place       under a map that is later found to be discriminatory and       invalid.        States are entering the first federal decennial       redistricting cycle without the full protections of the       Voting Rights Act since its enactment in 1965. Without       proactive protections to ensure district lines are not drawn       in a discriminatory manner, voters could be forced to go to       the polls under maps that years later, through lengthy and       costly litigation, are found to be discriminatory and       invalid.        The evidence presented to the Subcommittee demonstrates       conclusively that changes to methods of election, alterations       to jurisdictional boundaries, and redistricting can and do       disproportionately and discriminatorily impact minority       voters and can be, in some cases, wielded with discriminatory       intent.    THE DISPROPORTIONATE AND DISCRIMINATORY BURDEN AND IMPACT ON MINORITY   VOTERS OF CHANGES TO METHODS OF ELECTION, JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES,                             AND REDISTRICTING         There is a long, documented history of methods of election,       altering jurisdiction boundaries, and redistricting processes       being used to discriminate against, dilute the voting power       of, and effectively disenfranchise minority voters. Since       Reconstruction and the rise of Jim Crow, as Black, Latino,       Indigenous, and Asian American communities gained access to       the franchise, overcame barriers to voting, and gained       political power and voting strength, they have been met with       suppressive tactics meant to dilute their votes and ensure       voting power for the shrinking majority.        A November 2019 report on discriminatory voting practices       produced by AAJC, MALDEF, and NALEO noted that, for example,       since 1957, ``there have been at least 1,753 legal and       advocacy actions that successfully overturned a       discriminatory change in method of election because of its       discriminatory intent or effects.'' The report also cites       that at least 219 annexations or deannexations have been       challenged and invalidated by a court or the DOJ, or amended       or withdrawn. Additionally, according to the report, since       1957, 982 redistricting plans were challenged and invalidated       by a court or the DOJ or amended or withdrawn because of       their discriminatory intent or effects.        Professor Patty Ferguson-Bohnee testified that, before       Shelby County, the Department of Justice issued nine Section       5 objections to redistricting plans involving Native voters       in Alaska, Arizona, and South Dakota--five of those were in       Arizona. Additionally, since 1966, 22 federal cases       challenging at-large election systems, redistricting lines,       or malapportionment have been filed on behalf of Native       voters, including state legislative districts, school boards,       counties, sanitation districts, and city councils. Of these       22 cases, 6 were brought by the Department of Justice.        Thomas Saenz of MALDEF testified before the Subcommittee       that Latino voters have also seen attempts to limit the       growth of their voting power, including ``the perpetuation or       re-introduction of at-large voting or the failure to       acknowledge and incorporate the growth of the Latino       community in the decennial redistricting process.'' Asian       Americans have also seen the district drawing process used in       attempts to dilute their voting power.        Black voters have long-experienced attacks on their voting       power through vote dilution, annexations, redrawing       jurisdictional boundaries, and discriminatory redistricting       maps. As Justice Kagan noted in her Brnovich dissent,       following the passage of the VRA:        ``The crudest attempts to block voting access, like       literacy tests and poll taxes, disappeared. Legislatures       often replaced those vote denial schemes with new measures--      mostly to do with districting--designed to dilute the impact       of minority votes. But the Voting Rights Act, operating for       decades at full strength, stopped many of those measures       too.''        In the immediate aftermath of Shelby County, states and       localities redistricted, drawing new lines, or changing the       method of election from neighborhood seats to at-large       districts, in ways ``guaranteed to reduce minority       representation.''         Changes to Method of Election and Jurisdictional Boundaries         Altering methods of election and jurisdictional boundaries       has long been used to discriminate against minority voters       and dilute voting power. In definitional terms, ``method of       election'' refers to ``the system for electing members of a       body and may include features affecting the size and       composition of the electorate that votes for a given seat,       the timing of election for certain seats, and the number or       percentage of votes required to win an election.''        At-large elections occur when representatives are elected       from one large district simultaneously, rather than at the       community level through local, single-member districts. Janai       Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund testified that ``[a]t-      large elections can allow 51 percent of voters to control 100       percent of the seats on an elected body, which, in the       presence of racially polarized voting and other structures,       can dilute a racial minority group's voice in the electoral       system.'' Multi-member elections occur when a jurisdiction is       divided up into districts and, in each, voters all vote for       each of the multiple seats. Shifts to these two methods can       be used to dilute the voting power of minority communities       and prevent them from electing representatives of their       choosing.        In addition to altering the method of election, tactics       such as annexations, deannexations, or shifting       jurisdictional boundaries dilute the political power of       minority voters by selectively altering the racial and ethnic       makeup of the electorate.        In one of the first lawsuits challenging a change made       after the VRA's preclearance protections were undermined in       Shelby involved a change to the method of election for the       Pasadena, Texas City Council. MALDEF challenged the       conversion of the Pasadena, Texas City Council from eight       districted seats to six districted seats and two at-large       seats. Mr. Saenz of MALDEF testified that this change was       ``plainly undertaken to prevent the growing Latino voting       population from electing a majority of the city council;       participation differentials virtually ensured that the white       population would elect its choices for the at-large seats in       elections characterized by a racially polarized vote.''        Following a bench trial, the district court judge held that       not only would the change have the effect of unlawfully       diluting the Latino vote, but it was made intentionally to do       so. Chief Judge Rosenthal of the U.S. District Court for the       Southern District of Texas stated, ``[t]he intent was to       delay the day when Latinos would make up enough of Pasadena's       voters to have an equal opportunity to elect Latino-preferred       candidates to a majority of City Council seats.'' Mr. Saenz       testified that, following a long and costly trial preparation       and trial process, this resulted in the first contested       ``bail-in'' order, requiring Pasadena to pre-clear future       electoral changes.        Sonja Diaz of the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics       Initiative noted that, in California, because of the 1990       federal court decision in Garza v. Los Angeles County Board       of Supervisors, Los Angeles County was forced to create the       first Latino-majority seat--30 years later, the Board of       Supervisors still has only one Latino-majority district,       despite the Latino citizen population increasing 77 percent       over the last 20 years.        Mr. Saenz testified that, 10 years ago, MALDEF identified 8       counties in California that should have drawn an additional       Latino-majority district on their 5-member county board of       supervisors but failed to do so. Mr. Saenz testified that,       ``[e]ven with unlimited resources, challenging eight       jurisdictions through litigation under section 2 of the VRA .       . . would be daunting, if not impossible.'' While MALDEF       successfully challenged Kern County in ``the first section 2       litigation to go to trial in California in well over a       decade, seven other counties were able to leave their VRA-      violative district maps in place throughout the decade.''        Examples of changes to methods of election, and related       tactics can be found around the country. In 2014, a federal       court ordered Yakima, Washington, to create new, single-      member City Council districts to remedy an at-large       districting scheme that routinely suffocated the vote of       Latino voters. Ms. Diaz testified that, in the first election       with the new districts, three Latinas were elected to the       City Council, though this was met with forms of retaliation.       In response, ``the city clerk, along with some ousted white       city council members, resigned an entire month early'' and       White council members ``sought to leverage an at-large ballot       referendum to reduce the electoral voice of Latinos by       creating a strong mayor system.'' Ms. Diaz testified that:        ``In response, the non-Hispanic white members of the Yakima       city council attempted a retaliatory change to the charter as       a way to reduce the power of the city council to ensure that       Latinos could not have a majority of the representation on       the seven person council, in violation of Section 2 of the       Voting Rights Act. [Voting Rights Project] successfully       intervened on behalf of Latino plaintiffs to stop the       proposed districting change to a mayor-council system, which       if adopted, would revert the single-district council to an       at-large election that dilutes the Latino vote.''        Ms. Nelson of the NAACP LDF testified that, in 2015, the       County Commission in Fayette County, Georgia tried to revert       to an at-large voting system in a special election to replace       a Black Commissioner who had died unexpectedly. LDF won a       Section 2 case that stopped this change and required the       election to use single-member districts, which allow Black       voters to again elect their preferred candidate.  [[Page H4483]]         In another example, in 2016, the largely white City of       Gardendale, Alabama attempted to secede from the more diverse       Jefferson County School Board, a move that would have       effectively transferred Black voters in Gardendale from a       system in which they had some ability to elect candidates of       their choice, to the Gardendale city council's at-large       election system in which Black voters have no ability to       elect candidates of their choice. Ms. Nelson testified that,       in 2018, the Eleventh Circuit Court blocked the secession       after LDF successfully proved that Gardendale was motivated       by racial discrimination. Since Shelby County, LDF has warned       at least four local jurisdictions in Alabama that ``the at-      large aspects of their electoral systems may violate Section       2 of the VRA and potentially also the U.S. Constitution.''        Ms. Nelson also testified that, in 2017, LDF ``proved that       the Louisiana Legislature intentionally maintained at-large       elections for the state courts in Terrebonne Parish to       prevent the election of a Black judge.'' A Black candidate       has never been elected as a judge on the court in a contested       election. A three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed       the favorable decision in June 2020, despite the trial       court's finding that plaintiffs clearly established vote       dilution and denied LDF's petition for rehearing en banc.        Professor Patty Ferguson-Bohnee testified that at-large       districts have also been used to deny Native American voters       the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice--states       such as Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming have       used this scheme over the last 25 years to deny voting power       to Native voters.        In Utah, for example, the Justice Department sued San Juan       County in the 1980s arguing that the at-large system violated       Section 2 of the VRA--the resulting consent decree resulted       in single-member districts. Despite population changes, the       district lines did not change over the next 25 years and,       despite changes that were made to the other two districts in       2011, the boundaries of the Native American-majority district       remained the same. The Navajo Nation challenged the scheme of       packing Navajo voters into one, single district out of three.       As a result of multi-year litigation, the county's districts       were reconfigured, and Native Americans were able to elect       two candidates of choice--litigation that took seven years       and cost plaintiffs $3.4 million.        There are additional examples of the Justice Department       filing suit under Section 2 challenging methods of election       schemes in the years post-Shelby. In 2017, the Justice       Department filed a complaint under Section 2 challenging the       City of Eastpoint, Michigan's, at-large method of electing       the city council as diluting the voting strength of Black       citizens; and in June 2019, the court entered the parties'       consent decree providing for the city to use ranked choice       voting to resolve the claims. On May 27, 2020, the Department       filed a complaint challenging the at-large method of election       for the school board of the Chamberlain School District under       Section 2 of the VRA in South Dakota alleging that the Native       American population of the School District is sufficiently       large and geographically compact to constitute a majority of       the voting-age population and that the at-large method of       election the Chamberlain School Board dilutes the voting       strength of American Indian citizens.        As recently as April 14, 2021, the DOJ filed a complaint       and proposed consent decree under Section 2 of the VRA,       challenging the at-large method of electing the board of       alderman of the City of West Monroe, Louisiana's, city       council, arguing that the current method of electing the West       Monroe Board of Aldermen dilutes the voting strength of Black       citizens, who constitute 28.9 percent of the voting-age       population of the City of West Monroe, but no Black candidate       has ever been elected to the West Monroe Board of Aldermen,       and no Black individual has ever been appointed to the Board.        This is merely a sampling of discriminatory actions       executed through changes to methods of election and changes       to jurisdictional boundaries. The evidence before the       Subcommittee clearly illustrates that these practices are       enacted with discriminatory effect and intent, resulting in       the dilution of the voting power of minority voters and a       severe restriction of their ability to elect candidates of       their choosing.      Redistricting        Each decade, following the decennial census and       distribution of population data, states undertake to redraw       or update district lines--this affects districts up and down       the ballot and at all levels of government. Discriminatory       redistricting practices have been utilized for decades to       dilute and suppress the voting power of minority voters and       can impact representation at all levels of government. To put       a finer point on it--in 1991, since-deceased Republican       consultant Thomas Hofeller said, ``I define redistricting as       the only legalized form of vote-stealing left in the United       States today.''        In redistricting, officials can also use tactics known as       ``cracking'' and ``packing'' to dilute the votes of minority       communities. ``Cracking'' occurs when officials divide voters       into a number of different districts, such that the minority       voters in the districts do not have a majority in any of       them--the purpose of which is to maximize the number of       wasted votes. ``Packing'' occurs when voters are placed into       one or only a few districts, so the remaining districts are       easier for non-minority voters to control.        The country is now about to begin the first redistricting       cycle without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act       in more than a half century. According to the USCCR's 2018       report on minority voting rights access, ``overall data shows       that there have been over 3,000 changes submitted due to       redistricting in every 10-year cycle since the 1965 VRA was       enacted.'' Research performed by AAJC, MALDEF, and NALEO       found that, since 1982, ``at least 389 redistricting plans       have been challenged by a court of the DOJ, or amended or       withdrawn by responsible lawmakers, because of their       discriminatory intent or effects.''        The redistricting process can and has been used to deny       political power and equal representation to minority       populations. While a district is supposed to follow the ``one       person, one vote'' doctrine established by the Supreme Court       in the 1960s, the drawing of districts is all too often done       behind closed doors, without meaningful public input, and in       a manner used to dilute the voices of some voters and, in       effect, give disproportionate voting power to others.        Former Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., Chairman of       the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, testified       before the Subcommittee that:        ``In the days since that ruling eight years ago,       unnecessary and discriminatory voting restrictions went up       across the country . . . And we saw newly emboldened state       legislatures draw discriminatory maps that unfairly placed       Black people and other people of color, young and poor       people, into gerrymandered voting districts where their       impact would be diluted and their voice ultimately lost.''        Jerry Vattamala of AALDEF testified that ``Asian Americans       have been historically disenfranchised in the redrawing of       district boundaries and in their right to vote.'' Mr.       Vattamala further testified that the percentage of Asian       American elected officials is not keeping track with the       population growth, in many instances because Asian American       communities of interest are divided into numerous districts,       ``subverting the growth and thwarting the effects of this       growth and the numbers, to deny them the ability to elect a       candidate of their choice.'' Mr. Vattamala stated further       that ``we only see Asian American electoral representation       when we have fair redistricting. Only then are they able to       elect a candidate of choice and they usually do.''        Professor Ferguson-Bohnee testified that ``[i]n addition to       well-documented access barriers, redistricting has been used       as a tool to suppress Native American voting rights and       depress Native American political power.'' In Arizona, for       example, ``Tribal voters challenged redistricting plans every       cycle since the 1960s, except for the last decade following       the 2010 Census.'' The last decade was the first time       Arizona's maps were precleared on the first attempt--now, the       retrogression standard required under Section 5 of the VRA is       no longer an option to protect the state's single Native       American majority-minority district in the upcoming       redistricting cycle.        Litigation alone can take years to remedy the harm of       gerrymandering, meaning voters spend years represented by       maps that are later found to have violated their rights.       Cases challenging discriminatory maps drawn in the 2010       redistricting cycle in North Carolina and Texas, for example,       took more than half a decade to litigate, all while voters       went to the polls under districting maps later found to be       discriminatory and unlawful.        Allison Riggs of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice       testified that, ``[i]n the last decade, the North Carolina       legislature's repeated violations of the Fourteenth Amendment       in redistricting, local and statewide, should give anyone       pause, and are strong evidence of the need for federal       protections.''        Specifically, in North Carolina, the state drew       redistricting maps that packed Black voters into as few       districts as possible. Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit, and the       federal courts found that the challenged districts violated       the Equal Protection Clause. However, as Ms. Riggs testified,       when the State General Assembly was given the first chance to       remedy the districts, the legislature perpetuated the racial       packing. In 2016, after the District Court ruled against the       state's maps, state legislators drew new maps, this time       admitting the purpose of the maps was partisan.        In 2017, the Supreme Court upheld the lower court's       rejection of two North Carolina congressional maps on the       grounds that North Carolina's Republican-controlled       legislature relied too heavily on race in drawing the maps.       The state's maps had been the subject of continuous       litigation since the 2011 redistricting--all the while,       voters went to the polls to cast ballots under maps that were       found, years later, to be unlawfully discriminatory. On       October 28, 2019, a North Carolina state court again ruled       against the state's congressional district maps, saying the       record of partisan intent was so extensive that opponents of       the maps were poised to show that the maps were       unconstitutionally errymandered to favor Republicans over       Democrats and the voters would be irreparably harmed if the       2020 elections were held using those maps.        But the North Carolina legislature is not the only bad       actor. In 2019, Sean Young of the ACLU of Georgia testified       before the Subcommittee that the ACLU's case in Sumter       County, Georgia ``perfectly illustrates  [[Page H4484]]       the damage that Shelby County has caused.'' In 2011, 67       percent of Sumter County's Board of Education was African       American (six out of nine)--then the General Assembly       proposed a redistricting plan that would reduce the       percentage of African Americans on the Board to 28 percent       (two of seven) and submitted the plan to the DOJ for       preclearance. The DOJ did not preclear the plan, but       following the Shelby decision the Board was able to       immediately implement its discriminatory plan. Soon       thereafter, the ACLU of Georgia brought a lawsuit to overturn       a discriminatory gerrymandering plan in Sumter County,       Georgia--a federal court eventually ruled that the plan was       discriminatory and violated the Voting Rights Act, five years       after the plan went into effect and after years of expensive,       time consuming litigation. In the intervening five years,       School Board elections were held under a plan that was       discriminatory and illegal.        In September 2013, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a       complaint against the State of Texas as a plaintiff-      intervenor in Perez v. Perry (W.D. Tex.), seeking a       declaration that Texas' 2011 statewide redistricting plans to       the State House of Representatives and the Congressional       delegation were adopted ``with the purpose of denying or       abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or       membership in a language minority group in violation of       Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act'' and contended that the       Texas state legislature's plan diluted the voting power of       Asian Americans and other people of color.        Jerry Vattamala, Director of the Democracy Program at       AALDEF, testified before the Subcommittee that, at the time       of Perez v. Perry, Texas State House District 149 had a       combined minority citizen voting-age population of close to       62 percent, and since 2004, the Asian American community in       the District had voted as a bloc with Hispanic and African       American voters to elect Hubert Vo, a Vietnamese American and       the first Vietnamese American state representative in Texas       history, as their representative.        In 2011, the state legislature sought to eliminate Vo's       seat and redistribute the coalition of minority voters to the       surrounding districts. In denying preclearance of the plan in       2012, the three-judge panel in Washington, D.C., found that       the congressional and state redistricting plan had ``both a       retrogressive effect and a racially discriminatory purpose.       The decision later had to be vacated and remanded in light of       the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby and its implications       for Section 5 preclearance claims. That was not the end of       litigation over Texas' redistricting plans, however. The       legal battle over Texas' 2011 maps would go on for more than       three-quarters of the decade and cost millions of dollars. In       the intervening years interim maps were put in place.       Eventually, in Abbot v. Perez, the Supreme Court would allow       all but one of Texas' political districts to remain in place       through the end of the decade. The Court upheld the maps       despite a district court describing the process used to       create them as ``discriminatory at its heart''--while the       Court did not specifically find discriminatory purpose in the       adoption of the 2013 maps, ``it did not dispute the       determination that the 2011 maps were infected with the       discriminatory intent to limit the influence of voters of       color.''        The State of Texas has a long history of racial       discrimination in redistricting plans. In discussing Texas'       long history of discrimination in voting, in Veasy v.       Abbott--litigation over Texas' strict voter ID law--a federal       court found in 2017 that ``[i]n every redistricting cycle       since 1970, Texas has been found to have violated the Voting       Rights Act with racially gerrymandered districts.'' Despite       being covered by the VRA since 1965, federal judges have       ruled at least once every decade since then that Texas       violated federal protections for voters in redistricting.        In testimony before the Subcommittee, Thomas Saenz of       MALDEF testified that:        ``Last decade, the state of Texas gained four congressional       seats as a result of its comparatively rapid growth over the       course of the aughts. Nearly two-thirds of that Texas       population growth came in the Latino community. Still, in       adopting a new congressional district map, the Texas       legislature drew none of the four new districts within the       Latino community, instead engaging in splitting the increased       concentrations of Latino population among multiple districts       in order to prevent Latino voters from electing candidates of       choice. It took nearly a full decade of litigation under       the VRA, waged by MALDEF and others, to ensure that an       interim map, more respectful of the growing Latino       community, would remain in place to protect Latino       voters.''        In testimony submitted to the Subcommittee, Professor       Ferguson-Bohnee detailed the long history of minimizing       Native American political representation through       redistricting in the State of Arizona. The 2010 redistricting       cycle was the first time Arizona's maps were precleared on       the first submission. Tribes have previously participated in       redistricting and defended the single majority-minority       Native American legislative district--Arizona, like other       states, is no longer subject to Section 5 preclearance for       the coming redistricting cycle.        In North Dakota, tribal leaders raised concerns before the       Subcommittee at the 2019 field hearing that, though there is       only one at-large Congressional representative, their       reservations are divided in a way at state-level       redistricting that no Native American can win a seat       representing the tribal lands. State Representative Ruth       Buffalo testified in 2019 that, while she was the only Native       American serving in the State House at the time of the       hearing, she represents District 27--Fargo, North Dakota--a       district 370 miles from her homelands of the Fort Berthold       Reservation, and that the district representing Fort Berthold       encompassed a white population that overwhelms the Native       American population.        In another example, Professor Ferguson-Bohnee testified       that, in South Dakota, ``discrimination in redistricting led       to prolonged litigation followed by consent decrees.'' In       2004, in Kirkie v. Buffalo County, Buffalo County       gerrymandered its three districts by packing 75 percent of       the Indian population into one district. As Professor       Ferguson-Bohnee testified:        ``The county, the ``poorest in the country,'' was comprised       of approximately 2,100 people, of which 83 percent were       Indian. This redistricting had the purpose of diluting the       Indian vote, as whites controlled both of the other two       districts and thus County government. The case was settled by       a consent decree wherein the county admitted its plan was       discriminatory and was forced to redraw the district lines.       In addition, the county agreed to subject itself to Section       3(c) of the Voting Rights Act, which requires the submission       of voting changes for preclearance.''        Professor Ferguson-Bohnee testified that, in 2005, another       South Dakota County was forced to redraw district lines ``for       similar malapportionment of Indian voters.'' Professor       Ferguson-Bohnee testified that ``[p]reclearance may have       prevented this type of de facto discrimination, because the       changes would have needed preclearance approval prior to       enactment.''        Dividing tribal communities and ignoring tribal boundaries       in the redistricting process also dilutes the Native American       vote. Professor Ferguson-Bohnee testified that, while       dividing reservation boundaries may be required to meet equal       population requirements and to enhance voter effectiveness,       there ``are several examples of redistricting schemes that       divide tribal communities to reduce voting strength.''       Professor Ferguson-Bohnee notes that, for example, in recent       years redistricting bodies have divided tribal communities       into multiple districts in Wisconsin, Washington, Montana,       and California--in Washington, the maps split three separate       reservations.        Mr. Vattamala testified that, in the past, redistricting       plans have also diluted Asian American voting strength by       fragmenting communities into multiple districts. Mr.       Vattamala highlighted that Section 5 coverage was not only in       the South--New York previously had three covered counties as       well, which helped protect minority communities. In New York       City, for example, Mr. Vattamala testified that congressional       district boundaries have divided Asian American communities.       In the case Favors v. Cuomo, AALDEF submitted materials       superimposing the existing State Assembly and Senate, and       Congressional district lines over the Asian American       communities of interest, illustrating how divided each of the       communities were among multiple districts, essentially       denying the community the ability to elect candidates of       their choice.        Mr. Vattamala testified that:        ``AALDEF was ultimately able to convince the Special Master       to draw a fair congressional district in Queens that kept       Asian American [Communities of Interest] whole, and together.       Several months later that district elected the first Asian       American to Congress from New York State, and it was       primarily because the community was finally allowed the       opportunity to elect a candidate of its choice. This result       was likely only possible through federal litigation.''        Mr. Vattamala testified that the Asian American community,       working together with the Black community and the Latino       community, formed what they call a unity map that ``protected       all the communities of color that were protected under the       Voting Rights Act,'' and that it was very powerful to have       the knowledge that Section 5 existed, that the map drawers       started from a position of ensuring they were complying with       Section 5 and ``not retrogressing districts.'' Those       protections are no longer in place.        Partisan gerrymandering is also a form of vote denial and       dilution that can disproportionately impact minority voting       power when minority voters heavily favor one party over       another. In 2019, however, the Supreme Court in Rucho v.       Common Cause declined to weigh in on the question of when       partisan gerrymandering has crossed constitutional bounds,       holding that partisan gerrymandering claims are       nonjusticiable, presenting political questions beyond the       reach of the federal court. This decision leaves voters       vulnerable to 50 different interpretations of what       constitutes an impermissible partisan gerrymander in the       upcoming redistricting cycle. In their opinion, the Court       did, however, leave space for Congress to formulate a test       for determining when a map constitutes a partisan       gerrymander.                                  CONCLUSION         The evidence before the Subcommittee is clear, changes to       method of election, redrawing jurisdictional boundaries, and       the redistricting process have all been used time and again       to dilute the voting power of minority voters, denying them       the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice and a       real voice in democratic governance. Redistricting cases       ``typically require massive amounts of attorney time and       millions of  [[Page H4485]]       dollars in expert fees,'' leaving many communities vulnerable       to discrimination and suppression when voting rights       litigators cannot intervene on their behalf and without the       proactive protections of a federal preclearance regime. As       former Attorney General Holder testified, ``[w]e need to end       gerrymandering, so that all people, including people of       color, can be represented by public servants of their choice       and be able to hold those representatives politically       accountable.''      Conclusion        The Voting in America hearings conducted by the       Subcommittee show conclusively that discrimination in voting       does, in fact, still exist. The evidence gathered by the       Subcommittee not only illustrates that discrimination exists,       but that is has grown steadily in the wake of the Supreme       Court's decision in Shelby County. Furthermore, the evidence       demonstrates that the ``extraordinary measures'' once       deployed by the Voting Rights Act remain necessary today, and       that the removal of those safeguards released a torrent of       voter suppression laws the VRA once succeeded in holding       back.        As former Attorney General Eric Holder testified:        ``Before 2013, Section 5 had helped prevent discriminatory       voting laws from taking effect by imposing preclearance       protections that required a federal review of changes to       voting procedures in covered regions. Basically, areas with a       history of discrimination had to get approval from the       Department of Justice or from a federal court for significant       changes in voting laws or procedures. That section of the       Voting Rights Act had helped to stop some of the worst       attempts to discriminate against minority voters for decades.       But in a five-to-four opinion, the conservative members of       the Court wrote that the nation had ``changed dramatically''       since the Voting Rights Act went into effect and that,       because of gains made, particularly by Black Americans, these       protections were no longer necessary.''        The evidence demonstrates that the nation has not changed       as dramatically as the Court's majority may have thought. In       the eight years since Shelby County was decided, states have       taken significant steps toward suppressing the vote. Across       the country, states have purged millions of voters from the       voting rolls; enacted a rash of strict voter ID laws;       attempted to implement documentary proof of citizenship laws;       failed to provide necessary language access and assistance to       limited-English proficiency voters; closed, consolidated, or       relocated hundreds if not thousands of polling locations,       causing voters to wait in long, burdensome lines to vote;       attempted to cut back on opportunities to vote outside of       Election Day; and employed changes to methods of elections,       jurisdictional boundaries, and redistricting as methods to       dilute and disenfranchise minority voters.        Litigation under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the       Constitution has proven to be a powerful but inadequate tool       to combat the wave of voter suppression tactics unleashed in       the years since Shelby. Janai Nelson, Associate Director-      Counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, testified that, in       the first five years following Shelby ``an unprecedented 61       lawsuits were filed under Section 2 of the Voting Rights       Act,'' of which ``[t]wenty-three cases were successful.'' By       contrast, ``in the five years before Shelby, only five       Section 2 cases were won.'' Litigation alone is not an       adequate remedy to protect the right to vote--cases       arising under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act are       reactive, costly, and can take years to litigate.        The 2018 and 2020 elections saw record voter turnout. While       this is indeed an outcome to be celebrated, it is not, as       some argue, an indication that voter suppression and       discrimination no longer exists. The evidence gathered by the       Subcommittee demonstrates that voters turned out in record       numbers despite suppressive voting laws and a once-in-a-      century pandemic. And yet, the reaction of Republican-led       legislatures around the country to historic voter turnout has       been to unleash a new wave of restrictive voting laws in the       months following the 2020 election. States with a history of       discriminatory voting practices and racially polarized voting       continue to enact voting laws without analyzing whether these       provisions discriminate against minority voters.        The false specter of fraud has been cited to support these       new restrictive provisions. But, as we have heard time and       again, numerous investigations have found no credible       evidence of fraud in the 2020 election. Indeed, according to       cyber and elections security experts, ``the November 3rd       [2020] election was the most secure in American history.''       Unfortunately, fueled by the ``Big Lie'' that the election       was stolen, insurrectionists attempted to stop the       certification of a lawful, valid, democratic presidential       election by storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021. In the       six months since the attack, efforts to suppress the vote and       subvert democracy have continued, as state legislatures have       moved quickly to meet the increase in voter turnout with       voter suppression.        According to the Brennan Center for Justice, as of May 14,       2021, more than 389 bills in 48 states have been introduced       restricting the vote. As of June 21, 2021, 17 states have       enacted 28 new laws that restrict access to the vote, with       some state legislatures still in session. At least 16       restrictions on mail voting will make it more difficult for       voters to cast mail ballots that count in 12 states. At least       eight states have enacted 11 laws making in-person voting       more difficult. And more bills are still moving through state       legislatures.        These new laws only compound the legal and administrative       hurdles enacted in the eight years since Shelby. As former       Attorney General Holder testified:        ``These actions have not made our elections safer or more       secure. They have not improved the quality or accessibility       of our politics. Instead, they have stripped Americans of       fundamental rights and undermined the promise of American       democracy. And they have all--every one of them--      disproportionately impacted people of color.''        For example, Michael Waldman, President of the Brennan       Center for Justice, testified that ``[i]n 2013, at least six       states--Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota,       Virginia, and Texas--implemented or began to enforce strict       photo ID laws, most of which had previously been blocked by       the Department of Justice due to their discriminatory       impact.'' Federal courts in at least four states have found       strict voter ID laws to be racially discriminatory, including       Texas and North Carolina's laws. In previously covered       jurisdictions, 1,688 polling places were closed between 2012       and 2018, all with none of the disparate impact analysis       previously required by preclearance. Restrictions targeting       early voting opportunities can and do have a direct impact on       minority voters.        Thomas Saenz, President and General Counsel for MALDEF,       testified that, ``[t]here is simply no way that non-profit       voting rights litigators, even supplemented by the work of a       reinvigorated Department of Justice Civil Rights Division,       could possibly prevent the implementation of all of the undue       ballot-access restriction and redistricting violations that       are likely to arise in the next two years.''        The evidence compiled by the Subcommittee illustrates that       the voting and election administration practices of purging       voters from the voting rolls; enacting voter ID and proof of       citizenship requirements; failing to provide necessary multi-      lingual voting materials and assistance; closing,       consolidating, or relocating polling places; cutting or       restricting access to alternative opportunities to vote; and       altering methods of election, jurisdictional boundaries, and       redistricting disproportionately impacts Black, Latino,       Native American, Asian American, and other minority voters       and impedes access to the ballot in a discriminatory manner.        Congress needs to listen to the American people. The Voting       Rights Act was not written in the halls of Congress--it was       written between Shelby and Montgomery. It was written by       Americans who fought for equal access to what was promised to       be a democracy. We are again hearing from the people on the       need to protect the right to vote.        Defending democracy used to be a bipartisan endeavor. Since       the Voting Rights Act first passed in 1965, Congress has       acted several times, and in a bipartisan manner, to protect       access to the vote. The Voting Rights Act was reauthorized       five times with bipartisan votes--and signed into law each       time by a Republican President. The 2006 VRA reauthorization       was introduced by a Republican congressman. Moreover,       Congress has passed additional voting bills, including the       Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA)       in 1986, the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993,       and the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) in 2002 with bipartisan       support. Bipartisan commissions such as the Carter-Baker       Commission and the Presidential Commission on Election       Administration endeavored to create best practices in       elections to improve the voting experience.        We are now at an inflection point in protecting our       democracy. The time has come for Congress to utilize its       constitutional authority to protect the fundamental right to       vote for all Americans. As Mr. Henderson stated before the       Subcommittee, ``[f]or democracy to work for all of us, it       must include all of us.'' ``It is unacceptable that in 2021,       56 years after the VRA's passage,'' Ms. Nelson stated, that       ``the right to vote remains so very under-protected. This       model is not sustainable nor is it acceptable.''        And as Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in 1964, the year       before the passage of the Voting Rights Act, the ``right to       vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the       essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that       right strike at the heart of the representative government.''       After reviewing thousands of pages of evidence collected       during this Congress and listening to the testimony of dozens       of experts from across the country, as summarized in this       report, the evidence demonstrates one clear command:       Congressional action is needed.                            ____________________
