 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud American who has the  distinct honor of serving this great body.   As a Member of Congress, we take an oath to defend the Constitution  because at times it needs defending.   On January 6, the Nation watched as insurrectionists stormed the  Capitol, threatened the safety of countless individuals, and  successfully, albeit it temporarily, disrupted our process.   In the midst of the attack, hundreds of Capitol Police officers  heroically upheld their duty to defend the United States and protect  those who work here. Many officers were severely injured and beaten,  including one of my former interns.   Tragically, one officer, Officer Brian Sicknick, succumbed to the  injuries he sustained.   To Officer Sicknick's family, I extend my deepest condolences. Know  that we are praying for you.   To all Capitol Police officers, we are deeply thankful for your  bravery. Because of you, thousands of lives were protected, and the  people's work was able to resume.   Now, just as the Capitol Police protected us, Congress must match  that courage and protect the Constitution, our democratic processes,  and this Nation.   The President's role in the insurrection is undeniable. Both on  social media ahead of January 6 and in his speech that day, he  deliberately promoted baseless theories, creating a combustible  environment of misinformation and division.   To allow the President of the United States to incite this attack  without consequences is a direct threat to the future of this  democracy. For this reason, I will vote to impeach this President  tomorrow.   The bill before us tonight is a nonbinding resolution, which requests  the Vice President to invoke the 25th Amendment, a step he has already  said he will not take. It is merely a symbolic gesture, and I will  oppose that resolution.   After last week's attack on the Capitol, it is clear our Nation is  more divided than ever in recent history. We began this great  experiment over 240 years ago. To preserve it, we must remember that  our faith, race, or political party is not what unites us. What unites  us is that we are Americans. I would encourage members of this body,  and everyone at home, to remember that simple truth.                                time  2145
