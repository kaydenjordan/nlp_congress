 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  for yielding.   As I look at Walter here, it reminds me when I came to Congress in  2013, my first term here. Walter was one of the first people who  befriended me.   We had, over the course of several Congresses, many, many good  laughs. He was always quick to laugh. He was always gentle, strong in  his conviction, and he wouldn't hesitate to hold you accountable.   Every time I went on a codel, he would scold me for spending the  taxpayers' money. When the codel went to go to his funeral, I said, if  I went on that codel, Walter would roll over in his grave and yell at  me, and so I chose not to go just to honor him on that.   He would give you the shirt off of his back and help you in any way  he could. There was a Christmas ball, and I had to have a date for my  daughter because she came up here. I took my wife, and I called Walter.  He said: ``I don't want to do that, but for you, I will do that.'' That  is the kind of friend he was. And he walked my daughter in there so  that she got to go.   He cared about God, country, his family, the people who serve this  great Nation, and the people in his district.   He was held in high esteem, as was evidenced the day when   Thomas  Massie and Louie Gohmert gave the eulogy here in the talk about Walter.  That was the quietest this Chamber had ever been without the Speaker  having to interrupt.   He was always fun to have a joke with or laugh, and we had many. His  team is back here, faithfully to the end. Next time we are at a  reception, we will have a red wine and a cigar in Walter's favor.   I thank the gentlewoman for doing this, and I thank you, buddy,  Walter Jones, for the things you did for us.   God bless.
