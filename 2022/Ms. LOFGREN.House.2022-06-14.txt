 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentlewoman from California, the Honorable Connie Conway, be permitted  to take the oath of office today.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest,  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    Madam Speaker, on behalf of my California colleagues and  the House of Representatives, I welcome Representative Connie Conway to  Congress.   A lifelong San Joaquin Valley resident, Representative Conway has  served as a businesswoman, healthcare worker, Tulare County supervisor,  president of the California State Association of Counties, and director  of the National Association of Counties.   From 2008 to 2014, she served in the California State Assembly.  During her tenure she also served as the Assembly minority leader.   In 2019, Representative Conway was appointed to the USDA Farm Service  Agency as the California executive director.   In that role, she administered more than $100 million in safety net  and disaster relief programs serving California farmers, ranchers,  foresters, and agricultural producers.   Representative Conway previously operated her own consulting business  and comes with experience in the healthcare sector--previously working  for the Women's Health Department at Tulare District Hospital and  coordinating a wellness program for Visalia's Kaweah Health Medical  Center.   We look forward to working with Representative Conway.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Calvert).                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I would like to now welcome our newest  Representative to the podium.   Madam Speaker, I yield to Representative Conway.
