 Madam Speaker, it is clear-cut. The President of the  United States has violated his oath of office and betrayed the  Constitution and the American people.   He admitted to soliciting assistance from a foreign leader to  interfere in the U.S. election and aid his political reelection  campaign. That is a violation of law, a violation of the Constitution,  a betrayal of the American people, and an impeachable offense.   Overwhelming evidence also demonstrates the President withheld  congressionally approved taxpayer dollars to blackmail the young, new  President of Ukraine under attack from Russia.   The gentleman from Georgia says Ukraine didn't feel any pressure.  They are being invaded by Russia, Vladimir Putin, you know, Trump's  friend. He withheld that aid until the whistleblower report came out,  then the aid was released. It wasn't released for any good purpose.   Congress voted for that aid; the President signed the bill. That is  another impeachable offense.   The Committee on the Judiciary has put together an extensive document  which shows that there is evidence of numerous other Federal crimes,  including bribery and wire fraud.   Madam Speaker, the President's actions threaten the continuation of  our representative democracy. I am proudly voting for impeachment  today.                                time  1530
