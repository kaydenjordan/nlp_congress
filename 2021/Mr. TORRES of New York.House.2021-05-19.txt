 Mr. Speaker, when I was sworn in the week of  January 6, I never imagined living through an insurrection against the  U.S. Capitol during the electoral college vote count.   On January 6, I felt the same sense of shock and trauma that I had  felt on 9/11. Like most of America, I took for granted that the  peaceful transfer of power is so natural as to transcend even the most  turbulent period of partisan politics.   I was wrong. We were all wrong. Democracy is too fragile to be taken  for granted. It demands from all of us a vigilant defense.   As Members of the United States Congress, we took an oath to defend  and uphold the Constitution of the United States. The insurrection  against the U.S. Capitol was a literal and metaphorical assault on the  very Constitution we have been charged with defending.   The January 6 Commission is, therefore, not a choice, but an  obligation. We have a duty to investigate what happened and why it  happened and who is responsible.   As a Congress, if we are not able or willing to ascertain the full  truth surrounding an invasion of our very home,  [[Page H2578]]  of our Nation's Capitol, then why are we here? The 11th-hour attempt to  sabotage a bipartisan, bicameral position is not a difference of  opinion, nor is it politics as usual. It is an abdication of the oath  that we took to uphold the Constitution.   The United States of America is not a cult of personality, it is a  Nation of laws. And our loyalty should not be to one political figure  or one political party. Our highest loyalty should be to our country  and the Constitution that governs it.   We must never forget that the truth trumps politics. And if the truth  is what we seek, then we have nothing to fear from bringing the clarity  that only truth can bring to the chaos and confusion of January 6.
