 Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for the  nomination of Ronald Batory to be the Administrator of the Federal  Railroad Administration at the Department of Transportation and to  express my deep frustration that this noncontroversial, highly  qualified nominee has been languishing in the Senate for over 4 months  due to objections by a handful of Democrats over a parochial issue  entirely unrelated to the nominee's qualifications.   The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee held a hearing on  his nomination on July 26, 2017, and reported his nomination favorably  out of committee with a unanimous voice vote on August 2, 2017. At that  time, not a single Senator on the committee, Republican or Democrat,  expressed any doubt about Mr. Batory's extensive expertise on rail  safety issues.   Mr. Batory has over 45 years of experience in the railroad industry,  in both management and operational positions, and he is a respected  leader in driving organizational change and, most importantly, in  advancing safety improvements. In fact, Railway Age called him  noncontroversial and said: ``He is the best-qualified person to be the  Federal Railroad Administrator in a very long time, perhaps in the  agency's history.''   Yet, despite his unanimous approval from the committee, he has been  blocked from assuming his leadership duties at this important safety  regulatory agency. The FRA has critical safety decisions to make on a  daily basis, and the agency needs strong strategic direction and  management on time-sensitive safety issues. A senior adviser, which is  Mr. Batory's current role at the DOT, does not have the same legal  authority or ability to lead an agency as does a Senate-confirmed  Administrator.   It is time to stop hamstringing Mr. Batory and get him confirmed so  he can operate at full capacity. Unfortunately, it appears that we will  not be able to do that without, once again, engaging in the cloture  process on a noncontroversial nominee. This takes up valuable floor  time that could be spent on other priorities. Yet it will, undoubtedly,  still lead to his being confirmed by a large, bipartisan majority of  the Senate. This pattern of obstruction--burning up a week or more of  time to confirm two or three nominees who end up with overwhelming  cloture and confirmation votes--must end.   The Batory nomination is also significant for another reason. Earlier  this week, we saw the terrible tragedy of the Amtrak Cascades 501  derailment in Washington. Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with  all of those affected, especially during this holiday season. As the  NTSB continues its ongoing investigation, we will learn more about the  causes of this derailment and the measures that might have prevented  it.   To be clear, the tragic events of this week were not caused by a  vacancy at the helm of the FRA, but the Senate must act now to install  a leader at this agency to advance any safety solutions and oversight  found to be needed as a result of the accident.   To date, much of the discussion surrounding this accident has been  focused on positive train control or what we call PTC. While it is  still early to know what, if any, impact PTC would have had on this  accident, I could not agree more with the Democratic leader who earlier  this week said: ``We need Positive Train Control.'' He went on to say:  ``The Federal Department of Transportation is not pushing Federal PTC  hard enough.''   If he truly believes the DOT needs to do more, why is he, along with  a few of his colleagues, standing in the way of Mr. Batory's  nomination? After all, Congress has tasked the FRA Administrator with  providing the oversight and strong push that will be needed to ensure  railroads meet next year's December 31, 2018, deadline for full PTC  installation and training.   Make no mistake, a strong push is what many passenger railroads need.  According to the FRA's latest quarterly progress report for passenger  railroads, only 50 percent of locomotives are equipped and PTC  operable; 64 percent of required PTC radio towers are installed; and  only 24 percent of required route miles are in operation.   The Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee expects to  continue to play its role in conducting strong oversight of PTC  implementation, including holding a hearing in 2018. However, what I do  not expect the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee to do is  to grant any further change to the PTC deadline framework that is  established in current law. That is why we need Mr. Batory. When  finally confirmed, he will play a significant role in pushing  expeditious and successful PTC implementation.   This is not just the view of the Commerce, Science, and  Transportation Committee, I might add, which, again, approved Mr.  Batory, as I said earlier, unanimously, but also of the rail  professionals who advance safety on the ground. The States for  Passenger Rail Coalition, which consists of 25 State Departments of  Transportation, wrote in July:         The issues facing the railroad industry today are       significant, and it is vital that we have an experienced,       capable and dedicated leader like Mr. Batory, who is willing       to work with the states to make the improvements necessary to       build a national rail system with an emphasis on increasing       mobility and reliability, while enhancing safety and security       now, and in the years to come.        Likewise, rail labor--representing conductors and       communication workers--and other industry groups urged the       Senate to proceed to Mr. Batory's nomination ``as soon as       possible,'' stressing ``the importance of having Mr. Batory's       expertise and leadership at the agency responsible for       railroad safety.''    That letter was written in September. It is now December. There is no  reason for this delay.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both of these letters be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                 September 15, 2017.      Senator McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Senator Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Republican Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader       Schumer: As rail industry stakeholders, we write to support       the nomination of Ronald Batory for Federal  [[Page S8230]]       Railroad Administrator. We urge the Senate to proceed to Mr.       Batory's nomination as soon as possible.        Mr. Batory's nomination was announced in July, unanimously       approved and reported by the Senate Commerce Committee in       August, and now awaits action on the Senate floor. Mr. Batory       is eminently qualified to be FRA Administrator and we believe       he will have considerable bipartisan Member support once the       Senate turns to his nomination.        We ask that his nomination be considered soon by the full       Senate, in light of the importance of having Mr. Batory's       expertise and leadership at the agency responsible for       railroad safety.        Thank you for considering our views on this important       matter.

Hon. John Thune,      Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Nelson,      Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science and           Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson: On behalf of       the States for Passenger Rail Coalition, Inc (SPRC), I write       in support of the confirmation of Ronald L. Batory as       Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)       for the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT).        The SPRC's mission is to promote the research, development,       implementation, operation, sustainability, and expansion of       publicly supported intercity passenger rail services. On       behalf of its membership representing 25 state departments of       transportation and passenger rail authorities, SPRC advocates       for ongoing federal funding and programmatic support for       intercity passenger rail initiatives, including efforts to       improve safety on our nations rail system and at highway-rail       at-grade crossings.        We are impressed with Mr. Batory's extensive experience in       the railroad industry and appreciate his plan to improve       communications within the agency, and we encourage him to       collaborate closely with public and private stakeholders to       achieve policy goals. We are especially encouraged by his       reputation as a good listener with a sound analytical       approach We commend his affirmation of the need for the FRA       to move to performance-based rulemaking and fact-based policy       making. Focusing upon these two objectives will strengthen       the role of the states in promoting the development of a       safe, reliable and efficient vibrant national network of       freight and passenger rail services.        We ask that the Committee act speedily to confirm Mr.       Batory. The issues facing the railroad industry today are       significant, and it is vital that we have an experienced,       capable and dedicated leader like Mr. Batory, who is willing       to work with the states to make the improvements necessary to       build a national rail system with an emphasis on increasing       mobility and reliability, while enhancing safety and security       now, and in the years to come.            Sincerely,                                        Paul C. Worley, CPM, Chair,                          States for Passenger Rail Coalition, Inc.     Mr. President, we have had an immensely qualified leader,  Ronald Batory, ready to lead an important safety agency for over 4  months. The time for playing political games with the leadership of  this railroad safety agency should be over. It is long past time that  my Democratic colleagues end the obstruction, and this body must  confirm Ronald Batory.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 261, Ronald  Batory. I further ask that the Senate vote on the nomination with no  intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate then resume legislative session.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, I am kind of beyond words to explain why we  are objecting to someone who was unanimously approved out of the  committee, is highly qualified, noncontroversial, and would run an  incredibly important safety agency in this country. I just don't have  words to explain what that objection might be.   I hope this is the last time the Democrats in the Senate will object  to getting this important position filled with an individual who comes  highly regarded, highly qualified, and has gone through the entire  process--answered all of the questions through his confirmation--and is  ready now for a final vote in the U.S. Senate, which would allow him to  get the job and to get about the important work of ensuring that there  is safety on the railroads in this country.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week Congress sent the President a tax  reform bill that will translate into real relief for American families.   I have spent a lot of time on the floor of the Senate talking about  how this bill will benefit these families in South Dakota and around  the country.   Today I would like to take a few minutes to recognize the hard work  of those Members and staff who made the legislative goal of tax reform  a reality.   First, thank you to Senator Hatch for his leadership and members of  the Finance Committee for a job well done.   Numerous hearings, member meetings, and a lot of compromise helped us  get this bill to the finish line.   As a result, the contributions and priorities of each member of the  Finance Committee and, frankly, those of the entire conference are  reflected in the final product.   Having once served as a staffer here myself, I would like to  recognize the many staff members who contributed to this product.   Mark Warren, who serves as my tax counsel, has put in countless hours  on this legislation.   It has not been unusual over the last several months to find him in  his office when I arrive at work before 7 a.m. and still at his desk  late into the evening. With decades of experience, including time spent  at the House Ways and Means Committee and at the Treasury Department, I  and other members of the committee and conference relied heavily on  Mark's intricate knowledge of tax policy as we crafted this  legislation.   He worked very hard to help me advance priorities in this legislation  including provisions benefiting small businesses, farmers, and  ranchers. Thanks in no small part to his efforts, we successfully  delivered a tax reform bill that will work for them. Time spent at the  office is time away from family. I am grateful to both him and his  family for his efforts.   I would also like to thank my legislative director, Jessica McBride,  and my staff director, Brendon Plack. Brendon is a native of  Madison,SD, and has been with my office for over 12 years. Jessica is a  native of Miller, SD, and has been with my office for 8 years. Their  work, advice, and counsel were invaluable as we moved this bill across  the finish line.   I would also like to recognize a few other staff members for their  hard work: Jay Khosla, Mark Prater, Jeff Wrase, Nick Wyatt, Matt  Hoffman, Tony Coughlan, Eric Oman, Jen Acuna, Marty Pippins, Alex  Monie, Preston Rutledge, Bryan Hickman, Brendan Dunn, and Monica Popp.   I would also like to recognize Senator Toomey's tax staff member,  Randy Herdon, Senator Portman's tax staffer, Zach Rudisill, and Senator  Scott's tax staffer, Shay Hawkins.   I know many of them over the last few months were running on very  little sleep and perhaps missing important events at home with family  and friends in order to be here at work. Nevertheless, they were  patient, thoughtful, and tireless in their efforts because they knew  the work was important and the impact would be significant.   We have all benefited from their wise counsel and have a better  product for it.   Early next year, this legislation is going to have a real impact on  people's lives across this country. Their hard work and contributions  helped make it possible. They all worked incredibly hard and should be  very proud of the work you have done on behalf of the American people.   I thank them for their service, and congratulations on a job well  done.                            ____________________
