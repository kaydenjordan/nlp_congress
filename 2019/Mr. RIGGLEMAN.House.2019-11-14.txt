 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a  dear friend, Jay Kistler. Jay passed away on October 14 of this year,  after a life of heroism and bravery. He was 71 years old.   He had been married to his wonderful wife, Sheila, for almost 50  years, and he was the father of Brooke, Kerri, and Jay Kistler III.   Jay retired as a Navy captain and retired as the government lead for  the Electronic Warfare and Countermeasures Office. Jay's forward- looking vision allowed him to project capabilities and actions decades  into the future. He was respected by his peers, his subordinates, and  his superiors. He was our adversary's worst nightmare.   I will miss him as a naval flight officer, a commander, a decorated  veteran, a family man, and my mentor.   You changed everyone's life for the better, Jay. Fair winds and  following seas, Captain.                            ____________________
