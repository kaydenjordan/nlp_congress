 Mr. Speaker, normally at this time the majority leader and  I do a colloquy. We do a colloquy to discuss the schedule for the week  to come. My suspicion is they don't know what the schedule is for the  week to come because they were going to offer two immigration bills to  undermine the proposal that so many have made to have four alternatives  on DACA available for the people's House to speak for the people.   We are noting today 6 years since President Obama put into place  protection for DACA protectees. Mr. Speaker, 86 percent of the American  people support doing just that, and the President asked this House to  act. Mr. Aguilar and Mr. Hurd in a bipartisan way--everybody says to  the public: Yes, we want to work in a bipartisan way--well, the  majority had the opportunity to do it, and they have retreated from  that responsibility and that assertion.   I lament the fact that we have not acted as the President asked us to  on protecting DACA. They are Americans in everything but paper.                            ____________________
