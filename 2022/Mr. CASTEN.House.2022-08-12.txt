 Madam Speaker, last November, our House delegation went  to Glasgow for the COP26 conference. We told the world that we were  back, that we had rejoined the Paris climate accord, and that we were  committed to building back better and committed to putting science over  politics. It felt pretty good.   But to be blunt, the world didn't believe us. As we sat at that press  conference, all of these reporters from Europe said: What about the  Senate? What about the filibuster? What if Republicans take over in the  midterms?   They had heard this song before. They admired our enthusiasm, but as  you know, Madam Speaker, they really didn't share it.   Today, we are going to prove them wrong. We are going to remind them  what the United States is capable of. We are about to pass the most  impactful climate bill ever. You all should be proud of that. You were  here to share this moment with us. We are on the path to reducing  CO2 emissions by 40 percent by 2030. That is a really big  deal.   But it is only a start because 40 percent ain't enough. We have  reestablished U.S. credibility today, but we still have to establish  U.S. leadership. The measure of our success is not what we pass today;  it is whether the planet is cooler tomorrow.   Today, we remind the world and ourselves what we are capable of. I  hope we celebrate. But tomorrow, let's get back to work.
