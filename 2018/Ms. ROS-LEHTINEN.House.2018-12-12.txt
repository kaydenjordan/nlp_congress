 Mr. Speaker, on December 1, we commemorated World  AIDS Day, celebrating our many accomplishments in the fight against  HIV/AIDS around the globe. One important program for which we are also  celebrating 15 years of success this year is PEPFAR.   Mr. Speaker, before Congress enacted PEPFAR, the HIV rates were  skyrocketing, especially across the developing world. New cases of HIV  infection were outstripping AIDS deaths by more than 60 percent.   Serving in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, we followed this  issue closely, hearing from advocates and administration officials on  what to do. There was an almost unchallenged notion that we were about  to lose a whole generation in sub-Saharan Africa. It just seemed to be  an utterly hopeless situation.   In 2003, our tremendous leader, President George W. Bush, called on  us in Congress to take action in responding to this global crisis, and  I am proud that we swiftly answered the President's call. Today, there  are over 14 million people receiving HIV treatment globally, and over 2  million babies born HIV-free to HIV-positive women--simply astounding.   PEPFAR morphed from an emergency plan to a sustainable program, and I  am so glad that USAID is at the helm of this lifesaving program. Since  his time as Ambassador to Tanzania, USAID Administrator Mark Green has  had a clear-eyed strategy to address the challenges posed by the HIV/ AIDS epidemic. What he has done has reinvigorated this program.   We are so proud as Americans of what PEPFAR has achieved. It is  something that we need in order to continue to be a global leader  against the HIV pandemic.   I will never forget standing in the Oval Office as President George  W. Bush signed this essential program, PEPFAR, into law. I hope that my  colleagues continue to protect and strengthen this vital program.   I am also proud of the many organizations like the One Campaign that,  day in and day out, are working to get us closer to our goal of an  AIDS-free generation.                                time  1030                         Recognizing the Simon Family     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Simon  family of Key Biscayne for their exemplary work on the yet-to-be-named  park located in my congressional district at 401 Hampton Lane in Key  Biscayne, the first neighborhood park for their community.   I would like to thank Arielle Simon, the horticulture adviser; Brett  Simon, the architectural designer; and their father, Steven Simon, the  project coordinator, who worked tirelessly as volunteers to see this  vision into fruition.   This is not just any park; it is not just any effort. In an  editorial, the community, newspaper, The Islander News, wrote:         The park, put simply, is beautiful--but the story behind it       is even more so.    From the beginning, Steven, who has a history of effective community  leadership, saw an opportunity to work with local elected officials to  tackle a problem which they inherited.   Steven brought in his daughter, Arielle, who worked at Miami's  renowned botanical garden and became a certified horticulturist, and  his son, Brett, who has a master's degree in architecture and  craftsmanship education in furniture design, and other volunteers and  seasoned professionals.   Together, they all worked as a team, drafting proposals and securing  the necessary funds to see this project through.   And here is how the Simon family beautifully described and included  south Florida limestone in their proposal. They said:         We incorporated that natural material in our park design so       that, metaphorically, we bring the bedrock upon which this       island community of shifting sands was founded to the       surface. Functionally and aesthetically, limestone is an       integral part of our creation of a gathering place . . . in       our first neighborhood park.    The story, which is well documented in Key Biscayne's Islander News  over the past 3 years, truly shows what is possible when people come  together with a desire and a drive to do something positive for the  betterment of their community. I invite all of my congressional  colleagues to come to Key Biscayne and visit that island paradise and  especially to see this park for yourself.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 2736) to develop a long-term strategic vision and a  comprehensive, multifaceted, and principled United States policy for  the Indo-Pacific region, and for other purposes, as amended.

Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Indo-Pacific region--        (A) represents nearly 50 percent of the global population;        (B) is home to some of the most dynamic economies in the       world; and        (C) poses security challenges that threaten to undermine       United States national security interests, regional peace,       and global stability.        (2) The core tenets of the United States-backed       international system are being challenged, including by--        (A) China's illegal construction and militarization of       artificial features in the South China Sea and coercive       economic practices;        (B) North Korea's acceleration of its nuclear and ballistic       missile capabilities; and        (C) the increased presence throughout Southeast Asia of the       Islamic State (referred to in this Act as ``ISIS'') and other       international terrorist organizations that threaten the       United States.        (3) The economic order in the Indo-Pacific region continues       to transform, presenting opportunities and challenges to       United States economic interests.        (4) The United States has a fundamental interest in       defending human rights and promoting the rule of law in the       Indo-Pacific region. Although many countries in the region       have improved the treatment of their citizens, several Indo-      Pacific governments continue to commit human rights abuses       and place restrictions on basic human rights and political       and civil liberties.        (5) Without strong leadership from the United States, the       international system, fundamentally rooted in the rule of       law, may wither, to the detriment of United States, regional,       and global interests. It is imperative that the United States       continue to play a leading role in the Indo-Pacific region       by--        (A) defending peace and security;        (B) advancing economic prosperity; and        (C) promoting respect for fundamental human rights.        (6) In 2017, the Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific,       and International Cybersecurity Policy of the Committee on       Foreign Relations of the Senate held a series of hearings on       United States leadership in the Indo-Pacific region, in       which--        (A) experts, including Representative Randy Forbes,       Ambassador Robert Gallucci, Ms. Tami Overby, Dr. Robert Orr,       Ambassador Derek Mitchell, Ambassador Robert King, Mr. Murray       Hiebert, and others detailed the security challenges,       economic opportunities, and imperatives of promoting the rule       of law, human rights, and democracy, in the Indo-Pacific       region; and        (B) Dr. Graham Allison, the Douglas Dillon Professor of       Government at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at       Harvard University, testified, ``As realistic students of  [[Page H10131]]       history, Chinese leaders recognize that the role the United       States has played since World War II as the architect and       underwriter of regional stability and security has been       essential to the rise of Asia, including China itself. But       they believe that as the tide that brought the United States       to Asia recedes, America must leave with it. Much as       Britain's role in the Western Hemisphere faded at the       beginning of the twentieth century, so must America's role in       Asia as the region's historic superpower resumes its       place.''.        (7) The United States National Security Strategy (referred       to in this Act as the ``National Security Strategy''), which       was released in December 2017, states--        (A) ``A geopolitical competition between free and       repressive visions of world order is taking place in the       Indo-Pacific region. The region, which stretches from the       west coast of India to the western shores of the United       States, represents the most populous and economically dynamic       part of the world. The United States interest in a free and       open Indo-Pacific extends back to the earliest days of our       republic.''; and        (B) ``Our vision for the Indo-Pacific excludes no nation.       We will redouble our commitment to established alliances and       partnerships, while expanding and deepening relationships       with new partners that share respect for sovereignty, fair       and reciprocal trade, and the rule of law. We will reinforce       our commitment to freedom of the seas and the peaceful       resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance       with international law. We will work with allies and partners       to achieve complete, verifiable, and irreversible       denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and preserve the       non-proliferation regime in Northeast Asia.''.     TITLE I--UNITED STATES POLICY AND DIPLOMATIC STRATEGY IN THE INDO-                              PACIFIC REGION       SEC. 101. POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to develop and commit       to a long-term strategic vision and a comprehensive,       multifaceted, and principled United States policy for the       Indo-Pacific region that--        (1) secures the vital national security interests of the       United States and our allies and partners;        (2) promotes American prosperity and economic interests by       advancing economic growth and development of a rules-based       Indo-Pacific economic community;        (3) advances American influence by reflecting the values of       the American people and universal human rights;        (4) supports functional problem-solving regional       architecture; and        (5) accords with and supports the rule of law and       international norms.       SEC. 102. DIPLOMATIC STRATEGY.         It is the diplomatic strategy of the United States--        (1) to work with United States allies--        (A) to confront common challenges;        (B) to improve information sharing;        (C) to increase defense investment and trade;        (D) to ensure interoperability; and        (E) to strengthen shared capabilities;        (2) to strengthen relationships with partners who--        (A) share mutual respect for the rule of law;        (B) agree with fair and reciprocal trade; and        (C) understand the importance of civil society, the rule of       law, the free and reliable flow of information, and       transparent governance;        (3) to support functional problem-solving regional       architecture, including through the Association of Southeast       Asian Nations, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the       East Asia Summit;        (4) to emphasize the commitment of the United States--        (A) to freedom of navigation under international law;        (B) to promote peaceful resolutions of maritime and       territorial disputes; and        (C) to expand security and defense cooperation with allies       and partners, as appropriate;        (5) to pursue diplomatic measures to achieve complete,       verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea;        (6) to improve civil society, strengthen the rule of law,       and advocate for transparent governance;        (7) to develop and grow the economy through private sector       partnerships between the United States and Indo-Pacific       partners;        (8) to pursue multilateral and bilateral trade agreements       in a free, fair, and reciprocal manner and build a network of       partners in the Indo-Pacific committed to free markets;        (9) to work with and encourage Indo-Pacific countries--        (A) to pursue high-quality and transparent infrastructure       projects;        (B) to maintain unimpeded commerce, open sea lines or air       ways, and communication; and        (C) to seek the peaceful resolution of disputes; and        (10) to sustain a strong military presence in the Indo-      Pacific region and strengthen security relationships with       allies and partners throughout the region.

SEC. 412. SAVINGS PROVISION.         Nothing in this Act may be construed as authorizing the use       of military force.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this bill.  [[Page H10137]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Indo-Pacific region is of critical importance to the  United States. It is home to some of our most urgent security  challenges, our closest people-to-people links, and our strongest  commercial and economic ties. The administration has recognized this  priority in both the National Security Strategy document and the  subsequent free and open Indo-Pacific strategy.   The United States must adapt to new and emerging geostrategic  realities and recognize the competitive nature of our relationship with  China. The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018, or ARIA, is a key  component of this effort. It provides the administration with the  direction and resources it needs for meaningful implementation of this  free and open Indo-Pacific-Asia strategy.   ARIA cements U.S. leadership in the Indo-Pacific region by reassuring  our allies and deterring our adversaries. It strengthens our security  commitments with our allies and builds the capacity of our many  partners in the region to combat terrorism and to stop aggressive  actors.   The bill reaffirms longstanding treaty alliances in Asia with  Australia, South Korea, and Japan, and it calls for building new  regional security partnerships. It also expresses unequivocal support  for Taiwan by authorizing new arms sales; supporting enhanced, high- level contacts with Taipei; and countering any efforts to forcibly  change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.   On security, ARIA commits the U.S. Government to the full  implementation of sanctions on North Korea and its enablers. It  enshrines a policy of regularly enforcing U.S. freedom of navigation  and overflight rights in the East and South China Seas, where we are  seeing increasingly aggressive activities by Chinese ships and  aircraft.                                time  1430    Mr. Speaker, this bill also supports robust U.S. commercial presence  in the region. It promotes U.S. exports and trade facilitation efforts,  while also authorizing penalties against those who steal United States'  intellectual property. This is essential for the growth of the U.S.  economy and the success of American businesses operating in the region.   Unfortunately, there are also many challenges to human rights,  nonproliferation, and democratic values in the Indo-Pacific. For that  reason, this bill bolsters the critical work of the State Department  and USAID to promote democracy, strong civil society, and the rule of  law.   Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased that we are taking up this bill, which  earned unanimous bipartisan support in the Senate. The Asia Reassurance  Initiative Act demonstrates the strong, continuing commitment of the  United States to Asia. It reaffirms American values, strengthens  American commitments to our many partners and allies in the region, and  makes clear our enduring pursuit of peace and mutual prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States must continue to reassure the nations  of the Asia-Pacific region of the enduring commitment of the United  States to being a peaceful presence in the region, dedicated to  universal values and mutual prosperity.   Senate bill 2736 provides the United States with a long-term and  whole-of-government strategy for the Indo-Pacific region that advances  American national security interests, prosperity, and promotes the  values of freedom and human rights. I urge my colleagues to join me in  support of this measure.   I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York, the ranking member  of the Foreign Affairs Committee, soon to be the chairman of our  committee, for his friendship and for his kind words. I look forward to  treating him to a nice cafe con leche in Miami. So come on down--the  weather is fine--rather than me going to New York.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further consideration  of the resolution (H. Res. 274) condemning the Government of Iran's  state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued  violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment to the text at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment to the preamble at  the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the  Committee on Ways and Means be discharged from further consideration of  the bill (H.R. 6219) to support the independence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity of Georgia, and for other purposes, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  include in the Record an exchange of letters with the other committees  of jurisdiction on H.R. 6219.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an exchange of  letters.                                          House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                  Washington, DC, December 12, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I am writing with respect to H.R.       6219, a bill ``To support the independence, sovereignty, and       territorial integrity of Georgia, and for other purposes,''       on which the Committee on Ways and Means was granted an       additional referral.        As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions       in H.R. 6219 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, I agree to waive formal       consideration of this bill so that it may move expeditiously       to the floor. The Committee on Ways and Means takes this       action with the mutual understanding that we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation, and requests your support for       such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 6219.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady.      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, December 12, 2018.

Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 6219, the Georgia Support Act,       so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 6219 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.
