 Mr. Speaker, our Nation lost an intellectual giant and  visionary leader this past Saturday, November 10, 2018.   Dr. Herbert London was a legendary conservative author, scholar,  commentator, and defender of freedom. He was a scholar's scholar and a  gentleman's gentleman.   A New Yorker of great stature, Herb grew up playing basketball and  led his high school team to a city championship. After completing his  studies at Columbia University, Herb's hoop-playing skills caught the  eye of the Syracuse Nationals; however, an injury blocked his athletic  career.   Herb went on to earn a Ph.D. from New York University and later  served as the dean of NYU's Gallatin division. From running for  political office to leading the Hudson Institute to founding the London  Center for Policy Research, Dr. London was the definition of a  renaissance man and a true patriot, committed to bringing about a  stronger, more principled Nation.   A 6'5'' tower of humility, integrity, and vision, Herb will be sorely  missed, and his legacy will forever be enshrined in the hearts and  minds of many.   My prayers are with the London family as they heal from this  tremendous loss.   May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
