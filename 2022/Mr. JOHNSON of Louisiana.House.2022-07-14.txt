 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  important voice and for hosting this Special Order hour.   The sanctity of human life can never be overemphasized. The gentleman  has done so much work in that arena, and I appreciate him.   I am thankful to our Democratic colleagues tonight, as well, for  skipping their Special Order hour so we can just go right ahead and get  started in prime time. If America were experiencing record inflation,  sky-high gas prices, and uninhibited illegal immigration under our  watch, I would probably yield my time back, as well.   Mr. Speaker, this morning in our Judiciary Committee, the Democrat  majority convened a hearing, and they titled it: ``What's Next: The  Threat to Individual Freedoms in a Post-Roe World.'' It was an  appropriate title, indeed, because the radical abortion advocates are  becoming completely unhinged. They are seeking to trample on  [[Page H6615]]  the individual freedoms of anybody who disagrees with them.   Case in point, over the weekend, the leftwing activist group  ShutDownDC offered $200 bounties for public sightings of our Supreme  Court Justices.   This week, Senator Elizabeth Warren--talk about unhinged--said that  crisis pregnancy centers all across America should be shut down.   There are 2,700 pregnancy centers all around this country in all 50  States. They are supported by over 10,000 licensed medical  professionals. They are annually serving approximately 2 million women  and men. I used to serve as legal counsel for many of these  organizations, and I can testify to their invaluable work.   Why would anybody want to shut down pregnancy centers? They exist to  provide counseling, care, aid, and comfort to struggling mothers who  just want to have their babies. This is just abhorrent.                                time  1930    Speaking of abhorrent, I suggest to my Democrat friends to study up  tonight--really, I mean, seriously--on the bill that we are going to be  voting on here tomorrow. They call it the Women's Protection Act. It is  not. We call it, more appropriately, abortion on demand until birth  act.   Even though this will be the second time we voted on this bill in  this Congress, I am not sure they know what is in it. I keep hearing my  Democrat colleagues tell us: Oh, no, it is not about abortion on demand  until birth. It absolutely is.   Surely, if they knew that this legislation did this, they wouldn't  support it, right?   The American people certainly don't support it.   To our Democrat colleagues tonight, as I yield back to my friend, I  would just humbly suggest--read your bill. You got a few hours. Read  your legislation. Search your conscience. I hope that you will do the  right thing and vote against that bill tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kelly again for the Special Order hour.
