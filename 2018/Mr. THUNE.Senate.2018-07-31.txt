 Mr. President, the confirmation process for Judge  Kavanaugh continues and, predictably, so does the Democrat hysteria. It  is the same old playbook: Any Supreme Court nominee from a Republican  President is guaranteed to destroy the Constitution, abolish our  rights, and endanger the lives of the American people. I am not  exaggerating for effect. Those are actual accusations from Democrats  and liberal interest groups.   In the lead-up to Justice Gorsuch's confirmation, the head of one  liberal organization stated that there was ``substantial evidence''  that if Gorsuch's ``egregious views were to become law, Americans'  lives . . . would be put at risk in untold ways.'' A year into Justice  Gorsuch's tenure on the Supreme Court, Americans seem to be doing OK.   But that didn't stop the former Democratic Governor of Virginia from  tweeting that ``the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will threaten  the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come.''   Then, of course, there is that other favorite Democrat accusation-- that the Constitution will be put in jeopardy if we confirm a  Republican President's Supreme Court nominee. In the lead-up to Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination, the junior Senator from California said:  ``We're looking at a destruction of the Constitution of the United  States.''   I have to say that I find this accusation particularly hilarious  because if there is one thing that we can count on Judge Kavanaugh to  do, it is to defend the Constitution. In fact, his respect for the  Constitution and the rule of law is perhaps the distinguishing feature  of his jurisprudence.   In a speech last year, Judge Kavanaugh said:         As I see it, the Constitution is primarily a document of       majestic specificity, and those specific words have meaning.       Absent constitutional amendment, those words continue to bind       us as judges, legislators, and executive officials.    Later on in the same speech, Judge Kavanaugh noted:         Because it is so hard, and because it is not easy even to       pass federal legislation, pressure is often put on the courts       and the Supreme Court in particular to update the       Constitution to reflect the times. In the views of some, the       Constitution is a living document, and the Court must ensure       that the Constitution adapts to meet the changing times.        For those of us who believe that the judges are confined to       interpreting and applying the Constitution and laws as they       are written and not as we might wish they were written, we       too believe in a Constitution that lives and endures and in       statutes that live and endure. But we believe that changes to       the Constitution and laws are to be made by the people       through the amendment process and, where appropriate, through       the legislative process--not by the courts snatching that       constitutional or legislative authority for themselves.    In short, if there is one thing the American people can count on, it  is that Judge Kavanaugh will uphold the Constitution, even when he  doesn't like the result. He will not attempt to legislate from the  bench or to make the Constitution say what he wants it to say. Anyone  who comes before Judge Kavanaugh can be certain that he will rule based  on the facts of the case, the law, and the Constitution, and nothing  else--not his personal feelings, not his political opinions, not his  beliefs about what the law should be, but just the plain text of the  law and the Constitution. That is the kind of judge that all of us,  including the Democrats, should want on the Supreme Court--the kind of  judge who, in the words of Judge Kavanaugh, will decide ``cases based  on settled principles without regard to policy preferences or political  allegiances or which party is on which side in a particular case.''   The truth of the matter is that Democrats are not worried that Judge  Kavanaugh will not uphold the Constitution. Let's be clear about that.  They know very well that he will. What they are worried about is that  he will not deliver their preferred outcomes and that his judicial  opinions will conflict with the Democrats' political opinions.  Democrats aren't looking for a qualified Supreme Court Justice. They  are looking for a political rubberstamp.   For Democrats, the only good Supreme Court Justice is a Supreme Court  Justice who will use his or her power to advance the political agenda  of the Democratic Party. Just look at the Democrat Senator who  announced his opposition to the President's Supreme Court nomination  before the President had actually nominated anyone. That is right. The  Democrat Senator announced plans to oppose the nominee before a nominee  even existed.   Well, that is all the evidence we need that Democrats' opposition to  Judge Kavanaugh is based not on any actual problems with Judge  Kavanaugh but on Democrats' ideological opposition to any nominee they  are not sure will be a rubberstamp for the Democrat agenda.   The confirmation process will continue, and I am sure the hysteria  from Democrats will continue as well, but the Senate will move forward  with the business of confirming another outstanding judge of the  Supreme Court.
