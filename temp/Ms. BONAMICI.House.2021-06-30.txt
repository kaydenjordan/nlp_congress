 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago today, I joined my colleagues  on the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and we released our bold,  comprehensive, science-based climate action plan. Our plan is a roadmap  for solving the climate crisis, and I am thrilled that we are advancing  many of its provisions this week as part of the INVEST in America Act.   The transportation sector is the largest source of energy-related  carbon dioxide emissions in the country, and the pollution  disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of  color. We must take bold action to mitigate the climate crisis, and  that includes advancing the INVEST in America Act.   This bill would help decarbonize our transportation sector by  investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, zero-emission  buses, and transit. It will increase the resilience of our communities  by strengthening predisaster mitigation efforts, supporting the use of  natural infrastructure, and restoring fish passages. And importantly,  this bill also invests in the people who will rebuild our Nation's  infrastructure.   By passing the INVEST in America Act, we can protect our planet,  create good-paying jobs, and truly begin to build back better. I thank  Chairs Castor, DeFazio, and Pallone for their leadership.                            ____________________
