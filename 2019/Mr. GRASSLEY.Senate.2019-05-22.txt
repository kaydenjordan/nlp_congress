 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here to discuss with my colleagues  issues dealing with the work of the Senate Finance Committee and  possible legislation that hopefully will come up this summer to keep  healthcare costs down, particularly prescription drugs.   In the process of doing that, I want to set the record straight on an  issue that affects every American who is eligible for Medicare. More  specifically, I am here to talk about efforts to reduce the rising cost  of prescription medicine.   Prescription drugs save lives. Millions of Americans like myself wake  up every morning and take their daily medication, but there is  something that has become a very tough pill to swallow for an  increasing number of Americans, and that is paying for the rising cost  of prescription drugs.   I applaud President Trump for turning up the volume on this issue  last summer. That is when the President announced his administration's  blueprint to lower drug costs for all Americans. He found out--and we  all found out--that is a goal that has widespread support that includes  Republicans and Democrats, as well as urban and rural Americans.   Of course, the President can only do so much--whatever law passed by  Congress allows the President to do and that doesn't solve all the  issues. So even though I applaud the President, that doesn't mean I  exclude in any way the responsibility of Congress to take action.   There are many good ideas to build upon that share broad, bipartisan,  bicameral support. There is one policy, however, that some Members are  talking about that I don't agree with, and that is repealing what is  the noninterference clause in Medicare Part D. I would like to explain  why Congress kept the government out of the business of negotiating  drug prices in the Medicare program. Some 16 years ago, when I was  formerly chairman of the Finance Committee, I was a principal architect  of the Medicare Part D program.   For the first time ever, Congress, in 2003, added an outpatient  prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. Maybe I ought to  explain for my colleagues why it took between 1965 and 2003 to include  drug benefits in the Medicare program. Remember, in 1965, prescription  drugs or drugs generally didn't play a very big role in the delivery of  medicine like they do today, but over time, they have become more  important.   That is why great support at the grassroots, both bipartisan and  bicameral, evolved into what we call the Medicare Part D program,  adopted in that year, 2003. So we came to the conclusion that adding  the prescription drug benefits for seniors was the right thing to do,  but it needed to be done in the right way--right for seniors and right  for the American taxpayers. By that, I mean allowing the forces of free  enterprise and competition to drive costs down and drive value up.   For the first time ever, Medicare recipients in every State had the  voluntary decision to choose a prescription drug plan that fit their  pocketbooks and their healthcare needs.   The Part D program has worked. Beneficiary enrollment and  satisfaction are robust. The Part D marketplace offers consumers better  choice, better coverage, and better value; yet here we are again. It  has been 13 years since Part D was implemented, and once again, I am  hearing the same calls to put the government back into the driver's  seat of making decisions on what you can take in the way of pills or  what your doctor might be able to prescribe to you based upon what a  formulary might be. We want the private sector to decide the formulary,  not the  [[Page S3023]]  government. So these people happen to be the same backseat drivers who  think that centralized government knows everything and knows best.   As the Senator who, once again, chairs the committee with  jurisdiction over Medicare policy, I am not going to let Congress  unravel what is right about Medicare Part D. Remember, I was a  Republican leading the charge to add a new benefit to a government  program. A lot of people think that is very uncharacteristic of a  Republican, but I told you why I did that: because medicine was  becoming an increasing part of the delivery of quality healthcare. So  you heard me correctly, I was a Republican chairman working with my  Democratic ranking member, Max Baucus, to accomplish Part D. We  negotiated an agreement to add prescription drug coverage for seniors.    For me and other Republicans--namely President George W. Bush--there  were a few key caveats. First, it must be voluntary. Second,  beneficiaries would share the cost with the taxpayer because having  skin in the game keeps check on spending and on utilization. Third, we  must allow competition--not government mandates--to drive innovation,  curb costs, expand coverage, and improve outcomes. It wouldn't work if  the Federal Government interfered with delivery of medicine and dictate  which drugs would and would not be covered. That is why we wrote a  noninterference clause in the law.   My friend, Senator Wyden, the current Democratic ranking member of  the Finance Committee, voted for final passage in 2003. By the way, we  are having very good bipartisan cooperation in our Finance Committee  on, hopefully, legislation to be debated in our committee in June in  regard to lowering drug costs.   The noninterference provision expressly prohibits Medicare from, one,  negotiating drug prices; two, setting drug prices; and, three,  establishing a one-size-fits-all list of covered drugs. That list is  called a formulary. I remember that many of my friends on the other  side of the aisle voted for this policy; yet some are now pushing for  repeal of that provision.   Here is a list of Democrat leaders who supported and voted to ban  Medicare from negotiating drug prices: when he was in the Senate,  Senator Biden; Senator Kennedy; Senator Baucus; Senator Reid, the  former majority leader; Senator Schumer now in the Senate; Leahy;  Durbin; Stabenow; Cantwell. On the other side of the Capitol, the list  included Speaker Pelosi and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,  Chairman Neal.   There is something else that I have learned in all my years talking  healthcare policy with Iowans at my annual 99 county meetings where I  enjoy a Q and A with whatever agenda my constituents call upon me to  discuss with them.   At the end of the day, Iowans don't want the government prescribing  lifesaving medications. Iowans want to make those decisions with a  physician who is treating them. Last year, 43 million out of 60 million  Medicare recipients were enrolled in the Medicare Part D program. That  is the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries nationwide that don't  have coverage through a past employer or similar coverage from another  source.   Plan sponsors design different plan choices and compete for  beneficiaries based on what those plans cover and what they cost.  Beneficiaries can pick from many options, with over 3,000 plans offered  across 34 geographic areas. In other words, you don't have one plan  dictated by the government. Most beneficiaries were covered by a  prescription drug plan, and a growing number were covered by a Medicare  advantage prescription drug plan.   The Part D base premium amount is low and has remained stable over  many years. Looking back to our negotiations in 2003 to get this bill  to the President of the United States, we wondered how high these  premiums would go, and we were fearful they would just go out of the  atmosphere and that they would not be stable like they have been over a  long period of time. So the noninterference clause ensures that plan  sponsors create plan options that respond to what the beneficiaries-- not the government--says it should be.   The nonpartisan congressional scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget  Office, has repeatedly stated that repealing this noninterference  clause would not save money, unless there was a restricted formulary.  As I stated, we wrote this bill in 2003 so the government wouldn't get  between you and your doctor on what you ought to have in the way of  prescription drugs. So in regard to the cost, I asked CBO to update,  and they did. CBO sent me a letter stating the same thing.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the May 10, 2019, letter from the CBO.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                            Committee on Finance,                                       Washington, DC, May 10, 2019.      Keith Hall, Ph.D.,      Director, Congressional Budget Office,      U.S. Congress, Washington, DC.        Dear Dr. Hall: As an author of the Medicare Part D program       enacted in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, I support       the statutory provision that prohibits the Secretary of the       Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from       interfering with negotiations between drug manufacturers,       pharmacies, and plan sponsors. The Part D program structure       that uses private entities to negotiate and compete to enroll       beneficiaries has worked. Program spending has been lower       than estimated at the time the program was enacted.       Beneficiary enrollment has been robust, and enrollee premiums       have remained low and stable. Enrollees are largely satisfied       with their plan. The statutory ``non-interference'' clause is       a key reason for the program's success.        While the Part D program has provided beneficiaries with a       crucial lifeline through access to prescription medications,       improvements are needed to lower high out-of-pocket costs and       to realize better value for the taxpayer-supported Medicare       program. Some have suggested that allowing the Secretary to       negotiate for the price of drugs will achieve those aims. I       believe that talk of eliminating the non-interference clause       is misguided and counterproductive. I ask that you answer the       questions below as to inform the policy debate on this       matter.        If the Secretary was given authority to negotiate by       Congress and used that authority, would it be possible to       obtain savings in Medicare?        Could negotiating by the Secretary over drug prices obtain       savings for the Medicare program if those negotiations were       limited to selective instances?        Thank you for your attention to the Part D program that has       benefited millions of Medicare beneficiaries. Please contact       my staff if you have questions.            Sincerely,                                               Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman.                                   ____                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                   U.S. Congress,                                       Washington, DC, May 17, 2019.      Re: Negotiation Over Drug Prices in Medicare.       Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: You asked for updated answers to two       questions that CBO addressed in a letter to Senator Wyden in       2007. Those questions relate to the Medicare Part D       prescription drug benefit and options for allowing the       Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate over the       prices paid for drugs under that benefit. Under current law,       the Secretary is prohibited both from interfering in the       negotiations between drug manufacturers and the prescription       drug plans (PDPs) that deliver the Medicare benefit and from       requiring a particular formulary or instituting a price       structure for the reimbursement of covered drugs.        The questions and the key conclusions from CBO's response       in 2007 are below. CBO continues to stand by those       conclusions.        If the Secretary was given authority to negotiate by       Congress and used that authority, would it be possible to       obtain savings in Medicare?        The key factor in determining whether negotiations would       lead to price reductions is the leverage that the Secretary       would have to secure larger price concessions from drug       manufacturers than competing PDPs currently obtain.       Negotiation is likely to be effective only if it is       accompanied by some source of pressure on drug manufacturers       to secure price concessions. For example, authority to       establish a formulary could be a source of pressure. In the       absence of such pressure, the Secretary's ability to issue       credible threats or take other actions in an effort to obtain       significant discounts would be limited. Thus, CBO concluded       that providing broad negotiating authority by itself would       likely have a negligible effect on federal spending.        Could negotiating by the Secretary over drug prices obtain       savings for the Medicare program if those negotiations were       limited to selective instances?        The authority to engage in negotiations limited to a few       selected drugs or types of drugs under exceptional       circumstances could potentially generate cost savings. For       example, negotiations could be focused on drugs with no close       substitutes or those with relatively high prices under       Medicare that are needed to address a public health       emergency.  [[Page S3024]]         In such cases, CBO expects that the effect of the       Secretary's actions--if he or she took advantage of the new       authority--would primarily reflect the use of the ``bully       pulpit'' to pressure drug manufacturers into reducing prices.       Thus, CBO concluded that the overall impact on federal       spending from negotiations targeted at selected drugs would       be modest. Beyond that general conclusion, the precise effect       of any specific proposal would depend importantly on its       details.        If you would like further information on this subject, we       would be happy to provide it. The CBO staff contact is Tom       Bradley.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.     Mr. President, repealing the noninterference clause  means a restricted formulary, which places limits on the drugs that are  available to seniors, maybe excluding some drugs that your doctor wants  to prescribe for you. I don't believe that Medicare beneficiaries want  the government interfering in that process.    Then, as policymakers, we must keep in mind that we are making  decisions that affect healthcare choices for the people whom we are  elected to represent.   Let's all remember to first do no harm. Repealing the noninterference  clause may sound good, but not even a spoonful of sugar will help that  bad dose of policy medicine go down.   I come to the floor today to hope that I can put this issue to rest  and, as we try to work in a bicameral and bipartisan way to reduce drug  costs, that we don't get held up by people who want to do something  different by having the government more involved, when it isn't going  to save any money and will restrict formularies. It will get the  government between you and your doctor.   In other words, I am trying to save Part D. It has been a great  success. It is accepted by the people. Let's keep drug costs down  without having this issue interfere with our process.   We need to preserve the foundation of private enterprise on which  Part D is based--in other words, the marketplace working. We need to  get to the real work of reducing prescription drug costs.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
