 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and to honor  the life of my dear friend, Green Cove Springs Police Chief Derek  Asdot. Chief Asdot passed away last month after a prolonged and hard- fought battle with COVID-19.   He started his distinguished career in law enforcement with Duval  County Schools and, in 2002, joined Green Cove Springs Police  Department. During his nearly 20 years of service to the Green Cove  Springs community, he served in multiple capacities, including  patrolman, narcotics task force, and, finally, as chief of police  starting in 2017.  [[Page H5857]]    He leaves behind a wonderful wife and two children, as well as a  community full of grateful citizens, grateful for his decades of  faithful service to the community and its people and grateful for  having had a chance to know a man like Derek.   I am personally saddened by this loss. Chief Asdot was a friend, a  mentor, and a colleague who showed me what selfless public service  looks like. He did his duty with integrity, passion, grit, and I am  forever thankful to have known him.   Rest easy, Chief. We've got your 6.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Himes and Ranking  Member Steil.   Madam Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Select Committee on  Economic Disparity and Fairness in and Growth, aka, the Committee on  the Economy.   Over the past few minutes, we have heard a variety of arguments, and  there is absolutely no doubt that every Member here today has a vested  interest in ensuring our Nation remains prosperous for generations to  come.   While we may disagree on solutions, we will work together to address  economic challenges that we see across this country. Economic  prosperity for all Americans is imperative and we know that prior to  COVID-19, Americans saw tremendous progress.   In 2019 alone, the median household income grew 6.8 percent, the  largest increase ever recorded in American history. With historic  legislation passed by the House of Representatives and the Trump  administration, we saw minority and historically underserved  communities grow at historic rates, with income levels rising 7 percent  for Hispanics and African Americans.   Following the pandemic, however, we have seen labor force  participation plummet, as the policies proposed by our colleagues  across the aisle have incentivized unemployment that we have not seen  since the Carter administration which, for the record, was more than a  decade before my time.   Now, as we begin to prepare to explore what we can do to empower  workers for the jobs of the future and encourage all American families  to succeed nationwide, I am particularly focused on communities like  mine in north Central Florida, which lack broadband in both rural and  urban areas, suffering from a lack of investment, which in turn affects  our schoolchildren, telehealth opportunities, commerce, and so much  more.   Now, in an agriculture-heavy district like mine, I also want to  highlight the high trade deficit, the need for improved trade  agreements, which help Florida producers in my home State who have  consistently been devastated by lower prices from Mexico.   During the pandemic, farmers had to destroy crops and dump milk  because the demand was so low, while cheaper produce from other nations  continued to be imported cutting out the market from our producers.  Simply put, the economics of U.S. production in agriculture are in  peril.   Finally, I would like to bring attention to issues that are hot in  the headlines these days: educational freedom, school choice, and the  rights of parents to have a say in their children's education. We all  know education is a direct correlation to prosperity. We know that  America was built on equal opportunity, not equal outcome.   Rather than asking what more government should do, we should ask  where government can be removed and should be removed. Federal  regulations cost $1.9 trillion, spent on reporting, compliance, and  more, which could be better served in investing in employees or in  workforce development or in underdeveloped communities across the  country.                                time  2130    As we begin our work on this select committee, I am committed to  working with my colleagues to pursue meaningful opportunities for all  Americans, regardless of their location, regardless of their  background, regardless of their education, and regardless of whatever  box they check.   It is well past time that we stop seeing the government as the  solution to our problems because, after all, it is the incredible  opportunities here today in America that have allowed me, the daughter  of a single mom, a young woman from rural America, who has gone from  homeless to the House of Representatives in under a decade. It is time  that we expand those opportunities--not restrict them.   I thank Chairman Himes, again, as well as Ranking Member Steil for  their leadership. I am honored to serve on this select committee.    I rise today, Madam Speaker, to speak in support of the  RECORDS Act to make urgently needed reforms to the National Personnel  Records Center which has failed our Nation's veterans through a  critical time.   I would like to share a recent story from my district about a 99- year-old marine who has been suffering from Alzheimer's. Her family has  been attempting to obtain her DD-214 form to apply for her VA pension.  This would grant her a placement in a nursing home equipped to handle  an Alzheimer's patient. However, the National Personnel Records Center  has put an indefinite delay on sending her records to her and her loved  ones.   Their justification in writing: this request does not constitute a  medical emergency. She is 99 years old. She dedicated her life to  serving our country as a marine and is suffering from a debilitating  disease. As if this excuse was not poor enough, the center also  demanded that the family prove that she has been separated for 60 years  or more to justify pulling the records. Again, this is a 99-year-old  marine veteran.   The National Personnel Records Center can no longer be allowed to  lean on the crutches of COVID. This is their excuse to justify their  dereliction of duty. They have an obligation to fulfill these claims  for our Nation's veterans who have served our country bravely. If the  National Personnel Records Center does their job and still feels no  shame in letting veterans' care lapse while their needed records  requests go unfulfilled to the tune of 500,000-plus nationally,  hundreds within Florida's Third Congressional District--constituents of  mine--then it is time for us in Congress to intervene.   Madam Speaker, I urge the House to immediately take up this  legislation. Excuses be dammed.                                time  2140
