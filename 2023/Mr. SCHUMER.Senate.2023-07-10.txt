 Madam President, first, I would like to welcome back my  colleagues, including our Senate Acting President pro tempore back to  the Senate after celebrating the July 4th holiday.   Today, my thoughts are with all New Yorkers impacted by the flash  floods that barraged the Hudson Valley, particularly Orange County  where the West Point Military Academy is located, as well as other  parts of Upstate New York, particularly Ontario County. The situation  on the ground remains dangerous. Streets have been turned into rivers;  houses have been swept away in their entirety; and, sadly, at least one  person has lost her life.   I have been in contact with the local first responders on the ground  to ensure we are doing everything we can in my office to help.   Today, I also called on FEMA to be ready to grant any request from  the State for a major disaster declaration. And I urge everyone in New  York and across the Northeast to exercise caution in the coming days.  The danger is not over.   I will continue to monitor this situation and bring the long arm of  the Federal Government to help in every way that it can.   Madam President, now, when people think about the July 4th holiday,  they think about fireworks, barbecues, family. But last week, many  Americans saw something else too. They saw more construction workers  hard at work in their communities. They saw more hard hats and shovels  and cranes and cement trucks operating day and night. They saw, in  other words, Democrats' agenda in action, an agenda that has created  over 35,000 new infrastructure projects over the last 2 years. These  projects will mean millions of new good-paying jobs across the country  for years to come. New York is a terrific example.   Last week, I was proud to announce that nearly $7 billion in Federal  dollars has been approved for the Gateway Tunnel project, in what will  be the largest Federal transportation grant in history for the most  important infrastructure project in America.   Gateway has been a true passion of mine for more than a decade, a  labor of love that I have been focused on for a long time. It is  critical for our economy in the Northeast and, in fact, in the entire  country. Should the tunnels under the Hudson not be usable, the  Northeast--and probably the country--would go into recession. So this  affects everybody.   And the funding I announced was as a direct result of the terrific  work we did in Congress to pass generational infrastructure  legislation. Our work over the past few years is paying off. The  Gateway project alone will create 72,000 new jobs--good-paying jobs-- and generate over $19 billion in ancillary economic activity in  addition to the dollars that are being spent.  [[Page S2264]]    And our infrastructure agenda is not just about bridges and tunnels  either. The administration announced recently over $42 billion in  broadband funding is heading to the States across the Nation--more  money so kids can access high-speed internet at home and so more  families in both rural and urban communities can stay connected across  the country.   I thank my colleagues who worked over the July 4th weekend to  announce all the great projects happening around the country.  Implementation will remain a top Democratic priority.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on the Senate July work period, as  the Senate gavels back in, our North Star remains unchanged: to build  on our historic work over the past few years to strengthen our economy,  make life better for the American people, and do it in a bipartisan  manner whenever possible.   A little over a month ago, both parties came together to avert a  catastrophic default on the national debt, while agreeing on spending  levels that will keep our country and our economy strong.   This month, the work of funding the government will continue. It  won't be easy but must get done with good faith and bipartisan work. I  am pleased so far that this process is moving along in the Senate  through the Appropriations Committee, through regular order, in a  bipartisan way. And we will do everything we can to ensure that it  remains that way.   In another act of bipartisanship on something equally significant,  the Senate will move forward on the annual National Defense  Authorization Act so we can keep our country safe, support our friends  in Ukraine, outcompete China, and give our troops the pay raise they  rightfully deserve.   I thank Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Wicker for moving the NDAA  through the Armed Services Committee last month. I hope that we can  move quickly on it here on the floor in July.    These two areas--Appropriations and the NDAA, the Defense Act--are  prime examples of the kind of bipartisan work we want to see in the  Senate and which I have worked with my colleagues to foster.   We also need that bipartisanship on other issues too--to reduce the  cost of insulin prescription drugs, to hold bank executives  accountable, to modernize Federal aviation programs, to reauthorize the  farm bill, to make progress on safe banking, and outcompete the Chinese  Government.   And, of course, every one of these issues requires bipartisan  cooperation. Getting there won't be easy, but we are going to do  everything we can to make them happen because every one of them will  benefit the American people, and, of course, we will also need  bipartisanship to prepare for the radical transformations that AI will  unleash in the coming years.   Tomorrow, the Senate will have the first-ever classified all-Senators  briefing from the Department of Defense and intelligence community on  AI and how it affects our national security.   Our briefers will include Avril Haines, the Director of National  Intelligence; Kathleen Hicks, the Deputy Secretary of Defense; and  other top experts from our Defense and intelligence Agencies.   We are still in the early stages of understanding AI's role in our  national security. So this briefing will be critical for Senators to  learn more about how we are using AI to protect our country; also, how  it is being used by our adversaries; and what we can do to make sure  that we maintain our advantages.   And we have no time to waste. Our adversaries won't wait to deploy  this technology against us. Congress cannot behave like ostriches when  it comes to artificial intelligence. We need to learn as much as we can  about AI, as quickly as we can, so we can play our part to ensure the  AI revolution brings prosperity, safety, and unparalleled innovation.   So I thank all of my colleagues on both sides who attended the  previous briefing and encourage them to attend this one. And I thank  Senators Heinrich, Rounds, and Young for their bipartisan work on our  little group that is spearing AI in the Senate.                            ____________________     Finally, this work period, we must continue to confirm  President Biden's nominees and rebalance the Federal bench with judges  who respect the rule of law. Sadly, Americans' faith in the Judiciary  is at an alltime low after the extreme MAGA right captured the Supreme  Court.   In the last few weeks, this MAGA majority on the Court has gutted  affirmative action, blocked student debt relief for millions of  Americans, and green-lit discrimination against the LGBTQ community.   What we are seeing at the Supreme Court is a sickening hypocrisy: As  some Justices feel free to accept lavish gifts and vacations from  billionaire friends, they are refusing to help everyday Americans just  trying to get a fair shake. And the billionaires who have provided  these trips and emoluments are no ordinary, run-of-the-mill  billionaires. They are ideological MAGA extremists who bankroll hard- right MAGA causes and then bring those cases before the same judges  they patronized.   Congress has clear authority to oversee the Federal judiciary, and  that includes making sure that the highest Court in the land is held to  equally high ethical standards. So I support Chairman Durbin and the  Judiciary Committee's efforts to advance SCOTUS ethics reform and look  forward to working with them on this issue.   In the meantime, Senate Democrats will continue to help restore faith  and balance to the Federal judiciary by keeping up our historic pace of  confirming President Biden's judicial nominees.                            ____________________     On voting rights, the great John Lewis said, ``Democracy  is not a state. It is an act, and each generation must do its part to  build what we called the Beloved Community.''   We should heed these words in our day and age because today House  Republicans introduced their latest broadside against the fundamental  right to vote, a sweeping bill that one lawmaker called ``the most  substantive and conservative election integrity legislation that will  come before the House in over a generation.'' Let me say that again:  ``the most substantive and conservative election integrity legislation  that will come before the House in over a generation.'' Democrats here  in the Senate will never allow such a terrible proposal to become law,  and very soon, we will once again move to bring real, much needed  voting rights legislation before Congress.   People think that the attacks against democracy came and went on  January 6. Unfortunately, sadly, that is not true. In States as diverse  as Georgia, Texas, Iowa, Florida, and Arizona, partisans have rewritten  the rules of our elections in broad daylight to make it harder to  vote--harder to vote--in a democracy that, of course, for centuries has  hailed the right to vote and advanced it.   Today's bill from Republicans is the latest example of the giant step  backward the Republicans these days are taking when it comes to voting  rights, and Democrats will fiercely oppose it.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 34.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 114.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 141.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 21.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, July 10, be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from Maine (Mr. King), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr.  Manchin), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), and the Senator from  New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are necessarily absent.    First, a few words on just a good recent development. We  have just heard that Sweden will be allowed to join NATO, that Mr.  Erdogan has released his hold, and that Sweden will be joining NATO.   The fact that Sweden is joining NATO is great news for the West. It  strengthens the Western alliance significantly, and it shows Mr. Putin  that the West is strong, united, and growing stronger against his  aggression in Ukraine.   Any thought that the West is giving up, any thought that the West is  divided, is shown to be false by today's development of Sweden joining  NATO and of Turkey relenting.   So this is good news for freedom. This is good news against the  forces of autocracy, and it is very good news for a strong Western  alliance.   I want to salute President Biden, who has worked so much in the  foreign policy sphere--as well as domestic--but speaking about the  foreign policy sphere, he has done so much to advance the United  States' interests. He has a real grasp of it, a real handle on it, and  is very effective. This is victory for America, for the West, for  freedom, and for President Biden.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until  10 a.m. on Tuesday, July 11; that following the prayer and pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; following the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Small nomination postcloture; further, that all  time be considered expired at 11:30 a.m., and following the cloture  vote on the Hidalgo nomination, the Senate recess until 2:15 p.m. to  allow for the weekly caucus meetings; further, notwithstanding rule  XXII, at 2:15 p.m., the Senate vote on cloture on the Evanson  nomination; that the Senate recess from 3 p.m. until 4 p.m. to allow  for the all-Senators briefing; that at 4:30 p.m., if cloture has been  invoked on the Hidalgo or Evanson nominations, that all time be  considered expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the  nominations in the order in which cloture was invoked; finally, if any  nominations are confirmed during Tuesday's session, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:47 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, July 11, 2023, at 10 a.m.
