 Madam Speaker, I rise today to demand accountability.  Pete Buttigieg has shown he is unfit to lead the Department of  Transportation and must resign immediately.   From his first day in office, he has been more focused on diversity  training and identity politics than on building and maintaining  America's transportation system. He has abandoned his Department's  mission of improving safety, technology, and efficiency of our  infrastructure in favor of promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion  initiatives.   Case in point: The horrific train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.  Buttigieg took 10 days to acknowledge this incident and 3 weeks to show  up and support the community.   As Ohioans fled their homes and worried about their health, the  Secretary of Transportation was on TV whining about too many White  people in construction industries. His policies have continuously put  the wokes before the folks, and we are again seeing the consequences.   After seeing another Norfolk Southern train derail this weekend, I  was reminded of the fact that the company wrote to shareholders stating  that it is focused on DEI. This administration's focus on DEI is  forcing private companies to rethink their goals, and one has to  wonder, if Norfolk Southern's DEI policies are directing resources away  from the important things, like greasing wheel bearings.   This insanity must stop. Speaking of insanity, it looks like  Secretary Buttigieg is spending a lot of taxpayer money flying on  private jets, but he doesn't want the American people to know where he  is going or why.   I don't know about you, but I seem to recall a recent Health and  Human  [[Page H1157]]  Services Secretary being forced to resign over this same exact thing.   Anyway, why is the DOT refusing to tell the American people how much  Secretary Buttigieg's 23 flights on private jets have cost them?   Maybe the Secretary should just come to Capitol Hill and answer these  questions for himself. It would be a cheap trip, and it wouldn't  require airfare.   Either way, it is time for him to resign. That will allow him time to  promote wokeness and take private jets on his own dime and his own  time.                            ____________________
