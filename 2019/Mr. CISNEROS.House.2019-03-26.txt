 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Armed Services be discharged from further consideration of  the bill (S. 252) to authorize the honorary appointment of Robert J.  Dole to the grade of colonel in the regular Army, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
