 Mr. President, this always happens near the kick-the-can  funding deadlines that we are now approaching. There is controversy  surrounding what will and what will not make it into the continuing  resolution; that is, the legislation funding the government for a  finite period of time upon the expiration of a spending period.   In the House of Representatives, the debate and controversy continued  late into last night, and may well still continue later today.   Here in the Senate, there are a number of Senators, including me, who  are not inclined to give consent to expedite a funding measure that  supports and funds President Biden's unconstitutional and sweeping  vaccine mandate without holding a vote on that mandate and whether we  should fund that part of government charged with enforcing it.   Now, to be very clear about all of this, Senator Schumer, as the  majority leader, could have done this without our help if he had  started this process weeks ago or even days ago. He could have held  votes and passed this resolution without needing to ask for the help of  those of us who feel this way, who are not inclined to help him do it.   Senator Schumer is in a bind, due to his own delay and his own  denial. He is asking all of us to help him.   Now, I have offered a very simple solution, a very reasonable  solution. I am not asking that a poison pill or a pet project be  included, no. I am not asking for dramatic reforms or draconian cuts.  Far from it. I just want to vote on one amendment. I want the Members  of this body to go on record on whether they support funding--in this  bill--President Biden's vaccine mandate.   The American people have a right to know, through our votes, where we  stand and where we stand in connection with this bill, on a germane  amendment--one that pertains to that, a simple up or down, yes or no-- simple majority vote. That is all I am asking.   Let me first explain a little bit about the recent history of this  situation. While those involved in this effort have been accused by  many in elected office and in the press of brinksmanship, we have been  nothing but consistent and clear and open about our position for weeks  now--in fact, for a month.   On November 3, a group of Senators--15 of us, in fact--declared our  intentions, sending this letter to Senator Schumer. And in this letter,  we made very clear that we will ``not support--and will use all means  at our disposal to oppose--legislation that funds or in any way allows  the enforcement of President Biden's employer vaccine mandate.''   Now, 15 Senators have signed this letter. And there it is right there  in black and white--the words that I just read in that letter from a  month ago. The letter--again, written back at the beginning of  November--specifically mentions this funding deadline--the one we are  now approaching; the one that is hitting us tomorrow night--as one for  Senator Schumer and our colleagues to be aware of that we made our  intentions clear. We did so out of courtesy to the majority leader and  to those we represent: to the American people, those who will be  affected by these matters.   And now, as a matter of political convenience, he and others are  saying ``their unwillingness to come to the table,'' which is the  reason we are now approaching the deadline without an agreement,  somehow amounts to an act of brinksmanship on our part.   That portrayal is disingenuous, and it is wrong. After running out  the clock, knowingly, deliberately not coming to the table to  negotiate, and ignoring our clear, public position, Senator Schumer is  now accusing us of wanting to shut down the government because we  refuse to help him cram through a bill that we have already explicitly  stated we are against. We are providing every opportunity to avoid a  shutdown, and all we ask for is a simple up-or-down vote.   Now, I stand by the commitment I made not to support or grant consent  to pass or expedite a measure that funds, supports, or allows for the  enforcement of the President's vaccine mandates.   Now, it is true that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  has issued an order halting enforcement of the OSHA mandate, and that  OSHA has temporarily halted the enforcement of that particular mandate.  That does not in any way remove our obligation here in Congress to  protect our Constitutional role and to prevent unconstitutional  measures, laws, and regulations from afflicting the American people.   We still don't know the final outcome of that litigation. In any  event, we have an independent responsibility--constitutionally and  morally--to make sure that what we do here has our oversight and that  we don't spend money on things that most Americans find abhorrent.   Each of us did, in fact, swear an oath to the Constitution, and the  Constitution does not grant the Federal Government the authority to  implement a mandate of this sort. It just doesn't. You can search it;  you will not find that authority. The Constitution certainly does not  grant the President of the United States the authority to implement  such a mandate without the explicit authorization of the people's  elected lawmakers in Congress.   Make no mistake, this mandate is not only immoral; it is also  unconstitutional. For that reason alone, I must oppose it.   But the harms certainly don't stop with the damage that is being done  to our constitutional order. Millions of Americans are at risk of  losing their jobs due to this mandate. While court orders are offering  at least a temporary protection, these Americans are still anxiously  awaiting lasting protection from Congress, and currently could receive  at a moment's notice the final ultimatum to be vaccinated or lose their  jobs.   In fact, in fear of the huge fines that the Biden administration is  threatening against businesses that don't comply once the mandate is  enforced, many companies are already imposing these requirements on  their workers.   Countless businesses and hundreds of Utahns who are at risk of  closure or dismissal have reached out to me. Their stories are heart- wrenching. These are good people. They are our friends and our  neighbors. They are neighborhood businesses and American manufacturers,  mothers and fathers trying to get by in increasingly difficult economic  times. There are millions of them across the country. Over half a  million workers in Utah alone are at risk of unemployment due to this  mandate.   As I have said each time I have spoken on this, I am not against the  vaccine. In fact, I have gotten the vaccine. My family has gotten the  vaccine. I have encouraged people to get the vaccine. I am against the  mandate.   I recognize that these vaccines are protecting Americans from the  harms of COVID-19, and that the government has no business, no  authority, and no justification to make millions of Americans second- class, unemployable pariahs. Even if the Federal Government did have  that authority, which it  [[Page S8883]]  doesn't, the President of the United States could not exercise it  unilaterally, not without an act of Congress.   Our economic condition is increasingly dire. Inflation is becoming  long-lasting. The supply chain crisis has shown the prime value of  American workers. You know, I can't think of a worse time to kick them  to the curb.   I want to be very clear: I don't want to shut down the government.  The only thing I want to shut down is Congress's funding enforcement of  an immoral, unconstitutional vaccine mandate. However, if the choice is  between temporarily suspending nonessential functions on the one hand  and on the other hand standing idle, as up to 45 million Americans lose  their jobs, their livelihoods, and their ability to work, I will stand  with American workers every time. That is not a closed question.   I stand with American workers throughout Utah and across America. I  stand with moms and dads needing gifts and paychecks before the  holidays.   I stand by what I and others committed to as our word, that word  given a month ago without response. I won't support a continuing  resolution that funds President Biden's grievous, immoral,  unconstitutional vaccine mandate, and I just want to vote on it in  connection with this spending bill. All I am asking for is a vote. It  would take 15 minutes. We could do it right now, in fact.   If Senator Schumer wants to avoid this vote so badly that he will  shut down the government rather than hold it, he should explain why. We  can fix this situation right now. Let's hold a vote. Let's hold it  right now.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 45 million Americans, 45 million hard-working  moms and dads, neighbors, and friends are being threatened right now  with losing their jobs. They are being threatened not due to cyclical  economic conditions, not because jobs aren't available, not because of  some war or other calamity; their jobs are being threatened by their  own government--a government that has chosen to tell them if they don't  comply with a Presidential medical orthodoxy, they will be fired.   This is unfortunate. This is most unfortunate. It is most unfortunate  that this power has been exercised this way. The President doesn't have  that power. Congress hasn't given the President that power. Congress  doesn't have that power to begin with. This is not a power that belongs  in the Federal Government to begin with.   As a result of that, 45 million Americans are being threatened with  their jobs. They are being forced to choose between an unwanted medical  procedure and losing their job.   Look, I want to be very clear. I have been vaccinated. My family has  been vaccinated. I believe the development of the vaccine is something  of a modern medical miracle. I am grateful for the vaccine. I think the  vaccine is helping Americans be safe from the effects of COVID. It is  not the government's job. It is not within government's authority to  tell people that they must be vaccinated, and if they don't get  vaccinated, they will get fired.   It is wrong. It is immoral. You don't tell someone that if they don't  do exactly what you want them to do, that they are going to lose their  job. The American people overwhelmingly agree.   In fact, according to a recent Axios poll, only 14 percent of all  Americans agree with the President of the United States that if someone  declines to get the jab, they should lose their job.   Now, this is a huge percentage of the workforce in many States--most  States, in fact. Somewhere between a quarter and a third of all workers  are now being faced with the possibility of losing their job because of  these vaccine mandates. This, at a time when Americans are struggling  just to put food on the table, in part, because we have a government  that is spending too much money it doesn't have.   It is churning up money, printing it, in effect, in a way that  results in rampant inflation; in a way that makes limited paychecks go  less far, less capable of buying bread to put on the table. And amidst  all of this government-manufactured crisis, government is making it  worse; threatening to not just make that paycheck go even less far than  it already does because of government but to take it away altogether.  That is not kind; that is not the neighborly way in which we like to do  things; it is not moral; and it is not constitutional.   Look, it is tragic that this many Americans have to have their jobs  threatened as a result of a Presidential temper tantrum. There is  nothing about it that is OK. Deep down, we all know that it is not OK.   I will tell you, there is another thing that is not OK. It is not OK  that those who want to take away those jobs, those who are just fine  with the President exercising this authority fought tooth and nail to  prevent the U.S. Senate from taking the vote that we are preparing to  take tonight, a simple vote--a simple vote that simply allows us to  weigh in and decide whether or not we are going to fund that part of  government, that feature of our government that is going to enforce the  vaccine mandate.   Those in this Chamber who shamefully were refusing over and over  again to let us even cast a vote on that simple measure threatened to  shut down all of government because they didn't want to have us have a  chance, as the people's elected lawmakers, to decide whether or not we  should proceed with vaccine mandate enforcement. They would rather shut  down the government and make everything worse than they would stand  accountable for what they are doing.   Fortunately, this part of the story at least has a happy ending. We  are going to be able to vote on that tonight. We are going to be able  to vote on whether or not we fund vaccine mandate enforcement at the  Federal level.   This is wonderful. This is fantastic. It should not have resulted in  days and days of shutdown threats and days and days of deflection,  accusing other people of wanting to shut down the government when all  we wanted to do was have a vote, to give a chance to the hard-working  mom or dad, soldier, sailor, airman, or marine struggling to put food  on the table. That is all we wanted. And all they wanted to do is use  it as an excuse to deflect onto others that which they are doing.   We can do better than this. We must do better than this. The American  people deserve better than this. That is why I am so glad and grateful  that we will be casting this vote tonight.   But know this: This issue is not going away. I hope with everything  in me that when we cast this vote tonight, that a majority of us will  do the right thing and that we will vote the way that we know we should  vote; that we will stand with those people who may lose their  jobs. Thirty-one percent of the workers in my State--and in other  States, it is higher. Thirty-nine percent of the workers in West  Virginia stand to lose their jobs, 37 percent of the workers in  Alabama, 33 percent of the workers in Georgia. In State after State,  you see hard-working moms and dads being threatened.    This isn't right. It is not even an authority that the President has.  It is not authority that the Congress has. We shouldn't be doing this.  Deep down, we all know that is right. We also know that some of these  problems result from the fact that when we fund the government, we have  made significant mistakes as a result of the fact we have allowed so  many spending decisions to be concentrated in one vote on one bill,  [[Page S8905]]  such that all of government tends to be funded or none of it gets  funded.   Sometimes the only opportunity we have to weigh in on a particular  matter of public policy, one affecting 45 million American workers in  this instance--the only chance we have to do that is on a spending  bill, and we don't even get that chance unless we agree we can vote on  an amendment on that. That should never result in a shutdown threat.   When those threats are made, we should acknowledge who is making  them. Never once has any one of us wanted to shut down the government.  We wanted to give the American worker a chance for us to vote for them,  a chance for us to stand with them.   I urge--I implore--my colleagues: Please join me in voting to protect  the American worker. Don't take away the job of hard-working Americans.  Don't fire people because they are not inclined to adhere to  Presidential medical orthodoxy. Please support me in this amendment.    If you don't want to get the virus, get the vaccine.   The answer to someone not agreeing to your medical advice is not to  fire them. It sure as heck isn't to have the President of the United  States fine every employer in America that doesn't want to do this,  whether they have religious objections or otherwise. This is wrong. We  know it is wrong. We can stop this right now.   Please join me in opposing and taking down and refusing to fund for  the duration of this continuing resolution that part of government  charged with enforcing this immoral, indefensible, unconstitutional,  and illegal mandate.  [[Page S8906]]                               Vote on Amendment No. 4868
