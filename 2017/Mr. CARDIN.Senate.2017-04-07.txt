 Mr. President, I rise today to ask my Senate colleagues  to join me in designating April 2017 as National Congenital  Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Month. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia,  also known as CDH, is a birth defect that occurs when the fetal  diaphragm fails to fully develop, allowing abdominal organs to move  into the chest cavity and preventing lung growth. When the lungs do not  develop properly during pregnancy, it can be difficult for the baby to  breathe after birth or the baby is unable to take in enough oxygen to  stay healthy. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect that  occurs in 1 out of every 2,500 live births worldwide. Only about 50  percent of CDH cases are diagnosed in utero. The Center for Disease  Control & Prevention, CDC, estimates that CDH affects 1,600 babies in  the United States each year. Every 10 minutes, a baby is born with CDH,  adding up to more than 700,000 babies with CDH since 2000. According to  the CDC, babies born with CDH experience a high mortality rate ranging  from 20 to 60 percent depending on the severity of the defect and the  treatments available at delivery, yet most people have never heard of  CDH.   Researchers are making great progress to determine the cause of this  birth defect and to identify optimal treatment methods. In fiscal year  2017, the National Institutes of Health funded approximately $4 million  in CDH research, an increase of $700,000 from fiscal year 2015. There  is still much progress to be made, however. The cause of CDH remains  unknown, and there currently is no cure. CDH survivors often endure  long-term complications such as congenital heart defects and  developmental delays and the average CDH survivor will face postnatal  care of more than $100,000.   Last month, members from the Association of Congenital Diaphragmatic  Hernia Research, Awareness and Support, also known as CHERUBS, visited  my office. Among them were David and Allison Finger and their daughter  Vivienne from Hyattsville, MD. Vivienne was born with CDH and had to  spend 60 days in the newborn intensive care unit after birth and had to  have surgery to repair the hernia when she was only 3 weeks old. On  March 18, 2017, Vivienne celebrated her second birthday and is doing  very well. Babies like Vivienne, born with CDH, today have a better  chance of survival due to early detection and research on treatment  options.   For these reasons, I am proud my colleague the junior Senator from  Alabama, Senator Strange, has joined me in introducing a bill  designating April 2017 as National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia  Awareness Month. In previous years, I was pleased to work with his  predecessor; Senator Sessions, on this legislation. Designating this  month in this fashion provides an opportunity to raise public awareness  about CDH; promote quality prenatal care and ultrasounds to detect CDH  in utero; and support funding for the research necessary to improve  screening and treatment of CDH, discover the causes of CDH, and develop  a cure for CDH.
