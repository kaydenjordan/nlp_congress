 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time.   ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created  equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable  rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.'' Life.   Abortion is a termination of that life and a grave human rights  abuse, and it must end. No one has the right to end the life of an  innocent human being. The government has a duty to protect that right  to life.   Since 1973, more than 63 million unborn babies have had their lives  cut short. That is a tragedy and simply unacceptable, and I stand here  for the sake of millions of children, for the sake of the integrity of  our Nation.   Let's follow the science. Preborn humans are, in fact, humans and  deserving of life. But, unfortunately, the pro-abortion left has  decided that ``human'' doesn't automatically grant that right and that  humans should only be accorded human rights depending on their  location, level of dependency, or size.   That mindset is a travesty, and the practice of abortion will go down  in history as a great stain on this Nation.
