 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for working with  me to meet President Biden's goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore  wind  [[Page H3922]]  energy by 2030 as we transition to a clean energy economy.   While I support funding the Coast Guard, I am deeply concerned that a  provision in this bill would prevent us from meeting this imperative.  To achieve 30 gigawatts by 2030, the United States will need five to  six wind turbine installation vessels. Currently, there are only three  in the world. This provision would prevent the use of these vessels and  halt the only means we have to install and maintain wind turbines in  the short term.   Not only would this put those 30 gigawatts of clean energy out of  reach by 2030, it would also threaten thousands of good-paying union  jobs in Massachusetts. I share the chairman's goal of staffing offshore  wind projects with American workers in the long term.   Indeed, with my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Keating), I have secured funding to help train those workers, but there  will be no jobs and no offshore wind energy if this amendment is passed  and the development of offshore wind is stillborn. I ask for a  commitment to work in conference to ensure a seamless transition to  American workers that does not jeopardize access to wind turbine  installation vessels for current and future development of offshore  wind projects.
