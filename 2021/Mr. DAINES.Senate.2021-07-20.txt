 Mr. President, today, I rise to bring attention to new  revelations about President Biden's nominee to head the Bureau of Land  Management, Tracy Stone-Manning's involvement in a tree-spiking  incident in Idaho, and to share why I oppose her confirmation.   I would have welcomed having a nominee with such strong ties to  Montana to be the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, and, until  recently, I believed, as did most Montanans, based on her testimony  before the Montana State Legislature, back in 2013, that her role in  the tree-spiking crime was minimal, her actions were helpful, and she  helped bring criminals to justice.   Unfortunately, new information has revealed that this simply was not  the case. In fact, rather than bringing criminals to justice, Ms.  Stone-Manning assisted in helping them evade justice for years--for  years.   I am going to lay this out because I think it is important that the  facts are shared before this body. First, it reveals that she withheld  the truth from investigators for several years. Second, it reveals that  she harshly criticized Federal law enforcement at the very same time  she was refusing to tell them the truth. And, third, it reveals that  she has not taken responsibility or expressed remorse for not speaking  the truth much, much sooner.   I know many of my colleagues are probably just tuning into Ms. Stone- Manning's involvement in a tree-spiking crime committed in 1989 while  she was a member of an ecoterrorist group called Earth First!   The picture that she and her advocates have painted about her  involvement in this crime is that she was the innocent hero who helped  put bad people in jail. Well, in recent weeks, we have learned there is  a lot more to this story. It is very alarming. It is very disturbing on  many levels.   Ms. Stone-Manning stated to the Montana State Legislature that a  rather frightening man approached her with a letter while she was on  campus. Come to find out, that man wasn't a stranger. It was her  roommate and someone whom she described to the court during the 1993  trial as someone who was in her main circle of friends.   Ms. Stone-Manning stated that she simply mailed the anonymous  letter--that she simply mailed it. But in reality, and as we have since  found out and as we have explored court records in Idaho, this  information had not come out, except in the last 45 days.   The investigation later revealed that this letter had not only been  collaboratively composed, but after waiting for a few days, it was  typed by Ms. Stone-Manning on a rented typewriter, which, according to  her very own testimony, was because she wanted to avoid having it on  her own computer and avoid having any fingerprints that could be traced  back to her.   The words that Ms. Stone-Manning typed and mailed are explicit. It is  not what you type and send to protect people. They are what you say to  frighten people.   I am going to read this letter--it is not very long--that Ms. Stone- Manning typed on a rented typewriter and personally mailed. It says:         To Whom It May Concern:        This letter is being sent to notify you that the Post       Office Sale--    If I can add, the Post Office Sale was a timber sale. They labeled it  the ``Post Office Sale.''--       in Idaho has been spiked heavily.        The reasoning for this action is that this piece of land is       very special to the earth. It is home to the Elk, Deer,       Mountain Lions, Birds, and especially the Trees.        The project required that eleven of us spend nine days in       God awful weather conditions spiking trees. We unloaded a       total of five hundred pounds of spikes measuring 8 to 10       inches in length. The sales were marked so that no workers       will be injured and so that you assholes know that they are       spiked. The majority of trees were spiked within the first       ten feet, but many, many others were spiked as high as a       hundred and fifty feet.        I would be more than willing to pay you a dollar for the       sale, but you would have to find me first and that could be       your WORST nightmare.        Sincerely, George Hayduke        P.S. You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people       could get hurt.    The text of that letter was never made public until very recently,  just in the last 45 days. Montanans never had the opportunity to read  what Ms. Stone-Manning typed on the rented typewriter and sent until  just a few weeks ago.  [[Page S4963]]    The letter is chilling and it makes you think that, if Ms. Stone- Manning was really concerned about the tree spiking, she could have  gone to the authorities immediately in 1989, when this occurred.   We also now know she had firsthand knowledge about the perpetrators.  She knew who did it. She knew all of the details about the crime. She  knew who spiked the trees.   By the way, why do you spike trees? Why do you put these great big  spikes in the trees? That is because, if a logger comes in with a saw  and their blade hits it, they could be severely injured. If one of  these logs comes through a sawmill, the sawmill operator can be  severely injured, as has actually happened. We have had some severely  injured individuals because of the tree spiking. This was the  ecoterrorism going on several years ago.   But she withheld this information from law enforcement in 1989, even  after she was subpoenaed by a grand jury for her hair, her handwriting,  and fingerprint samples. She didn't report it to law enforcement in  1990, not in 1991, not in 1992. In fact, she condemned the FBI for  investigating her in the first place, despite the fact that she knew  all the details of the crime. In fact, she claimed being investigated  by the FBI was ``degrading'' and that the ``government does do bad  things.'' She compared her treatment to how the Government of Panama  would treat someone.   Ms. Stone-Manning said all of these things and played the victim,  despite knowing all the details and players of the crime, despite  having had the opportunity for 4 years to put bad people behind bars.  What Ms. Stone-Manning did was actively obstruct an investigation.   At no time, by the way, did Ms. Stone-Manning ever come forward from  her own volition. Now, she only came forward after there was a break in  the investigation. This is now in 1993, after another suspect  identified her involvement and after her attorney struck an immunity  deal, not before she was caught.   In fact, one of the men she had the opportunity to put behind bars  during the time she remained silent went on to commit an act of--this  man that she remained silent on went on to commit an act of domestic  violence. Her cooperation with law enforcement could have prevented  this.   None of her actions show any kind of remorse. They didn't then and  they still don't now. Ms. Stone-Manning has not expressed regret for  her false and disparaging characterization of Federal investigators.   This deception and misrepresentation of her involvement, coupled with  her clear violation of Senate Ethics rules while she served as a U.S.  Senate staffer, leave the public with no reason to trust her judgment,  her leadership capabilities, or her ability to remain pragmatic when  making decisions on behalf of the Bureau of Land Management.   Ms. Stone-Manning has lost her credibility, and to move forward with  her nomination would cause more controversy and distrust for the  leadership at the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Senate, and the  Biden administration.   You see, there are 10,000 employees at the Bureau of Land Management  who report to the Director and they need to have that trust, as well.   President Obama's former Director of the Bureau of Land Management,  Bob Abbey, has concluded that Stone-Manning's ``questionable past''  brings what he said ``needless controversy'' to the Agency. Obama's  very own Director of the Bureau of Land Management said that her  involvement in the tree-spiking crime should disqualify Stone-Manning  and the Biden administration needs a new nominee.   I agree with Mr. Abbey because, in Montana and the West and all  America, we need a Director of the Bureau of Land Management who can  garner public trust, bring folks together, and lead with integrity.   Throughout the confirmation process, I have given Ms. Stone-Manning a  fair shake, an opportunity to answer questions about important policies  that impact our Montana way of life. However, over the course of the  last few weeks, this new information has come to light and has led me  to now actively and publicly oppose her nomination.   The controversy surrounding this nomination is not and should not be  about party-line politics. Montanans care about trusting those in  public service, about integrity. The public trust surrounding Ms.  Stone-Manning has been wrecked. Her ability to be the Director that the  Bureau of Land Management needs has been compromised beyond repair.   As this nomination draws more attention and some continue to contend  that her actions were commendable, I hope all my colleagues will give  full consideration to the facts laid out here today. I urge my  colleagues, especially those who represent western States, to join me  opposing this nomination. I would urge the Biden administration to pull  Ms. Stone-Manning's nomination. Nominate someone to lead the Agency who  can garner the public trust and one who can lead the Agency without the  significant controversy   I yield the floor.
