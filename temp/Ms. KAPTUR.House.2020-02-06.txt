 Mr. Speaker, today's passage of the Protecting the Right  to Organize Act is a major victory for the American worker.   Nationwide, millions of Americans work full-time jobs yet earn  unsustainable wages and little to no benefits. Too many people work  multiple jobs yet struggle to make ends meet while they watch the stock  market and their executives, who, together, make millions upon  millions.   But by restoring balance to the gutted National Labor Relations Act,  the PRO Act will restore the collective voice and dignity of American  workers from all backgrounds, no matter the color of their collar.   The PRO Act includes meaningful, enforceable penalties for union- busting companies and executives. It restores workers' ability to stand  together by weakening States' antilabor right-to-work laws and closes  loopholes that corporations use to exploit workers. Most importantly,  it strengthens workers' right to free and fair union elections and  requires corporations to respect the results.   American workers are the living fabric and backbone of our country  and economy and the future of our prosperity. They deserve the power to  stand together and advocate for themselves. The PRO Act is the pathway  to that power.                            ____________________
