 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday the National Defense Strategy  Commission released its report after about a year of study for the  defense needs of the United States and our future requirements for  defense strategy and funding of that strategy. I had the honor of  serving on that commission during the time that preceded my current  presence in the U.S. Senate.   The Commission was appointed by the chairmen and ranking members of  the House and Senate Armed Services Committee. There were six appointed  from each of the two bodies, so a total of 12, and it was a division  equally between Republicans and Democrats. I was privileged to have  been appointed by my predecessor, Senator John McCain.   The commission is chaired by Ambassador Eric Edelman and Admiral Gary  Roughead, Retired, and it included defense experts who had served in  Congress, who had served in the intelligence community, the diplomatic  community, and the military. There was one former political person-- myself. As I said, we were tasked with the job of studying our National  Defense Strategy and providing recommendations to the Secretary of  Defense and to the Congress about our future courses of action.   The Commission worked very hard to review all of the pertinent  information related to the formation of the Trump administration  National Defense Strategy, which had been issued earlier in the year.  This effort included examining the assumptions, the missions, the force  posture, the structure, as well as strategic and military risks  associated with the execution of that National Defense Strategy.   The Commission particularly focused on threats to the United States  and the size and shape of the force required to deter and, if  necessary, defeat these threats. It focused on the readiness of our  force, the posture and capabilities of the force, and the allocation of  resources. It also examined the strategic and military risks that  informed the development of both the National Defense Strategy and the  National Security Strategy.   This Commission has demonstrated that, even in Washington, DC, it is  possible to get a genuinely bipartisan consensus on something--in this  case, our  [[Page S6971]]  consensus on United States' national security. We agreed that, for  example, budget-driven strategies that assume too much risk will cost  us more in the long run than properly funded strategies based on the  realistic assessment of the current strategic environment. That is kind  of a long way of saying that what this bipartisan commission concluded,  on a consensus basis--no dissenting views at all--was that we risk more  by proceeding with the rebuilding of our military constrained by budget  requirements than if we were to increase the budget for defense  spending and eliminate the impediments to sensible acquisition, such as  the continuing resolution and the sequestration requirements that  Congress has been engaged in over the past several years.   What this Commission said, in stark headlines, is that the United  States faces a national emergency. It concluded, in very stark terms,  that we might lose a war with China or Russia, and that the only way to  avoid this is to adequately fund the strategy that the Secretary of  Defense has set out. His prioritization, the Commission concluded, is  exactly right: We have to change from focusing solely or primarily on  fighting a war in the Middle East or conflicts with terrorists, and  instead change to focusing on the threats that are posed by potential  adversaries--Russia and China. If we have the capability of dealing  with those threats by deterring them or, if necessary, defeating them,  then we should also have the ability to deal with terrorism, to deal  with North Korea and deal with Iran, but our first priority needs to be  to focus on China and on Russia.   The NDS Commission report argues:         The U.S. military could suffer unacceptably high casualties       and loss of major capital assets in its next conflict. It       might struggle to win, or perhaps lose a war against China       or Russia. The United States is particularly at risk of       being overwhelmed should its military forces be required       to fight on two or more fronts simultaneously.    Some might oppose such strong wording, but the Commission believed we  had to be able to talk honestly about the state of our military  preparedness and our national security.   As Ambassador Edelman, Chairman of the Commission, stated, ``It is  probably more dangerous to tell ourselves and other people that we're  going to be able to do these things when, in fact, we aren't able to do  them because we're not paying for them.''   The object of a strong military is to deter conflict from ever  occurring. You do that by demonstrating you are able to prevail in a  conflict if necessary. You have to have the capability of defeating any  adversary you might face. If you have that capability, those  adversaries are less likely to miscalculate, to assume they might be  able to advance their parochial interests without a pushback from the  United States, NATO, or our other allies, and they come to this belief  if they examine their capabilities against ours and determine we are  lacking in the ability to stop them.   What this report says is that we have to get serious about rebuilding  our military, or we run the risk of bad actors in the world deciding  they can take a chance that we will not respond.   Let me summarize what this report says. Again, I can't emphasize this  too much. I know it is Washington, DC. I know we are talking about  difficult issues here, but these 12 Democrats and Republicans, equally  divided, reached a conclusion, a consensus, about what we need to do,  and we are willing to speak very strongly about it. It is possible for  Democrats and Republicans to get together on something in this city,  and I am hoping my colleagues in the House and in the Senate will  approach the issues in the same bipartisan spirit that characterized  the deliberations of the Commission.   Here is the summary:   First, we are in a state of national emergency. For the first time  since the end of the Cold War, the United States is at risk of losing a  war against these peer competitors--that is a euphemism for China and  Russia.   Second, there is a bipartisan consensus that Congress must provide  predictable and sufficient funding for the Department of Defense to  execute the strategy it has developed--the National Defense Strategy.  This means Congress must undo sequestration, which is the provision in  law that says that if we don't meet certain budget requirements, all  Departments of the government, including the Department of Defense,  have to cut right off the top an equal percentage of funding in order  to get back to those budget levels. For the Defense Department, it is  impossible to both provide for our national security and comply with  that requirement, so sequestration has to end.   We have to return to the regular order of appropriating funding for  the Department of Defense on an annual basis at the beginning of each  fiscal year so the Pentagon can do the planning necessary and the  people who provide the weaponry and other products to the Defense  Department can plan adequately for the development and production of  these items on a sensible basis, on a basis that enables them to  calculate in the future how much money they will have over the period  of time they need. We can't do that if, instead, we continue to operate  on what are called continuing resolutions, where Congress throws up its  hands sometime in the late summer and says: We are never going to agree  on how much to fund the various Departments of government, including  the Department of Defense. Let's just agree to continue to do the same  amount of spending we did last year on the same things.   Think about that in your family budget. Each year, instead of trying  to figure out what you are going to need this year--and it is going to  be a little different from last year--you say: We will just spend the  same amount we spent last year on the same things. It is a very  illogical way and it is a very detrimental way for us to provide for  our national defense.   The third thing the Commission recommended is that we have to  increase the top line or the total amount of money spent on defense  over the next several years if we are going to truly rebuild our  military. Last year, a deal was struck in which we agreed to a 2-year  funding for the Department of Defense that staunched the flow of blood  from the inadequate funding of years previous. All it did was to  temporarily provide funds, primarily to increase our readiness. It did  not provide enough to rebuild our military. It provided enough to start  the journey, which may take us 15 or 20 years, but that is how long,  with increased funding, it will take to do the job.   We concluded that we ignore the issues at our peril, that today our  adversaries undermine U.S. goals on a daily basis and that continued  neglect of our defense capabilities puts our Nation at risk.   What are the specific conclusions? This report reports that America's  military superiority has ``eroded to a dangerous degree'' and that the  United States is in a ``crisis of national security.'' It says that  ``the United States is particularly at risk of being overwhelmed should  its military be forced to fight on two or more fronts simultaneously.''   In other words, we are in a state of national emergency, and this  country is at risk of actually being defeated by Russia or China should  we find ourselves in conflict with them. Nobody is predicting a war  today or even tomorrow, but we have seen the nationalistic designs that  China has in its region of the world, and we have seen repeated efforts  by Vladimir Putin's Russia to advance its sphere of influence,  particularly in Eastern Europe--the taking of Crimea, the invasion of  Ukraine, the shooting down of a civilian airliner, the use of chemical  agents--prohibited by treaties, by the way--on foreign soil to deal  with people with whom it disagrees. Somebody has likened Vladimir Putin  to the burglar in a hotel who walks down the hallway pushing on each  door until he finds one that is not locked so he can go in and  burglarize. He is an opportunist who takes advantage of weakness. The  last thing we want to do is to suggest to him that we would not or  could not respond to actions he takes. In other words, to prevent him  from miscalculating, we have to deter conduct that could lead to  conflict.    The way the Russian military doctrine works these days is, it starts  with a hybrid war. It is not a fighting war to begin with. It is done  through cyber attacks, through propaganda, through actions that perhaps  utilize contractors rather than the Russian military  [[Page S6972]]  to go into another country so that they have plausible deniability  until they have achieved their initial goals and then have the Russian  military move into the area and even potentially, according to Russian  doctrine, use nuclear weapons. They would do this on a tactical basis  to do what they call escalate to deescalate--in other words, to suggest  to NATO, the United States, and other allies that our responding to  that attack could lead to a nuclear conflagration.   The Russians have the tactical weapons. They have 10 times more than  we do, so they can use them on a battlefield and then say: Look, we  have taken the territory we want to take. We are done for now, and you  just need to leave us alone rather than getting involved in this  conflict.   That is the kind of way we could be drawn into a conflict even though  there is not a big army attack or air attack to begin such a conflict.  It is the escalation ladder where tactical nuclear weapons might be  used, and then it is up to the United States to decide what to do next.   This is the kind of thing in which miscalculation can occur. The  United States has to persuade countries like Russia and China that they  shouldn't begin the process of calculating whether they could defeat us  with the assumption that we wouldn't or couldn't respond. That is what  deterrence is all about. Nobody wants war, but you prevent war by  demonstrating to the aggressor that it is not worth it for that  aggressor to start the conflict, that he is going to lose more than he  can potentially gain.   We don't get to define whether we have adequate deterrence; that is  defined by our potential adversary. What do they think we can do? In  the past several years, both the Chinese and Russians have gone to  school on the United States and the way we conduct our military  activities, for example, in the Middle East, in Afghanistan. They  understand our strengths and weaknesses. They have been spending a lot  of money on research and development and readiness and weapon  acquisition and doctrine to take advantage of our weaknesses in an  asymmetrical way in order to defeat us if there should ever be a  conflict between us.   The Chinese have put a lot, for example, into their space-based  capabilities, trying to knock the United States out of space so that  our satellites can't tell our weapons where to fire or tell our troops  how to get where they need to go.   The Russians are very good in cyber activity. They would like to be  able to deny us the ability to communicate with each other and to do  the other things we rely upon through cyber space. They have developed  very capable modern technology and weaponry that in some cases is much  better than ours. They have the ability to deny us access to  battlefields through their long-range air defenses, for example. The  United States no longer has superiority in all military fields. We can  expect not to have air superiority, for example, in a conflict with  Russia.   These are problems that have to be remedied, and they can't be  remedied overnight. What our Commission concluded is that we have to  recognize the potential threat. The reason our adversaries have  developed the kinds of weapons and doctrine they have is because they  want to be prepared in the event of conflict between us. We are not  going to start a conflict, but we want to make sure they don't  miscalculate and start one, and that starts with having a military that  they understand is sufficient to defeat them. That is what real  deterrence is all about.   This report should not be understood as a criticism of the Secretary  of Defense or of the Defense Department. It is true that we say there  are areas that need improvement, but Secretary Mattis knows as well as  anyone what the nature of this threat is. He is able to say ``I will  make do with what the Congress gives us,'' but I don't think he is able  to say ``I know in my heart that will be sufficient.'' In fact, earlier  this year, he warned us that ``our competitive edge has eroded in every  domain of warfare--air, land, sea, space, and cyber. The combination of  rapidly changing technology, the negative impact on military readiness  resulting from the longest continuous period of combat in our Nation's  history, and a prolonged period of unpredictable and insufficient  funding, created an overstretched and under-resourced military.'' He  has recognized the problem.   I think it is up to the Congress to respond to his recognition of the  problem and to the report of this bipartisan Commission. We have all  heard plenty about the results of this underfunding. We have seen  aircraft that aren't able to fly or they crash. We have seen Navy ships  that collide with each other and other kinds of catastrophes that have  befallen our military. Today, our military is the smallest it has been  since 1940, since before World War II. We face munition shortages. We  obviously need to refresh our wornout troops and equipment. There are  urgent requirements to modernize our nuclear deterrent--the deterrent  that says to the Russians or the Chinese, for example, and in the  future North Korea and perhaps Iran: Don't even think about a nuclear  conflict with us. We have the ability to destroy you. We are in the  process of modernizing that, and it is going to take a long time and a  lot of money to do that.    Defense spending is near historic lows. We think that because last  year we made a deal to slightly increase it for a 2-year period of time  that we solved the problem. That is not true. As a share of the Federal  budget and the national economy, we are spending at near historic lows  on defense. We now have enough evidence to know that mindless spending  cuts, as would be required by sequestration, for example, don't make  the Department of Defense more efficient. There are always savings to  be had in the Department of Defense, but that is not the way to achieve  them. In fact, informing the larger drivers of the Pentagon's budget  would actually require legislative changes that the Congress has been  unwilling to make. So let's put the burden where it lies, and that is  on Congress, to fix a lot of these problems.   Between the fiscal years 2012 and 2019, the Department of Defense  will have sustained $539 billion in cuts over the budget plan proposed  by Secretary Gates in the year 2010. So Secretary Gates said: Here is  our 20-year plan, and we are almost half way through that plan, and we  have already suffered almost half a trillion dollars in cuts over what  he said we would need. If defense spending continues at the planned  rate through 2021, it will take another 19 years to reverse all of the  Budget Act cuts that occurred as a result of sequestration. Obviously,  we have work to do.   I have talked about the threat. Let me just mention a couple of other  points that we made in the report. We commented on the Defense  Department's national security report--the National Defense Strategy,  which was published in 2017--and it actually helped to make this case  for us. It argued that we face ``an extraordinarily dangerous world,''  and that threats ``have intensified in recent years.'' We face a world  where ``China and Russia challenge American power,'' where ``the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Islamic Republic of Iran  are determined to destabilize regions,'' and where transnational threat  groups ``are actively trying to harm Americans.''   So when I speak to China and Russia, I don't mean to demean the  threats posed by other actors like North Korea and Iran or the  terrorists who continue to threaten us. I am simply noting the most  serious threat should conflict arise. This focus on China and Russia, I  think, is prudent because both countries, as I said, have extensively  modernized their forces, including their nuclear weapons arsenals, and  they have routinely taken actions that threaten, coerce, and intimidate  others in the region.   For the last 17 years most of our forces have been organized, manned,  trained, and equipped to fight smaller scale wars in Iraq and  Afghanistan. I think in the meantime some of our planners have  forgotten how to plan and operationalize large-scale military  conflicts. This we have to relearn while we still have time.   Our adversaries are not waiting, as I said. They don't face similar  fiscal constraints as we do. I was asked the other evening: Well, isn't  it true that we spend a lot more in our military than Russia and China  do? The answer is that this isn't even an apples-and-oranges  comparison. We are honest about  [[Page S6973]]  our budget and transparent. We put out in the public what our  intelligence community topline budget is. The Russians and Chinese  don't do that. They hide as much as they can. They don't pay their  forces the way we do, and 70 percent of our defense budget is for our  forces--our manpower--in the pay and benefits and healthcare they need.  We don't have the combined industrial base with the military that the  Chinese do, for example, and that the Russians do. What we spend is all  out there. They can hide a lot of their spending in the activities of  their industrial companies that are doing the work of the Chinese army,  for example. So that is not a valid comparison.   I will just conclude this way. I was in the Congress for 26 years. I  served on the House Armed Services Committee. I came to the Senate and  served on numerous commissions and task forces--in the Intelligence  Committee, for example, for 8 years, which looked into the threats that  we face and what we need to do about those threats. I led efforts  dealing with our strategic deterrent, our nuclear modernization effort,  and I was sobered by the evidence that we received as a member of the  National Defense Strategy Commission. I was taken aback. I had not been  in the Senate for 5 years. I hadn't had the advantage of classified  briefings on the status of our adversaries' efforts and our own, and I  was shocked at the degree to which we have lost the advantage that we  used to have. I shared the concerns with my colleagues that this could  lead potential adversaries to miscalculate, to think that they could  make moves that wouldn't be resisted by the United States because we  don't have the capability any more to do that. That has to change if we  are to avoid war.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues in the days and weeks to come to  review this Commission report, to think about it in terms of a  consensus document between Republicans and Democrats, who unanimously  agreed that it was critical to tell the American people the truth--that  we have a severe crisis in this country--and to recognize that we, the  Congress--the House and the Senate--have the first obligation to do  something about this by setting the policy through our National Defense  Authorization Acts and then funding those policies adequately through a  series of eliminating sequestration, funding through the regular order  appropriation process, rather than continuing resolutions, and  increasing the topline budget for the military enough to make up the  gap that we discuss in this report here.   That effort will begin with an administration in the development of  its budget, which is underway right now and will be submitted to the  Congress in the early spring. I urge the administration, as well, to  recognize that its leadership in this effort will have a lot to do with  the success of Congress stepping up to do its job to fund that budget  adequately.   So to my colleagues who are concerned about our national security-- and who isn't--and to those who said during the last campaign that we  want to work across the aisle to solve problems that confront the  American people, well, I can't think of a more serious problem than  this. This is a great opportunity to roll up our sleeves and work  together. I pledge to work with my colleagues to do exactly that and  commend to them this report of the National Defense Strategy Commission  to review during the Thanksgiving break we are going to have here and  to come back ready to do work.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
