 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Robert Powell  Holding, III, of Wilmington, North Carolina. Thomas Jefferson once  said, ``God who gave us life gave us liberty.''   North Carolina is fortunate to have an embodiment of this American  spirit in Robert Holding, III, who is continuing his battle against  pancreatic cancer by working on a new E.A. Morris/Robert P. Holding  Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I first met Robert, or ``Robbie'', as so many of his  closest friends and family in our home county of Johnston call him,  when I was a teenager working on our family farm during the summers.   He drove up in his pickup, with his wrist resting on top of the  steering--the window rolled down, of course. I don't know how I can  recall that detail so vividly and not remember the exact year, but I  think I was about 13 or 14.   He had stopped by the shop there at the farm to visit with my uncle  for a bit. They talked weather and the crops and the latest news in the  county for a good 30 minutes, maybe longer.                                time  1030    Now, that wasn't the first time I had seen a neighboring farmer come  by in their pickup to talk, but it was the first time I had ever met a  Holding. I had heard about the family for years--arguably the most  influential family in Johnston County and eastern North Carolina--but I  had never met one until that day. Years later we would be neighbors at  McGee's Crossroads in Johnston County and in Wilmington as well.   Former U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth said it best when he wrote about  Robert Holding: Robert, you are one of the strongest people of faith I  know. Lauch went on: I remember launching my campaign in your living  room. You have been in the top leadership for Reagan in 1980, Senator  Jesse Helms, myself, Senator Dole, and others.   My dear friend and former Congressman George Holding added: I watched  my older brother work hard for years, building businesses in  manufacturing, media, real estate, and finance. And I watched him  tirelessly give back to his family and community.   I have personally seen firsthand how Robert Holding's hard work,  mentoring, and insightful mind inspires others. He has helped make our  State and Nation a much better place.   From the Nutcracker Company to vice president of promotional  wholesale; from founder and CEO of Carolantic Communications and RP  Industries; to founding Reedy Branch Farms, Robert has worked to be a  contributor to his community.   From founder and CEO of Allied Communications, Delta Broadcasting and  WKFT-TV, to CFB Construction Company, Jefferson Marketing, RP Holding  Realty, the Coalition for Freedom, and the Vance Young Team at  Intracoastal Realty, Robert has provided love, leadership, and jobs to  employees and owners.   From Americans for Reagan to Helms, Faircloth, Dole, Leo Daughtry,  the Congressional Club, and so many others, Robert Holding is a  visionary business leader who stands for what he believes.   You can see his kind heart in how he continues to give back to our  community locally through his nonprofit work, and by his help to  champion to E.A. Morris Cancer Center at Duke University. He is helping  lead projects in Johnston County to strengthen Providence Presbyterian  Church, expand LifeSpring Academy, and support Friendship Baptist  Church, as well as his work with the Wilmington Boys and Girls Club,  and leadership of Monday night Bible study.   He has also worked tirelessly to champion wildlife conservation  across North Carolina with legendary conservationist Eddie Bridges. His  vision for the Eddie C. Bridges, Robert P. Holding Black Creek Youth  for Christ Wildlife Habitat Conservation Grounds will help future  generations value our amazing natural sources.   Like his father and grandfather before him, Robert Holding, III, is  an example of the American spirit that makes this country great; the  spirit of faith, family, and community; the spirit to be the best we  can be and to help others.   God bless you, Robert, and thank you. May God bless your wife, Pam;  your children, Bob and Amy; your six grandchildren; your brothers,  Frank and George; your sister, Jane; and all those whose lives you  continue to touch.   Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to know Robert and to recognize him  today.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Michigan for  yielding.   With Veterans Day just around the corner, I am pleased to join my  colleagues to honor the brave men and women who valiantly answered the  call of duty to serve and protect the United States.   In North Carolina, we have a rich tradition of military service, and  we are blessed to have a large community of veterans in the Seventh  Congressional District. It is because of their selflessness and heroism  that the United States remains free and continues to be the greatest  light for liberty mankind has ever known.   Their families have devoted just as much to this noble cause. Over  the past year and a half many of our citizens across this great land  have struggled with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but none have  been more affected than our veterans and their families.   Those veterans who have seen the horrors of war carry scars. Some are  physical scars; others are emotional scars. Mental health has always  been a need for many, given what they have been through. The botched  withdrawal from Afghanistan has further exacerbated that mental anguish  for so many who have served.   This is why now, more than ever, it is important that Congress pay  tribute to our country's servicemembers and our veterans. It is also  important for them to know that America supports them. To every veteran  across this great land and their loved ones, we thank you and we are  forever indebted to you. It is my honor to serve as a voice for North  Carolina veterans in Congress, and I will continue to support vital  measures to honor, provide support, and deliver results for our  Nation's heroes. May God always bless them.
