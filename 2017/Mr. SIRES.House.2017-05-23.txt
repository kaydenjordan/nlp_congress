 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Florida. I want to  commend her for her passion and her commitment to helping the people of  Venezuela. I thank her for making me part of this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the ongoing crisis in Venezuela.  With every week that passes, we see the situation in Venezuela becoming  more critical.                                time  1930    A country with the world's largest known oil reserves is spiraling  into a collapsed state where people are struggling just to survive.  Journalists and citizens risk their lives every day to report what is  happening inside Caracas and around the country. We see that tensions  are growing, and government security forces shoot first and don't even  bother to ask questions later.   Maduro continues to keep political prisoners like Leopoldo Lopez  under lock and key to send a strong message to those trying to question  his actions. Just yesterday, we saw reports that government buildings  in western Venezuela are being set ablaze. Make no mistake: It is the  failed Chavismo policies and the authoritarian actions of Nicolas  Maduro that have brought all of this pain and suffering upon the  Venezuelan people.   Press reports show that of 800,000 businesses that opened during the  Chavez regime, nearly 600,000 have shut down. Both the Obama and Trump  administrations have sanctioned senior officials in the Venezuelan  Government for their associations with narcotrafficking, money  laundering, and other illicit activities.   Just today, Reuters released an exclusive report that the Venezuelan  Government is in possession of 5,000 shoulder-launched surface-to-air  missiles that are typically used to shoot down low-flying planes and  helicopters.   Last week, Spanish authorities interdicted a shipment of 6 tons of  cocaine from Venezuela en route to their shores. With the recent  sanctions of Vice President Tareck El Aissami, under the Kingpin Act,  it has become clear that Venezuela's Government is  [[Page H4499]]  acting as a narco-state and facilitating the shipment of narcotics  throughout the region. These sanctions are not against the Venezuelan  people but are carefully crafted and targeted towards the individuals  who are committed to destroying the lives of millions of innocent  civilians in exchange for money and power.   Last week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned members of  Venezuela's Supreme Court for their rulings that stripped power away  from the National Assembly, further consolidating Maduro's  authoritarian regime. Maduro and his cronies continue to get rich as  they traffic money and drugs while doing nothing to help the millions  of suffering people in Venezuela. They continue to loot the country as  reports regarding the worsening situation continue to make front-page  news throughout the region. Maduro's tactics are making it impossible  to survive.   Multiple news reports confirm a growing health crisis as people lack  access to basic medicines, and infant mortality rates and preventable  diseases such as diptheria, malaria, and the Zika virus are all on the  rise. In addition, nearly every day we hear of young children whose  lives are cut short, whether it is from a bullet from Maduro's thugs or  the lack of access to food, water, and basic services.   That is why I am grateful for the efforts of my colleagues here  tonight who have supported several initiatives in Congress that work to  hold these thugs accountable. My colleagues and I have held hearings,  sent letters, and met with our allies in the region to work together to  try to bring sound relief to the Venezuelan people.   Meanwhile, instead of focusing on the economy, Maduro is staging mock  military exercises and stoking fears by spreading propaganda of U.S.- led invasion.   The truth about Maduro is clear, and the international community is  starting to unify against him. The OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro  has wisely called for Venezuela's suspension from the OAS unless it  frees its political prisoners, accepts humanitarian aid, and holds  elections without delay.   I believe we need to work together with our allies around the world  and continue to insist Maduro abide by international norms and give the  Venezuelan people the freedom they deserve.   I thank my dear friend from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and the  other Members here tonight for their relentless commitment to these  important issues.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Sires for such an eloquent  statement on behalf of the beleaguered and embattled Venezuelan people.   Before I yield so proudly to Mr. Castro of Texas, another member of  our Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I would like to say just a few  words about the continuing human rights abuses and the deteriorating  situation in Venezuela.   As we have heard from Mr. Sires, we are dealing with a corrupt  dictatorship, and we are dealing with a brutal dictatorship. At least  42 are dead and 90 arrested since protests began in March of 2017, you  can see on this poster.   This is a dictatorship that will go to all lengths to maintain its  tight grip on power and silence the opposition by tear gas, by real  bullets, by jailing, and by intimidation. The people of Venezuela are  literally dying, Mr. Speaker, on the streets from the violence of the  Maduro regime. They are dying on the streets from starvation, and they  are dying from the lack of medical supplies, yet they still risk their  lives.   This goes on each and every day in Venezuela. They go out into the  streets. They demonstrate to the world that they will not be silenced,  and what they desire is freedom, and what they desire is democracy, and  what they desire is nothing less and nothing more than their God-given  human rights, the very same intangibles that many in America here take  for granted because we live in the greatest country in the world. We  take for granted that we have our freedom.   But the ideals that we proudly espouse and defend around the world  are alive and well in the streets of Venezuela. Venezuelans are  protesting against the regime's continual assaults on Venezuela's  constitutional and democratic order.   Like Chavez before him, Nicolas Maduro has a horrific human rights  record, including restrictions on freedom of expression, restrictions  on the press, widespread arbitrary detentions, extrajudicial killings,  torture, and the list goes on and on.   In its human rights reports on Venezuela last year, our own State  Department noted how the Maduro regime has misused the judiciary to  undermine the National Assembly, a body overwhelmingly manipulated by  the opposition since December of 2015. This opposition has risen to  power thanks to the vote of the people.   So what did Nicolas Maduro say? Well, his supreme court nullified  almost every action taken by the National Assembly, including refusing  to allow lawmakers to take their seats in the legislature and  overturning laws to free political prisoners and grow the economy.   I am so pleased to see that we have been joined by the chairman of  the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Mr. Duncan, tonight.   But things have only gotten worse since that time. In March, the  regime controlled the Supreme Tribunal of Justice--a sad name for what  it does--and ruled that it would resume the responsibilities of the  National Assembly. It said: We are the state. Who needs the National  Assembly that is manipulated and controlled by the opposition? We  nullify its actions. We will assume the responsibility.   And although what the Tribunal said, they had to backtrack almost  immediately because the condemnation internationally was so loud. It  partially reversed its decision just a few days later, but the damage  was already done, Mr. Speaker. Venezuelans had further proof of a break  in the constitutional order.   Anti-regime protests have been going on, as we can see here, day  after day, day after day, as hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have  taken to the streets to demand relief from the Maduro repression.  According to The New York Times, before these protests even began, Mr.  Speaker, the Maduro regime had arrested 6,893 people, jailed 433 for  political reasons just in the past few years, and there are at least  175 political prisoners behind bars today, including Leopoldo Lopez and  Daniel Ceballos.   Joshua Holt, a United States citizen, Mr. Speaker, is being unjustly  held for nearly a year. In September, I wrote a letter, joined by my  colleagues here, to the State Department about Joshua's case. Joshua  Holt's health has deteriorated over the last month. I urged the State  Department to secure his unconditional release on humanitarian grounds.  We all were humbled to meet with Joshua Holt's mom, who is so anxious  to see his release, just last month.   So, Mr. Speaker, despite all of the Maduro regime's human rights  abuses, the beatings, the violence, the murders, the repression, and  the political prisoners, despite all of this, the Venezuelan people are  refusing to be silenced. They are rising up, and they are protesting in  even greater numbers. This is just amazing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro), my  good friend from the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I want to take this moment to thank my  colleague and my chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee for  always being present on all the important issues, human rights issues  in the Western Hemisphere.   And of course, I want to thank my colleague from Florida, Ileana Ros- Lehtinen, for her passion and determination to bring democracy to  Venezuela.   Before I recognize my good friend from Florida, Mario Diaz-Balart, I  would just like to say that Venezuela basically has taken a page out of  the Castro brothers. This is how the process in Cuba started. Fifty- five years later, there is nothing but oppression, no freedom of  expression, no election, and, quite frankly, there are approximately  about 30,000 Cubans in Venezuela running the security apparatus.   But I want the Venezuelan people to know that we are fighting along  with them, that we are talking to all the Presidents, all the leaders  in the Western Hemisphere, to put pressure on Venezuela to develop the  democracy and stop the abuse of human rights in Venezuela.   At this time, I yield to my good friend from Florida (Mr. Diaz- Balart), who is also a fighter for human rights and who has been always  in the forefront of human rights in the Western Hemisphere.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, let me first start by thanking the  leadership, the steadfast, never confused leadership of Congressman  Albio Sires. He is a man who I have had the privilege of traveling with  to Eastern Europe, where he is known there, as he is in the United  States, for one who is always fighting for those who are repressed,  oppressed around the world; which is why the people of Venezuela know  that they can count on Congressman Albio Sires for his leadership.   Thank you, sir, for never giving up, never fighting, never forgetting  those who are struggling under repression. You mentioned Congresswoman  Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. She is a giant, a giant in the Halls of Congress,  a giant for not only things that obviously affect us here domestically,  because she is fighting for those, particularly those who are the least  fortunate in our society.   But if there is somebody who is known internationally as a fighter  for those who, again, are struggling for freedom, it is Ileana Ros- Lehtinen.   I thank you also, Mr. Sires, for mentioning the chairman of the  Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. We just heard from him, a person who,  again, is on the same track of always making sure that the--he makes  the United States look good by never forgetting human rights as a  fundamental pillar of our foreign policy.   The people of Venezuela are demonstrating that they are, in fact, the  heirs of Simon Bolivar. They are showing now, with 50 days of  consecutive demonstrations in the streets, that they are not willing to  accept repression. They are not willing to accept any more of this  dictatorship; that they are not willing to accept, as Mr. Sires  mentioned, in essence, a takeover from the Cuban regime of their  beautiful country of Venezuela.   And they are suffering because of that activism, that bravery of  hitting the streets. About almost 50 of them have been murdered since  this last number of demonstrations have taken place, not to mention the  dozens upon dozens of political prisoners, whether it is political  leaders, mayors, et cetera, who are in prison just because they are not  willing to stand by while their country has been taken over by this  horrendous, narco-terrorist, murderous dictatorship.   Frankly, I am here to commend the Venezuelan people and, as Mr. Sires  said, to let them know that they are not alone, that we stand with  them, that the United States Congress stands with them.   But I would be remiss if I didn't end as I started, Mr. Speaker, by  thanking these individuals who have spoken already: the giant of human  rights in the House of Representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the  chairman of the subcommittee, who never gets confused, and who is  always fighting for those who are struggling to regain or gain their  freedom; and yes, Albio Sires, who I have had the privilege of seeing,  not only who he is recognized here in this Congress by his colleagues  as a true freedom fighter for human rights, but I have been able to  travel with him and see that whenever you go anywhere with Albio Sires,  he is also recognized around the world as that champion for freedom.   So what a privilege to be part of and to be able to spend this time  with you. Thanks to each and every one of you for not forgetting the  struggle of Venezuela. I know that you have done it in your committee,  you have done it in your subcommittee, and this Congress is grateful,  and this Member of Congress is grateful for your leadership.   And I know that the Venezuelan people who are showing incredible  bravery know, and history will record that, in their toughest moments,  when they were putting their lives on the line, all of you, and this  Congress, stood with them.   So with that, thank you, Mr. Sires, for yielding to me.    Thank you, Congressman. Thank you for all your passion and  all your effort on behalf of those people who need it the most, the  people in Venezuela.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to end by saying, you know, I remember  years ago when Spain went through 39 years of dictatorships in the  Franco era. And one of the things that happened that was able to  develop democracy in Spain was the fact that all the European countries  got together and helped and assisted in developing a democracy in  Spain. I think the same thing needs to happen in this region.                                time  2000    The countries of our Venezuela have to demand that Venezuela release  its political prisoners, that it has free elections, and stop the human  rights abuses. After all, it is in their best interest that a stable  Venezuela is good for a stable region.   Mr. Speaker, I thank very much my colleague, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,  always for her passion on this issue. She is the little giant of human  rights in this Congress. I thank her and my colleague, Mario Diaz- Balart.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
