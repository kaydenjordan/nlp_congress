 Mr. President, last night, the Senate agreed to pass a  short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open through  early February.   With less than 2 days to go until the appropriations lapse, if we are  to avoid a shutdown, the House must pass this continuing resolution and  President Trump must sign it. If President Trump vetoes the short-term  spending bill, he would no doubt compound the serious errors he has  made throughout the budget process. It is already indisputable that a  shutdown would fall on President Trump's back. He has been demanding it  for months, and, of course, when Leader Pelosi and I went to the White  House, he demanded it in front of all the American people.   Now, compounding that--vetoing the last train out of the station, a  CR--he would be doubling down on his responsibility for a Christmas  shutdown, and every single American would know it. Most importantly, it  would not move the needle an inch toward the President getting his  wall.   I mention these points because several Members of the Freedom  Caucus--the hard rightwing in the House--and hard-right voices in the  media are openly encouraging the President to veto any CR that doesn't  have his money for the wall. These are the same voices pressuring the  House leadership to refuse to put the CR on the floor. The voices of  the hard right--both in the House and in the media--give no strategy at  all--simply, shut the government down. But none of them have detailed  any path to get their wall.  [[Page S7963]]    Let me just walk my friends in the House through it. Democrats are  not budging on the wall. We favor smart, effective border security, not  a medieval wall.   A Trump shutdown will not convince a single Democrat to support  bilking the American taxpayers for an ineffective, unnecessary, and  exorbitantly expensive wall that President Trump promised Mexico would  pay for.   I hear Mr. Jordan and Mr. Meadows say: This was a campaign promise.  They are only mentioning half of the campaign promise. The promise  throughout the campaign was this: We will build a wall, and Mexico will  pay for it.   Furthermore, there are not the votes in the Republican House for a  wall. There are not the votes in the Senate for a wall--not now, not  next week, not next month or beyond.   If Speaker Ryan refuses to put the CR on the floor or President Trump  vetoes it, there will be a Trump shutdown, but there will be no wall.  And if President Trump or House Republicans cause a shutdown over  Christmas, on January 3, the new Democratic House will send the Senate  a clean CR bill. Based on passage of the CR last night, it is clear-- and to their credit--that Senate Republicans don't want a shutdown.   What is the endgame here? What is the endgame of those who are  demanding the President not sign the CR--that the House not pass the  CR? It seems, unfortunately, that the Trump temper tantrum is spreading  like a contagion down Pennsylvania Avenue to the allies in the House.   Trump's allies in the House can pound their fists on the table all  they want, but it is not going to get a wall. They can--having caught  the Trump temper fever--jump up and down, yell and scream. It is not  going to get a wall. And neither Mr. Meadows nor Mr. Jordan have  outlined any conceivable plan on how to achieve what they say they want  to achieve.   I would say this to my less frenzied friends in the House. Go ask Mr.  Jordan and ask Mr. Meadows: What is your plan? What is your endgame?  What is your path to getting the wall?   I suspect that anyone who asks them will find that they don't have  one. They are just angry and mad, and so they pound their fists on the  table. They have caught the Trump temper tantrum, but they have no  conceivable plan, and so their anger will result in a Trump shutdown,  but not a Trump wall. Frankly, their anger will result in further  discrediting the President whom they support.   Amazingly, Representative Meadows said yesterday that the American  people will support President Trump shutting down the government over  the wall. I don't know what evidence he has for that or whom he speaks  to, because every public poll that I have seen shows that the American  people are not only strongly against a border wall, but they are even  more strongly against a shutdown to get the wall. Imagine how strongly  they would feel as he ties those two things together.   When Mr. Meadows says the American people are for it, he must think  the American people are only conservative Republicans. If he widened  his horizons a bit, he would come to the understanding that shutting  down the government over President Trump's wall is futile, self- defeating, and has minimal support among the American people. Even a  quarter of President Trump's shrinking base does not support shutting  down the government over the wall, and among the vast majority of other  Americans who are not part of President Trump's base--and those are the  majority of Americans--the strong majority are totally against it.   We need to get something done here to keep the government open over  Christmas. We need to tell the hundreds of thousands--millions--of  workers that they will get paid over Christmastime. The House needs to  come to the same sensible conclusion that the Senate came to--that we  should not hold millions of innocent Americans hostage to demand  something they will never get.   The Senate has produced a clean bill. There are no partisan demands,  no poison pill riders. We could have demanded lots of things in the  bill that we want. It is just a clean extension of funding. If House  Republicans and President Trump refuse to pass it, then we will have a  Trump shutdown over Christmas. The choice is theirs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last night we received some  extraordinarily concerning news regarding the President's nominee for  Attorney General, Mr. William Barr.   According to reports earlier this year, Mr. Barr sent the Justice  Department an unsolicited memo criticizing what he believed to be an  avenue of investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Mr. Barr's  memo reveals that he is fatally conflicted from being able to oversee  the special counsel's investigation and that he should not be nominated  for Attorney General.   Mr. Barr believes Presidents, in general, and, more frighteningly,  President Trump, who has shown less respect for rule of law than any  President, are above the law--much like Justice Kavanaugh--because he  has an almost imperial view of the Presidency--as almost a King, not an  elected leader. That much comes across in the memo because it doesn't  allow legal processes to work against the President, who might be  breaking the law.   We will see what Mueller finds out if that is true, but we should let  him go forward. The fact that Mr. Barr holds these deeply misguided  views and chose to launch them in an unprovoked written attack on the  special counsel unquestionably disqualifies Mr. Barr from serving as  Attorney General again.   Since Mr. Barr hasn't been formally nominated yet, the President must  immediately reconsider and find another nominee who is free of  conflicts and will carry out the duties of law impartially.                            ____________________     Finally this morning, on another Justice Department  matter, the Justice Department seems that it is becoming more and more  of a swamp--at least in its top leaders. This time it is Mr. Whitaker.   This morning, we learned that ethics officials at the Justice  Department told Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker that he did  not need to recuse himself from overseeing the special counsel's  investigation. The decision by the Justice Department defies logic.  Matthew Whitaker has publicly and forcefully advocated for defunding  and imposing severe limits on the Mueller investigation, calling it a  ``mere witch hunt.'' He also has troubling conflicts of interest,  including his relationship with Sam Clovis, who is a grand jury witness  in this investigation.    There is clear and obvious evidence of bias on the part of Matthew  Whitaker against the special counsel's investigation. To allow him to  retain oversight over that investigation without his recusal is  incredibly misguided.   The Congress and the American people must be informed of any instance  in which Mr. Whitaker has sought or is seeking to interfere with the  Mueller investigation. If Mr. Whitaker has sought any limitation on  witnesses, funding, subpoenas, or any other limitation, we must be  informed of it right now.   We believe that Matthew Whitaker shouldn't be in the job in the first  place. His appointment is potentially unconstitutional. His oversight  of the Russia investigation is hopelessly biased.   It is clear that President Trump is trying in every way possible to  appoint or to nominate people to lead the Justice Department who could  well impede the special counsel's investigation.   I thank the Senator from Florida for patiently waiting.   I yield the floor.
