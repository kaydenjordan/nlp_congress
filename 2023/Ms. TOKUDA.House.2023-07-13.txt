 Mr. Speaker, for 140 years, Hawaiian Telcom has been  keeping the people of Hawaii connected.   Since the days of the Hawaiian Kingdom, when Archibald Scott  Cleghorn, father of Princess Ka'iulani, chartered the Mutual Phone  Company, loved ones and lifelines have been just a phone call away.   As an island State, the ocean often seems far too wide for me. Like  the iconic commercial we all remember--which still bring tears to my  eyes--of a college student getting a call from her mom, Hawaiian Telcom  continues to keep us connected with our ohana, now with high-speed  internet and modern communication services for the digital age.   Hawaiian Telcom and its generations of employees, past and present,  have made it their mission to provide the people of Hawaii with the  connectivity and digital equity they deserve. Whether it is accessing  educational or workforce opportunities, stimulating our economy,  promoting telehealth services, or simply connecting with family and  friends, innovative communication technologies play a critical role in  the rural and remote communities we live in.   To all who have contributed to Hawaiian Telcom's 140-year legacy of  service to our islands, I extend my sincerest congratulations and  thanks. Mahalo for all they do to keep us connected, and I look forward  to our next 140 years of service together.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I don't get this whole woke reference, but I  am definitely awake after what I have heard on this floor today.   During our markup, we heard repeatedly that the PRC and Russia--even  today we heard it--they aren't spending their troops' time on DEI. I  absolutely agree with you. They aren't.   The strongest military possible, the one we aim to be, the one we  are, is a diverse, equitable, and inclusive one.   When you compare our military with those of our competitors, what is  immediately striking is the diversity of our servicemembers.   Studies have long shown and demonstrated that diversity helps  organizations out-innovate, outperform, out-strategize, outmaneuver  others.   Our diversity is our strength. Our commitment to equality, to  exclusiveness, that is what makes us Americans. It is why we have the  very best military in the world.   Some House Republicans insist on peddling a false choice between DEI  and readiness. Why are they so keen on emulating and becoming more like  the PRC, more like Russia?   Eliminating DEI won't help our military compete more effectively with  the PRC. It will, however, undermine the innovative thinking, the  cultural competency, the inclusive institutional cultures, the  qualitative edge, our ability to win if we need to be agile and ready  and lethal.   This amendment to terminate DEI offices and personnel and all of the  insidious DEI-related amendments we have had to hear and will hear  tonight by my Republican colleagues aren't just harmful to our national  security--they are a major threat.   It is time we set aside the political games that we are seeing and  get serious about our national security and stand by our servicemen and  -women of all backgrounds who have given up so much in defense of our  country and to keep all of us safe.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith).  [[Page H3535]]         Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Washington.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. McClellan).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, in closing, I just have one question to ask:  What about us scares you?   My grandfather, my father-in-law, and my brother all fought and  risked their lives for this country. Yet, the sacrifices made by so  many who feel marginalized, our communities of color, simply pale in  comparison to the hate and fear that drives this obsession with DEI.   First and foremost, we just heard that under a strong administration  like the Trump administration, you would not have this. However, DEI is  not new. In 2020, the Trump administration established a Defense Board  and a Defense Advisory Committee on Diversity and Inclusion to increase  diversity and ensure equitable opportunity across all ranks.   If you want to be more like China, if you want to be more like  Russia, keep this up. I don't want to be like them. DEI is necessary.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, you know, it has been said once already on  this floor, but I don't think it can be said enough. If we ever, ever  needed a reason to support DEI training, you need look no further than  the debates, the antics that we have seen on this floor today, the  childish, yes, actions that we have heard from the other side.   In fact, from the backwards, racially insensitive comments spoken on  this floor, it seems DEI training would be good right here in the Halls  of Congress.   Mr. Chair, we have spent hours in markup already debating DEI, but  apparently it wasn't enough. So here we are again forced to debate yet  another bad amendment.   Never mind that 40 percent of our servicemembers identify as members  of minority groups, or that 42 percent of servicemembers of color turn  down assignments because of concerns about racism and discrimination  that they have experienced.   Never mind that almost half of all servicemembers in a recent survey  said they have been the subject of racial slurs or jokes in their  communities.   To say that we do not need DEI is to say racism and discrimination  does not exist in our military and in our society.   For the sponsor of this amendment to be proud of taking a meat  cleaver to DEI flies in the face of all Americans and the diversity  that we represent.   What this reckless amendment and this obsession over DEI really  exposes is a callous disregard for these servicemembers and their  experiences. They deserve better. America is better than this, and I  strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                                time  2045
