 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York, with  whom I have had the pleasure and displeasure of working on many  occasions. He is a strong advocate for what he believes in. Yet, over  the years I have worked with him, his word is good, and when it comes  to tough discussion and agreement and when agreement is reached, he  sticks to his word, and that is an important element in our ability to  work together.   I thank the Senator from New York for his efforts in bringing us  together in a bipartisan fashion. I hope that what we will get done in  the next few days is an example of what we can do when working  together, so I thank him for his opening remarks and his advocacy in  our bipartisan work together.   I join my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, the ranking member  of the Armed Services Committee, to speak about the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. I thank the Senator from Rhode  Island for his hard work on the NDAA. I remain appreciative of the  thoughtfulness with which and bipartisan spirit in which he approaches  national security issues. He is a great partner, and this legislation  would not be possible if it were not for his contributions and  leadership.   In June, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed the National  Defense Authorization Act unanimously, by a vote of 27 to 0. During  that process, the committee considered and adopted 277 amendments that  were offered by Republicans and Democrats--some with very spirited  debate and discussion. I thank each of my fellow members of the Armed  Services Committee. A vote of 27 to 0 is something we can be proud of.  I am tremendously proud of the committee's work. The bill, as I  mentioned, passed unanimously this year for the first time in 5 years.  I was especially proud of the way in which my colleagues worked to  overcome differences, of the respect that each member showed for one  another, and of the common commitment to support our servicemembers and  help our military achieve its mission.   Now we are prepared to consider the legislation on the floor under an  open amendment process that will allow all Senators to have their  voices heard. I thank the majority leader, the Senator from Kentucky,  for bringing the NDAA to the Senate floor this week and for doing so,  once again, under regular order. That means that we will have  amendments, that we will have debate, that we will have spirited  discussion, which is what the Senate is supposed to have.   I am guardedly optimistic that at the end of this, we will complete  legislation which will be better for having gone through that process  and for the men and women who are now in harm's way, defending our  Nation.   For 55 consecutive years, Congress has passed this piece of  legislation. That record speaks primarily to the importance of this  legislation to our national security. I know that all of my colleagues  would agree that our men and women in uniform deserve our constant  support and unending thanks for their sacrifice and service. No other  piece of legislation has a long history of broad, bipartisan support.  In today's political climate, the passage of this legislation may be  exactly what we need to remind ourselves of the important work the  American people sent us here to do.   The NDAA is a piece of legislation in which this body and Members on  both sides of the aisle can and should take immense pride. Not only  does this legislation provide our men and women in uniform with the  resources they need and deserve, but it is the product of an open and  bipartisan process that represents the best of the Senate, and it could  not come at a more important time.   The threats to our national security have not been more complex,  severe, or daunting at any time in the past seven decades, and our job  is to ensure that we have a military capable of meeting those threats.  For too long, we have locked ourselves into making strategic decisions  based on budget realities. It is time to start making budget decisions  based on strategic realities.   Just consider the current threats to our national security.   Day after day, test after test, North Korea continues to get ever  closer to developing the capability to strike the U.S. homeland with a  nuclear-armed missile and continues to threaten our allies in the  region.   While we have made some important gains in the fight against ISIS,  the campaign to achieve a lasting defeat of terrorist threats and to  secure our enduring national security interests in Iraq and Syria is  far from over.   Iran continues to destabilize the Middle East and seeks to drive the  United States out of the region.   We have entered a new era of great power competition as Russia and  China contest the rules-based liberal world order that is the  foundation of our security and prosperity.   Every day we learn more about Russia's asymmetric capabilities--from  cyber attacks to disinformation campaigns--even as they modernize their  military, occupy Crimea, destabilize Ukraine, and threaten our NATO  allies.   Meanwhile, China continues to militarize the South China Sea and  modernize its own military at an alarming rate.   We must not forget that we are a Nation at war, with thousands of our  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines deployed in harm's way in  Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the globe.   Yet, as dangerous as these and other foreign threats are, perhaps the  greatest harm to our national security and our military is self- inflicted. I repeat: self-inflicted. It is the accumulation of years of  uncertain, untimely, and inadequate defense funding that has shrunk our  operational forces, harmed their readiness, stunted their  modernization, and, as every single member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  has repeatedly testified before the Committee on Armed Services, put  the lives of our servicemembers at greater risk. I want to repeat that.  Every one of our military leaders in uniform has said that because of  what we have done with the so-called sequestration, it has put the  lives of our servicemembers at greater risk. Don't we have an  obligation not to do that?   Now we are paying the awful price. This summer alone, 42--I repeat,  42--servicemembers tragically perished in accidents during routine  training operations. On June 17, seven sailors were killed when the USS  Fitzgerald collided with a container ship off the coast of Japan.   On July 10, a Marine KC-130 crashed in Mississippi and killed all 16  troops on board.   On August 21, 10 sailors perished when the USS McCain collided with a  tanker near Singapore.   On August 25, an Army Black Hawk helicopter went missing during a  training mission off the coast of Yemen, and one soldier died.   Just last week in Nevada, two Air Force A-10 aircraft crashed into  each other. Thank God the pilots safely ejected, but the planes were  lost--at a cost of over $100 million.   For the two Pacific Fleet naval collisions, ship repairs are  estimated to cost more than half a billion dollars.   The lives lost in each of these incidents were priceless.   Over the past 3 years, a total of 185 men and women in uniform have  been killed in noncombat accidents. During this same period, 44  servicemembers were killed in combat. The bottom line is this, and I  want all of my colleagues to concentrate on what I am about to say: We  are killing more of our own people in training than our enemies are in  combat.   We were warned about this. We were warned. We were warned by our  senior defense and military leaders and by many of us in Congress.  Earlier this year, Secretary Mattis testified that ``no enemy in the  field has done more to harm the combat readiness of our military than  sequestration.''   Secretary Mattis went on to say: ``We are no longer managing risk; we  are now gambling.'' Now, it is clear that we are not only gambling with  our  [[Page S5247]]  ability to fight and win wars. We are also gambling with the very  ability of our troops to operate safely during peacetime.   In that same hearing, General Dunford--I will remind my colleagues,  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--described what is at stake  if we continue down the path of budget cuts, saying: ``In just a few  years if we don't change the trajectory, we will lose our qualitative  and our quantitative competitive advantage, [and] the consequences will  be profound.'' Those are not my words. They are the words of the senior  general officer in the U.S. military.   Each of our military service chiefs has testified time and again  before congressional committees about the dangers of sequestration,  Budget Control Act-level spending, and repeated continuing resolutions.   The Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Richardson, testified: ``Eight  years of continuing resolutions including a year of sequestration have  driven additional costs and time into just about everything that we do.  . . . The disruption this uncertainty imposes translates directly into  risks for our Navy and our nation.''   General Neller, Commandant of the Marine Corps, said: ``Sequestration  impacts on key modernization programs will have catastrophic effects on  achieving desired capabilities to defeat emerging threats and will  place an unacceptable burden on legacy programs.''   The Air Force Chief of Staff, General Goldfein, testified:  ``Repealing sequestration, returning to stable budgets without extended  continuing resolutions and allowing us the flexibility to reduce excess  infrastructure and make strategic trades are essential to success.''   The Army Chief of Staff, General Milley has said: ``Candidly, failure  to pass a budget, in my view both as an American citizen and chief of  staff of the United States Army, constitutes professional  malpractice.''   ``Professional malpractice,'' he said.   He added: ``A year-long CR or a return to the [Budget Control Act- level] funding will . . . increase risk to the nation, and it will  ultimately result in dead Americans on a future battlefield.''   We need look no further than all of the recent training accidents,  collisions, and crashes for evidence that these warnings and concerns  were well placed, and the troubling signs were there. Failure to meet  training requirements and fulfill safety certifications has become all  too common in the force--especially in the U.S. Navy.   Recent reporting details a troubled state of affairs. The GAO found  that 37 percent--well over one-third--of the training certifications  for U.S. Navy cruisers and destroyers based in Japan are expired-- technically meaning that they are not prepared.   The USS McCain had expired training certifications for 6 out of the  10 key warfare mission areas prior to its collision. The USS Fitzgerald  had expired certifications for all of its 10 mission areas.   Lest anyone think the Navy is the only service facing troubling  readiness statistics, I will remind my colleagues that only 5--5 out of  the 58--Army brigades and 4 of the 64 Air Force squadrons are combat- ready.   There is plenty of responsibility to go around for the deteriorated  state of our military. The Senate Armed Services Committee will  continue to hold hearings and conduct rigorous oversight of these  military readiness challenges, looking at everything from command  responsibility to readiness standards, to training culture within our  military. We will continue seeking explanations for the causes of these  incidents, corrective actions to remedy these causes, and  accountability from leadership.   Yet we can't ignore Congress's role and our responsibility. Years of  budget cuts have forced our military to try to do too much with too  little. As we have asked our military to maintain a high operational  tempo with limited resources, we know what has suffered: Training,  maintenance, readiness, effectiveness, and the lives of too many brave  young servicemembers.   But despite the abundant evidence that our military faces a readiness  crisis that is putting lives at risk, this body voted just last week to  put the Department of Defense on yet another continuing resolution for  the start of fiscal year 2018. We know that continuing resolutions  cause a great deal of harm to our military.   Just last week, Secretary Mattis sent a letter to the Armed Services  Committee detailing the detrimental effects of a continuing resolution.  He said that the impacts of a CR are felt immediately by our military  and will grow exponentially over time if we repeat this mistake in  December. In the next 3 months, the Navy will delay ship inductions and  reduce flying hours, the Army will postpone maintenance, the Air Force  will limit execution of infrastructure funding, and all services will  delay training and curtail recruitment, leaving, according to Secretary  Mattis, ``critical gaps in the workforce skill set.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a letter from Secretary Mattis outlining his concerns.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                           Secretary of Defense,                                  Washington, DC, September 8, 2017.      Hon. John McCain,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your August       29, 2017 letter regarding the potential impacts of another       fiscal year under Continuing Resolution (CR) authority. I       appreciate and share your concern in this matter.        Long term CRs impact the readiness of our forces and their       equipment at a time when security threats are extraordinarily       high. The longer the CR, the greater the consequences for our       force. A CR, if required, avoids a government shutdown and       provides an opportunity for a long-term solution that lifts       the BCA caps.        In the long term, it is the budget caps mandated in the       Budget Control Act (BCA) that impose the greater threat to       the Department and to national security. BCA-level funding       reverses the gains we have made in readiness, and undermines       our efforts to increase lethality and grow the force. Without       relief from the BCA caps, our air, land, and sea fleets will       continue to erode. BCA caps obstruct our path to       modernization, and continue to narrow the technical       competitive advantage we presently maintain over our       adversaries.        The Service Secretaries and Chiefs have identified many of       their specific concerns about operating under a CR       (enclosed). I appreciate that you share our concerns, and       look forward to working with you in FY 18 as we build a       solution to alleviate the BCA caps.        I have provided similar letters to the other Chairs and       Ranking Members of the House and Senate Committees on Armed       Services and Appropriations.                                                   James N. Mattis.        Enclosure.       Impacts of a Continuing Resolution Authority in Fiscal Year 2018         This summary describes the most likely impacts of operating       under a Continuing Resolution (CR), if enacted for Fiscal       Year 2018 (FY18). The impacts of a CR depend in part on the       level of funding provided and the duration of the CR period.        The Military Departments and Defense Agencies are       justifiably concerned that under a CR, the Department cannot       reprogram FY18 funds until a MI appropriation is enacted.       Inability to reprogram CR funds drastically reduces the       ability to respond to urgent requirements or to address       funding gaps that damage readiness.        During a CR, we remain committed to supporting the       warfighter. The Military Departments will realign or execute       CR and existing budgetary resources within the limits of       their authorities to fully support forward-deployed       operations, direct support activities, and urgent operations       of the Combatant Commands. Finding ways to fully fund such       essential activities while operating during a CR does not       make CRs any less disruptive or detrimental--in reality,       doing so imposes a great burden on DoD's foundational       capabilities, and immediately manifests in impacts on       training, readiness and maintenance, personnel, and       contracting.        Training: Impacts begin immediately, within the first 30       days of a CR. By 90 days, the lost training is unrecoverable       due to subsequent scheduled training events. These training       losses reduce the effectiveness of subsequent training events       in FY18 and in subsequent years.        Most major exercises and training events are scheduled for       the spring and summer, and presume individual and unit-level       training was completed. Training scheduled during the period       of the CR, however, must be re-scoped and scaled to       incorporate only mission essential tasks and objectives, so       units enter the major exercises less prepared.        For example, the scope of a Joint live fire field training       exercise (FTX) scheduled to execute in conjunction with       annual Marine Corps weapons certification events may have to       be reduced during a CR by limiting weapons crews to firing at       levels that firing tables specify as necessary to maintain       certification, thus forgoing the added training benefit of       firing weapon systems in a Joint operational context. Without       this experience, the  [[Page S5248]]       Marines would then enter their major exercises and training       rotations without the benefit of having practiced       coordinating joint fires, or the experience of firing in an       operational environment.        Air Force must preserve core readiness training for       deployed or next-to-deploy units, at the cost of       institutional training and flying hours. Lack of funds to       stand-up two F-16 training squadrons, reduced aircraft       availability, and inability to grow the force (military and       civilian) will further reduce pilot production, leaving the       Air Force unable to train the number of pilots necessary for       continued readiness recovery. Cancellation of exercises will       further degrade pilot training and readiness.        Readiness and Maintenance: The impacts of a CR are felt       immediately, and grow exponentially over time. Although       maintenance impacts can be mitigated for some activities       operating under a 3-month CR, in areas, such as Navy Ship       Depot Maintenance, funding shortfalls result in delays in       Naval vessel availability, which may affect subsequent       deployment rotations.        Under a CR, funding reductions will impact all major       activities not related to deployed forces, including: depot       maintenance, individual and collective training, and       munitions procurement. Failure to properly fund readiness       restoration initiatives in a stable and consistent manner       will impede the recovery of our readiness, which has just       begun to see tangible results, and may prove fatal in a       future conflict with major-power adversaries. Furthermore, a       ready force requires continued and stable investment in our       munitions inventory and a CR will not provide the Services       the necessary flexibility to procure and develop weapons, nor       build sufficient infrastructure to align with the       Department's readiness recovery efforts.        Navy will delay the induction of 11 ships, which will       exacerbate the planned ship maintenance in FY18, and will       slip ship availabilities into FYI 9, further impacting that       plan. FY18 Ship availabilities considered for schedule slip:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------               Ship                   Planned start         Location ------------------------------------------------------------------------ KIDD DDG-100....................  19 Nov............

Virginia MAHAN DDG-72....................  19 Feb............  Virginia ------------------------------------------------------------------------         Under a 90-Day CR, all listed ship inductions will be       delayed, as the shipyards' capacity is not capable of fully       ``catching-up'' lost work, thus the entire schedule slips to       the right. This means that even a relatively short CR creates       delays in ship depot maintenance, thus deployment timelines,       into subsequent years.        Under a 3 month CR, Army will defer supply transactions,       and then later have to pay more to get parts fabricated or       shipped quickly, in order to keep up with maintenance       timelines. Under a 6 month CR, Army will order parts from       sources outside the DoD supply system, just to keep up with       operational demand. These external transactions will cost       more and fail to leverage the efficiencies built into the       centralized supply system.        Under a CR, the Army will have about $400 million per month       less in their operating accounts. Beginning in a 3 month CR,       It will be forced to restrict home station training        Immediately under a CR, Army will postpone all non-critical       maintenance work orders until later in the year.        Within the first 3 months of CR, Navy will reduce flying       hours and steaming days for those units not deployed or next       to deploy. It will delay the replenishment of spares and       repair parts on supply shelves in our ships, submarines, and       aircraft carriers across the non-deployed Fleet.        The Military Departments will limit execution of       infrastructure funding by prioritizing life, health and       safety requirements. For the Air Force, this will affect 79       major installations worldwide and negatively impact aircraft       bed-downs and mission generation.        The lack of a National Defense Authorization Act, the legal       requirement for specific appropriations for major military       construction projects, and new start restrictions within the       CR combine to mean that no new major military construction       projects can be initiated using CR finds, with an inevitable       delay in project schedules and potential increased costs. For       the Navy this will impact 37 projects; the Air Force has 16       projects; the Army has 38 projects.        Personnel: The uncertainty imposed during a 3-month CR       causes most hiring actions and recruitment to be curtailed,       and vacancies to then be re-announced once an appropriation       is enacted. This disruption leaves critical gaps in the       workforce skill set and causes unnecessary angst among       military and civil servants, making the Government a far-less       attractive option to the highest-skilled potential       candidates.        Both Congress and the President agree need exists to add       military personnel to meet critical skill gaps such as       pilots, maintainers, cyber experts, and nuclear trained       personnel. A CR will delay the accession process, with the       consequence that units and organizations will continue to       lack the full complement of personnel they need to be       effective.        Professional development and training for both military and       civilians will be delayed.        Non-critical travel, which includes PCS moves for civilians       and military members and their families, will be curtailed.       This often results in missed hiring opportunities as       potential employees pursue other options. It creates       unnecessary turmoil for families who had otherwise planned to       relocate, whose orders are delayed; and may then result in       missed schoolyear timing for dependent spouses and children.        Adverse outcomes for medical beneficiaries experiencing       potentially life threatening illnesses due to delays in       receiving the required treatment. Beneficiary health care is       an entitlement and there is no mechanism to slow down or       reduce the demand for services.        Payments to medical care providers for services rendered       for patients will be delayed. This results in a potential       reduction in future access to private sector health care for       DoD beneficiaries, as a result of providers discontinuing       services to patients paid by TRICARE.        Contracting: The impacts of a CR on DoD contracting efforts       are significant and begin within the first 30-days of each       CR. Every contract that has to be re-competed represents       additional work for the already-pressed DoD acquisition       workforce. In addition to these increased administrative       costs, new start rules and funding constraints carried       forward under each CR extension combine to increase the       likelihood that costs of material and labor in the contracts       themselves will also grow. To the vendors and manufacturers,       the Government becomes a less reliable, higher-risk customer.        As is the case in the private sector, DoD saves money by       buying in quantity. When we are forced to sever contracts and       renegotiate terms with each CR, our costs grow to offset the       increased risks and delays; we offer vendors less stability       and predictability, and pay accordingly.        Acquisition programs are forced to use incremental contract       actions to preserve efforts and schedules, which inevitably       results in higher program costs and schedule delays. Each       iteration of contract rework further taxes the DoD       Contracting community, doubling or tripling their workload       annually.        Under a CR, there are generally no new-starts, and no       production rate increases for acquisition programs with       budgetary program quantities of record.        In FY18:        In the first 3 months under a CR, the Army has 18 new       starts and 8 production rate increases that would be       impacted. These include the Paladin Integration Management       Improvement, Interim Combat Service rifle, Multi-role Anti-      armor Anti-personnel Weapon System, Lightweight 30mm cannon       and the Armored Multi-purpose Vehicle. Rate increases are       planned for handguns, TOW2 missiles, M240L medium machine gun       and the Advanced Tactical Parachute system.        Beyond three months (4-12 months), the Army would have 24       additional new starts and 7 additional production rate       increases. The new starts include the Udairi Range Target       Lifters, Heavy Equipment Transporter System, and the Modular       Catastrophic Recovery System. Production rate increases       include modifications to Stinger and Avenger, Guided Multiple       Launch Rocket System, and the Reduced Range Practice Rocket.        The Navy has 7 procurement contracts that will be delayed       by a 6-month CR due to the new start restrictions. It also       has 12 planned production rate increases that will be       deferred and 3 research and development new starts.        The Air Force has a total of 6 new starts that would be       impacted by a 6-month CR. These include multiple F-15C and F-      16 upgrades and the Joint Space operations Center Mission       system.        Funding limitations for all research and development will       result in the Services assessing the relative priorities of       their programs, resulting in providing only minimum       sustaining funding to the selected programs.     Mr. President, the vote we took to begin the year on a  continuing resolution locks the Department of Defense into last year's  funding level. It prevents them from reprogramming funding to meet  emerging needs. It prohibits the start of new programs to modernize for  future threats. Perhaps worst of all, a continuing resolution mandates  a level of spending that is $89 billion less than the fiscal year 2018  funding level authorized in this legislation.   When the Senate voted to put the Department of Defense on a  continuing resolution, it voted in favor of the status quo for our  military, where more servicemembers are dying in accidents than in all  the wars we are fighting combined. Last week's vote signaled that the  current, undeniably degraded state of our Armed Forces is just fine  with us. It was irresponsible and unacceptable.   We must all do better. Pentagon leaders must make clear-eyed  assessments and ask for what they fully need, and this body must  provide the resources required. That is the only way to stop gambling  and restore readiness, and this is the bare minimum we owe to the brave  men and women who fight to defend this Nation.   That is why this legislation is more important and vital than ever.  The  [[Page S5249]]  NDAA delivers the resources, equipment, and training our men and women  in uniform need to meet the increasingly complex challenges of today's  world. It begins the process of truly restoring readiness and  rebuilding our military.   The Defense authorization bill authorizes a base defense budget that,  together with the administration's request of $8 billion for other  defense activities, supports a total defense budget of $640 billion in  funding for the Department of Defense and the national security  programs at the Department of Energy. The legislation also authorizes  $60 billion for overseas contingency operations. In total, this  legislation supports a national defense topline of $700 billion.   This funding is critical to begin addressing the readiness shortfall  and modernization crisis currently facing our military. With our  adversaries investing heavily in their own militaries and developing  future warfighting capabilities intended to erode our military  advantage, we cannot wait any longer to recapitalize our forces and  restore our capabilities.   The national defense topline in this legislation is significantly  higher than the administration's budget request. It is worth  considering why, in committee, more than one-quarter of the Members of  this body--one-quarter of the Members of this body, Senators of both  parties and of all political stripes--voted for a higher defense  topline. The answer is simple. Today's national security threats demand  more resources. While not every crisis has a military solution, our  military remains an indispensable aspect of America's ability to  project power and provide the framework for global stability and  security.   The problem is that funding to meet these national security threats  and challenges has been constrained by the arbitrary caps of the Budget  Control Act. Members from both sides of the aisle have acknowledged  that the Budget Control Act simply does not allow for adequate spending  on national defense.   While altering the Budget Control Act or the spending caps is outside  of the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, the committee has  expressed its support in this legislation for the unconditional repeal  of the Budget Control Act. Congress must summon the political courage  to admit that this legislation has failed, rise above politics, and fix  it.   The Budget Control Act has not achieved its intended purpose by  reducing the deficit. For years, it has prevented Congress from  providing our military servicemembers with the resources they need.  This cannot continue. I tell my colleagues, this cannot continue. We  can, and must, do better.   Under the Budget Control Act, defense spending for fiscal year 2018  would be capped at $549 billion. That is $54 billion less than what the  President requested for defense and $91 billion less than what the  Armed Services Committee supported.   The members of the Armed Services Committee agreed unanimously that  any defense budget at that level would be inadequate and unacceptable.  That has been reinforced time and again over the last several years in  testimony from senior military and civilian defense leaders who have  come before our committee with warnings of the danger of the BCA  spending caps and sequestration.   At the conclusion of debate on this legislation, the Senate's passage  of the NDAA has served as evidence that an overwhelming bipartisan  majority of this body agrees that the status quo is not sufficient, and  we need to spend more money on defense to keep our Nation safe.   Even so, the unfortunate truth is, with BCA as the law of the land,  $549 billion is the only defense budget that is currently legal, unless  Congress acts. It is up to this Congress to decide if that is the  defense budget we want. In doing so, we must remember that a BCA-level  defense budget cannot give us the military we need.   The President also acknowledges that a BCA-level defense budget of  $549 billion is inadequate, and he campaigned on the promise of  rebuilding the military. That is why it was so disappointing that the  President's budget request did not deliver on the promise of the  military buildup we need.   The defense budget request came in at $603 billion. It is important  to recognize three important factors about that number. First, it is  rooted in the same arbitrary policy as $549 billion, since $603 billion  is simply the original BCA cap before sequestration takes effect;  second, it represents only a 3-percent increase over the Obama  administration's defense budget plan; and, third, it is plainly  inadequate to meet our Nation's defense needs.   One indication of this is that the military services sent this  Congress lists of unfunded requirements. That meant requirements they  have but we are not funding, and that means over $30 billion that our  military needs to do its job. It is time for Congress to do our job and  provide the resources they need.   What our military needs is a real buildup. The NDAA is the start of  what will be a years-long process of rebuilding our military after  years of devastating cuts to the defense budget. We must begin that  process now. Our men and women in uniform can't afford to wait any  longer.   The NDAA also builds on the reforms this Congress has passed in  recent years. By continuing important efforts to reorganize the  Department of Defense, spur innovation in defense technology, and  improve defense acquisition and business operations, the NDAA seeks to  strengthen accountability and streamline the process of getting our  warfighters what they need to succeed. At the same time, it prioritizes  accountability from the Department and demands the best use of every  taxpayer dollar.   The NDAA authorizes a pay raise for our troops. It improves military  family readiness and supports the civilians and contractors who support  our Armed Forces. It provides support for our allies and partners  around the world who are dedicated to advancing the cause of freedom,  deterring the aggression of our adversaries, and defeating the scourge  of terrorism.   This legislation recognizes the reality of the dangerous world our  men and women in uniform face every day. As threats turn into crises  around the world, we have asked these brave servicemembers to do more  with less. That must end now.   The NDAA takes important steps to deter Russian aggression, whether  across its borderers or in cyber space. Russia continues to occupy  Crimea, destabilize Ukraine, threaten our NATO allies, violate the 1987  Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and bolster the Assad regime  in Syria. In an unparalleled attack on our core interests and values,  Russia engaged in an active, purposeful campaign to undermine the  integrity of American democracy and affect the outcome of the 2016  Presidential election.   The legislation authorizes nearly $5 billion for the European  Deterrence Initiative to bolster U.S. capabilities in Europe and  support our regional allies who feel the constant threat of revanchist  Russian aggression. It also authorizes $500 million to provide security  assistance to Ukraine, including the defensive lethal assistance the  Ukrainians need to defend themselves. The legislation authorizes $65  million for research-and-development program on a ground-launched,  intermediate-range missile in order to begin to close the capability  gap opened by the Russian violation of the INF Treaty, without placing  the United States in violation of the treaty.   In supporting the fight against resurgent terrorism in the Middle  East, the NDAA authorizes $1.8 billion in funding for counter-ISIS  efforts via the Train and Equip Programs in Iraq and Syria. To support  the continued mission in Afghanistan, the legislation authorizes $4.9  billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund. Importantly, the NDAA  also authorizes 4,000 additional visas through the special immigration  status under the Afghan Allies Protection Act. The legislation also  authorizes $705 million for Israeli cooperative missile defense  programs.   The NDAA authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish the Asia- Pacific Stability Initiative, a funding mechanism that has the  potential to reshape the U.S. approach to this important region,  reassure our allies and partners, and send a resounding message to our  potential adversaries about the strength of our commitment. The  legislation also authorizes $8.5 billion for  [[Page S5250]]  the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland, regional, and space- based missile defense systems. In particular, the legislation  authorizes funding for up to 28 additional ground-based interceptors in  Alaska, which could be a crucial part of our Nation's defense against a  potential North Korea missile threat.   The NDAA would allow our military to embark on an ambitious program  of modernization, one that is desperately needed and long overdue.  Across the services, this legislation provides funding above the  administration's request to meet the list of unfunded priorities from  the Department of Defense. Above and beyond the administration's  request, the legislation funds 24 more Joint Strike Fighters, 10 more  F/A-18 Super Hornets, and 5 additional ships for the Navy. The  legislation also authorizes funding for an increase in end strength for  the Army and the Marine Corps, adding 6,000 additional soldiers and  1,000 additional marines.   At the same time, as part of rigorous congressional oversight of  defense spending, this legislation demands accountability for results,  promotes transparency, and protects taxpayer dollars. The legislation  identifies targeted reductions to wasteful or underperforming programs,  especially those that heavily rely upon software and information  technology systems, and reinvests the savings in high-priority needs  for the warfighters. The goal, as always, is to ensure our men and  women in uniform receive the capabilities they need on time, on  schedule, and at a reasonable cost.   The NDAA makes important efforts to correct the glaring and dangerous  lack of an effective strategy and policy for the information domain,  including cyber, space, and electronic warfare. Without a sufficient  response to previous congressional calls for a comprehensive strategy  from the executive branch, the NDAA establishes a U.S. policy for cyber  deterrence, cyber response, and cyber warfare.   With respect to space, decisionmaking is currently fragmented across  more than 60 offices in the Department of Defense--I repeat, 60 offices  in the Department of Defense. Funding for space programs is also near  30-year lows, while the threats and our reliance on space are at their  highest and growing. This legislation fully funds our space  requirements and authorizes additional funding for the military's  underfunded priorities for space. The NDAA also establishes a new DOD  Chief Information Warfare Officer--a position that would streamline a  current bureaucracy that is too often duplicative, inefficient, and  ineffective, and instead assigns responsibility and accountability to  one leader for all matters relating to the information environment-- including space, cyber security, electronic warfare, and the  electromagnetic spectrum.   Finally, the legislation takes several steps to bolster border  security and homeland defense. It authorizes $791 million for the  Department of Defense Counterdrug Programs. It would authorize and  encourage the National Guard to enhance border security capabilities  while gaining effective unit and individual training. It continues to  support the United States-Israel anti-tunneling cooperation program,  which helps to improve our efforts to restrict the flow of drugs across  the U.S. southern border.   This is an ambitious piece of legislation. It is one that reflects  the growing threats to our Nation. Everything about the NDAA is threat- driven, including the $640 billion topline, which is based on an  assessment of the strategic environment rather than an arbitrary  adherence to budget agreements that have been overtaken by events.   As we move forward with consideration of this legislation, I stand  ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass  this important legislation and give our military the resources they  need and deserve. We ask a lot of our men and women in uniform, and  they never let us down. We must not let them down. Their service  represents the best of our country, and this Congress should always  honor their sacrifice.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I call up substitute amendment No. 1003.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment  be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I understand Senator Paul is on his way to  discuss his amendment.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the following Members to  be recognized for debate: 15 minutes for Senator Cardin, 5 minutes for  Senator Murphy, 7 minutes for Senator Moran, and 15 minutes for Senator  Paul, and that following Senator Paul, Senator Corker be recognized.    For the information of my colleagues, in approximately 45  minutes, the Senate will have a vote on a motion to table the Paul  amendment, which means around 12:15 p.m.    Madam President, I want to discuss the amendment, which  has to do with the importance of the authorization for use of military  force in the ongoing U.S. operations against violent extremist  organizations.   First of all, it is important to acknowledge why our current fight  against terrorism is necessary. Earlier this week, we commemorated the  anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, which took the lives  of thousands of innocent Americans, shook our Nation to its core, and,  importantly, brought us together in common resolve to make sure that  kind of tragedy would never, ever happen again.   In pursuit of that noble goal, thousands of brave men and women in  uniform are currently deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and many other  places. No matter what else we do in this body and on this legislation,  we must always ask ourselves if we are doing everything we can to  support those servicemembers as they risk their lives to defend us.   At the same time, we must recognize the ways in which the current  conflict is different from when Congress passed the first authorization  for use of military force in 2001. The landscape of the global fight  against terrorism has changed dramatically with the emergence of ISIS  and the spread of the threat beyond Afghanistan and Iraq. That is why I  and many others have long called for updating the AUMFs.   Yet the nature of the conflict remains the same: Terrorist  organizations continue to warp the religion of Islam and promote a  radical ideology to recruit new fighters and plot violent attacks as  part of their jihad against the United States of America and all that  we stand for.   As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am open to a  process that would develop a new AUMF specific to the current fight  against ISIS and other terrorist organizations as identified by the  administration. I would be very willing to work with my colleagues,  including the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations  Committee, as well as the Senator from Kentucky, to ensure that the  legislation proceeded under regular order and included hearings, a  committee markup, and a floor amendment process that ensured that each  Member of this body was able to have his or her voice heard.   Haven't we had enough of bringing things to the floor without  hearings, without amendments, without debate? I am confident that an  overwhelming bipartisan majority of my colleagues would agree to  approve the use of military force against the vicious, brutal enemy  that we face in ISIS and its associated forces.   The amendment before us now falls far, far short of that process.  Repealing the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs without simultaneously passing a new  authorization would be premature, it would be irresponsible, it would  threaten U.S. national security, and it would inhibit our democracy- building efforts abroad.   As we speak, we have troops deployed overseas who are engaged in the  fight against ISIS, al-Qaida, the Taliban, and other violent extremist  organizations. Repealing the existing AUMFs without having a  replacement would jeopardize the legal authority for ongoing military  operations. I cannot stand by silently as this body considers taking  any action that would put our currently deployed servicemembers at  risk.   It is also important to recognize that adopting this amendment would  embolden our enemies and would send a signal to the members of the U.S.  Armed Forces who are serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere that  Congress and the American public no longer support their mission and  their sacrifice. We cannot send that message, because it is not true.   In closing, I agree with those who support this amendment that the  time has come for a new authorization for use of military force in the  global fight against terrorism, but this amendment is, simply, not the  way to do it. Rather than repealing the existing AUMFs without passing  a new authorization, I urge my colleagues to work together on a new,  bipartisan AUMF that addresses the threats we face today.   There are many Members on both sides of the aisle who have been  working together on AUMFS, including the chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee. That is a process in which I would be proud to  participate, and it is one that would honor those who are currently  deployed in harm's way, fighting to make sure that our Nation never  sees another day like 9/11. But I cannot support anything that fails to  provide our men and women in uniform with everything they need-- including the legal authority--to keep our Nation safe.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I modify my amendment with the changes  that are at the desk.    Mr. President, I again thank my friend and colleague,  Senator Jack Reed, for the continued cooperation which has  characterized our work together.   First, I wish to say that this modification to the substitution  amendment that I am offering, with the agreement and support of Senator  Reed, includes 48 amendments from both Republicans and Democrats that  will help improve this legislation. The modification submitted this  morning included 56 amendments, also evenly divided between Republicans  and Democrats. I want to emphasize that these amendments which were  just included are the result of bipartisan agreement on both sides.  They would not have been proposed if they hadn't already been agreed  to.   This means that now we have incorporated 104 bipartisan amendments in  this legislation. The amendments have the support of both Republicans  and Democrats in strengthening this legislation, making the NDAA more  reflective of the voices and opinions of all Members of the Senate. So  I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for allowing  us--helping us come up with these amendments which tremendously improve  the underlying legislation.   But I must say that we are at an impasse on about four amendments,  all four of which are very important amendments, and we simply can't  get agreement, which will probably call for the majority leader to file  cloture.   I really wish we weren't filing cloture. I wish we were treating  amendments the way we treated the Chair's amendment earlier today.  Every Senator should have the right to speak and to vote on any issue  that comes before this body, and that includes amendments.   Unfortunately, the majority leader will have to file cloture, we will  go through a period of time, and then we will move forward with the  bill, which, in my view, could be finished tomorrow.   The bad news is that not every Senator is able to be heard and able  to file amendments--second-degree, whatever it is. They are going to be  shut out by the cloture procedure. That is not right. It is not right.  Every one of these 100 Senators should be able to vote, to amend, and  to debate. That is what the Senate is supposed to be all about.   There are four basic amendments, and I won't describe them, but I  hope that overnight my colleagues on both sides can sit down and figure  out, as we have on a number of amendments, a way that we can reach a  point where we can have up-or-down votes on these amendments, which are  important to the Nation, particularly when we are talking about the  National Defense Authorization Act.   So I again thank the Senator from Rhode Island, my partner. I thank  him for all the work he is doing and ask him if he has any suggestions  or ideas.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island, and I  thank him for the relationship we have developed over the years.   Here is the deal: We have basically four amendments--which are  important amendments, and I don't mean in any way to denigrate their  importance--that are forcing us to go to a mode where there will be no  other amendments voted on. By failing to reach an agreement, we are  shutting out our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and preventing  them from having their amendments considered. That is why cloture is  not a good thing. Cloture should be an act of desperation, and we  should not be shutting out debate or amendments by any Member of the  Senate.   I have talked a lot about the need to work on a bipartisan basis. I  have talked a lot--let's do the regular order, committee markups,  debate, legislation to the floor, debate, amendments, and then sent to  the President of the United States. I believe we can still do that. I  believe the progress we have made on this bill indicates that. But I  hope my colleagues think about the fact that we ought to be able to  decide, as we have on numerous aspects of this bill on a bipartisan  basis, either to agree or to have those amendments debated and voted  on. What we do when we invoke cloture is we silence Senators. That is  not the way our Founding Fathers envisioned the Senate would function.   But I also would like to say that there are 104 amendments that we  did agree to in a bipartisan fashion. I think we can be very happy  about that. But there are still three or four salient issues that I  wish we could just go ahead and debate and vote on, as we already have  on a couple of very tough issues.   I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation. I thank them for our  ability to get in all of these amendments. I am grateful for the votes  we have taken. I hope that overnight, even though the majority leader  will file cloture--and I support that--we should think overnight if  there are ways of resolving the existing differences--not in agreement  but to move forward with debate and votes.   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I thank my friend from Rhode  Island. I hope we keep upmost in mind that what we are doing here  affects the lives, the welfare, the benefits, and the capabilities of  the finest in our society, the finest in America--the men and women in  uniform.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to hear about the  passing of my friend and former colleague, Senator Pete Domenici, a  great American who dedicated his life and career to public service. I  had the great privilege of serving alongside Pete for many years and  knew him as a gentleman who always behaved in the highest traditions of  the Senate. Pete was a knowledgeable and pragmatic leader who knew how  to reach across the aisle to advance bipartisan solutions to the  Nation's biggest problems. Perhaps the best example of his skill for  compromise was when he negotiated the Nation's last balanced budget in  1997. Pete represented the very best ideals of the U.S. Senate and left  an indelible mark on this Chamber. Cindy and I extend our deepest  condolences to Nancy and the entire Domenici family as they mourn the  loss of a great man.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that LCDR Kevin M.  Ferguson, a congressional defense fellow in my office, be granted floor  privileges for the duration of the Senate's debate on H.R. 2810, the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mike Benitez,  a defense fellow in the office of Senator Rounds, be granted floor  privileges for the duration of the calendar year.
