 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture  is invoked on the Herrnstadt nomination, the vote on confirmation occur  at 5:30 p.m. and that the Senate recess from 4 p.m. until 5:30 p.m.    Madam President, Senators can expect two votes at 5:30  p.m. Those votes would be on the confirmation of the Herrnstadt  nomination and cloture on the Heinzelman nomination to be general  counsel of the CIA.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
