 Mr. Speaker, Representative Ed Perlmutter and I  will be introducing the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act.   In 2017, more than 1.6 million Americans will be diagnosed with  cancer, and many of them are currently repaying their student loans.  For these individuals, a cancer diagnosis goes beyond the exhaustive  treatment and increased medical expenditures and often leads to  unemployment or underemployment. As a response to this growing problem,  I have introduced the Deferment for Active Cancer Treatment Act.   This commonsense bill will enable cancer patients to defer payments  on their public student loans while actively receiving treatment  without interest accruing during this difficult period, helping them,  thusly, to avoid defaults. This measure will also help lenders by  empowering borrowers to continue repaying their public loans after  their treatment ends, leading to fewer defaults.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join Mr. Perlmutter and me  in standing with cancer patients  [[Page H5005]]  throughout our Nation and supporting the Deferment for Active Cancer  Treatment Act.                            ____________________
