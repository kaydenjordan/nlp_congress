 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation to  honor the memory of Marine Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman of Richland,  Washington.   Dietrich grew up in central Washington and had a strong love for the  Pacific Northwest. He had a positive influence on everyone he came into  contact with and a life full of potential.   After high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps with the goal  of becoming part of its Special Operations Command. He bonded with his  brothers in arms, but he remained close friends with his family in  Washington State as he traveled around the world honorably serving his  country.   Sergeant Schmieman achieved his goal and was serving in the 2nd  Raider Battalion at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, when he was  tragically killed in a military cargo plane crash in July of 2017. He  and 15 other servicemembers that passed away will never be forgotten  for their sacrifice.   Dietrich is remembered for his kindness, his sense of adventure and  strong friendships. In honor of his service, I am introducing  legislation, with the support of the entire Washington State delegation  in the House of Representatives, to designate the facility of the  United States Postal Service located on West Van Giesen Street in West  Richland, Washington, as the Sergeant Dietrich Schmieman Post Office.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation to  honor the memory of Sergeant Schmieman, who gave his life for our  Nation.                            ____________________
