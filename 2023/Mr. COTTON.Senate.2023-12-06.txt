 Madam President, I would like to take a few moments to  recognize Maj. Allen ``Sig'' Black who has worked in my Senate office  this year as a defense fellow. Major Black is a patriot who has served  our country nobly and made it a safer and better place. It has been a  pleasure to have him in my office.   Major Black joined the Air Force in 2011 as a distinguished graduate  of the ROTC program at Pennsylvania State University. He began flying  the F-22 fighter aircraft soon after completing the Euro-NATO Joint Jet  Pilot Training in Texas and has since become a masterful Air Force  pilot and knowledgeable authority on virtually every detail of the  Raptor. In total, Major Black served as an operational F-22 pilot for 5  years, deploying for combat operations in Operation Inherent Resolve  and executing numerous homeland and Presidential protection missions.   Prior to moving to Washington, D.C., Major Black spent 3 years at  Edwards Air Force Base in California. There, where he attended the U.S.  Air Force Pilot Test School and left as a distinguished graduate and  the Liethen-Tittle Award winner as the top test pilot graduate in class  19A. While still serving at Edwards, Major Black also distinguished  himself as F-22 command chief pilot and assistant director of  operations of the 411th Flight Test Squadron, 412th Operations Group.   In 2021, Major Black led the F-22 Combined Test Force through 26 F-22  and 20 F-16 developmental test missions and several first-time events.  Twelve of his missions were supporting elevated risk F-22 envelope  expansion tests. For one such mission, Major Black planned and led the  first F-22 high angle of attack test in 17 years while carrying a new  externally podded capability. His success in executing 12 additional  missions evaluating new F-22 software led to the fielding of the first  F-22 Rapid Agile Capability Release operational flight program.   Major Black is a skilled military leader. He directed the No. 1 DOD  weapon program, developed new F-22 open software pathways, and has  helped lead numerous working groups. According to Air Force Materiel  Command, ``The distinctive accomplishments of Major Black reflect great  credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.'' For these  achievements, Major Black was awarded the Lieutenant General Bobby Bond  Memorial Aviator Award, which is the award for the best test pilot of  the year in the entire Air Force.   I could not have been assigned a more talented pilot to join my  office in January 2023, representing the Air Force in Congress as a  Defense Fellow.   During his time in my office, he staffed over 25 high-level  engagements and at least 10 hearings, along with helping draft dozens  of pieces of legislation to strengthen our Nation's defense. He has  also provided meticulous and incisive research that has guided my  office on important public policy questions. His colleagues have been  consistently grateful for his attention to detail, willingness to  diligently analyze problems, and ability to translate complex military  concepts into digestible language. His passion and dedication to making  this great Nation safer was evident each and every day working in the  Senate.   Finally, I cannot honor Major Black without also thanking his family:  his wife Kelsey, his daughter Sloane, and his son Nicholas. I am  grateful to his family for sharing him with my team.   Major Black has had a remarkable career and he has a promising future  ahead. He is exactly the kind of man and leader that our military  needs. For these reasons and many more, I was honored to have Major  Black in my office this year.   Sig, thank you for your service to Arkansas and to the United States  of America.                            ____________________
