 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mikko  Colabe, III, or Clem Fain Sylestine, as he was also known, the  principal chief of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, who passed  away on May 21, 2019, at the age of 91 years.   Chief Colabe, III, was born on November 4, 1927, on the Alabama- Coushatta Indian Reservation and is of the Granddaddy Long Legs Clan.   He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Austin College in Sherman,  Texas, in 1952.   Chief Colabe, III, was a teacher and coach at Southmayd High School,  Holland High School, Shepherd High School, Woodville ISD, and Goodrich  ISD. Although he retired in 1988, Chief Colabe, III, touched so many  lives throughout his time in education.   In addition to the passion that he had for educating children, Chief  Colabe, III, was a distinguished Tribal leader for most of his adult  life. He served as an elected Tribal Council member and then served as  its chairman for many years.   He assumed his chieftainship role in 1995 as the second chief and was  elected as the principal chief in 2014. In serving as the principal  chief, he followed in the footsteps of his father, Bronson Cooper  Sylestine, who served as the chief from 1936 to 1969.   Chief Colabe, III, was a direct descendant of Chief Colabe, who  served as the second chief to Principal Chief Antone in the early  1800s. He was also an elder in the Indian Village Presbyterian Church  on the Alabama-Coushatta Indian Reservation.   As I join the Tribe in their period of mourning through the end of  2019, I want to recognize the impact that he had on so many east Texas  communities.   The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe is an integral part of east Texas.   Mr. Speaker, my prayers and condolences are with his family, his  friends, and the Tribe of Chief Colabe, III.                            ____________________
