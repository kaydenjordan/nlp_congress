 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in  allowing me to speak on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I hear my friend from Texas talking about the booming  stock market and the increase in employment. Actually, the statistics  will bear out that the increase in employment has been a steady line  through the Obama administration. It hasn't spiked. It is just kind of  continuing the slow recovery.   About that stock market, now maybe my friend was distracted for the  last few weeks, but the gains for the entire year disappeared in a  couple of weeks. The uncertainty troubles people who care about the  future of this country.   As the 115th Congress staggers to its conclusion, this rule enshrines  the failure of the Republicans to deal meaningfully with America's  scandalous Tax Code, although promising to reform the Tax Code.                                time  1615    I was one of the people on the Ways and Means Committee who worked  the 8 years they were in charge to try and find areas of bipartisan  cooperation, but they have repeatedly failed at reform. Instead, every  year, they made the Tax Code more complicated and less fair. That came  to a glorious conclusion with their tax scam which made a hash out of  the Tax Code. It means that millions of people actually will pay more.  Irony of irony, Americans trying to deal with a more complicated Tax  Code won't even be able to deduct the accounting expenses to deal with  this monstrosity.   The centerpiece of the 8 years in charge was the tax scam costing  taxpayers $2.3 trillion of additional debt. Now, you would think if we  were going to borrow $2.3 trillion and lavish tax breaks, admittedly on  people who need them the least, that you would think that would at  least be popular. My friend from Massachusetts cited some of the  perceptions of the American public. But what I think is most telling is  that their tax cut that costs the American taxpayer $2.3 trillion in  additional debt was less popular than Bill Clinton's tax increase.   What was supposed to be the centerpiece of a ride to victory in  November ended up being the largest net increase for Democrats since  Watergate, and at the end they weren't touting it. They weren't  campaigning on it.    In fact, if that was such a great idea, don't you  think they would have had a hearing on this bill?   Don't you think they would get their Members involved?   Where are the dozens of Republicans coming to the floor to celebrate  the rule for this flawed piece of legislation?   It is complex, and it is unfair. It is raising taxes on millions,  destabilizing our economic future, and making it harder for us to  compete in the future.   Mr. Speaker, reject the rule, and reject the bill.
