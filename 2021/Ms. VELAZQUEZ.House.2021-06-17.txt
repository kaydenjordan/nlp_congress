 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 256.   Let me first recognize the tireless efforts of Representative Barbara  Lee, who has spearheaded this issue for nearly two decades and has been  the moral conscience in Congress against endless, unjust wars.   The decision to go to war is one of the most profound and  consequential a nation can make. This 2002 AUMF is outdated, and its  repeal will end its legal authority to justify U.S. intervention in  Iraq.   Under the Constitution, Congress has the sole duty to declare war. By  repealing this authorization today, we are working to return this power  back to the people's House and the Senate. That is how a checks and  balances system works.
