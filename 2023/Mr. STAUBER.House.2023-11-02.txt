 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  4821, the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations  Act for fiscal year 2024.   This year's appropriations bill is a win for Minnesota's Eighth  Congressional District and our Nation.   It is abundantly clear that the Biden administration has an anti- mining, anti-farmer, anti-American worker, and anti-energy independence  agenda. This bill stops that agenda in its tracks.   The Department of the Interior's mineral withdrawal in northeast  Minnesota forces us to be dependent on Chinese-owned, child-labor-using  mines in the Congo. This bill stops that agenda.   The Biden administration's WOTUS rule that punishes farmers for  puddles in their fields, this bill repeals the WOTUS rule.   The EPA's abuse of the Endangered Species Act to list the northern  long-eared bat, which has stifled responsible logging and forest  management, this bill stops and reverses that.   Mr. Chairman, I am proud that we finally have a commonsense funding  bill that puts American workers and rural America first.   Mr. Chairman, additionally, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge  that this bill also provides funding for critical infrastructure  projects in Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District, including  wastewater treatment projects in Bemidji, Braham, and Silver Bay,  Minnesota.                                time  1115    Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairwoman Granger, Chairman Simpson, and my  colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for all their hard work on  this legislation. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting  this legislation.
