 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I rise today in opposition to this legislation that would legalize  abortion on demand up until the moment of birth.   As a physician, I first swore an oath to do no harm. As legislators,  we cannot, in good conscience, vote to pass legislation that would  claim the lives of unborn children in late-term abortions.   This poorly written legislation would put our Nation alongside  countries like China and North Korea by allowing discriminatory  abortions based on sex, based on race, even based on disability. This  is unacceptable, and it is gut-wrenching that Congress would even  consider passing such legislation.   This abortion on demand act would override pro-life laws passed in  our States and prohibit State-level elected officials from passing  legislation to protect unborn children in our communities.   It is time for all Members of Congress to vote against this poorly  written bill.    It is time for all Members of Congress to  vote against this poorly written bill. I urge a ``no'' vote.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two articles, ``Democrats  Launch Ads in Lifestyle Mags in All Out Push for Abortion'' from the  Daily Caller and ``Ohio Right to Life Says Offices Targeted Twice by  Pro-Abortion Vandals with Rocks, Spray Paint'' from FOX News.  [[Page H6642]]                        [From the Daily Caller, July 13, 2022]    Democrats Launch Ads In Lifestyle Mags In All Out Push For Abortion                              (By Mary Rooke)         The Democratic National Committee (DNC) launched a digital       ad campaign Tuesday in several lifestyle magazines telling       readers that Republicans want to outlaw abortion nationwide.        The DNC purchased at least $10,000 in digital ads in over       20 lifestyle publications to focus on abortion rights issues       as the midterms approach, the Associated Press reported.        Magazines like Teen Vouge, Elle, Refinery29, Essence, GQ,       Esquire, Men's Health, Cosmopolitan and Glamour, hosted the       DNC's ads, reported the AP.        The ad showed Republican Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell next       to blue, pink, and white lettering that read: ``Republicans       are pushing to ban abortion nationally. Join us in fighting       back,'' according to the report.        The DNC is looking to launch a separate abortion-centered       ad campaign with plans to spend six figures, reported the AP.        The DNC's ads promoting a ``week of action'' to defend       abortion are in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision       to overturn Roe v. Wade, sending abortion law-making back to       the state legislatures.        ``With this Defend Choice Week of Action, we're giving       people across the country a chance to turn their anger into       action by holding anti-choice Republicans accountable and       helping to elect Democrats,'' DNC chair Jaime Harrison said,       according to the AP.        The DNC held a virtual launch for its ``all-hands-on-deck       effort to defend choice'' on Tuesday night, according to the       DNC website.        ``This fight isn't over and we need all hands on deck. This       event will serve as the kickoff for our Week of Action, which       we'll highlight how to get involved with on the call,'' The       DNC event description stated.        The latest Associated Press-NORC poll released Friday       showed that only 16% of Americans feel abortion is the       biggest issue facing the U.S. In comparison, 40% of U.S.       adults said they were more worried about inflation and 33%       said gas prices, according to the poll.        The survey polled, 1,053 adults nationwide from June 23-27       with a margin of error of       +/-4.0%.                                   ____                        [From Fox News, July 13, 2022]  Ohio Right to Life Says Offices Targeted Twice by Pro-Abortion Vandals                          With Rocks, Spray Paint                              (By Emma Colton)         Dozens of pro-life centers have been targeted across the       country since a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion signaled       Roe V. Wade would be overturned In May, followed by the       nation's highest court ultimately ruling as such in June.        For one pro-life organization in Ohio, it has been targeted       twice since last month.        ``As pro-lifers, we know that our work might cost us       something and that very well could be our physical safety,''       the executive director of the Right to Life of Northeast Ohio       Allie Frazier told Fox News Digital. ``I think that it's       important in moments like this for the pro-life movement to       be really clear that we're not going to be intimidated. We       will save babies. We will protect women. And we're not going       to let threats of violence stop us from doing that.''        Offices for the Right to Life of Northeast Ohio were most       recently targeted on July 8, Frazier said, when al least one       suspect was caught on camera lobbing rocks at the building,       breaking windows and spray-painting menacing messages.        ``If abortion isn't safe, neither are you,'' the suspect,       who was seen wearing a face mask, scrawled on the sidewalk of       the offices. The phrase has been spray-painted at similar       offices across the country, often by members of pro-abortion       extremist group Jane's Revenge.        Frazier said it's likely that Jane's Revenge is behind this       attack, noting that among other spray-painted messages, the       name ``Jane'' was written on the ground.        ``I think It would be easy for a situation like this to be       a copycat scenario. But as far as I'm concerned, if any pro-      abortion individual decides to take that next step, to take       that bad step, and use violence against pro-lifers, that is       something that I am going to work hard to protect my staff       against,'' she said.        The incident was reported to the Akron Police Department,       Frazier said. The Akron Police Department has not responded       to multiple Fox News inquiry requests on the matter.        Frazier said that the damage caused by the vandalism was       ``significant,'' but ``undoable,'' noting that repairs were       being made to the broken windows as she spoke to Fox News       Digital.        ``I know that the intention of this attack was to stop us.       It was to stop our peaceful activism. It was to stop the ways       that we are impacting women and babies in this community for       a positive. And they didn't even stop that. I was already       back to work in my office within a few hours,'' she said.        It was the second time the offices were targeted, Frazier       said. Activists posted pro-abortion posters at the office on       June 24, the day Roe was officially overturned, hung a coat       hanger on an office door knob, and rang a Ring security       camera before flashing a middle finger to the camera,       according to Frazier.        She said that the attacks pro-life centers have recently       faced should ``100%'' be investigated as hate crimes.        ``(Pro-abortion vandals] are not afraid of using violence       to get what they want. This is absolutely a threat against       the peaceful pro-life movement. And we do ask that law       enforcement and local, state, and federal leaders continue to       lead the way and say, `Hey, violence is never okay,' '' she       said.        Pro-life activists have repeatedly called on Presiden1       Biden to forcefully condemn the attacks on pregnancy centers       and churches, including Frazier who called on the president       to not ``be complicit in this violence.''        ``Regardless of how people feel on the issue of abortion,       everybody should be able to condemn acts of violence against       peaceful nonprofits. Whether that's an advocacy organization       like Right to Life of Northeast Ohio, or a pro-life pregnancy       center that are literally meeting the needs of women and       babies in crisis,'' she told Fox News Digital.        The White House has previously condemned the violence at       pro-life centers but has come under scrutiny for not doing       more.        ``Instead of supporting and defending more pro-life       pregnancy centers that provide health care and support to       women at every stage of life, President Joe Biden and the       Left are working to dismantle the work of these amazing       centers. They won't strongly condemn the violence and threats       pregnancy centers are facing,'' the Republican House Energy       and Commerce Committee posted on Tuesday, demanding Biden       ``MUST condemn the violence and threats.''        Dozens of pro-life centers have faced attack since May,       including a pro-life Christian pregnancy center in Buffalo,       New York, that was allegedly ``firebombed,'' and a pregnancy       center in Dearborn, Michigan, that saw every ``window and       door along the front face of our building'' smashed.        Jane's Revenge has taken responsibility for a handful of       the attacks and declared ``open season'' on pro-life       pregnancy crisis centers in a letter published last month.        ``We offered an honourable way out,'' the letter read.       ``You could have walked away. Now the leash is off. And we       will make it as hard as possible for your campaign of       oppression to continue.''        But to Frazier, the pro-life movement will remain unchanged       and committed to protecting women and babies.        ``We must be willing to do what it takes to protect women       and babies and be ready to take any backlash from that . . .       Don't be afraid. We got this,'' she said of her message to       pro-life Americans, adding that pro-lifers can also reach out       to their local pregnancy centers to check in on staff and see       if they need any additional resources.     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   When I was in medical school, I learned about the development and the  journey of a child in the womb of the mother.   Madam Speaker, let me review that journey with you today. At 6 weeks,  a child is developing a mouth, nose, ears, and--most important--a  heartbeat of their own. At 12 weeks, a baby has fingers and toes.   Continue on this journey with me. At 15 weeks, a baby can sense light  and even has taste buds. At 19 weeks, a child can hear and knows the  voice of their mother.   These lives are precious, and they must be protected.   By 22 weeks, many babies can survive outside the womb if they are  born prematurely.   Clearly, these are human lives. Clearly, we in Congress have an  obligation to protect these human lives.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and support  all human life. It is time for us to stand up for the American people  and to stand up for all human life.
