 Mr. Speaker, this past Friday, I joined  Secretary Scalia of the Department of Labor on a trip to North  Carolina's Fifth District to meet with local business leaders and  frontline workers.   The events we attended at Innovation Quarter, Forsyth Technical  Community College, and Lowes Foods came together in record time, and it  is a  [[Page H3097]]  clear reflection of Secretary Scalia's and his staff's commitment to  witnessing North Carolina's economic drivers in action.   COVID-19 has impacted North Carolina in many ways, but the resiliency  of our State's frontline workers and businesses, which we witnessed on  a firsthand basis, continues to propel North Carolina in the right  direction.   Mr. Speaker, no matter the challenge, the American people rise  together. The men and women I was privileged to meet on this trip are  the epitome of American resiliency in action. Though they are not  recognized in the media for their tireless work, they show up to work  every day with the same goal: to support their communities.   We still have work to do on the local, State, and Federal levels to  combat COVID-19 and to restore our economy, and I am certain progress  will continue to be made on all fronts.                                time  0915    As a Nation, we have overcome monumental challenges before, and we  will do it again with the same spirit and grit we have always had.   The great American comeback is unfolding before our very eyes, and  the progress we have seen to date is undeniable.   Look to the performance of the stock market, the recent jobs report,  the multitude of businesses reopening their doors to the public across  the country, and the skyrocketing innovation that has been spearheaded  by the private sector.   Many times I have come to the floor and spoken about American  resiliency. I have highlighted businesses in my district, constituents  who have stepped up to the plate in their communities, and the  unwavering spirit of frontline workers.   Resiliency, in and of itself, has no designated boundaries. It does  not ebb and flow or wax and wane. It is a trait that is engrained  within our work and within our values as Americans. We will continue to  work until this virus is defeated, and we will come out stronger and  more resilient than ever before.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Ruth Kelley, an exemplary student from Kernersville, North Carolina,  who was selected to be part of the National Youth Orchestra of the  United States.   Every year, thousands of students submit applications to take part in  the National Youth Orchestra, and only 200 applicants are selected.  This, without question, is an amazing achievement.   In this program administered by Carnegie Hall, young musicians are  exposed to digital learning, mentorship, and performances by principal  players from top American orchestras. Additionally, participants are  invited to take private lessons, studio sectionals, and master classes  to perfect their craft.   Congratulations to Ruth. I am confident this experience will propel  her to new heights and teach her lessons she will carry with her into  her future career.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the flaws of this amendment as  ranking member of the Committee on Education and Labor, which has  jurisdiction over the Federal student loans.   Federal student loans dominate the education loan marketplace, with  roughly 92 percent of all outstanding student loans.   Mr. Speaker, proponents of Big Government have succeeded in offering  the most generous loan terms in the marketplace, but the private  student loan marketplace hasn't made the same mistakes the Federal  Government has. The private student loan companies underwrite their  investments. Their model fosters student success because that is the  only way they, as a business, can succeed.   It was stated earlier that students had to make payments on their  loans in the past few months. Well, that is what they agreed to do and  what all borrowers agree to do, Mr. Speaker. That is the way it works.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment which will  complete the government takeover of the student loan industry and, in  the process, fail to set students up for success.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by the gentlewoman from North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the amendment under consideration is, first and  foremost, bad for borrowers but is also another partisan attempt to  complete the socialist takeover of the student loan marketplace.   This debate detracts from the underlying bill's important work of  providing for the national defense. In a functioning Congress, this  student loan policy dispute would be reserved for the committee of  jurisdiction, not the National Defense Authorization Act.   While the amendment may sound beneficial to private loan borrowers,  it inserts the Federal Government into private transactions in which  neither party asked for assistance.   The authors of this amendment assume prior education loan borrowers  are all struggling to meet their obligation and that borrowers need a  year-long reprieve from making their agreed-upon payments.   The fact is, private student loan borrowers must typically go through  rigorous underwriting standards and find a cosigner before taking on  debt. These critical features lead to a much better performing  portfolio than the Federal student loan program. Only 2.7 percent of  private student loans are in default, compared with the Federal student  loan cohort default rate of over 10 percent. There are existing options  like forbearance to weather the storm without Federal Government  interference.   Indeed, there are many examples of private student loan companies  creating COVID-19-specific relief options for their borrowers. That is  the beauty of a competitive marketplace. When there is consumer demand,  the market incentive will generate creative solutions.   The truth is, borrowers benefit from making consistent payments and  paying off their debt as quickly as possible. Congressional mandates to  block this healthy habit can have negative outcomes for the borrowers.   Furthermore, the proposal would not reimburse private lenders for  this forced hiatus, which would likely lead to a collapse of the  industry and complete the Federal takeover of student loans.   I urge my colleagues to object to the inclusion of this misguided  policy. We can and must do better for students across the country. The  best way we can serve our constituents is to have a robust debate  within the proper committees of jurisdiction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   This amendment is bad policy. It involves the Federal Government in  completely private transactions and attempts to solve a problem the  facts suggest does not exist.   Again, the people who borrowed this money agreed to pay it back. They  are not victims.   This is a trend of our colleagues never to hold people responsible  for their actions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the amendment under consideration seeks to punish a  small business because it had the audacity to try to help military and  veteran students achieve their educational and career potential.   The amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to deny proprietary  colleges and universities permission to operate the DOD educational  assistance programs if such an institution of higher ed receives more  than 90 percent of its revenue from ``Federal education assistance  funds.'' Federal education assistance funds include DOD tuition  assistance, GI Bill benefits, and all Federal student aid in the Higher  Education Act, like Pell Grants and student loans.   Congress should not deny educational choices to military  servicemembers because of arbitrary accounting gimmicks based on the  whims of Congress. Sadly, that is exactly what this amendment would do  if passed and implemented.   What is particularly damaging about the amendment is it seeks to  judge institutions on how students pay for  [[Page H3511]]  school and not on the success of the students. This is not what good,  fair accountability looks like.   Mr. Speaker, I believe in accountability for all institutions, no  matter their tax status. If this accountability framework is so great  for students, then my colleagues should not mind applying the  accounting standard to all institutions.   But that is not what this is about. This is about putting hardworking  Americans out of business. Students are an afterthought in Democrats'  zeal to eliminate for-profit colleges.   My colleagues would like you to believe that for-profit colleges act  only to pad their bottom lines at the expense of students. This belief  comes from a fundamental misunderstanding about the goals and aims of a  business.   Any successful small business owner can tell you that cutting corners  and delivering an inferior product to customers in the hopes of making  a bit more money will only result in fewer customers and less business.   The profit motive, in fact, is a powerful incentive for proprietary  colleges to act in the best short- and long-term interests of students.  That is why you see several for-profit institutions spending all the  money received from the CARES Act on direct student aid. Without a  reputation for delivering successful results, these colleges would  cease to exist.   Additionally, this amendment has the perverse incentive of forcing  colleges to increase their tuition, thereby shutting out opportunities  for students who might be unable to afford these increases.   We should not be putting forward additional harmful regulations that  cause college costs to increase. Instead, we should be looking to  provide incentives to decrease costs while also judging all  institutions based on how they improve the lives of the students they  serve.    I urge all Members to reject the inclusion of this amendment. Vote  ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    The gentleman from California has no time  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   We have heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that  for-profit institutions, proprietary schools, are taking advantage of  veterans, in particular. The bottom line is this amendment is arbitrary  and is not a meaningful accountability tool.   Let me point out that the University of Maryland University College,  which recently changed its name--I hear it advertising every morning on  the radio--actively recruits and enrolls many, many veterans, a very  high percentage of veterans, and is a university supported by the  taxpayers of Maryland, along with Federal taxpayers.                                time  2000    But it has for many, many years had a graduation rate less than 10  percent. I don't hear my colleagues talking about, again, other  institutions which have abysmal graduation rates and serve many  veterans being held to the same accountability measures. This is not  fair.   We hear a lot about fairness from our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle. Let's be fair. Let's apply the rules to everyone--everyone-- Mr. Speaker.   Our students, particularly the brave men and women in uniform,  deserve better from us no matter where they might choose to continue  their education. So let's be fair. Let's make the rules the same for  everyone. Let's not go after institutions that have been in existence,  some for hundreds of years, because our colleagues don't like groups of  people that make a profit.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
