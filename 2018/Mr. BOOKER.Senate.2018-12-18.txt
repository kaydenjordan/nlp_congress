 Would the Senator yield?   I wish to express my gratitude on the floor. I have been here in the  Senate for almost exactly 5 years, and Senator Durbin and Senator  Grassley have been nothing short of heroic, in my eyes, in consistently  working the entire 5 years to get us to this point where we are, to use  a football metaphor, on the 1-yard line in getting this over.  Obviously, Senator Mike Lee and Senator Whitehouse have also been in  that category.   You did an incredibly good job of laying out that we have amendments  that go counter to the victims groups and to their interests and to  their well-being, their often emotional well-being, being  retraumatized, forced to be back out there.   But I want to ask you a question about that last amendment Cotton is  making about that so-called exclusion list, people who won't be  eligible for particular programs before they are released. In other  words, there are programs they can enroll in while they are in prison  that would ultimately shave a little bit of time off their sentences.  These programs, though--I would like you to maybe go into them because  they are evidence-based programs that actually lower recidivism rates,  and they save taxpayer money. The idea behind this--maybe you could  explain it--is to make sure that when people are released, they don't  come back. In other words, if they don't get into these programs, it is  more likely that those very people he has tried to exclude might come  back. Can you explain why these programs are important and why they  make sense?    Mr. President, I want to thank the Presiding Officer and  acknowledge my friend, whom I deeply admire, sitting in the chair. It  is great to give this short speech in front of him. It is good to see  the Presiding Officer, my friend.   I want to say good afternoon to everyone, and this is a moment in  which I want to give a sense of gratitude.   I want to thank my colleagues for their incredible work and  leadership and, especially, recognize the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley. I want to thank Senator Dick Durbin,  who has been a hero of mine on the issue of criminal justice reform, as  well as Mike Lee, who has been a champion, all of their staffs,  everyone who is involved in the tireless work and effort that has been  going on in what is the pending bill on the floor before us now, the  FIRST STEP Act.   I also want to recognize the incredible people--many of them  advocates, many of them citizens, many of them activists. So many of  the groups have been pushing, challenging, demanding that we have  criminal justice reform in this country. A lot of these groups have  been organized and working for years and years--years before I came to  the Senate--to try to bring forward criminal justice reform. They  brought insight, wisdom, and they helped to shape this legislation.  Their advocacy has made this a better bill.   It is because of the work and the diversity of voices that have been  involved in this process that we stand poised today to pass this bill,  to begin to deliver some reforms to our savagely broken criminal  justice system.   I am proud of this coalition. I am proud that the coalition has  people all across the political spectrum. I am proud that the coalition  has people from diverse backgrounds. This is how change has been made  in this country for generations.   I want to return to the fact that we are poised to pass this bill  because of the deeply, savagely broken criminal justice system that we  have.   Since 1980 alone, our Federal prison population has exploded by 800  percent. There has been an 800-percent increase in our prison  population. This is because of failed policies by this body that  created harsh sentencing, harsh mandatory minimum penalties--three  strikes and you are out. These are the bills that caused this exploding  population of prisoners to become the largest in terms of percentage on  the planet Earth.   America is now the preeminent incarceration Nation. We are the  incarcerating capital of the planet Earth. Even though we only have 5  percent of the world's population, one in four of the incarcerated  people on the planet are in the United States of America. One in three  of all incarcerated women on the planet Earth are here in the United  States of America.   Today, close to one-third of all adults in the United States have a  criminal record. We have criminalized the United States population.  About one-third of Americans have a criminal record.  [[Page S7763]]    After decades of failed Federal policies and after decades of going  in the wrong direction, we now have an opportunity to reverse course in  a significant way.   Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is an affront to  whom we say we are as a nation. We profess--we swear an oath to the  flag that we are a nation of ``liberty and justice for all,'' but our  criminal justice system violates those values.   I believe you can tell a lot about a nation--not by its buildings,  not by its structures or its wealth, but you can tell a lot about the  true character of a nation by looking at its prisons and seeing whom  they incarcerate. You can go to countries with authoritarian regimes  and see how they imprison their political opposition. You can go to  some countries and see they actually incarcerate members of the media.  We don't do that in the United States.   In this country, if you go into our prisons and our jails, you see,  overwhelmingly, that we incarcerate those who are marginalized in our  society, those who are vulnerable in our society. Overwhelmingly, in  the United States, our prisons and jails are full of those Americans  who are already hurting and struggling and often need more help than a  system that hurts them. Our prisons and jails have become warehouses  for people who are struggling with trauma, struggling with disease,  struggling with illness. Right now, our prisons and jails are filled  overwhelmingly with people with mental illness, overwhelmingly with  Americans struggling with addiction, overwhelmingly with Americans who  are survivors of sexual assault, and also overwhelmingly, it is full of  Americans who are low-income, poor folks and people who are  disproportionately people of color.   This is a system in our country that feeds upon certain communities  and not others. The War on Drugs--which has fueled so much of the  explosion of our prison population--has really been a war on certain  people and certain communities and not on others. I am the only Senator  who lives in a majority Black and Brown community. It is low income,  but I can tell you right now, my community does not mistake wealth with  worth. I live in an inner-city community, and when I go home at the end  of most weeks, I draw strength from my community. I see evidence of the  incredible growth that has occurred. These are good people in a city.  They pull together, work together, and can accomplish more things than  other people who are disrespecting, disregarding, and just plain  dissing them don't think is possible. I am proud of my community.   Despite all the work that has been done in the city of Newark, I  still live in a community that is both overcriminalized and  underprotected because of Federal policies--because of policies in this  body that mistake severity of a punishment with the actual security of  a people. We know there is no deeper proclivity to commit crime among  people of color, but there is a much deeper bias in the way our drug  laws have been and are being applied, which disproportionately target  people of color and low-income communities.   We have a system that for over a century, we as a nation have  overcome slavery--decades of Jim Crow--but author Michelle Alexander  calls our criminal justice system ``The New Jim Crow'' because of its  disproportionate impact on people of color. We now have a criminal  justice system where there are more African-American men under criminal  supervision than there were enslaved in 1850. This is a punishing  reality that I have seen with my own eyes, where people in certain  privileged communities don't face the kind of scrutiny, the kind of  arrests that you do in other communities in our country.   The truth about human beings is that all of us make mistakes. That is  an inevitable part of life, but the way our country's drug laws are  designed and applied, a kid in a more privileged community or on a  college campus gets a chance to stumble--to learn a lesson. There is a  wide margin for error, but a kid living in a community that is low  income or a community that is Black and Brown, gets trapped by a system  that disproportionately impacts their lives more than it does others.   Bryan Stevenson said we live in a nation ``that treats you better if  you are rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent.''   In the USA, we see Americans getting trapped in a system where the  data is clear. There is no difference between Blacks and Whites for  using drugs or selling drugs in the USA. There is no difference, but if  you are Black, you are almost four times more likely to get arrested  for selling drugs and almost three times more likely to be arrested for  possession of drugs. This is one of the things that has led to such a  dramatic racial disparity in incarceration in the USA. People right now  in our country are sitting in prisons for doing things that two of the  last three Presidents admitted doing, but they encounter a different  type of justice system. The scales of justice in America are not  balanced. This is a system that hurts people, and it hurts people who  are often already struggling, often already hurt.   What we do to people in this country with a nonviolent drug offense  is like getting a life sentence for the rest of your life. Even after  you have come out of a prison sentence or even if you received no time  served at all, once you are convicted of a nonviolent drug offense-- again, like people in this body and in the White House have done  before, potentially in this body; I am making no accusations--but once  you have been convicted of a crime, for the rest of your life, if you  are one of those folks who has been convicted of a nonviolent drug  offense, you have to check a box that says you are going to have  difficulty being hired, you are going to have difficulty getting  housing. You can't get many business licenses. You can't get food  stamps. You can't get a loan from the bank. The American Bar  Association points to 40,000 collateral consequences that come with a  criminal conviction in this country--40,000 collateral consequences  that follow you for life for a criminal conviction.    We are debating a funding bill that is dominating the news, but we  are already throwing an exorbitant amount of taxpayer dollars into the  black hole of mass incarceration. That is not making us safer, and it  is not making us stronger. In fact, it is making us a more vulnerable  community.   We have been using more government resources--not to offer more  support for law enforcement, not to offer more opportunities for  Americans to get mental health care, not to help more folks get access  to drug treatment, not to rehabilitate people, but we have been  spending more and more money actually hurting more Americans by putting  them into a system that actually harms them more often than helps them  with their addiction, with their mental health issue, with their  trauma. We are using our resources to compound hurt and harm that  people have already endured to incarcerate more Americans than ever  before in our history, which ultimately makes our neighborhoods and  communities one that is like mine: less safe, not more.   Despite the fact that our infrastructure in this country is  crumbling--that our trains and roads and bridges are in desperate need  of repair--we have been investing in a different type of  infrastructure. Between 1990 and 2005, a new prison in this country has  been opened every 10 days. We spend billions of dollars for the  construction of prisons and jails to warehouse human potential: folks  who often need help, need counseling, need mental health care, need  rehabilitation. We have been taking the far more expensive way and  warehousing human beings in our prisons and jails instead of helping  them.   We call this system a justice system. It is not meant to be a system  of retribution; it is meant to be a justice system. It is not meant to  be a system of punishment only; it is meant to be a justice system. We  are Americans. We have ideals of restoration and rehabilitation.  Ultimately, in the United States of America, we all believe this is a  nation where redemption is possible.   One of our former Senate colleagues who stood in this same well got  into a lot of trouble in his youth. He was convicted of multiple  crimes--crimes like arson and assault. He attacked a police officer. He  actually became one of the most serious outspoken advocates for  restoring this broken system. It was Senator Alan Simpson. This is what  he once wrote. He said:         I was lucky that the bullets I stole from a hardware store       as a teenager and fired from  [[Page S7764]]       my .22-caliber rifle never struck anyone. I was fortunate       that the fires I set never hurt anyone. I heard my wake-up       call and listened--and I went on to have many opportunities       to serve my country and my community.        When a young person is sent ``up the river,'' we need to       remember that all rivers can change course.    He went from an arsonist, a person who attacked police officers, and  a person who was admittedly guilty of crimes to a Senator because we  are a nation that believes in redemption. The fact is, when most people  go to prison, 95 percent of those folks right now in State prisons will  come back to our communities. The question is, Will they come out  further harmed by the system or better able to start again, better able  to avoid more criminality or will they be people who actually help to  make us safer and stronger, to be elevated toward that ideal of full  citizenship?   Those of us in this body who proclaim Christian faith know the story  of the prodigal child, that child who did wrong, but yet when he came  back, his father embraced him. That story is held in the Christian  community as an ideal, but what do we do in America? Is it the story of  the prodigal child? It is not because this is a system that right now  inflicts harm on those incarcerated rather than trying to rehabilitate  them.   This is a system that still subjects young people to what other  countries and human rights activists in this Nation call torture:  juvenile solitary confinement. This is a system that, in some places,  still denies women access to basic sanitary products. This is a system  that, in some places, still allows the shackling of pregnant women  during birth.   This is a system that burdens families, hurting them economically and  fracturing entire communities like the one I live in. It is a system  that inflicts poverty by concentrating its attacks on low-income  neighborhoods. In fact, according to a study from Villanova University,  the poverty rate in all of America would be 20 percent lower if we had  incarceration rates in line with our industrial peers. This system, as  a whole, is a cancer on the soul of our country, and it is hurting  every single American.   Today we have an opportunity to do something about addressing the  ills of this system. That is why I am proud this is a bipartisan  compromise bill with extraordinary leadership on both sides of the  aisle, saying: Hey, there are things we need to begin to correct for  this system. There are ways to make this system more fair. There are  ways to make this system better reflect our collective values and  ideals.   Because of this collection of work done over the last years, this  bill includes critical sentencing reform that will reduce mandatory  minimums and give judges discretion back--not legislators but judges  who sit and see the totality of the facts.   Thanks to the work of Senator Durbin, the racially biased crack  cocaine sentencing disparity has already been negotiated down from 100  to 1 to 18 to 1. It should be equal. It should be 1 to 1, but we made  progress. The problem was the change wasn't retroactively applied.  Because of that, there are people sitting in jail right now for selling  an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy bar who have watched  people come in and leave jail for selling enough drugs to fill a  suitcase. We never made this change retroactive. That is not justice.  Making this fix in this bill alone will mean that thousands of  Americans who have more than served their time will become eligible for  release, and it addresses some of the racial disparities in our system  because 90 percent of the people who will benefit from that are African  Americans; 96 percent are Black and Latino.   The bill includes a provision that I have worked on for the past 4  years that will effectively end the use of juvenile solitary  confinement among young people under Federal supervision.   This bill also takes an important step but still an incomplete step  in reforming the way women are treated behind bars. This bill will  ensure that incarcerated women will have access to free sanitary  products, and it will ban the shackling of pregnant incarcerated women.  Last year, I introduced a bill that includes this reform, among others,  and I am happy to see it now as part of this legislation.   Can we do more? Yes. This legislation is the product of compromise.  This legislation is just one step in the right direction. If we pass  this legislation, it will be a step in the right direction and I hope  will be the momentum for greater, urgently needed reforms that will be  supported by conservatives in this country and progressives.   Let's make no mistake. This legislation, which is one small step,  will affect thousands and thousands of lives. Those are not just some  people. When you affect the lives of some Americans on issues of  justice, you affect the lives of all Americans because we as a people  cannot fall into that trap of separateness, the insidious idea that we  think that there are some throwaway people whose dignity we can assault  without assaulting our own.   Dr. King said, ``Justice is indivisible,'' and he was right. We  cannot separate a system of oppression in our country and think that it  won't affect us all as a whole. It could not be further from the truth.  You cannot deny justice, deny dignity to any American without its  affecting us all. You cannot cheapen justice for some without its  cheapening the justice of us all.   As a man much greater than anyone in this body once said, ``Injustice  anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' We are all caught in an  inescapable network of mutuality that is tied in a common garment. We  cannot suffer the illusion of separation when we think this criminal  justice system that is so punishing of some is not hurting this country  as a whole. Our criminal justice system, as it stands right now, is a  gaping, self-inflicted wound. This bill is a step--a step--towards  healing.   It has been perhaps one of the greatest honors of my life--easily one  of the greatest honors as a Senator--to have worked in a bipartisan  coalition over the last 5 years to get to this point. I have had the  opportunity to sit down with people in common cause--from Republicans  on the far end of the conservative spectrum to individuals with whom  and organizations that on most other issues, I often disagree. Yet we  have found common ground because this system is an affront to our most  fundamental common values on both sides of the aisle--the value of  freedom, the value of liberty, the value of equality, the value of  fairness, and the value of justice. We share those common values  because we still live in a nation in which the ties that bind us are  stronger than the lines that divide us.   This bill is a recognition of the fact that we are bound together as  a people by the most precious ideals and humanity--the ideals that were  put forth by our Founders, which have been aspired to in every  generation and have been worked on in every generation to make us a  more perfect Union.   We know that our Nation's history--the bills and debates we have seen  in this very body--is scarred by many wretched injustices--slavery and  the denial of universal suffrage, Jim Crow and segregation. Like  people--individuals who have done wrong in the past--our Nation has  demonstrated the capacity to change. We as a nation have demonstrated  the capacity to improve. Like people, we have demonstrated as a nation  the capacity to redeem ourselves. None of us should ever be judged by  the least of what we have done but, instead, by our ability and our  capacity to find redemption.   Every generation has worked to make our ideals more true and real,  which makes the dream more accessible to us all. We have stood for each  other and have worked with each other. We have sacrificed with each  other despite our differences in race and differences in color and  differences in religion and creed. Every single great gain in this  country has been made by multiethnic, multiracial, broad-based  coalitions because we recognize the ideal that is above the President's  desk, written in stone here, which is the ideal of E pluribus unum-- ``out of many, one.'' We know that it is not just a slogan, that those  aren't just words; it is a calling to the people of this country.   I want to see more than the bill we have today. I know we can do more  than just this bill we have today, but this is a first step. It is a  necessary step. For the sake of thousands of Americans whose lives will  be directly  [[Page S7765]]  affected, this is a step in the right direction. I hope that we all  come together and make this first step our momentum on the journey. We  have work to do in this country, and I am proud to have been a part of  what can be an historic step in the right direction. May our work  continue.   I yield the floor.
