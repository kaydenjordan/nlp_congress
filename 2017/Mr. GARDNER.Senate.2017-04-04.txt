 Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to come to  the floor today in support of Judge Neil Gorsuch's confirmation to the  Supreme Court. As a Coloradan, it gives me great honor to be here to  talk about his nomination, the exceptional qualities of Judge Gorsuch,  and how he will make us proud from the bench of the U.S. Supreme Court.   I also commend my colleague, Chairman Chuck Grassley, for his work on  the Judiciary Committee presiding over a very fair series of hearings,  giving members on both sides of the aisle time to learn about Judge  Gorsuch, to question Judge Gorsuch, and the time to present their side  of the argument depending on whatever side that was going to be.  Because of the fairness of the hearings, because of the fairness with  which Chairman Grassley executed the hearings, it is quite obvious that  this Chamber is faced with a very exceptional judge, a very exceptional  nominee, and a nominee there is really no excuse to vote against.   Neil Gorsuch really is about the story of the West. He is a fourth- generation Coloradan. It is nice to stand here and talk about somebody  who shares so much of our western experience and western heritage and  somebody who serves on the Tenth Circuit Court in Denver--a circuit  court that represents 20 percent of the land mass of the United States.   Neil Gorsuch's background and upbringing in Colorado represent the  hard work of westerners. His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joseph McGill,  began his adult life by working in Union Station, the main railway  terminal in downtown Denver. Dr. McGill put himself through medical  school and went on to become a prominent surgeon. His grandmother,  Dorothy Jean, raised seven children, all of whom he gave a better life  and put through college because of his work in Colorado.   Neil's paternal grandfather, John Gorsuch, was his legal inspiration.  After serving in World War I, John Gorsuch put himself through  undergrad and law school at the University of Denver by driving a  trolley car back in the trolley car days of Denver. John, his  grandfather, helped to build a private law practice that focused on  real estate law. He made time to help Denver's welfare department and  participated in Kiwanis and numerous other civic organizations,  building a legendary law firm in Denver known as Gorsuch Kirgis.   This is the kind of upbringing that made Neil Gorsuch who he is. In  his younger days, Neil moved furniture, shoveled snow, like so many of  us in Colorado, mowed lawns. It was the kind of upbringing that brings  grit and determination to any person who knows hard work. It is that  work ethic, combined with his family's appreciation of higher  education, that helped Neil consistently realize academic excellence.  It has been debated on this floor numerous times, his academic  credentials that he would bring to the Supreme Court--his background  and education at Columbia, law school at Harvard, his Ph.D. at Oxford,  and of course, most importantly, the summer he spent at the University  of Colorado and the teaching he carries out at the University of  Colorado School of Law.   This week, we are going to see a lot of finger-pointing and hear a  lot of accusations. We are going to hear a lot of blame. The one thing  we may not hear too much about is the person we are debating--Neil  Gorsuch. That is because when it comes to Judge Gorsuch, people  understand the highly qualified judge that he is. People understand the  incredible legal mind he would bring to the Supreme Court. Instead of  debating the merits of the nominee, they are going to debate how we got  to the place we are today, and by the end of this week, architects of  obstruction may force this Chamber to vote along partisan lines on  something that should be a bipartisan effort.   In Colorado, if you go to downtown Denver, you will see an area known  as Confluence Park. Confluence Park is a great place in Colorado where  people go to spend an afternoon and perhaps a weekend on a hot summer's  day. It is where two rivers join together. There at Confluence Park,  Colorado's poet laureate, Thomas Hornsby Ferril, has a poem inscribed  on a plaque, which reads:         I wasn't here. Yet I remember them, the first night long       ago, those wagon people who pushed aside enough of the       cottonwoods to build our city where the blueness rested.    It is a poem that reminds us in Colorado that we are always looking  up, that we are always looking toward the mountains and to that great  blue sky. That is what Neil Gorsuch has done his entire life. He is  somebody who is forward-thinking, somebody who understands the  optimistic sense of Colorado, who understands the majesty of our West,  and who understands the majesty of our form of government--a system  that has three separate but equal branches of power. He has led a life  that is dedicated to the majesty of our Constitution. He is somebody  who understands the pillars of our government in that no one branch of  government should gain an unfair advantage over the other. That is what  we ought to be debating this week. Instead, we are going to live the  consequences of decisions that were made over a decade ago.   It is interesting that Judge Gorsuch serves on the Tenth Circuit  Court because one of his fellow judges on the Tenth Circuit Court was  nominated by President George Bush in the early part of 2001, 2002,  2003. It was Tim Tymkovich who was nominated by President Bush and who  was caught up in the very first round of filibusters that changed the  way this Chamber worked on nominations.   It was a calculated determination by some in this Chamber to use a  tool that had never been used before in such a lethal, partisan fashion  that it would bring down judges and ultimately lead to a corrosion of  Senate custom--a corrosion of over 200 years of Senate practice--when  it comes to judges' confirmations. Ultimately, this week, we will see  whether it leads to the disruption of how we confirm Supreme Court  Justices.   Make no mistake about it, over the past 200 years, we have not seen  this moment before--a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court  Justice. People are going to talk about this around the country as they  read the news, as they listen to the radio, as they watch on TV what is  happening in the Senate. Most will just wonder, is the nominee  qualified? If the nominee is qualified, then why are we trying to have  an argument about ``he said, she said'' 15 years ago, 16 years ago?  Because the nominee is well qualified, he should be confirmed. Why are  we going to change 200 years of Senate practice and custom if the  nominee is highly qualified, has what it takes to serve on the Supreme  Court? That is the choice Members of this Chamber will have to make  over the next several days as we work to confirm Judge Gorsuch.   In 2006 when Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to serve on the Tenth  Circuit  [[Page S2193]]  Court in Denver, this Chamber did so unanimously by voice vote. There  are a dozen Members in this Chamber who served then and did not oppose  his nomination, many of whom seem willing today to block his nomination  to the Supreme Court.   One thing has changed in the intervening years; that is, who serves  in the Presidency, who serves in the White House, who serves as  President, and whether that nomination came from a Republican or a  Democrat. The nomination, of course, in 2006 came from a Republican.  Still, he was confirmed unanimously. Judge Gorsuch, now nominated to  serve on the Supreme Court, was appointed by a Republican. Yet those  very same people who supported him 11 years ago are now objecting to  his service on the High Court after his exemplary decade of service on  the Tenth Circuit Court.   It was service that showed Judge Gorsuch's joining in over 2,700  opinions, and with the majority the vast number of times. It was  service in which he got to know the Colorado legal community. As we  have discussed over the past several days and several weeks and the  past month, the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best are the people  who served with him and who worked with him at the Department of  Justice, who practiced law with him, and who serve in the Colorado  legal community. I thought it was important that we spend some time in  talking about the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best because I  think their opinions matter in this--those of the people of  Colorado who want Judge Gorsuch confirmed.    Let me start with a series of quotes from Judge Gorsuch's supporters  back home in Colorado--again, those people who know him the best.   This particular quote comes not from a Republican, not from a  conservative; this quote comes from Steve Farber, who served in 2008 as  the Democratic National Convention cochair. Again, he is not a  conservative and he is not a Republican; he was the cochair of the 2008  Democratic National Convention.         We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of utmost character.       He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a judge and a person.    Steve Farber continues:         We all agree that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well       qualified to join the Supreme Court. He deserves an up-or-      down vote.    This is not Mitch McConnell who is saying this. It is not Cory  Gardner, Republican Senator from Colorado, who is saying this. This is  a very prominent figure in Colorado's legal community and somebody who  served in the 2008 Democratic National Convention.   One of those 12 people who supported Judge Gorsuch in 2006 was then- Senator Barack Obama, who was seeking the nomination at Mile High  Stadium, at this very convention of which Steve Farber was cochair.  Steve Farber says we should confirm Judge Gorsuch with an up-or-down  vote.   Norm Brownstein said that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair shake in the  confirmation process. He is another very prominent Democratic lawyer in  Denver.   We have heard a lot of people talk about the cases--those 2,700  opinions--that he was a part of. We have heard Senator Grassley talk  about arguments against Judge Gorsuch, people who have said that Judge  Gorsuch was always against the little guy and that he was siding with  corporations.   Here is a quote from a Denver lawyer and Democrat on representing  underdogs before Judge Gorsuch:         [Judge Gorsuch] issued a decision that, most certainly,       focused on the little guy.    Why did Marcy Glenn say this? Marcy Glenn said this because she knows  that Judge Gorsuch voted with the majority of the court in 99 percent  of the cases. In those 2,700 opinions, 99 percent of the time, Judge  Gorsuch ruled with the majority. That is not trying to look out for the  big guy or the little guy. That is about following the law. That is  about a court that recognizes it is not in the business of focus groups  or policy preferences, popularity contests or poll testing. It is about  a judge who recognizes that the rule of law matters and that you take  an opinion where the law leads you and takes you, not where your  personal opinion takes you. It was 99 percent of the time that Judge  Gorsuch voted to side with the majority on the court, and 97 percent of  the time, those rulings were unanimous. Those decisions were unanimous.  Of those 99 percent in which he sided with the majority, 97 percent of  them were unanimously decided.   This is a judge who is as mainstream as we have seen. He is somebody  who understands the obligation and the duty he has to the law. He is  somebody who understands what it means to be a good judge.   I want to read a letter Senator Bennet and I received from the  Colorado legal community:         As members of the Colorado legal community, we are proud to       support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next       Supreme Court Justice. We hold a diverse set of political       views as Republicans, Democrats, and Independents.    That is bipartisan support back home from those people who know the  judge the best.   What does Neil Gorsuch think it takes to be a good and faithful  judge? I will just read from Judge Gorsuch:         It seems to me that the separation of legislative and       judicial powers isn't just a formality dictated by the       Constitution. Neither is it just about ensuring that two       institutions, with basically identical functions, are       balanced one against the other. To the Founders, the       legislative and judicial powers were distinct by nature, and       their separation was among the most important liberty-      protecting devices of the constitutional design--an       independent right of people essential to the preservation of       all of the rights later enumerated in the Constitution and       its amendments.        Now, consider, if we allow the judge to act like a       legislator, unconstrained by the bicameralism and presentment       hurdles of Article I, the judge would need only his own voice       or those of just a few colleagues to revise the law, willy-      nilly, in accordance with his preferences, and the task of       legislating would become a relatively simple thing.        Notice too how hard it would be to revise this so easily       made judicial legislation to account for changes in the world       or to fix mistakes. Being unable to throw judges out of       office in regular elections, you would have to wait for them       to die before you would have any chance of change. Even then,       you would find the change difficult, for courts cannot so       easily undo the errors given the weight that they afford to       precedent.        Notice, finally, how little voice the people would be left       in a government in which life-appointed judges are free to       legislate alongside elected representatives. The very idea of       self-government would seem to wither to the point of       pointlessness. Indeed, it seems that, for reasons just like       these, Hamilton explained, that liberty can have nothing to       fear from the judiciary alone but that it has everything to       fear from the union of the judicial and legislative powers.    That is what Judge Gorsuch said makes a good and faithful judge.   Over the course of the next week or over the course of the next  several days, we are going to flesh out in detail some of the decisions  people may find they disagree with. We will flesh out in detail Judge  Gorsuch's temperament and his performance at the committee hearings.  Yet there is no doubt that Judge Gorsuch has the support of the  American people, who believe he should be confirmed. There is no doubt  that Judge Gorsuch has the support of people who cochaired the  Democratic National Convention and of prominent attorneys who know him  best from Colorado. There is no doubt that his is an upbringing from  the West. It is the story of how we built the West.   I hope that over the course of the next few days, Republicans and  Democrats alike will come to the conclusion that we will do this  country a service. Instead of having partisan fights, we will have the  bipartisanship support for a judge who will truly make this country  proud, a judge who will truly represent the law, not personal opinion.   I thank the Presiding Officer for this opportunity today. I look  forward to being here for the rest of the week as we talk about Judge  Gorsuch's qualifications and as we talk about the nomination.   More than anything, let's make it clear that for 200-plus years, we  have allowed judges to come to this floor for the Supreme Court and to  be confirmed by a simple majority--no threshold, no 60-vote  requirement. We have done so without partisan filibusters. I think that  if we can maintain that custom, that practice, this country will be  better served. There is no reason to change two centuries of practice  in this body simply because they have decided they do not like the  person who made the nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S2330]]     Mr. President, it has been an eventful week already. We  have seen a number of Members come to the Senate floor and debate the  qualifications of Judge Neil Gorsuch, the President's nominee to the  highest Court, the U.S. Supreme Court. Many have come to the floor  talking about his high qualifications--the fact that he has the highest  American Bar Association rating; the fact that he has the support of  the 2008 cochair of the Democratic National Convention; the fact that  Neal Katyal, a high-ranking former official in the Obama  administration, supports the confirmation of Neal Gorsuch.   We have had others come to the floor, of course, and express their  opposition. We have had them come and express their opposition to an  individual who has proved himself to be a mainstream judge, who has  proved time and again that he has the respect of his colleagues on the  Tenth Circuit Court--the bench of the Tenth Circuit Court, as well as  circuit courts around the country, and that he has the respect and  admiration of the Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, where Judge  Gorsuch clerked for Justice White, the last Coloradan to be on the  Nation's High Court, and where he clerked for sitting Justice Anthony  Kennedy.   Judge Gorsuch has been known and has become known as a feeder judge-- somebody who provides clerks to the Supreme Court because they  understand the quality and caliber of Judge Gorsuch's work.   We know Judge Gorsuch was a part of 2,700 opinions--decisions decided  99 percent of the time with the majority of his court; we know that 97  percent of that time, these decisions were unanimous. We know about his  record as it relates to being reversed or overturned.   We know that our colleagues who, for some reason, are opposing Judge  Gorsuch continue to come to the floor and talk about the reasons they  apparently can't support Judge Gorsuch: because he will not violate  judicial ethics--the ethics judges are expected to keep; because he  will not preview how he would rule under a certain fact circumstance.  George Washington himself could come down from a mountaintop and would  be rejected by the U.S. Senate to be a Supreme Court Justice.   It is pretty incredible to see and hear the arguments that have taken  place--some lasting all night--because some of these arguments are  nothing more than sour grapes. Some of these arguments are nothing more  than that two wrongs must make a right, in their minds. They criticize  Republicans for invoking the Biden rule or the Schumer rule, and then  they decide because of that, they are going to demand the seat be held  open--not confirmed--because they believe it was taken from them. In  their mind, if you do two things that are wrong, it must be a right. We  have taught our children that is not true.   We know, in this instance, that the American people decided who the  Supreme Court Justice would be.   In 2006, Judge Neil Gorsuch was nominated to serve on the Tenth  Circuit Court. A dozen sitting Members of this Chamber didn't object to  his nomination then. They didn't oppose him. They didn't come and  register their ``no'' vote. In fact, nobody even showed up at his  confirmation. Lindsey Graham was the only one. That is how  objectionable he was then. So either of a couple of things has  happened: Nobody did their work then to find out what kind of judge he  was going to be or they have decided that the politics have changed.   To me, the most egregious part of this debate is that the politics of  the time are demanding that there be absolute obstruction for the first  time in over 230 years of a Supreme Court Justice, trying to defeat a  Supreme Court Justice with a partisan filibuster for the first time in  two centuries, of a judge who agreed 99 percent of the time with the  opinions of the court. Ninety-nine percent of the time, his opinions  were made with a majority of the court; 97 percent of the time, they  were made unanimously.   This is an individual who has outstanding legal credentials: Harvard,  Columbia, and, most importantly, time spent at the University of  Colorado.   He is a fourth-generation Coloradan. I think an old joke of the late  Justice Scalia was that four of the five boroughs in New York have  their own Supreme Court justice. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a  Supreme Court Justice from west of the Mississippi River, another  western voice on the Supreme Court, a judge who comes from a circuit  court that represents 20 percent of the landmass? If you are a  Westerner and you have a choice of putting a judge on the Supreme Court  who is familiar with Tribal law issues, a judge who is familiar with  water issues, a judge who is familiar with public land issues, that is  a pretty good pick for the High Court, to represent a vast part of  America that is underrepresented on the Nation's High Court.   This institution can seem pretty puzzling at times because you  consistently hear the outcry for bipartisan support: Let's work  together. Let's have bipartisan support. Then the President nominates a  judge who has strong bipartisan credentials from the people who know  him the best. Look, most people in Washington, DC, most people in this  Chamber have known Neil Gorsuch for just a couple of months since the  time of his nomination. Most conversations people in this Chamber have  had with Judge Gorsuch have consisted of an hour or two at a judicial  confirmation hearing or perhaps when he visited the office prior to the  hearing. That is the extent of their relationship and their knowledge  and their understanding of Judge Gorsuch.   But the people who know him best--the people out in Colorado,  Republicans, Democrats--believe he is well qualified and should be  confirmed, that he deserves an up-or-down vote. People like Democratic  Governor Bill Ritter believe that Judge Gorsuch should have an up-or- down vote and be confirmed.   Some people find Judge Gorsuch to be so unreasonable or so unfit to  serve on the High Court, they might find it hard to believe that the  2008 cochair of the Democratic National Convention is supporting Judge  Gorsuch's confirmation.   Jim Lyons, an attorney and close friend of President Bill Clinton,  supports the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch.   They know his record. They have reviewed the cases that the  opposition has stated that they find so egregious, and they still  believe he is worthy of confirmation to the Court.   The standard that has been set by those who oppose Judge Gorsuch is a  standard that simply says: No Justice could be confirmed. Why? We know  that because Judge Gorsuch's credentials, his academic background, his  judicial history, his temperament, his qualifications, his ratings show  that he is more than able to serve and deserving to serve on the  Supreme Court.   There is a certainly a difference in philosophy that has been  presented here, a difference of philosophies that some people believe  that a judge should just be a judge who follows the law or rules and  makes a decision based on where the law takes them, but there are  people who believe that a judge somehow has to be maybe a focus group  of opinion or policy preferences, that a judge should be somebody who  puts their thumb on the scale of justice to reach an outcome that is  preferred by a political party. That is not what our Founders had in  mind when they wrote the Constitution. That is not what justice is  about.   Judge Gorsuch believes that you take an opinion, you take a decision  where the law takes you, where the law leads you as a guardian of the  Constitution.   He understands the separation of powers, but apparently that is not  good enough for some. They want an activist judge, but I hope that over  the next several hours and the next few days that our colleagues will  come realize that those who know him best believe that he is qualified,  that he deserves an up-or-down vote, that a judge who votes 99 percent  of the time in the majority agrees with them.   I look forward to our conversations as we confirm Judge Gorsuch at  the end of this week.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to  legislative session.    Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 118, submitted  earlier today.  [[Page S2372]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10 a.m., Thursday,  April 6; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the time for  the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; further,  that following leader remarks, the time until the cloture vote on the  Gorsuch nomination be equally divided between Senators Grassley and  Feinstein or their designees; finally, that the mandatory quorum call  with respect to the cloture vote be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume executive session to consider the nomination of Neil Gorsuch.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in recess  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Cantwell for  10 minutes, Senator Franken for 30 minutes, Senator Murphy for 30  minutes, and Senator Hirono for 30 minutes.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, over the next several hours, we will have  the final opportunity to debate the confirmation of Supreme Court  Justice nominee Neil Gorsuch. This has been a lengthy process this  week, as we have heard from Senators on both sides of the aisle who  have come to the floor and talked about their support or their  opposition to Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.   I have had several opportunities over the past weeks and months to  personally visit and speak with Judge Gorsuch, whom I have known from  Colorado, the opportunity to listen to a number of my colleagues  address the Chamber, to watch the Senate confirmation hearings in the  Judiciary Committee--the day after day, it seemed, that that  confirmation hearing proceeded--and of course we have gotten to know  Judge Gorsuch over the past several years. We are proud that we have a  Coloradan nominated to the Nation's highest Court and that he would be  the second Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court, the other one being  Justice Byron White. Justice Byron White also led the NFL in rushing  one year, and while Gorsuch will never live up to that part of the  Supreme Court legacy for Coloradans, we know that Judge Gorsuch is an  avid outdoorsman, a fly-fisher, expert-level skier, and somebody who  understands public lands. I think having that kind of expertise and  experience on our Nation's highest Court will serve this country well.   I think it is important to understand that his roots represent the  roots that built the West. He is a fourth-generation Coloradan,  somebody who hails from a State that is independent, that takes great  pride in its libertarian streak, its love of the outdoors, recreational  opportunities, understanding agriculture, energy. It is a State that  really does have it all. From the Eastern Plains to the Western Slope,  there is great beauty in our State.    Neil Gorsuch understands that. He served on a court, the Tenth  Circuit Court, that is housed in Denver and represents 20 percent of  the landmass of our State. Judge Gorsuch's family, as I mentioned,  really does show the grit and determination of those who built the  West. His grandfather was someone who worked in Union Station, someone  who grew up driving trolleys back in the time when Denver was a trolley  town. His other grandfather, of course, was a physician, and both were  experts in their fields. One grandfather helped found a law firm,  Gorsuch Kirgis, a very prestigious firm in Denver.   But it is Judge Gorsuch's experience, his high qualifications of  academics that he brings to the Court, having received his degrees from  Columbia, Oxford, Harvard, as I mentioned previously--the most  important academic experience being the University of Colorado, where I  think he spent at least some time in the summer attending, and also  teaching a course as a professor at my alma mater, the University of  Colorado School of Law. This has all helped him build what he is today;  that is, a very mainstream jurist, an incredibly exceptional legal  mind, one of the brightest jurists this country has to offer, someone  who is known as a feeder judge, providing clerks to the Supreme Court,  and who has the respect of the Colorado legal community.   I want to talk about some of these things because I have come to the  floor multiple times, and I have talked about his qualifications. I  have talked about the people who know him best,  [[Page S2392]]  not the people in Washington, DC, but the people who have practiced in  front of his court in Denver, the people who know him personally out in  Colorado.   Here is what those individuals have said. They believe that Judge  Gorsuch deserves an up-or-down vote. Bill Ritter, former Democratic  Governor for the State of Colorado, believes that Judge Gorsuch  deserves an up-or-down vote. Now we will have it. We have invoked  cloture. We will have a final debate on Friday night and a final vote  on whether or not he should be confirmed.   People like Steve Farber, the cochair of the Democratic National  Convention in 2008 in Colorado, have talked about the need to confirm  Judge Gorsuch.   So the debate that we enter now is not one of whether he will have an  up-or-down vote. He is going to have an up-or-down vote. But it is  whether we should confirm him, actually give him the ``yes'' vote.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of  Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. Some of the arguments that I have heard  over the past several weeks on the floor, listening to some of the  arguments on the floor--it is quite interesting to me that some of the  arguments we hear seem to be at odds with each other.   Presiding over the Senate yesterday, I heard people talk about how  they don't think Neil Gorsuch will stand up to the President. They are  concerned that he will not express the kind of independence the  judiciary commands, that he will not be someone to stand up to the  President of the United States. They often cite some of the comments or  tweets that the President has made and then fail to mention the fact,  though, that at the very time one of those tweets was mentioned,  questioning the judiciary, Judge Gorsuch, in a meeting with one of our  Democratic colleagues, actually had objections. He said he objected to  the statements the President had made, expressing his independence,  talking about how what he had heard was demoralizing--very much showing  independence.   But the second argument you often hear, for those who have decided to  oppose this mainstream jurist, is that they are afraid he won't show  enough independence from the President, and then they say they are  concerned about his language as it relates to the Chevron doctrine-- whether Judge Gorsuch is going to be willing to overturn the Chevron  doctrine.   I find those two arguments kind of interesting because, on one hand,  you have an argument saying we are afraid he is not going to stand up  to the President of the United States, and then, on the other hand, you  have an argument saying that we are afraid he is not going to stand up  to the administrative state of the President of the United States-- because that is what the Chevron doctrine does; it gives great  deference to the regulatory body, to the administrative state.   Here is another irony. The Administrator of the EPA in 1984 was Neil  Gorsuch's mother, Anne Burford--the Administrator of the EPA. She was  the first woman to serve as EPA Administrator who was the subject of  the Chevron doctrine.   Not only is he willing to stand up to the President and the  administrative state of the President, but he is willing to overturn a  case that was a subject that his own mother was a subject to.   I have also heard comments from colleagues on the aisle that Judge  Gorsuch is not a mainstream jurist. This argument, I think, can be  dealt with in a couple of ways because there are some pretty good  statistics to refute these arguments.   Ninety-seven. Ninety-seven percent is the number of times in the  2,700 opinions that he was a part of--97 percent represents the times  that the decisions were unanimous. Judge Gorsuch did not serve only  with conservative-appointed judges. He didn't serve with only  Republican nominees. Judge Gorsuch served with Republican and Democrat  nominees, appointments approved by the Senate. In 97 percent of the  cases, Judge Gorsuch ruled--decided--in unanimous decisions.   The other statistic that I think is even more revealing, of course,  as to whether Judge Gorsuch is a mainstream judge is 99 percent.  Ninety-nine percent is the amount of times that Judge Gorsuch ruled  with the majority of the court; he made decisions--opinions--with the  majority of the court.   I heard a comment yesterday from a colleague who said that Judge  Gorsuch was never intended to be a mainstream nominee. If Judge Gorsuch  was never intended to be a mainstream nominee, do you think we would  see a judge before us that has support from the 2008 Democratic  National Convention Chairman? If Judge Gorsuch was never intended to be  mainstream nominee, do you think we would have decisions by the  Democratic Governor of Colorado, former Democratic Governor of  Colorado, to demand or ask for an up-or-down vote? If Judge Gorsuch was  never intended to be a mainstream nominee, do you think that the  President would have nominated somebody who agreed 99 percent of the  time with his colleagues on the bench, colleagues who came  from appointments given by Republican Presidents and Democrat  Presidents?    The arguments over whether Judge Gorsuch is going to be with the  little guy or he spends too much time defending the big guy--well, let  me again go back to the people who know Judge Gorsuch the best, who  have practiced in front of his court. Here is a statement from a Denver  attorney and Democrat on representing underdogs before Judge Gorsuch.  This is from the Denver Post: ``He issued a decision that most  certainly focused on the little guy.''   Yet the story from the opposition here, out of 2,700 cases, is: Oh,  my gosh, this is a person who has never defended the little guy. Well,  here is somebody who has practiced in front of his court who absolutely  believes he focused on the little guy.   So we have a judge who agrees with the majority of the court most of  the time--99 percent of the time; 97 percent of the time it is a  unanimous decision, and lawyers practicing in front of him believe that  he represents the little guy. We have heard from leading Democrat  voices in Colorado who support him. The ABA gave him its highest  qualification, rankings, ratings. They believe it.   Then the question becomes, What are we looking for in a Justice?  Maybe that is the biggest argument here. Maybe the argument should be  about what are we looking for in terms of philosophy, ideology?   Well, we have seen his ideology and his philosophy in what he has  testified before the Judiciary Committee, what he has stated in the  past through writings. He is someone who is going to follow the law. He  is someone who is going to take a decision where the law leads him, not  somebody who is going to take an opinion or decision where his personal  beliefs or politics take him. That is the kind of judge we want on the  highest Court. That is the kind of Justice we want--someone who is not  going to decide a policy preference from the bench of the Supreme  Court, not somebody who is going to take a look at a public opinion  poll or someone who is going to take a look at a focus group and make a  decision but someone who will rule by the law.   I have heard colleagues come to the floor and talk about their  experiences where they were given decisions to read without being given  the law. They were given just the facts of the case. They said: How  would you have decided this case? Then they showed him the actual  ruling, the actual holding in the case.   Some people believe, well, that is not the way we would have decided  because we don't feel that was a good outcome; we don't feel that was  the right policy.   It is not the job of a Justice to put their thumb on the scale of  policy; it is the job of a Justice to be a guardian of the  Constitution, to defend the Constitution, to follow the law and to  decide cases based on the law not on feelings, politics, polls, public  opinion.   We have a judge, nominated for Justice, who has said that a judge who  agrees with every opinion that they have issued is probably a bad  judge. He is paraphrasing other judges and Justices throughout our  history. It is because he knows it is not his job to issue opinions or  decisions or to decide a case based on being a Republican or Democrat.  It is not his job to decide a case based on whether he was nominated by  President Trump or President Obama or President Bush. It is his job to  look at the law, to leave policy decisions to the legislative branch.  That is what we have to do. That is what Judge Gorsuch has said he will  do.  [[Page S2393]]    So these arguments just don't hold water. It doesn't hold water that  he is not looking out for the interests of our citizens, because here  clearly he is. Democrats who have practiced before him in court have  said as much. The argument that he will not stand up to Trump  administration--we know it; he said in front of our Democratic  colleagues that he would stand up to the President.   He has said that he rejected attacks on the Court. We also know that  when it comes to the Chevron doctrine, which seems to be sacred ground  now, that there are these ironic arguments taking place, because you  want someone who will stand up to the administration, but then you are  concerned that he is interested in or concerned that we have taken the  Chevron deference--the doctrine of Chevron deference too far.   Now which is it? Do you want a judge who is going to stand up to the  administration or do you want a judge who is not going to stand up to  the administration? It sounds as though the arguments are trying to  have it both ways.   The bottom line is that we know Judge Gorsuch to be a person who is  eminently qualified, a mainstream jurist who has the respect and  admiration of judges around the country, who has the admiration and  respect of fellow jurists and legal professionals throughout Colorado,  and we know that he will make this country proud. He is certainly going  to make Colorado proud as he receives his confirmation to the Nation's  highest Court.   I hope, as we spend these hours debating, that we can realize this  Senate should operate in a bipartisan fashion, that we should confirm  judges who are clearly mainstream.   I yield the floor.
