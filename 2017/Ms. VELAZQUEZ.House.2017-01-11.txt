 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are playing politics  with millions of Americans' health care. In fact, if Republicans go  forward with their plan to chaotically dismantle the Affordable Care  Act, 30 million Americans will lose health insurance. In New York State  alone, 1.6 million of our neighbors, who gained coverage through ACA,  will see their health insurance taken away; and 2.7 million New Yorkers  who have enrolled in Medicaid could lose coverage.   But let us remember that this is not just about New Yorkers. In fact,  the sad irony is that many of the Americans who will lose and be most  devastated by repeal of this law are in red States and counties, the  places that voted for President-elect Trump. Those areas have high  numbers of Americans on the Medicaid rolls. Already, States like Idaho,  Nebraska, South Dakota, and Georgia are putting Medicaid expansion on  hold, waiting to see how action on the ACA plays out. That means half a  million Americans will have to wait for health benefits.   But let's keep in mind that this is not just about Medicaid and it is  not just about those who obtained coverage through the exchanges. What  we need to remember is that all the elements of healthcare reform work  together. If you start chipping away at one part of the system, you  will see disasters in other parts of the market.   This is about the young person, just out of college, who can stay on  their parents' insurance until they are 26, giving them time to secure  employment and coverage on their own. It is about patients with a  preexisting condition who, until the ACA, were barred  [[Page H306]]  from securing quality medical insurance. It is about women who have,  time and again, faced gender discrimination in the insurance market.   Just this past Saturday, New Yorkers in my district rallied together  to oppose Republican plans to roll back the ACA and make America sick  again. We heard from our local hospitals and healthcare providers who  talked about how they will be affected by a dramatic surge in charity  care. Nationally, healthcare providers could get stuck with $88 billion  in 2019 alone and $1.1 trillion from 2019 to 2028 in uncompensated  care. This will strain resources and make it harder for them to provide  care to all their patients.   And we heard from ordinary working people who have benefited from the  ACA, people like Juana Alvarez, who was able, for the first time, to  secure coverage for herself and her family through this law. We heard  from Susan Maples, who told us she would not have been able to start  her own business without the health benefits afforded under ACA. These  are the people Republicans are planning to harm with their  irresponsible, chaotic, and destructive attack on our health system.   Now, let me also note this: The Republican slogan ``repeal and  replace'' is a sham.   What are they going to replace the ACA with?   They have never--not once--put together a realistic, defensible plan  to replace the ACA. The Republican plan is not repeal and replace. It  should be called ``repeal and displace'' because it will mean  displacing millions of Americans from their health coverage.   So let's be clear. If you are voting to take away the ACA, you are  voting to take away health care from millions. And for those who do  retain their employer-based coverage, you are voting to increase their  premiums, as millions of healthy Americans are taken out of the  insurance pool. This is a recipe for disaster. It is a plan to make  America sick again, and it cannot stand.   I urge my colleagues to think about what you are doing. Think about  going home and looking in the eyes of your constituents and telling  them you voted to take away their health coverage. Enough playing  politics with health care.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR.

Periodic review of rules         ``(a) Not later than 180 days after the effective date of       this section, each agency shall publish in the Federal       Register and place on its website a plan for the periodic       review of rules issued by the agency which the head of the       agency determines have a significant economic impact on a       substantial number of small entities. Such determination       shall be made without regard to whether the agency performed       an analysis under section 604. The purpose of the review       shall be to determine whether such rules should be continued       without change, or should be amended or rescinded, consistent       with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, to       minimize significant economic impacts on a substantial number       of small entities. Such plan may be amended by the agency at       any time by publishing the revision in the Federal Register       and subsequently placing the amended plan on the agency's       website.        ``(b) The plan shall provide for the review of all such       agency rules existing on the effective date of this section       within 10 years of the date of publication of the plan in the       Federal Register and for review of rules adopted after the       effective date of this section within 10 years after the       publication of the final rule in the Federal Register. If the       head of the agency determines that completion of the review       of existing rules is not feasible by the established date,       the head of the agency shall so certify in a statement       published in the Federal Register and may extend the review       for not longer than 2 years after publication of notice of       extension in the Federal Register. Such certification and       notice shall be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy and       the Congress.        ``(c) Each agency shall annually submit a report regarding       the results of its review pursuant to such plan to the       Congress and, in the case of agencies other than independent       regulatory agencies (as defined in section 3502(5) of title       44, United States Code) to the Administrator of the Office of       Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of       Management and Budget. Such report shall include the       identification of any rule with respect to which the head of       the agency made a determination described in paragraph (5) or       (6) of subsection (d) and a detailed explanation of the       reasons for such determination.        ``(d) In reviewing rules under such plan, the agency shall       consider the following factors:        ``(1) The continued need for the rule.        ``(2) The nature of complaints received by the agency from       small entities concerning the rule.        ``(3) Comments by the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and       the Chief Counsel for Advocacy.        ``(4) The complexity of the rule.        ``(5) The extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates, or       conflicts with other Federal rules and, unless the head of       the agency determines it to be infeasible, State and local       rules.        ``(6) The length of time since the rule has been evaluated       or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or       other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule.        ``(e) The agency shall publish in the Federal Register and       on its website a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to       such plan. Such publication shall include a brief description       of the rule, the reason why the agency determined that it has       a significant economic impact on a substantial number of       small entities (without regard to whether it had prepared a       final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule), and       request comments from the public, the Chief Counsel for       Advocacy, and the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman concerning       the enforcement of the rule.''.  [[Page H350]]            SEC. 305. CHANGES TO THE REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT TO                     COMPORT WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER 13272.         (a) Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.--Section 603       of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding at the       end the following:        ``(e) An agency shall notify the Chief Counsel for Advocacy       of the Small Business Administration of any draft rules that       may have a significant economic impact on a substantial       number of small entities either--        ``(1) when the agency submits a draft rule to the Office of       Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of       Management and Budget, if submission is required; or        ``(2) if no submission to the Office of Information and       Regulatory Affairs is so required, at a reasonable time prior       to publication of the rule by the agency.''.        (b) Inclusion in Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of       Response to Comments on Certification of Proposed Rule.--      Paragraph (2) of section 604(a) of title 5, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after ``initial regulatory       flexibility analysis'' the following: ``(or certification of       the proposed rule under section 605(b))''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Velazquez) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The Regulatory Flexibility Act has reduced regulatory costs by $130  billion since 1998. However, it could do better. The amendment I am  offering will improve this process.   However, unlike the underlying bill, my amendment is actually aligned  with the original statute, which was created to protect the unique  needs of small businesses in the regulatory process, not to stop  regulations. My amendment is also much more cost effective to the  taxpayers, as the underlying bill creates a massive and unnecessary  government bureaucracy. It should be noted that my amendment is based  on bipartisan legislation from a previous Congress, which the committee  reported by a recorded vote of 26-0.   The amendment makes improvements to the most significant deficiencies  facing the Regulatory Flexibility Act without the overly broad changes  contained in the underlying bill. This includes making sure that  agencies live up to their obligations to retrospectively review the  burdens of existing rules on small businesses. The GAO has reported on  numerous occasions that agency compliance with this requirement was  poor. My amendment holds the agencies more accountable by requiring  them to report the results of their reviews to Congress annually.   My amendment also takes steps to make analyses more detailed so that  agencies cannot ignore the RFA and simply certify that a rule has no  significant economic impact on small businesses. Addressing this matter  will ensure that agencies are required to provide a more factual basis  for such certifications rather than just a sentence which dismisses the  concerns of small firms.   The most important aspect of my amendment is what it does not do.  Unlike H.R. 5, my amendment does not create a new governmentwide  bureaucracy or foist a truckload of new responsibilities on the Office  of Advocacy, which only has a $9 million budget.   For instance, H.R. 5 requires the Office of Advocacy to approve size  standards, a function already handled by the SBA. This is like creating  a Rayburn cafeteria next to the Rayburn cafeteria. It is ridiculous.  This is a complete waste of taxpayer resources and will, ironically,  take the Office of Advocacy away from its core mission of monitoring  regulations.   Also, another aspect that is very important, what this legislation  does is it is setting the Office of Advocacy to fail. They do not have  the expertise. They do not have the resources. In addition, H.R. 5  imposes the panel process across the entire government. I will say that  again. Across the entire government, including all independent  agencies. So much for fiscal responsibility. There is another complete  waste of taxpayer resources, and it will further limit the Office of  Advocacy's ability to weigh in on the most important matters affecting  small businesses.   Instead, my amendment makes the targeted changes to the RFA that  small businesses have called for over the last 5 years. In doing so, it  is cost effective and responsible to the taxpayers. I urge Members to  vote ``yes'' on my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman for being  so kind. But let me just say that on this one, your approach is not  balanced, and it is going to impact the very agencies that you are  empowering with so many responsibilities.   I would like to ask the gentleman, adding all these new  responsibilities that would require manpower and expertise that is  needed, how much money is included in the authorizing process for this  office to work properly?   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
