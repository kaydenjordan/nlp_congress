 Madam Speaker, it is inhumane, colleagues, to allow the  killing of children. I do have one more question for so many that I  have asked over and over again: Is doing nothing really going to save  lives? Is it going to actually result in change? How many more of our  children have to die?   How many more school children's little pink shoes will be left behind  stained with blood before some of the electeds in this room put the  lives of people ahead of the profits of their political donors?   In my district, in River Rouge, a 6-year-old girl was caught in a  crossfire and shot by a high-powered assault rifle.   The measures in the Protecting Our Kids package that we are set to  vote on today is essential and it does save lives. Let's just be very  clear though: Our kids need way more than this. They need an assault  weapon ban. They need far stricter regulations on handguns and bold  initiatives to reduce the number of firearms in our communities.   Most of all, they need accountability from us--from all of us.    Madam Speaker, they need accountability from those of us  who are enabling the mass murder of millions of Americans so they can  profit from our pain, and that the people that enable their slaughter- for-profit scheme are here in our government.    Madam Speaker, I look forward to supporting this and so much more  because our kids deserve it.
