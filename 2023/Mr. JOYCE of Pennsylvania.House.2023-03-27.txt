 Madam Speaker, it is estimated that more  than 100,000 additional lives could be saved each year if CPR was  initiated on time. We saw firsthand that CPR saved the life of Buffalo  Bills safety Damar Hamlin, who was resuscitated after collapsing during  a game in Cincinnati this year on January 2.   Sadly, more than 7,000 young people are stricken by sudden cardiac  arrest like the one that was suffered by Damar Hamlin, and it is  currently the leading cause of death for student athletes. That is why  it is so critical that teachers, coaches, and all trainers become  proficient on how to perform CPR and how to use automatic  defibrillators.   By completing CPR training and by placing automatic defibrillators  within reach at athletic venues, we can help to restart hearts, save  lives, and protect our student athletes.                 Restoring Our Nation to Energy Independence     Madam Speaker, as Americans look to return  to energy dominance, it has become clear that we urgently need a change  in  [[Page H1442]]  our energy policy by reforming the permitting process, by boosting the  production of critical minerals, and by reversing President Biden's  antienergy policies that have made our country less secure.    It is time to pass H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, and increase  domestic energy production to restore our Nation to the energy  independence that we enjoyed before President Biden took office.   H.R. 1 will stop Biden's $6 billion natural gas tax. It will require  the Department of the Interior to resume lease sales on Federal lands.  H.R. 1 will enhance our ability to develop critical energy resources.   Unfortunately, Pennsylvania families are hurting because of the  restrictive energy policies enacted by far-left liberals under the  guise of green energy. Now is the time to embrace the critical  resources like oil, natural gas, and Marcellus shale that are  underneath the feet of my constituents in Pennsylvania's 13th  Congressional District. It is time to pass H.R. 1 and get back to  working for the American people.                            ____________________
