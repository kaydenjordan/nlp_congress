 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  so-called Equality Act.   Rather than delivering equality, this bill undermines protections for  women and for girls. And simply put, women's shelters should remain  women's shelters and not allow biological men to intrude. And girls'  sports should remain sports for girls.   This is not equal opportunity. This is catastrophic for girls'  sports. This is what the Equality Act seeks to overturn, and that is  fairness in girls' sports.   All of this is even before mentioning the provisions that would  undermine religious freedom. Religious organizations shouldn't be  forced to act contrary to their beliefs. This is why they call it  religious freedom, after all.   This bill poses a dangerous threat to free speech, religious freedom,  and pro-life, the sanctity of life. This, honestly, goes against  everything that I believe as a Christian and I will be opposing this  bill.
