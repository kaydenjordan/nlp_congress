 Mr. Speaker, I was proud to vote for the American  Rescue Plan because I knew it was the transformational investment we  needed to get the pandemic under control and our economy back on track.   Two months later, it is clear the investment has paid off. We have  gotten more shots in arms, lifted families out of poverty, helped  children get back to school, helped businesses stay open, and helped  workers keep their jobs. And we are just getting started.   Much of the vital support for workers and families included in the  American Rescue Plan is still underway. One of these measures is the  expansion of the child tax credit, a historic investment in the future  of our country.   It has become harder and harder to afford a college education, a  home, and childcare.                                time  1045    As the cost of living continues to soar and wages continue to  stagnate, the American Dream is slipping out of reach for many working  families. We need to level the playing field so every child has the  opportunity to fulfill their potential.   The child tax credit expansion means working-class families will get  $300 per child under 6, and $250 per child for children aged 7-17. $300  a month helps put food on the table so kids do not go hungry. It helps  pay for child care so parents can get back to work and build a better  life for their families. And it helps cover healthcare expenses so  children stay healthy.   This lifeline benefits a whopping 85 percent of the children in my  district on the central coast of California. That means a stronger  economic foundation for over 135,000 children in our community. For the  11,200 children in my community living in poverty, the child tax credit  could make all the difference in their lives and their futures.   I come from a low-income family myself, a working-class family, so I  know that $300 a month would have lifted a financial burden off my  parents' shoulders, who already worked so hard to give me and my  siblings a chance for a better life.   Advance monthly payments of the child tax credit will start to be  sent out in July and last through December 2021. Families will get the  remaining tax credit when they file their 2021 tax returns. Families  can make sure they get an accurate payment quickly by filing their 2020  tax return as soon as possible.   Even individuals who lost their jobs during the pandemic or do not  normally file taxes, should file this year to receive the credit. The  IRS needs the information from the tax returns to calculate and issue  the monthly child tax credit payments.   I will continue to fight for working families in Congress so they  keep their hard-earned money in their pockets, and every child has the  means to achieve the American Dream.                            ____________________
