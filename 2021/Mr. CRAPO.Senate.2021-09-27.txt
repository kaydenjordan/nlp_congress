 Mr. President, I draw attention to and recognize the  immense service and commitment to our country of our Nation's Atomic  Veterans. I also extend special recognition and gratitude to Idahoan  and Atomic Veteran Noelan ``Mac'' McCormack for his service to our  country and his efforts to ensure his fellow veterans receive  appreciation and recognition for their service and sacrifices.   Mac McCormack of Coeur d'Alene, ID, served in the U.S. Marine Corps  Test Unit #1, a unit active from 1954-1957 involved in specialized  tactics, including warfare as it related to nuclear weapons. An Atomic  Veteran is a veteran who, as part of his or her military service,  participated in nuclear testing between 1945 and 1962, served in the  U.S. military forces in or around Hiroshima and Nagasaki through mid- 1946, or was held a prisoner of war in or near Hiroshima or Nagasaki.   Earlier this year, when designating July 16, 2021, as National Atomic  Veterans Day, President Biden noted the considerable challenges Atomic  Veterans have faced, ``Atomic Veterans  [[Page S6695]]  served our Nation with distinction, but their service came at a great  cost. Many developed health conditions due to radiation exposure, yet  because they were not able to discuss the nature of their service, they  were unable to seek medical care or disability compensation from the  Department of Veterans Affairs for their illnesses.'' Decades after  their service, in 1996, Congress repealed the Nuclear Radiation and  Secrecy Agreement Act, which enabled Atomic Veterans to seek services  and share their experiences. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs  provides information to connect Atomic Veterans with medical services  and compensation. However, the National Association of Atomic Veterans,  Inc., notes, ``Currently, there are approximately 195,000 Atomic  Veterans across America who either do not know their oath-of-secrecy  has been rescinded, and who are not aware of the potential monetary  benefits due them for (service connected) radiation induced  illnesses.''   While the best healthcare and other services in the world can never  reverse what many Atomic Veterans and their families have endured, we  owe it to America's servicemembers who have answered the call to duty  to ensure access to high-quality services and resources to support  their commitment to our country. As part of this effort, I cosponsored  S.565, the Mark Takai Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity Act, which  would reclassify veterans who participated in the cleanup of the  Enewetak Atoll as radiation-exposed veterans, making them eligible for  the same benefits afforded to those covered by Radiation Exposure  Compensation Act, RECA. Work also continues on bipartisan legislation  to extend and expand RECA eligibility to those in Idaho and other  States who have suffered from cancers related to fallout from nuclear  weapons testing during the Cold War period of the 1950s and 1960s. As  work continues on these and other efforts to support veterans, I join  in honoring Atomic Veterans whose service has been a central part of  our national defense. I hope recognition can also draw attention to  available services and resources for Atomic Veterans.   In 1983, then-President Ronald Reagan urged fellow citizens to join  him in appreciation of the service of Atomic Veterans he characterized  as, ``those patriotic Americans who through their participation in  these tests helped lead the United States to the forefront of  technology in defense of our great Nation and the freedoms we as  Americans hold so dear.''   Thank you, Mac McCormack, and your fellow Atomic Veterans, for your  immeasurable and in many ways unrepayable service. I hope you know how  deeply grateful we as a nation are for your patriotism.                            ____________________
