 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Demings for  hosting this Special Order hour in honor of our brave law enforcement  officers. I am proud to serve with her as a member of the Congressional  Law Enforcement Caucus co-chaired by our dear friend and colleague Bill  Pascrell.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to commemorate Police Week and to  honor all the brave law enforcement officers in New Jersey and across  the country who put their lives on the line every single day to protect  our communities.    We especially honor the more than 124 police officers who have died  in the line of duty across the United States this year, including 64  who we lost to COVID-19. We will never forget their bravery, sacrifice,  and service.   Mr. Speaker, police officers are our heroes, and I am deeply grateful  to all law enforcement--Federal, State, and local--for what they do day  in and day out. They never fail to get our backs, and we have a  responsibility to get theirs.   That is why, in Congress, I am committed to fighting for all of our  sworn officers and first responders by making sure they have the  resources, equipment, and training they need to do their jobs safely  and effectively.   Our police departments have been tested and challenged during the  pandemic over the year, but they have risen to the occasion, continuing  to help our State and our people recover. I was very proud to lead the  New Jersey delegation in requesting critical  [[Page H2255]]  support for PPE and staffing at the very start of the pandemic, and I  fought hard for and ensured a presumption for Public Safety Officers'  Benefits for those on the front lines of COVID.   I thank all of my colleagues for working across the aisle for those  who have served and having the backs of our first responders every day.  Most of all, I thank every law enforcement officer for their solemn  commitment to protect and to serve. God bless.
