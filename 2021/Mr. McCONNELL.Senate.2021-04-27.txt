 Mr. President, as I noted here on the floor last week,  the unaccompanied children packed into overflowing facilities are not  the only tragic consequence of our failure to secure the border.   In addition to the U.S. mail, our southern border is a major source  for the stream of lethal illegal drugs that continue to pour into our  country. According to the CDC, more Americans died of overdoses last  year than ever before.   This health crisis predated COVID-19 and will outlast it, and Customs  and Border Protection data tell us a major cause has been a spike in  the flow of fentanyl and its analogs produced by chemical companies in  places like China. These drugs, which can be hundreds of thousands of  times stronger than morphine, are rightly classified on the schedule of  controlled substances. There are severe penalties for those caught  trafficking them. It is the least we can do to protect American lives,  families, and communities.   Clearly, on its own, this step hasn't been sufficient, but in a few  weeks, even this obvious step is set to expire. Fentanyl analogs would  cease being controlled substances in Federal law, making enforcement  and deterrence even more difficult.   So Congress is faced with what should be a crystal-clear choice. The  right thing to do, of course, is to permanently schedule these  substances. Only in Washington could this become some kind of intense  debate, but alas, some soft-on-crime corners of the political left have  convinced some Democrats that this impending expiration is actually,  actually a political opportunity. They want the Democrats to only  reschedule these analogs for a short period of time, punting this  deadline just a few months into the future, which makes you ask, Why?   Well, so that Democrats could come back to the table with an  unrelated soft-on-crime bill--say, reducing prison sentences for drug  dealers--and make that bad idea the price of admission for keeping  these deadly poisons illegal.   So look, we need to be clear-eyed here. No amount of political spin  or inside-the-beltway horse trading can muddy the debate. It is very  clear: Congress should schedule these fentanyl analogs permanently-- permanently.   It is not complicated. Americans are dying. Communities are drowning.  Chinese drug traffickers are getting rich off of our misery.  Permanently scheduling these analogs is the very least, the very least  Congress can do                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, this week the  Senate is set to vote on President Biden's nominee to be Deputy  Administrator of the EPA. This nominee actually needs no introduction  for my fellow Kentuckians and our neighbors in coal country.   But for those less familiar, Janet McCabe was the chief author of the  Clean Power Plan that President Obama unveiled back in 2015. Well, 6  years and thousands of coal industry jobs later, Ms. McCabe is set to  join an administration whose job-killing policies would make the Obama  EPA blush.   Of course, President Biden's War on Coal predates his administration.  Back in 2008, as a candidate for the Vice Presidency, he insisted there  would be ``no coal plants here in America. Build them, if they're going  to build them, over there,'' obviously, meaning some other country.   Sadly, this was one area where the Obama administration,  unfortunately, kept its promises. It was a terrible time to be a  working American whose livelihood the Democrats happened to dislike.  But our new President's leftward sprint is set to make these bad old  days merely the warmup act.  [[Page S2205]]    Remember, rejoining the Paris climate agreement was a day one  priority for this administration--this unenforceable deal whose own  signatories largely ignored their commitments for the past 5 years, the  deal that proved unable to keep China from significantly increasing its  greenhouse gas emissions and proved unnecessary for the United States  to decrease our own. We decreased our own.   But despite it all, the administration is rushing back in to signal  virtue on the international stage. Here at home, they are rolling out  policy after policy that would cost American families quite dearly.   The President signed away thousands of jobs by canceling the Keystone  XL Pipeline. The authors of the Green New Deal boast about the radical  social engineering they have seeded into the administration's  legislative proposals. The infrastructure plan they have rolled out  would pick winners and losers in automotive manufacturing and aim to  purge the electrical grid of the most reliable and affordable forms of  domestic power.   Of course, despite it all, carbon emissions don't respect national  boundaries, so all the unilateral sacrifices this administration is  eager to impose on blue-collar families won't make a dent in global  emissions if our adversaries just keep on roaring right past us.   And now the Biden climate team is hoping to add a proven veteran from  the War on Coal. The President campaigned suggesting he wouldn't owe  the far left anything, but he is choosing to govern like he owes them  everything.   I will oppose the McCabe nomination and would urge my colleagues to  do the same.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, yesterday I  discussed how the Biden administration's wishful thinking has set them  up for foreign policy failure in Central Asia and the Middle East. The  likely catastrophe in Afghanistan may well consume the administration  and distract from the challenges proposed by competition with Russia  and China.   The President's meager defense budget proposal suggests his  administration isn't taking strategic competition very seriously to  begin with. Russia and China have spent years--years--investing heavily  in military modernization with a specific eye toward threatening U.S.  forces. We spent the previous administration repairing the readiness of  our forces and beginning to modernize after years on the back foot.   A bipartisan Commission concluded we would need sustained increases  in defense funding to successfully counter the growing Russian and  Chinese capabilities. Yet adjusting for inflation, President Biden's  proposal would amount to a reduction in spending.   This administration has talked tough with both these rivals, and I  have given credit where credit has been due, but when the time came to  speak in the language that Putin and Xi understand best--money and  power--this White House flinched.   Just last week, Russia reminded us of the threat it poses to Europe  with a massive mobilization of forces on Ukraine's border. NATO allies  are already struggling to meet their commitments on collective  security.   So you have to ask, Would declining American spending make Putin more  likely or less likely to think twice next time? And what about China?  Will China be more likely or less likely to respect its neighbors'  territorial waters if the United States stops contending for an edge in  naval and long-range capabilities and lets ourselves fall behind?   The head of the U.S. Strategic Command reported last week that both  Russia and China are modernizing their nuclear arsenals faster than the  United States. He warned that if we fail to keep pace, we will be ``at  risk of losing credibility in the eyes of our adversaries.''   Our nuclear triad has preserved the peace for decades, but crucial  components are now decades older than the men and women we have  operating them. If we want to maintain effective deterrence, we have to  modernize.   Whether this administration likes it or not, we are locked in a race  with adversaries who plan literally decades ahead. A lack of resolve  will compound on itself and invite disaster. Surely that cannot be the  legacy President Biden hopes to leave.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
