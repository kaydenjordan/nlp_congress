 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the Oversight  and Government Reform Committee, a great leader in our Congress, and  someone who I admire greatly.   The only thing clever about this bill is the title. Everything else  about this bill is truly diabolical. The SCRUB Act isn't going to clean  anything up. Its toxic suds will just make people sicker, our  environment dirtier, and our products more dangerous.   Creating an unelected commission to oversee the entire regulatory  policy of the United States is undemocratic and unimaginably damaging.  Essentially, five people appointed by the President  [[Page H1373]]  would be able to sacrifice the health and safety of the American public  to the altar of big business.                                time  1445    Say good-bye to protections from big banks, big polluters, and big  pharmaceutical companies; and hello to financial ruin, environmental  destruction, and unsafe food and drugs.   These Presidential pawns would also have unlimited subpoena power.  Now, think about this: they are going to have more subpoena power than  the inspectors general in this country.   Also, the SCRUB Act's senseless and dangerous regulatory cut-go  process would force agencies to choose between maintaining existing  protections and responding to new threats to our health and safety. For  example, in order to clean up the air, an agency might have to allow a  corporation to pollute our drinking water.   Talk about death panels--this, my friends, is a death panel. The only  thing the SCRUB Act washes away is commonsense governance. This is a  diabolical bill; and this, my friends, is what being drunk with power  delivers.
