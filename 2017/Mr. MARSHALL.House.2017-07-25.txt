 Madam Speaker, there are 20,000 open jobs in Kansas and  an unemployment rate of 3 percent. This is a 16-year low for our State.  However, we face only a 63 percent national workforce participation  rate.   Almost 40 percent of our country's labor force has given up on  finding a job, or has lost motivation to work.   In Kansas, a top concern I have heard over our 40 townhalls this year  is the need for a stronger workforce.   My colleagues and I must start work on a welfare to work program--a  set of policies that will empower people to find a job that lifts them  out of poverty and lifts their spirit with a sense of purpose.   Let's empower those across the country to get the training they need  for a rewarding career and a quality of life that turns the tide of  poverty and uncertainty toward personal and societal prosperity.                            ____________________
