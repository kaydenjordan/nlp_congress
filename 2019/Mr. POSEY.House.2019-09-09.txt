 Madam Speaker, on Monday, September 9, 2019, my return  flight to Washington, DC, was delayed due to mechanical difficulties.  As such, I was unfortunately unable to be present for the legislative  session. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No.  515, and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 516.                             personal explanation
