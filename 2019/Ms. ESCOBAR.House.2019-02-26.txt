 Mr. Speaker, I come from El Paso, Texas, which is right  on the U.S.-Mexico border. I live on the border. My family has lived on  the border for more than 100 years. I can assure my colleagues that the  border has never been safer; the border has never been more secure.   In fact, what I am more worried about today than what is happening on  the U.S.-Mexico border, than those vulnerable asylum-seekers coming to  our front door asking for help, is I am more worried that people in  this Chamber are willing to ignore the oath of office that we took on  the day that we were sworn in, that we would violate the Constitution  that we promised to uphold.   I am also far more worried about the fact that they are willing to  divert funding that is going to our U.S. military in favor of a  political prop, a monument to xenophobia, a campaign promise. In fact,  Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, stands to potentially lose $275 million.   Why didn't they get it done when they had an iron grip over the  House, the Senate, and the White House? Because there was no emergency.
