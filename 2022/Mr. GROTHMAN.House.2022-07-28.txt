 Mr. Speaker, we all know that inflation is the big  topic on people's tongues nowadays, but what we can't let people forget  is that high inflation is caused by high spending.   Now, what did Congress do after returning to this floor this week and  spending the weekend hearing people complain about high gas prices, but  even more high housing prices, high food prices? They passed the CHIPS  bill today for $76 billion.   Now, I know why they thought they could vote for a $76 billion bill.  They thought the public wouldn't know the difference between $76  billion and $76 million. $76 billion is $230 for every man, woman, and  child in this country. If you are a family of four, Congress just spent  $1,000 of your money and didn't think anything about it.   Now, the other thing that bothers me about it is, I like to look out  for the average guy. Who owns these chip companies? The uber wealthy.  Seventy-six billion dollars toward the uber wealthy and corporate  welfare.   A lot of people think the majority party likes to freely spend money  for welfare, for the people who don't work. And that is true; they do.  What is not as known is they love to spend money on the uber wealthy as  well.   Every newspaper in the country ought to have a banner headline in the  morning: ``$76 billion spent again by Congress.''                            ____________________
