 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  use a prop on the Senate floor, a tree spike.    Mr. President, you see some of my colleagues are down  here. We are a little bit fired up. Right? And this is not some kind of  partisan game. We are fired up for a reason--that the U.S. Senate is  getting ready to confirm a nominee who has no business being even  considered on the Senate floor. No business being considered on the  Senate floor.   And with all due respect to my colleague from Montana, this isn't-- what did he say--attacks against somebody. These are facts that we are  going to talk about. These are facts--someone who is still continuing  to not even tell the truth about her past as a violent ecoterrorist.   Now, look, we know this administration has put forth far-left  individuals. I am going to talk about a few. But to put forward a far- left, violent nominee--I think we all should recognize--is kind of a  bridge too far for the U.S. Senate.   But that is happening right now, and I am really hopeful that at  least some of my Democratic colleagues, at the last minute, will go:  Maybe we shouldn't do this. Maybe we shouldn't set this standard.   So I have been on the floor a number of times talking about Tracy  Stone-Manning's nomination. It is actually the first time in my Senate  career that I asked the President to withdraw a nominee, and for good  reasons--because of all the things you have heard from my colleagues  from Wyoming, Idaho; colleagues from mostly Western States.   And I am going to ask my Democratic colleagues from Western States:  Do you really want to set this precedent? How are you going to go home  and tell people who harvest timber legally for a living that you were  good to go with this; good to go with someone who put hundreds of these  kinds of tree spikes in trees for people--our fellow Americans--to get  hurt?   But that is what we are seeing right here.   You know, I think that maybe the Biden administration, after I and  many others requested that they withdraw this nominee, that maybe they  thought: Well, look. With all the noise going on around here--a  reckless $3\1/2\ trillion tax-and-spend extravaganza, the botched  Afghanistan withdrawal, the crisis on the southern border, inflation  going through the roof, the price at the pump hurting working families  in my State and those across America,  [[Page S6824]]  the shutdown of the energy sector unilaterally and then going begging  Russia and Iran for more oil that they can import to the United  States--I mean, you can't make this stuff up.   But I think the Biden administration thought, with all this chaos  that they are creating, maybe nobody will notice Tracy Stone-Manning's  confirmation process and vote.   Well, they are wrong. As you see here, there are some really strong  feelings about this nominee--a past ecoterrorist; a member of Earth  First!, an extreme group that performed violent acts as part of their  platform for getting attention in America.   In fact, she is so extreme that the Director of BLM from the Obama- Biden administration, Bob Abbey, made a statement saying that if her  violent ecoterrorist past activities were true--and they were. They  were. I am going to talk about them. Senator Risch has already talked  about them; Senator Barrasso has; Senator Lummis has--if these were  true, then President Obama's BLM Director said she does not deserve the  job.   So this isn't just Republicans. This is the former Democrat Director  of the Agency that we are going to vote on that she wants to lead.   So before I talk a little bit more about her--and I know we have had  a number of Senators do it--I want to make another point.   The reason I have been down here so much, focused on this nominee, is  that BLM to some states--heck, if you live in Connecticut, probably  nobody knows what that is. But the Bureau of Land Management in my  State is one of the most powerful Federal Agencies there is in the  great State of Alaska.   The Alaska BLM manages more surface and subsurface acres in my State  than in any other State in the country, by far.   The BLM Director in Alaska is our landlord, and I don't want an  ecoterrorist as my State's landlord, and neither do my constituents.   Let me give you some numbers. The BLM manager in Alaska manages over  70 million surface acres of land and 220 million subsurface acres of  land in Alaska.   A little context: That is the equivalent land of about one-fifth of  the entire lower 48. Do you see why this is really important to me and  my constituents? Most States can't even comprehend land that size. One- fifth of the lower 48 of the United States of America is about the  amount of land BLM manages just in my State. This is a huge amount of  land, and, of course, by definition, a huge amount of power that this  Federal Agency has over the people I am privileged to represent--their  work, their jobs, their hunting activities, their subsistence  activities. And that is why I have been down here talking about this  nominee.   I know to some in East Coast States--forget it. We don't know who she  is. No power. She doesn't have any power over New Jersey or some of  these other small States on the East Coast.   But in my State, massive power, and it is imperative that the  Director of this Agency, the Bureau of Land Management, with so much  power and so much control over the future of Alaska and its economic  opportunity for working families, that the manager of BLM be  trustworthy, be honest, be fairminded, beyond reproach, and certainly  not someone who was involved in ecoterrorism earlier in their career.   Is that too much to ask, my colleagues in the Senate?   What we know about Tracy Stone-Manning is, she is none of these  things. She hasn't been trustworthy with the Senate, fairminded.   Well, let's go back to a little bit of her background because people  need to know this. People need to know this. My colleagues have already  done a good job, but I hope the American people are watching this. She  was not only a member of Earth First!, a radical far-left group that  has engaged repeatedly in what is defined as ecoterrorism, she,  herself, was complicit in putting metal spikes--see this--big, thick,  metal spikes, by the hundreds, in trees that were meant either to hurt  or gravely injure American citizens who were legally harvesting trees.   We are OK with that, Senate Democrats? We are OK with that? Americans  who were cutting down trees legally as part of their job to help their  economy, to help their family, who were putting trees in saw mills  legally. All the while, she and her buddies--comrades, I call them-- were acting illegally, putting these spikes, by the hundreds, in trees.   This was a common technique--tree spiking is what it is called-- developed by ecoterrorists in the 1980s and early nineties. Now, Ms.  Manning's group, Earth First!, began in the 1980s by disaffected  environmentalists who thought their movement wasn't radical enough:  ``So how can we get more attention? Let's perpetrate violence against  fellow Americans.'' That is how they could get more attention. Their  slogan was ``No compromise in the defense of Mother Earth.'' In their  view, ``no compromise'' meant destroying property, putting steel spikes  in trees that could kill someone who harvested a tree. And they  celebrated and even encouraged such actions. The group even put out a  manual detailing tree spiking and instructions on how to do other  sabotage activities: cutting down power lines, flattening tires,  burning machinery--all directed at those who were trying to legally  harvest trees.   David Foreman, the founder of Earth First!, described all these  activities as ``fun.'' ``This is where [you] can have fun.''   Let me talk a little bit about ``fun.'' I have an article from the  Washington Post during that time. They were talking about a tree- spiking incident, and I am going to quote from it:         George Alexander, a third-generation mill worker, was just       starting his shift at the Louisiana-Pacific lumber mill in       Cloverdale, Calif., when the log that would alter his life       rolled down his conveyor belt toward a high-speed saw.    Now, we have some of these saws in these mills in Alaska--not nearly  as many as we used to have. They are huge. They are giant. They are the  size of people. They spin at incredibly fast speeds with huge teeth.  They are dangerous to work with normally. But when you put a steel  spike in a tree that is going through a fastly spinning saw, you can  imagine the explosion and the violence.   I will continue the article:         It was May 1987, and Alexander was 23 [years old]. His job       was to split logs. He was nearly three feet away when the log       [he was working on] hit his saw and the [giant] saw exploded.       One half of the blade [struck] . . . the log.    It exploded when it hit one of these.         The other half hit Alexander in the [forehead, with the       giant saw] tearing through his safety helmet . . . [tearing       through his]face shield. His face was slashed from eye to       chin. His teeth were smashed and his jaw was cut in half.    Good job, Earth First!--a fellow American, trying to kill a fellow  American. These were the kind of activities that Tracy Stone-Manning  once conspired in.   I wonder if that disturbs anybody?   I was up at our fish camp on the Yukon River this summer over the  Fourth of July clearing some brush, trees, working a chain saw--a  smaller chain saw--and I literally was thinking, ``Boy, I wonder what  would happen if my chain saw hit one of these?''   It wouldn't have been good. So I think if you are not disturbed by  this, you really should be.   So I know that some of my colleagues have already read the letter on  the floor that she wrote, a profane, anonymous letter from this member  of Earth First!, about the 500 pounds of tree spikes--500 pounds-- hammered into trees in Idaho.   She rewrote the letter on a rented typewriter because, she later told  a reporter, her fingerprints were all over it. So she didn't want to be  caught. So, obviously, she knew she was engaging in criminal activity.  She didn't just handwrite it; she typed it and then sent it to the FBI.  Now, I know some of my colleagues have already read it. I am just going  to notice a couple of highlights:         This letter is being sent to notify you that the Post       Office Sale in [the great State of] Idaho has been spiked       heavily. . . .        The project required that eleven of us spend nine days in       God awful weather conditions spiking trees. We unloaded a       total of 500 pounds of spikes measuring 8 to 10 inches in       length. . . .    Five hundred pounds of these. That is a lot of spikes.         The majority of trees were spiked within the first ten       feet, but many, many others were spiked as high as a hundred       and fifty feet.    Again, why would they go that high? That is not where you are going  to cut  [[Page S6825]]  it down. So when it goes to the mill, you injure and kill the mill  workers.   She goes on further.   Mr. President, I don't know if I am allowed to swear, but you can  call me out if I am not supposed to:         P.S. You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people       could get hurt.    That is real nice.   Now, she kept quiet for many years on what she did. She later  received immunity for her part in this tree spiking when prosecutors  went after other members of Earth First!, and she testified about it.  But in her narrative, she has always tried to portray herself as a  victim.   She wasn't a victim.   The investigator of this disputes that characterization dramatically.  The U.S. Forest Service Special Agent Michael Merkley described her as  vulgar, antagonistic, and extremely anti-government. She was  uncooperative.   It was also clear that only after she knew she was going to get in  trouble that she began to cooperate. ``Let me be clear,'' Special Agent  Merkley said recently, ``Ms. Stone-Manning only came forward after her  attorney struck the immunity deal, and not before she was caught.''   In testimony to the Senate, she claimed that tree spiking was  alleged.   It wasn't alleged.   And that it was never investigated.   That is not true. We know that is not true.   So that was recent.   So it is not just the tree spiking. She hasn't been honest, but she  is still clearly a radical.   Let me give you another example. Her husband wrote an article for  Harper's Magazine--Senator Risch already talked about this--in 2018,  claiming wildfires were a political issue and that such an issue should  be solved by letting houses in forests burn.   Think about that.         Perhaps the solution to houses in the interface is to let       them burn.    Those are his exact words. Now, look, that is her husband. We can't  blame her for her husband's radical views.   But here is what she did. She weighed in herself in 2020--last year-- retweeting the article and basically endorsing his views. Here is what  she said:         Not a bad time to revisit this piece from my husband,       Richard Manning, from two years ago. Clarion call . . . [on       climate action].    So think about that.   So I was in charge of our lands in Alaska. We worked--including  fighting wildfires--we worked really closely with the Federal  Government, the State of Alaska, Federal officials, on fighting our  wildfires. We have big wildfires in Alaska, always have had them,  always will have them. Never ever, ever, in any time I was involved in  issues relating to fighting wildfires, have I heard a State official or  Federal official say, ``Hey, if there is a fire near a bunch of homes,  let them burn.''   But do you see the problem? She is going to be in charge of that in  Alaska.   ``Let them burn.''   You know what our Federal firefighters do? They save structures. They  save houses. They are very heroic.   ``Let them burn,'' she said last year.   In a nutshell, this is potentially, if we don't stop this vote  tonight, the new head of the BLM. She was a member of an ecoterrorist  group who had a goal to actually threaten to hurt or actually hurt  American citizens, hard-working Americans doing something legal. She  has clearly been dishonest recently.   With all due respect to my colleague from Montana, these are not some  kind of ad hominem attacks. These are facts.   Last year, she said: Hey, I agree with my husband's article. Let it  burn. Let the homes burn in these wildfires.   That is not going to work in my State. She is going to head up an  Agency with enormous power over my State and its future.   So, look, we have differences on issues of resource development,  energy for America, certainly on issues of jobs. In my State,  unfortunately, the Biden administration seems to, weekly, want to shut  down resources just in Alaska. I think we are up to almost 20 Executive  orders or related actions from this administration focused just on my  State--to shut down jobs.   I gave a speech here a while ago asking, not the President of the  Senate, the President of the United States: Can you imagine if a  Republican administration came in and issued almost, who knows, 10,  15--it is hard to count--Executive orders shutting down Delaware's  economy? What would you do, Mr. President, if you were a Senator? You  would be furious.   Well, I am furious, and I am furious because we have got another  radical who is going to be in charge of my State's future.   ``Let it burn.'' Tree spikes.   But here we are, unfortunately, about to confirm this individual as  the Director of BLM. But here's the thing I want to know. If you are a  western Senator--say, Arizona, Nevada, California--good luck going home  and explaining this to your constituents. Good luck with that.   I am going to just mention another nominee to speak about briefly. If  Tracy Stone-Manning weren't radical enough, I would like to mention  another Biden nominee from the far-left socialist fringe. This is Saule  Omarova, who was nominated by the President to be Comptroller of the  Currency.   So what does the Comptroller of Currency do?   It charters and regulates and supervises all national banks--another  very serious position. Not a lot of Americans, you know, highlight this  or think about it a lot. It is like BLM, but it is important and  powerful. And you would think you would have somebody in that position  who would understand or value and respect free markets in our financial  system, particularly our banks.   Ms. Omarova doesn't value our system and doesn't seem to much like  banks. She has other ideas. According to the Wall Street Journal today,  they said that it might even make our colleague Senator Sanders blush.   So who is Ms. Omarova?   First, she is a 1989 graduate in Moscow State University, where she  received the Lenin Personal Academic Scholarship. Yeah, you heard me  right. I am not talking Moscow, ID. I am talking the real Moscow in the  Soviet Union. Let me say that again. A graduate of Moscow State  University, where she received the Lenin Personal Academic Scholarship.  You can't make this stuff up.   From her writings, it appears that she still significantly believes  in what she learned at old Moscow U, particularly about our free market  system and communism and socialism.   Here is what she tweeted in 2019--2019, 3 years ago--2 years ago:  Until I came to the U.S., I couldn't imagine things like gender pay gap  still existed in today's world. Say what you want about the old USSR,  there was no gender pay gap there. Markets don't always know best.   That is a tweet 2 years ago: Say what you want about the old USSR,  about Stalin and Lenin and the roughly 100 million people killed during  their reigns. Say what you want about the old USSR, the famine, human  degradation, about the ill-fated violent attempts to snuff out the  flame of freedom and liberty all across the world. Say what you want  about the old USSR, the gulags, pogroms. At least there is no gender  gap. There is no food either, by the way; and there is no freedom.   So she is like: Hum, maybe I should clarify this.   So here is her clarification: I never claimed men and women were  treated absolutely equal in every facet of the old Soviet Union, but  people's salaries were set by the State in a gender-blind manner, and  all women got very generous benefits, but those things are still a pipe  dream in our American society.   Wow. That was her clarification. Oh, the golden days of the USSR, a  mere pipe dream now. Her nostalgia for socialist communist regimes and  policies doesn't end with pay disparities. She has advocated for  expanding the Federal Reserve's mandate to include draconian controls  over financial institutions, wages, and consumer bank deposits.   How would she do this?   Through ``a people's ledger, a national investment authority, a  public interest council.''   Sounds like a modern-day version of the system set up by the  Bolsheviks that I am sure she learned about at Moscow U. Plainly put,  she is another radical who will have sweeping powers  [[Page S6826]]  over the institutions of our United States Government.   So I am going to conclude with this: If you are watching America, I  hope you are seeing a theme here. The Biden administration,  unfortunately with the help of some of my Senate Democratic colleagues,  is trying to make us comfortable with far-left fringe radical  appointments who will take over very significant posts in our  government and will push us towards the path of socialism. They are  pushing a radical left lurch for our country that the vast majority of  Americans don't want.   Just look at what my colleagues are coming up with, with their $3\1/ 2\ trillion tax-and-spend bill written by the chairman of the Budget  Committee, an avowed socialist. It is not an insult. That is a fact.   All this is being done with no hearings, no markups; the biggest  social spending bill in decades with zero transparency. Even the House  had a markup. But the Senate, once known as the most deliberative body  in the world, is not having one hearing or one markup on a $3\1/2\  trillion reckless tax-and-spend bill.   But mainstream middle-class America does not want socialism, and they  don't want far-left radicals to run our Federal Government. My  Democratic colleagues keep thinking they can ram through this far-left  agenda without anyone noticing, but the American people are noticing.  The American people are wise, and they are already starting to feel the  pain of the Biden administration's far-left, anti-energy, anti- capitalism agenda, especially at the pump.   They will remember which Senators are enabling this, and they will  remember the Senators who have no problem voting for nominees who have  a record of being part of organizations that sought to perpetrate  violence against their fellow Americans.   I hope my Democratic colleagues have a change of heart and vote  against Tracy Stone-[Spike]-Manning because our country and my State  really don't need her in charge.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, there is a lot going in the Senate, as  we have been debating and voting on a number of things--important  matters, no doubt--for the country. But that doesn't mean that we are  going to forget other important matters that we regularly take up here  in the Senate. And what I am talking about, of course, is the Alaskan  of the Week.   Now, our pages are back, which is such great news. But you need to  know this is one of the most exciting times in the Senate. Usually  every Thursday I get an opportunity to come down here on the Senate  floor and talk about somebody in Alaska who is making a difference.   In fact, we talked about a Gold Medal Olympic athlete just a couple  of weeks ago, making a huge difference for Alaska, her community, the  world, America. So we really enjoy this. We kind of have a cult  following. But the pages really enjoy it because it is stories and  adventure, all for the people who are doing wonderful things in my  State.   This week, on the actual day of her retirement from a long and  rewarding career with the Alaska State Troopers, our Alaskan of the  Week is Anne Sears.   So before I talk about Anne and her extraordinary service to Alaska,  about her being the first and only Alaskan Native female trooper, let  me tell you a little bit about what is going on back home.   In Wasilla, AK, where Anne recently moved--she was actually born in  Nome; we will talk about that--the temperature has been in the  midforties, twenties at night. The sun rose today at 8 a.m., sets at  7:30 p.m. You know, it moves fast in Alaska. We have already had  several pretty good size snowstorms. So winter is coming. Winter is  coming--definitely coming to Alaska right now.   But let's get back to Anne. After decades of hard work as an Alaska  State Trooper, it is time for Anne to settle into a new home, to rest,  get some sleep, and think about her next steps--all of which she is  planning on doing starting tomorrow because, today, she is retiring.   So Anne Sears--well, let's start with her mother Gladyce, who is from  Nome. Gladyce actually left Nome for a little bit of time, moved to the  lower 48. And among other things, Gladyce, Anne's mom, worked here in  DC. She worked for Alaska Congressman Ralph Rivers.   Most people don't think we ever had any other Congressman but   Don  Young because he has been there forever, but this was Congressman Ralph  Rivers. And Gladyce, Anne's mom, met her husband Cary, Anne's father,  who was an electrician in the Navy. But Cary and Gladyce decided to  move back to Nome because they wanted to make sure Anne was going to be  born in Nome, which she was.  [[Page S6834]]    So Gladyce, obviously, is a woman of ambition, and so was her  daughter Anne. She passed that down to Anne. So after Anne was born and  Cary, her father, left the Navy, he got a job as an electrician with  the Federal Aviation Administration in Alaska, which took him and his  family all around the State: Bethel, Kotzebue, Unalakleet--so many  great villages in our rural part of Alaska.   Now, eventually, they settled in Juneau. And after high school, Anne  got a job as a clerk for the Juneau Police Department. All through her  younger years, she knew she wanted to do something to help people. But  it wasn't until the tender age of 31 that her calling came.   As the clerk at the Juneau Police Department, she decided: Hey, I can  do this.   So she took the test required to become a police officer. Of course,  a woman of this intelligence passed with flying colors, and she was  offered the job. On the first day of on-the-job-training, Anne was in a  police car, speeding to a site where a woman was hurt. She got there.  She helped that woman. And her desire, motivation, to be a police  officer was cemented. She was hooked.   She met her future husband Jay at the police academy, and eventually,  they became Alaska State Troopers as a couple--both of them working in  rural Alaska together, where they had worked for over 15 years.   It didn't take Anne long to realize she was actually really good at  her job. That is not being arrogant. She just knew.   ``I could talk to people,'' she said. ``Not being big and being a  woman, you've got to use your words [in this job].''   Anyone who has watched the reality show ``Alaska State Troopers''-- now, there are a lot of Alaska reality shows, but anyone at home  watching right now, if you have seen ``Alaska State Troopers,'' you  will have seen Anne featured prominently in that series, and you will  understand what she means when she talks about using her words. She is  articulate. She is tough. She is firm. She is very clear, but she is  also calming, which is what you need from a good officer. She is able  to bring calm and ease to the most volatile situations and situations  that can be extraordinarily challenging for our law enforcement  officers.   Now, as some might have heard me talk about here on the floor, the  hundreds of small, rural villages in the hub communities of rural  Alaska are literally the spiritual and cultural soul of my State.   Like many areas across America, both urban and rural, rural Alaska  also has many challenges. And one of them is that there is not enough  public safety officers present in rural Alaska. We have dozens of  communities with nothing--no sheriff, no police officer, no trooper, no  VPSO--nothing.   It is a big issue. It is something I am certainly passionate about  that we are all working on, more law enforcement presence in our rural  communities. So being a law enforcement officer in rural Alaska,  particularly in the hundreds of villages that don't have roads to get  in and out of, can pose unique challenges. Anne has seen those  challenges throughout her career.   What are some of those?   Well, first, you have to get to the village, especially if it doesn't  even have an officer in the village when this is a crime or a  challenge. That often requires flying in a single-engine plane to a  remote place in a giant State, in tough weather. Then when you get  there, you have to figure out where you need to go. Sometimes, there is  no facilities, no jail, no holding cell, no place to take people--maybe  one city office, at the most. And then you have to figure out how to  get into those offices, which can be particularly challenging,  particularly in the winter. When it is cold and dark, it might be 50  below zero with the wind howling.   So these are many, many of the challenges that Anne has dealt with.  As she says: This is not ``NCIS'' or ``Law and Order.'' In rural  Alaska, we have to do it all.   Indeed, as a trooper, she has played many roles: a protector, an  enforcer, a trooper, a friend, a confidant, a social worker. And she  loved it all, and she was really good at it. Here is what she said:         It was the best job I could have ever had and the hardest       job I could have ever had. But I couldn't have done it       without my husband, Jay, my sons, Hunter and Zachery, and my       brother, Perry.    Anne also credits the health aides and public safety officers, VPSOs,  VPOs in these villages who have really, really important roles.   One of the most difficult aspects of her job was handling cases of  domestic violence and sexual assault.   Now, I love my State. We are a great State. I come down on the floor  once a week and brag about it with our Alaskan of the Week. But this is  something we don't like to brag about in Alaska: the horrific problems  we have with domestic violence, sexual assault, and the challenges that  brings particularly with young people, too many people.   But she has been very focused on these issues. Anne teamed up with  local health providers to go into high schools, to give presentations  about these horrible crimes, and talk about why it is wrong--this kind  of abuse--and to try to change the culture of our State, which we need  to keep focused on.   She had groups and gatherings for parents too. She said mostly  mothers would come and, heartbreakingly, almost inevitably tell stories  of some of the victims and survivors of abuse that we have in our  State. But she was undeterred.   She said: If I could just touch one child on these kinds of crimes,  to help them, I know I made a difference.   Anne has made a difference--I would say a huge difference--for  Alaska.   Here is what fellow Trooper Bryan Barlow said about Anne's service:  ``Her legacy as a caring, compassionate, and dedicated trooper and  investigator has without a doubt made our State''--the great State of  Alaska--``a much safer place.''   James Cockrell, the commissioner of the Alaska Department of Public  Safety, said that Anne's dedication to rural Alaska was an  extraordinary asset to the department's mission to keep Alaskans safe.   As I have said, Anne was the first female Alaskan Native trooper, but  I guarantee you, she will not be the last. She has proved a role model  for so many, a true trailblazer, an example that we need in Alaska and  so many people look up to.   Now, she hasn't decided what the future holds, but she is still young  and still has the urge to help out. I have no doubt she is going to  make a big impact in other places, helping Alaskans. For now, though-- you can tell this is a tough job--I think she needs a little rest and  some sleep.   So, thank you, Anne, for all you have done. Congratulations on your  retirement today. From the Alaska State Troopers: Thank you for being  an inspiration, an example to so many in our great State. And, of  course, congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.    I yield the floor.
