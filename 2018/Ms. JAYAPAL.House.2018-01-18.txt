 Mr. Speaker, we are back again for the third continuing  resolution this fiscal year. This makes no sense, and it is no way to  govern. And let me be clear and repeat what my colleagues have said:  Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House, but  they just can't seem to pass a real budget.   If Republicans want Democratic votes, they need to have our  priorities reflected in that budget--priorities like protecting the  American Dream for 1.5 million DACA recipients with the Dream Act,  thousands of young people who fear deportation because of the cruel  termination of the DACA program; priorities like community health  centers and protecting the retirement savings of working families;  priorities like addressing the opioid epidemic that ravages our  communities; priorities like infrastructure, and education, and real  healthcare protections for everyone.   So if the Republican majority--yes, the majority--shuts down the  government because they won't look to get our Democratic priorities  addressed, then they will have to answer to communities across the  country who are looking for a permanent budget, not something that  kicks the can down the road for another few weeks.    Mr. Speaker, this is not a real solution. We will not  substitute one family's pain for another's gain. This is about the  lives and livelihoods of millions of people. It is about the soul of  our country, and Americans deserve a better deal.
