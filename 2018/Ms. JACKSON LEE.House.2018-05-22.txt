 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to offer my appreciation  for all of my colleagues--in particular, those who have offered this  legislation.   I recall, in the Congress preceding this, we offered a bipartisan  combination of comprehensive criminal justice reform, took bills that  included prison reform and sentencing reform, and were really on the  way to passing that combination of very important partnership.  Unfortunately, the politics of that time got in the way.   But my appreciation to Mr. Jeffries and Mr. Collins. It really is the  coming together of Members. Mr. Nadler worked very hard to inject very  important provisions, as well as many other Members. And they even did  so on the day of the markup. And all but one that Mr. Richmond, Ms.  Jackson Lee, Ms. Jayapal, and Mrs. Demings put in on retroactivity  failed in the committee.   So let me give an open letter to the mothers and fathers of  incarcerated persons who are in our constituency and, as well, to those  inmates who may, by chance, be looking at this debate. Having recently  visited one of the Federal centers, I know that inmates are astute and  concerned about their future.   So I think it is important to establish to those parents why  Democrats have consistently tried to sew together, tried to stitch  together the idea of sentencing reduction and prison reform.   Elements of this bill are striking and good. But to a mom, is it more  exciting for you to know that your son, who had an excessive sentencing  because of mandatory minimums, and you, who are incarcerated, have your  sentence reduced than maybe on the back end?   Now, it is important to note that all of those, if this bill is  passed, will participate in the rehabilitation programs, but it is also  important to note that the Bureau of Prisons has closed halfway houses.  That is a component of this bill. And they have reduced and cut the  numbers of individuals who are corrections officers to the extent that  corrections officers feel endangered and that augmentation has been  used.   Augmentation means that nurses and teachers and others who are inside  the prison are being used to augment the staff of correction officers  which have been fired--or terminated, rather--under this  administration.   In a letter from the BOP union president, they indicated that they  are severely understaffed and it would be difficult to implement this  bill without those aspects being remedied--meaning more staff, more  halfway houses, more money to implement this program.   So many of my friends have asked me: What is the harm? Let me give  you what is the harm.   First, it would divert limited resources for programming by requiring  a complex risk assessment process that would primarily benefit people  deemed at a low or minimum risk of recidivism.   That means, if you came in with a harsh drug sentence but through the  years, Mom or Dad, you saw your son or daughter fix their lives, you  would note that they, in fact, would not be eligible for this program.    Mr. Speaker, without provisions in the bill to  reduce the excessive sentencing produced by mandatory minimums for drug  offenses, overcrowding will still persist and thereby divert resources  from programs to reduce recidivism.   Let me be very clear: The corrections officers indicate they don't  have the staff. Halfway houses have been closed.   In addition, it is documented that, if your son or daughter has an  offense that was considered excluded and they have repaired their life,  through the prison they have made changes, they will not be eligible-- not for the programs, but they will not be eligible for relief.   So it is a first step. But I would simply say: If it is the first  step, why not protection of immigrants? And, also, why not have a  sentencing reform hearing, which the Republicans have canceled because  of my position on this bill?   Let us work together for what is good, Mr. Speaker. Let us make a  difference in the lives of all of the inmates.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on H.R. 5682, the ``FIRST STEP Act of  2018'' and thank my colleagues, Mr. Jeffries and Mr. Collins for  bringing this forward. This legislation purports to help reduce  recidivism for the millions of formerly incarcerated people that will  return to our communities. I respectfully reserve the right to voice my  concerns with this bill.   First, as the NY Times editorial noted, ``the biggest problem with  the FIRST STEP Act is . . . . what's left out, specifically, sentencing  reform.'' Eric Holder said in the Washington Post, ``by choosing a  tepid approach, the prison reform bill abandons years of work and risks  making it harder for Congress to advance more serious legislation in  the future. Meaningful sentencing reform will be less likely to occur  if the narrow prison bill is enacted.''   Even President Trump specifically stated during his remarks at the  White House Prison Reform Summit last Friday, ``we want the finest  prison reform bill that you could have anywhere.'' I agree with the  President on this, as I also want the finest prison reform bill. Hence,  I will continue to fight for the very best legislation that will  adequately address the nearly 650,900 formerly incarcerated people that  will return to our communities a year. That's not partisan or personal  politics, but rather, common sense, just and equitable politics.   Imagine you are a mother, child or loved one of an incarcerated  person that was robbed by a system that played Russian roulette with  his or her life because that system  [[Page H4315]]  decided they were criminals rather than victims of a public health  crisis during the crack epidemic. Now imagine that same system, rather  than remediating the tragedy it caused in broken homes and communities  through inept policies that had a racial and economic disparate impact,  now seeks to pat them on the back and further insult an entire race by  feeding them crumbs.   As a mother or loved one, you would demand that the system cure the  defect in those sentencing laws that would drastically reduce his or  her time in custody, and apply justice equitably. Let's not forget what  happened in the 1964 Crime bill. Congress has the power to do that. We  should hold ourselves accountable to deliver on the promise we made  when we acknowledged the draconian policies implemented during the  ``War on Drugs'' crisis, in passing the Fair Sentencing Act. Let's  finish what we started then, by appealing to our better angels and not  crucify each other because we disagree.   As Families Against Mandatory Minimum indicated in their letter,  ``sentencing reform should be included in any final justice reform  package.''   Second, even if the majority chose to ignore sentencing reform due to  pressure, we cannot sit idly by and allow a slim-fast version of prison  reform when dealing with the lives of millions of people.   I will not apologize for demanding more from my colleagues. I will  not apologize for fighting with every breath I have to secure justice  for those left behind. And I will not apologize for doing my job and  shedding light where we may fall short, even when we have in good  faith, tried our best. We will all go home tonight. What about those  that have longed for that same freedom after they've paid their debts  to society. We owe it to ourselves, to the thousands of broken  families, and to our society, to give each inmate that will return to  our community, their best chance at success, by providing them  incentives that will get them home to their families sooner also.   Even the bill's supporter at markup said in their letter, ``the bill  unwisely reserves its incentivized programming for those who already  pose little threat of re-offending'', for example, those that would  commit the sort of crimes alleged against Kushner and others within  Trump's orbit. The supporters go on to say, ``We fear that the bill's  failure to direct incentivized programming to the group that needs it  most will result in little or no reduction in recidivism, and, worse,  that that failure will be blamed on prisoners rather than the bill's  mistaken design.'' Most alarming here, is that great skepticism looms  even in those who want to support this endeavor, because the reality is  that the risk assessment tool is flawed.   This Kushner/Trump bill amounts to nothing more than a false sense of  hope for those who will never be released, due to either lack of  shelter given the significant reduction in housing, or lack of  eligibility per the warden.   The wide latitude and discretion given to Sessions, a person who  whole-heartedly opposes any form of effective criminal justice reform,  and proponent of over-criminalization, will inevitably prove  problematic for many who otherwise would benefit greatly from this  measure with some modicum of oversight. We should take our time to  include an independent committee that would serve as a bulwark in the  development, implementation and recommendation process of such a  program that will use novice and untested tools at the federal level.   Why must we rush this process? Why not take our time to produce the  finest prison reform bill anywhere as the President suggested? I  visited and spoke directly to guards and wardens in the BOP. They told  me they are severely understaffed and safety is paramount given the  shortage in staff. The Director of BOP quit, in the middle of Trump's  Prison Reform Summit. All of these facts tell us to wait so that we  could get it right. In NOBLE's opposition letter to this bill they  write: ``a key concern is the ability of the Federal BOP and U.S.  Attorney Offices to implement key elements of this legislation. In  particular, it will require that U.S. Attorney Offices and BOP address  their needs in staffing and funding. It is our opinion that the  proposed $50 million of funding per year for five years will not  support the bill's expanded programming.'' For these reasons I oppose  this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.   The Act does not include a single provision that will reduce the  prison time of persons who are serving unfair sentences for low-level  offenses. Even supporters of the bill like FAMM states, ``sentencing  reform should be included in any final justice reform package.''   The Act uses an untested and potentially racially and socially  discriminatory risk assessment to identify individuals who are eligible  to earn credits, which primarily depends on static factors that  correlate with socioeconomic class and race, such as criminal history,  to assess the risk. Therefore, it will likely fail to reduce crime or  mass incarceration.   The Act's exclusions would likely have a disparate impact on racial  minorities because the bill excludes individuals convicted of certain  categories of offenses from redeeming credits towards early release,  even if they successfully complete the program.   The Act leaves it to the discretion of prison wardens to determine  who can use their credits and when.   Early release would be into a halfway house system which is so  underfunded that there is no bed space. Therefore, it will be unlikely  that prisoners can truly be released given the reality of the current  halfway house system.   The Act gives a false sense of hope because it wraps the empty  promise of prison reform around exclusions and wide breadth of  discretion to a full-throated opponent to prison reform, policing  reform and sentencing reform, in Jeff Sessions.   BOP already has broad authority to implement the positive provisions  of the bill, but has opted not to and Sessions cannot be trusted to  implement these provisions.   The FIRST STEP Act includes a list of prisoners who are ineligible  for time credits if they participate in recidivism reduction programs  by virtue of their convictions for certain offenses. Prisoners who are  excluded from time credits are those convicted under Title 18, in the  following sections:   ``(i) Section 113(a)(1), relating to assault with intent to commit  murder.   ``(ii) Section 115, relating to influencing, impeding, or retaliating  against a Federal official by injuring a family member, except for a  threat made in violation of that section.   ``(iii) Any section of chapter 10, relating to biological weapons.   ``(iv) Any section of chapter 11B, relating to chemical weapons.   ``(v) Section 351, relating to Congressional, Cabinet, and Supreme  Court assassination, kidnapping, and assault.   ``(vi) Section 793, relating to gathering, transmitting, or losing  defense information.   ``(vii) Section 794, relating to gathering or delivering defense  information to aid a foreign government.   ``(viii) Any section of chapter 39, relating to explosives and other  dangerous articles, except for section 836 (relating to the  transportation of fireworks into a State prohibiting sale or use).   ``(ix) Section 842(p), relating to distribution of information  relating to explosive, destructive devices, and weapons of mass  destruction, but only if the conviction involved a weapon of mass  destruction (as defined in section 2332a(c)(2) of such title).   ``(x) Subsection (f)(3), (h), or (i) of section 844, relating to the  use of fire or an explosive.   ``(xi) Section 924(e), relating to unlawful possession of a firearm  by a person with 3 or more convictions for a violent felony.   ``(xii) Section 1030(a)(1), relating to fraud and related activity in  connection with computers.   ``(xiii) Any section of chapter 51, relating to homicide, except for  section 1112 (relating to manslaughter), 1113 (relating to attempt to  commit murder or manslaughter, but only if the conviction was for an  attempt to commit manslaughter), 1115 (relating to misconduct or  neglect of ship officers), or 1122 (relating to protection against the  human immunodeficiency virus).   ``(xiv) Any section of chapter 55, relating to kidnapping.   ``(xv) Any offense under chapter 77, relating to peonage, slavery,  and trafficking in persons, except for sections 1592 through 1596.   ``(xvi) Section 1751, relating to Presidential and Presidential staff  assassination, kidnapping, and assault.   ``(xvii) Section 1841(a)(2)(C), relating to intentionally killing or  attempting to kill an unborn child.   ``(xviii) Section 1992, relating to terrorist attacks and other  violence against railroad carriers and against mass transportation  systems on land, on water, or through the air.   ``(xix) Section 2113(e), relating to bank robbery resulting in death.   ``(xx) Section 2118(c)(2), relating to robberies and burglaries  involving controlled substances resulting in death.   ``(xxi) Section 2119(3), relating to taking a motor vehicle (commonly  referred to as `carjacking') that results in death.   ``(xxii) Any section of chapter 105, relating to sabotage, except for  section 2152.   ``(xxiii) Any section of chapter 109A, relating to sexual abuse,  except that with regard to section 2244, only a conviction under  subsection (c) of that section (relating to abusive sexual contact  involving young children) shall make a prisoner ineligible under this  subparagraph.   ``(xxiv) Section 2251, relating to the sexual exploitation of  children.   ``(xxv) Section 2251A, relating to the selling or buying of children.   ``(xxvi) Any of paragraphs (1) through (3) of section 2252(a),  relating to certain activities relating to material involving the  sexual exploitation of minors.

The exclusions also apply to convictions under the following sections  of Title 42, Title 49, Title 21, Title 8 and Title 50:   ``(xxxvi) Section 57(b) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C.  2077(b)), relating to the engagement or participation in the  development or production of special nuclear material.   ``(xxxvii) Section 92 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C.  2122), relating to prohibitions governing atomic weapons.   ``(xxxviii) Section 101 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C.  2131), relating to the atomic, energy license requirement.   ``(xxxix) Section 224 or 225 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42  U.S.C. 2274, 2275), relating to the communication or receipt of  restricted data.   ``(xl) Section 236 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2284),  relating to the sabotage of nuclear facilities or fuel.   ``(xli) Section 60123(b) of title 49, United States Code, relating to  damaging or destroying a pipeline facility, but only if the conduct  which led to the conviction involved a substantial risk of death or  serious bodily injury.   ``(xlii) Section 401(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.  841), relating to manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance,  but only in the case of a conviction for an offense described in  subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (b)(1) of that section for  which death or serious bodily injury resulted from the use of such  substance.   ``(xliii) Section 276(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8  U.S.C. 1326), relating to the reentry of a removed alien, but only if  the alien is described in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b) of  that section.   ``(xliv) Any section of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50  U.S.C.

The exclusions also apply those prisoners convicted of a prior  Federal or State ``serious violent felony,'' described as follows (in  Title 18):   ``(xlvii) An offense described in section 3559(c)(2)(F), for which  the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than one  year, if the offender has a previous conviction, for which the offender  served a term of imprisonment of more than one year, for a Federal or  State offense, by whatever designation and wherever committed,  consisting of murder (as described in section 1111), voluntary  manslaughter (as described in section 1112), assault with intent to  commit murder (as described in section 113(a)), aggravated sexual abuse  and sexual abuse (as described in sections 2241 and 2242), abusive  sexual contact (as described in sections 2244(a)(1) and (a)(2)),  kidnapping (as described in chapter 55), carjacking (as described in  section 2119), arson (as described in section 844(f)(3), (h), or (i)),  or terrorism (as described in chapter 113B.   Finally, prisoners may not obtain credit for participation in  recidivism reduction programs if they: (1) completed recidivism  reduction programming before enactment of the Act; (2) completed  recidivism reduction programming during official detention before  moving to Bureau of Prisons; or (3) are inadmissible or deportable  under immigration law.                                           The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                       Washington, DC, May 21, 2018.                     Vote ``No'' on The FIRST STEP Act         Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, and the 109 undersigned       organizations, we write to urge you to vote NO on The FIRST       STEP Act (H.R. 5682). While well intentioned, this bill takes       a misguided approach to reforming our federal justice system.       Without question, we appreciate the inclusion of some       promising provisions to address some of the problems in the       federal prison system, however, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)       already has broad authority to make the majority of these       changes through administrative action. In sum, this bill       falls short on its promise to ``meaningfully'' tackle the       problems in the federal justice system--racial disparities,       draconian mandatory minimum sentences, persistent       overcrowding, lack of rehabilitation, and the exorbitant       costs of incarceration. Decisions we make now through this       bill could have deep implications for our ability to impact       the abiding and deepening harms that lead to mass       incarceration.        As such, we continue to have several, grave concerns with       The FIRST STEP Act, including:        The Dangerous ``Risk Assessment System'': The Act purports       to offer people in prison the chance to ``earn time credits''       towards early release to pre-release custody--but by building       and placing a ``risk and needs assessment'' algorithm in the       hands of the Attorney General--one not required to be       designed or tailored for the individuals it is meant to       judge--we risk embedding deep racial and class bias into       decisions that heavily impact the lives and futures of       federal prisoners and their families.        Researchers have shown that risk assessment tools applied       in sentencing decisions in Florida--meant to predict       recidivism--were twice as likely to be wrong when evaluating       Black people as White people. One of the first independent       studies analyzing the use of risk assessment in pretrial       showed that decisionmakers using risk assessment tools--in       this case, Kentucky judges--ignored their results over time,       while also overseeing an increase in failures-to-appear at       court and an increase in pretrial arrests. A further recent       analysis showed that risk assessment tools are as accurate as       a prediction made by a random human selected over the       Internet.        We cannot introduce algorithmic risk assessment into the       assignment of housing and release decisions or rehabilitative       opportunities without sufficient transparency, independent       testing for decarceral and anti-racist results prior to       implementation, and regular effective oversight for not just       what the tool purports to predict, but how decisionmakers in       our prison system use it. The Act uses ``risk assessments''       in an untested manner. It fails to ensure transparency,       independent testing, or analysis of the proposed risk       assessment system or its results prior to its adoption or       implementation. And again, it doesn't require the tool to be       designed or tailored for the individuals it is meant to       judge.        Without these things, and in the hands of the nation's most       prominent proponent of a punishing, rather than a       rehabilitative criminal justice system, ``risk assessments''       will further embed racism into the meting out of resources       that could change prisoners' lives--like access to treatment,       work, and most importantly, the ability to earn time off of a       sentence.        The Overbroad List of Exclusions: The majority of people in       prison will eventually be released. Categorically excluding       entire groups of people from receiving early-release credits       will undermine efforts to reduce prison overcrowding and       improve public safety since such exclusions weaken the       incentive to participate in recidivism-reduction programming.       Furthermore, many of these exclusions, such as those based on       immigration-related offenses, could have a disproportionate       impact on people of color.        The Overbroad Discretion Provided to Attorney General       Sessions: The bill gives broad authority to the Attorney       General and would rely upon implementation by this       administration. Despite assurances to the contrary, this       administration has failed to take any active steps to improve       the justice system, has dismantled existing protections, and       has shown outright hostility to people of color and other       historically marginalized communities. Furthermore, Attorney       General Jeff Sessions is a well-known, longtime opponent of       sentencing and prison reform. It would be unwise and harmful       to vest so much discretion in an Attorney General so hostile       to meaningful justice reform.        The Misplaced Incentive System: Effectively reducing       recidivism requires targeting those most likely to reoffend       with rehabilitative programming. Yet, under this bill, only       ``minimum'' and ``low-risk'' prisoners would be able to       redeem their earned time credits, and they would earn more       credits than prisoners categorized as ``medium'' or ``high-      risk.'' Given that time credits would also be subject to       denial by the BOP warden and they are not real time off of a       sentence but rather a flawed mechanism to transition into a       decreasing number of halfway houses or to home confinement       that is rarely used by BOP, the bill is unlikely to provide       the incentives that would meaningfully reduce recidivism.        Allows for the privatization of certain public functions       and allows private entities to profit from incarceration. The       bill retains a provision that in order to expand programming       and productive activities, the Attorney General shall develop       policies for wardens of each BOP facility to enter into       partnerships with private entities and industry-sponsored       organizations.        The Absence of Appropriations for Implementation: The       resources needed to expand programming authorized under the       bill have not been--and may never be--appropriated. In fact,       Congress could decide today, absent this legislation, that       prison programming should be funded and increase the BOP's       budget by $50 million a year for the next five  [[Page H4317]]       years. Instead, the FY19 BOP budget calls for a reduction.       Furthermore, the recidivism reduction programming that       currently exists in the federal prison system is grossly       underfunded and not enough to serve those currently       incarcerated. Therefore, without any guarantees that the       necessary funding will be appropriated, this bill is an empty       promise.        The Undetermined Human and Fiscal Impact: It is unclear       what the fiscal impact of this bill will be, given that the       Congressional Budget Office has not released a score for the       bill. Moreover, it is unclear what the human impact of this       bill will be, given that neither the BOP nor the U.S.       Sentencing Commission has produced updated estimates on the       number of people projected to be impacted by the legislation.       Proponents argue that at least 4,000 people will be impacted       by the good time fix alone; however, relying on that number       is misleading because it is based upon data that is over a       decade old. No hearings have been held and there is no CBO       score available in order to explore these questions further.        The Omission of Sentencing Reform: Sentencing reform and       prison reform are both important, but one will not work       without the other. Meaningful reform requires both.       Furthermore, advancing prison reform as a stand-alone will       undermine longstanding, bipartisan efforts in the Senate to       advance a comprehensive justice reform package that includes       sentencing reform.        Last week, we were joined by over 70 civil rights       organizations in opposing this well-intentioned, but       misguided legislation at the House Judiciary Committee       markup. Many of our concerns were also shared by the American       Federation of Government Employees representing 33,000       federal correctional workers in the Bureau of Prisons, as       well as Representatives Lewis, Jackson Lee, and Senators       Durbin, Booker, and Harris in a recent Dear Colleague letter.       While we appreciate the inclination to support legislation       that endeavors to reform our prison system, we believe that       this particular bill would do more harm than good and would       have unintended consequences that ripple into the future.        Finally, if presented with one choice, ``to take what we       can get now,'' then we must ensure that ``what we get'' will       not perpetuate the existing harms of mass incarceration or       give false hope to the men and women languishing in prison       and the communities we represent. Our communities are being       demonized and criminalized so we must stand firm to resist       the lure of a compromise that is ultimately a false promise       that may never be realized and isn't in their best interests.        For the foregoing reasons, we urge you to vote ``No'' on       the FIRST STEP Act and The Leadership Conference will include       your position on the bill in our voting scorecard for the       115th Congress.

Re FIRST STEP Act, H.R. 5682, falls far short of meaningful           criminal justice reform.       Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McConnell and Minority       Leaders Pelosi and Schumer: As Congress prepares to consider       the FIRST STEP Act, I write to express The Sentencing       Project's significant concerns regarding the bill's       deficiencies in addressing the overcrowding, staffing and       programming crisis within the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Reform       of the federal prison and sentencing system is long overdue       and The Sentencing Project has been at the forefront of       promoting comprehensive recommendations to ensure a more       humane, fair and proportional system for more than two       decades.        Unfortunately, H.R. 5683 falls short of these objectives in       two key areas. First, it would divert limited resources for       programming by requiring a complex risk assessment process       that would primarily benefit people deemed at a low or       minimal risk of recidivating. Second, without provisions in       the bill to reduce the excessive sentencing produced by       mandatory minimums for drug offenses, overcrowding will       persist and thereby divert resources from programs to reduce       recidivism.        The federal prison system currently operates at 14 percent       above capacity, and at higher rates at high and medium       security institutions, 24 percent and 18 percent       respectively. Along with an ``inmate to correctional       officer'' ratio among the highest in the country at 8.9 to 1,       prison safety concerns are at critical levels. Indeed, the       rate for some types of assaults in federal prisons has       steadily increased since 2014. In order to successfully       reform the federal prison system, including improving       conditions of confinement in areas such as medical and mental       health care, and to comprehensively rehabilitate instead of       warehouse the people confined within, Congress should adopt       policies to reduce the population, invest in correctional and       programming staff, and fully fund programming for all       incarcerated people.        H.R. 5682 would authorize only $50 million per year to       carry out the bill's mandates to create a risk assessment       tool to determine earned time credit eligibility, and expand       programming and community corrections capacity. While The       Sentencing Project supports the bill sponsors' stated       intentions to reform prisons, their promises of change ring       hollow. For example, the bill excludes thousands of people in       prison from benefiting from the programming incentives that       allow for earlier transition into community corrections. By       doing so it conflicts with research that demonstrates that       prison programming and associated incentives are most cost-      effective when provided to the highest risk groups.        Current authorization levels will only scratch the surface       in overcoming the huge deficit of programming at the BOP.       Indeed, the waiting list for the BOP's literacy program alone       is 16,000. Moreover, because of overcrowding and staff       shortages, many programming staff are regularly required to  [[Page H4318]]       augment correctional officer duties, resulting in fewer       programming opportunities. This staffing shortage may partly       explain why the number of people completing their GED dropped       by 59 percent between FY2016 and FY2017. Congress must take       more determined and thoughtful steps to change this dire       situation.        The Sentencing Project is pleased by the growing bipartisan       consensus among lawmakers to prioritize change in the       nation's criminal justice system. We will continue to be a       part of this conversation and look forward to strengthening       effective bipartisan reforms to achieve shared goals of       justice, fairness and safety.            Sincerely,                                                        Marc Mauer,      Executive Director.                                   ____                   [From the Washington Post, May 21, 2018]     There's Something Huge Missing From the White House's Prison Bill                          (By Eric H. Holder Jr.)         Over the past decade, Republicans and Democrats across the       country have joined forces to advocate for a fairer, more       effective criminal-justice system--one that would keep us       safe while reducing unnecessary mass incarceration. At the       heart of that effort has been an attempt to reduce overly       punitive sentences that fill our prisons for no discernible       public-safety rationale.        But now the Trump administration is pushing a misguided       legislative effort--likely to be voted on in the House this       week--that threatens to derail momentum for sentencing       reform. The bill is a tempting half-measure, but lawmakers       should resist the lure. The chance to implement real,       comprehensive reform may not come again any time soon.        It's easy to miss, but the push for bipartisan sentencing       reform has slowly been gaining strength. It was nothing short       of remarkable when Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) led the       Senate Judiciary Committee this past February to approve a       measure that would revise the federal government's outdated       federal mandatory minimum sentences. Grassley's move--in       direct defiance of the administration--was the most       significant legislative step toward federal criminal-justice       reform in decades.        Unfortunately, this progress has hit a roadblock with the       Trump administration's modest prison reform bill, called the       First Step Act. The bill seeks to improve prison conditions--      such as by requiring that inmates be housed within 500       driving miles of their families and by prohibiting shackles       on pregnant women. It also includes education, job training       and other personal development programs, as well as a system       of incentives to participate in the programs. These narrow       reforms are important, but they do not require congressional       action, nor do they deliver the transformative change we       need. The only way to do that is by amending the bill to       include comprehensive, bipartisan sentencing reform.        Why is this so important? The statistics are stark and, by       now, well-known. The United States has 5 percent of the       world's population, but 25 percent of its prisoners. Mass       incarceration is a core civil rights struggle for this       generation: One in three black men will be behind bars at       some point, a disparity that perpetuates underemployment in       the black community and contributes to the racial wealth gap.       The system is hugely expensive and ultimately unfair. And it       is not necessary to prevent and punish crime.        It is impossible to right this wrong unless we send the       right people to prison for appropriate lengths of time. That       starts by making sure that federal prison sentences are smart       on crime rather than thoughtlessly ``tough.'' The Justice       Department worked toward that goal when I led the agency       under President Barack Obama, blunting the impact of harsh       mandatory minimum sentences by directing federal prosecutors       to seek lower charges when possible. It worked. The federal       prison population dropped while the nation continued to       experience near-record-low crime rates.        As Grassley's support shows, this is not just a priority       for Democrats. He worked with Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.)       and others to advance the Sentencing Reform and Corrections       Act, which would reduce some mandatory minimum sentences. The       bill failed in 2016 as a victim of election-year politics,       but when Grassley doggedly brought it up again in February,       it passed through the committee by a vote of 16 to 5, with       support from several members of his own party.        Republicans and Democrats are enacting bold sentencing       reforms at the state level, too. Texas, Oklahoma and       Massachusetts are just a few of the states that have made       changes to cut back on overly punitive mandatory minimum       sentences.        Unfortunately, the White House has different ideas.       President Trump warned of ``American carnage'' in his       inaugural address, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions has       stoked false and misleading claims of rising crime. Bowing to       the president's most extreme allies, the White House has put       forward the First Step Act, which leaves out sentencing       reform entirely.        By choosing a tepid approach, the prison bill abandons       years of work and risks making it harder for Congress to       advance more serious legislation in the future. Meaningful       sentencing reform will be less likely to occur if the narrow       prison bill is enacted.        Fortunately, lawmakers have time to change course. They can       ensure that any legislation includes sentencing reform, on       which there is such strong consensus. Progressive lawmakers       in particular should fight to extend, not abandon, the Obama       administration's criminal-justice legacy. Conservative allies       such as Grassley have stepped forward for a shared strategy       and needed policies; Democrats should stand with them.        Nobody is under any illusions: Criminal-justice reform is       hard. The White House might scuttle the bill entirely, and       wavering members of Congress might balk. But to reform       America's prisons, we must change the laws that send people       to them in the first place. Anything less represents a       failure of leadership.
