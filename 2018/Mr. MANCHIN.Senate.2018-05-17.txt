 Mr. President, I wish today to honor the life of  a West Virginia son and selfless public servant, Christopher P.  Stadelman.   After the news that Chris lost his hard-fought, 4-year battle with  colon cancer on Friday, May 11, 2018, loved ones and friends from  across West Virginia joined in a chorus of sadness for the loss of such  a remarkable person, but also thankfulness for the inspiring life he  lived.   Chris dedicated his life to serving the people of West Virginia as a  journalist and editor at the Charleston Daily Mail, as the co-owner and  operator of the Parsons Advocate with his incredible wife, Kelly, and  as communications director and chief of staff for Governor Earl Ray  Tomblin. Chris said these were his ``dream jobs'', and he certainly  made an enduring impact through each one of them.   Chris and Kelly called two places home: Charleston and Thomas, WV. He  is a member of the Marshall University Journalism Hall of Fame and was  named a Distinguished West Virginian by Governor Tomblin and an  Honorary Mountaineer Brigadier by MG James Hoyer of the West Virginia  National Guard.   He loved the news and seemed to always know the latest news well  before it broke. He loved debating politics and policy. He loved  baseball, especially the Pittsburgh Pirates. He loved his dogs. Above  all, he loved Kelly.   When they ran the Parsons Advocate together, Chris would often go to  the scene of news and report back to Kelly in the newsroom. For 18  years, they were partners in every sense, and she was his rock as he  fought colon cancer with fearless resolve.   During his 4-year battle, on most days, you wouldn't have known Chris  was sick. In the Governor's office, he was often the first to arrive in  the mornings and the last to leave. After the tragic flooding that took  23 lives in West Virginia in 2016, Chris was tireless in finding ways  to help West Virginians recover, even leading the charge to establish a  program that has helped people rebuild their homes.   It is because of all of this and so much more that Chris has been  surrounded with a family of friends and supporters who proudly proclaim  the name Team Stadelman.   I have always been moved by Chris's inspiring life, and my abiding  thoughts and prayers are with Kelly; his mom, Nancy; his stepmom,  Helen; his siblings, Matt, Jonathan, Philip, and Rachel; and all of  Team Stadelman.   Last year, Chris's father, Paul, lost his own battle with cancer.  When reflecting on his son's illness, Paul wrote, ``So much has been  shared. So much has been given. So much has been accomplished.''   And for that, West Virginia is so much better.

A native of Pittsburgh, PA, Pat has always showcased a passion for  giving back to the communities and the people of this special region,  and my wife, Gayle, and I are so very proud to call him a dear friend.  He has been a part of the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation for  more than 24 years, serving as president since 1998 and a trustee since  1994. The foundation serves the people of West Virginia, southwestern  Pennsylvania, and the multistate economic region centered on  Pittsburgh.   In addition to his role with the foundation, he serves on numerous  boards and committees that range from efforts in economic and community  development, to policy research, to attracting and retaining diverse  talent, to the statewide economic development initiative in West  Virginia, called Vision Shared. He was a founding member and past chair  of the Fund for the Advancement of Minorities through Education, a past  board member of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania, a  past member of the West Virginia Jobs Cabinet, and served on the  advisory board for the West Virginia Teacher Quality Initiative. He  also serves on the implementation committee of the Tri-State Shale  Coalition, which is a collaborative effort by the Governors of West  Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania seeking to optimize downstream  economic development pertaining to shale gas and especially modern  manufacturing. Since 2006, he has been a leader of Power of 32, a 32- county, four-State economic development project in the Pittsburgh  region.   Prior to beginning his role as president of the foundation in 1999,  Pat had practiced law with Pittsburgh's firm, Meyer, Unkovic, and Scott  for nearly 30 years. In addition to his work at the foundation, Pat has  had an unparalleled commitment to advancing educational opportunities  for young people and enhancing the quality of life in the region.  Countless families have felt the impact of his outstanding efforts and  leadership, and he has had a hand in preparing the future leaders of  our region to be well-prepared, inspired, and unafraid of creativity,  no matter their circumstances.   The people of the region Pat and I share have an exceptional can-do  spirit, a neighborly love that is unrelenting, and are grounded by the  same core principle: to help others be the best they can be. That is  Pat's legacy as a public servant and as a leader, and there is no  greater achievement than to be in a position to give back to the  communities you love.   While he is retiring and everyone is certain to miss his strong  leadership, Pat's dedication and commitment to excellence will leave a  lasting legacy with the countless lives he has touched. Again, I  congratulate Pat for his remarkable years of service, and I am honored  to wish good health and much happiness to him and his family in the  days and years ahead.                            ____________________
