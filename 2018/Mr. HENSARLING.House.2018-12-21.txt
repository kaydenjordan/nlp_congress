 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7388) to extend the National Flood Insurance Program, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7388         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.  [[Page H10568]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the National Flood Insurance Program is a program that  has a number of challenges, but it is also a vital program for  Americans who live in flood-prone areas.   The challenges in the program are well-known. Regrettably, it is  going bankrupt. Regrettably, it incents people to live in areas that  are repeatedly flooded. Regrettably, it is a program that protects a  government monopoly; that is why the House, earlier this year, acted  with a comprehensive reform bill. Unfortunately, our friends on the  other side of the Capitol have yet to act.   We do not wish to have the current program lapse; thus, we are on the  floor at this very moment.   This is a very simple bill. It would provide a temporary, short-term  authorization through the end of May of 2019, regrettably, I believe  now, the ninth extension since the House has acted.   And it also ensures that we provide certainty, certainty to the  market of what the policies of the National Flood Insurance Program  are.   I was there in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. And one of the  great tragedies--there were many tragedies, but one of the great  tragedies was how few people actually had flood insurance. So what we  want is a system that, hopefully, will see more people have flood  coverage written into their homeowners' insurance policy.   So the NFIP wisely had moved in the direction of what they call  allowing insurance companies to not have to have a non-compete. This is  a current policy of the program, but too many insurance companies don't  believe that policy will stay. So we will ensure that that policy stays  through this bill, so that more people in a tragic situation will be  covered by flood insurance.   So, again, this ensures that current policy is at least extended  through May of 2019. It adds certainty to current policy.   I know in discussions with the ranking member--who has a lot of  expertise in the subject of flood--we negotiated in good faith. We  didn't quite get there on the comprehensive bill, but she agrees that  we need this bill, right now, to ensure that current policy is  extended, at least through May of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just point out again, all this  bill does is extend for 6 months the current policies of the NFIP. Not  one single policy of the NFIP is changed in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority whip for his kind words and our  ability to work together to put together a product that we are both  proud of and that the House passed. Again, we regret that those on the  other side of the Capitol have not seen the wisdom to put forth any  plan.   What we have before us is something that is quite simple. If you  believe that you want to create at least 6 months of certainty for the  market, for the real estate market, residential market, particularly in  flood-prone areas, then you will pass this bill, because this is the  one that creates certainty that every single current policy of the NFIP  is extended for 6 months. That is what it does.   It codifies one particular policy of the NFIP, and this creates more  certainty. This is what people have come to the floor to say they want.   Again, I lament the fact we are not doing a 5-year reauthorization. I  lament the fact we are not dealing with many of the challenges that I  mentioned earlier, but at least, today, we can create certainty for 6  months as negotiations continue in the next Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
