 Mr. Speaker, Trump has no plan, no strategy in the  Middle East, but this self-described ``stable genius,'' who tells us he  is smarter than our generals, smarter than our military and  intelligence leaders, he wants sole control over whether our Nation is  plunged into a war with Iran.   Today, we say: No, Mr. President. You are not yet the tyrant that you  wish to become. You defied military judgment by rejecting the Iran  nuclear agreement. You abruptly abandoned our Kurdish allies, so vital  to the fight against ISIS and terrorism, and you have taken us to the  brink of war with an assassination of a foreign leader without any  imminent threat demonstrated, only double-talk to explain that  assassination.   It is time to put the brakes on his dangerous pursuits.   We reject this reckless and impulsive escalation, the endless  bloodshed, and the lack of vision beyond promoting his own selfish  interests.   It is Congress that our Constitution vests with responsibility to  declare war.   If 1776 stood for anything, it was that America would not be ruled by  a king or one who today aspires to be an authoritarian.   This legislation will cut off funds for future war with Iran unless  Congress authorizes war, has a specific authorization, or we face a  true, genuine imminent threat.   Before young Americans are again placed in harm's way, let's be sure  it is the only choice to ensure our security and have a strategy for  victory.  [[Page H723]]    Today, let's set the groundwork for peace, not more architecture for  endless war.
