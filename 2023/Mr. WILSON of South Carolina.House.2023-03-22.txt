 Mr. Speaker, as revealed by The Wall  Street Journal on March 10:         The Pentagon's budget request seems large, but the figure       is only a 3.2 percent increase, and with inflation at 6       percent it means a decline in buying power. Compare the       growth to the double-digit increases for domestic accounts:       19 percent for the Environmental Protection Agency; 13.6 for       both Education and Energy Departments; 11.5 percent for       Health and Human Services.        Defense in 2022 was only 3 percent of GDP, down from 6       percent during the Cold War, even though America's challenges       today are more numerous and acute.        Mr. Biden's largest failure is promising his budget will       keep America safe instead of leveling with the public about       the threats.    We should have a return of bipartisan support for defending American  families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the Global War on Terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to the safe haven of America.   Thank you to the Prime Minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, for the  courage to visit Kyiv, Ukraine, this week as the democracies unite  against war criminal Putin.                            ____________________
