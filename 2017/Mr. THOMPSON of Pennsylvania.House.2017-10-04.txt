 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend  the Department of Veterans Affairs for proposing a rule that will allow  VA-credentialed healthcare providers to practice telemedicine across  State lines. This is excellent news because our veterans should receive  the best care possible no matter where they live or are located.   With advances in technology, we see new opportunities for veterans to  obtain coverage through telemedicine, especially in some of our most  rural areas.   The VA rule is similar to a bill that I introduced together with  Representative Julia Brownley, called the VETS Act. The existing  licensure requirements for VA service providers are not in line with  the technology and care available today.   Outdated regulations prevent individuals who receive care within the  VA system from accessing qualified providers who utilize telemedicine  simply because of the geography and a State border. That is wrong, and  we must change it.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the VETS Act and work to give our  veterans access to the best care possible. Our servicemen and -women  answered their country's call. Let's be there for them when they return  home.                            ____________________
