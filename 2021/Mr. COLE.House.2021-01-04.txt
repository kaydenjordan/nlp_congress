 Madam Speaker, I really think that my good friends in the  majority need more time to present a fair rules package. So I move to  postpone consideration of H. Res. 8 until January 5, 2021.                               Motion to Table     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.

Mr. Womack, Mr. Posey, Ms. Waters, Mr. Smith of Washington, and Mr.  Langevin appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of office,  as follows:         Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the       Constitution of the United States against all enemies,       foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and       allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely,       without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and       that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the       office on which you are about to enter, so help you God.     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, my  very good friend, Chairman McGovern, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes; and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to address the majority's proposed  changes in the Rules of the House of Representatives for the 117th  Congress.   These changes are some of the harshest and most cynical that I have  experienced during my time in Congress. Democratic leadership is  suppressing minority rights and paving the way for the Green New Deal  by intentionally removing budgetary checks that have been in place for  over a decade.   The most egregious of these changes is the complete gutting of the  motion to recommit. The motion to recommit, or the MTR, is the  minority's right to propose a final amendment before moving passage.  This is a right that has been guaranteed to the minority for well over  a century.   With today's changes, the majority is seeking to silence views they  are afraid of with no regard for this institution or the American  people's trust in our constitutional responsibility to govern and  govern well. They are taking away the ability to debate a motion to  recommit and the ability to offer a motion to recommit with  instructions. This completely guts the minority's ability to offer a  last amendment on the floor prior to passage of legislation.   I would remind my colleagues that during the many years Republicans  were in the majority, we never even thought to deny the minority this  motion. And the only reason Democrats are doing so today is out of  embarrassment. They are embarrassed that the  [[Page H22]]  Republicans were able to pass eight motions to recommit in the 116th  Congress. But rather than acknowledging that Republicans sometimes have  good policy ideas that should be incorporated into legislation, the  majority is instead seeking to completely cut off this key right, and  that, Madam Speaker, is simply reprehensible.    Madam Speaker, the motion to recommit has been around since the  beginning of the House as an institution, and it has been in its  present form since 1909. In fact, in 1919, Representative Abraham  Garrett of Tennessee, noted that ``the motion to recommit is regarded  as so sacred it is one of the few rules protected against the Committee  on Rules by the general rules of the House.''   And when Speaker Pelosi was herself in the minority, she equated the  motion to recommit with the right of free speech enshrined in our  Constitution. How this majority can now decide that a procedure that is  so important it is on par with the guarantee of free speech must be  eliminated is beyond my understanding.   Madam Speaker, it is simply shocking that Democrats are so afraid of  Republican ideas that they feel the need to rig the system against us.  They don't want the House to work its will. They only want the  Speaker's will. And we all know why that is. It is because the majority  cannot effectively defend its policies against competing ideas.   Eight times in the last Congress a majority of the House agreed that  the Republican policy idea had merit and should be included in the  final bill. But that state of affairs is evidently so embarrassing to  Democrats that they can't stand it, and now they have to completely  shut down minority rights lest they be embarrassed further, especially  after the November election dealt them a harsh blow and they lost seats  in their own ranks.   Madam Speaker, I want to offer my friends on the other side of the  aisle a word of warning: Majorities do not last forever. If there is  one certainty we can take away from the history of American politics,  it is that the party in power in the House of Representatives today  will not hold that position forever. I can also guarantee you that your  efforts to shut us down will not shut us up.   So instead of having bills that pass with slight improvements made  through an MTR, bills will fail here on the House floor. And for that  reason, among others, I am sure Democrats will regret making this  egregious change in the very near future. Republicans are proud to  debate our policies and proposals, unlike the majority today, whose  record of promised openness and fulsome debate is an abject failure.   Now, Madam Speaker, while gutting the MTR may be the worst piece of  this rules package to many, I want to applaud my friends for removing  an almost equally egregious piece of this rules package. When the  majority released this package over the weekend, there was a  particularly noxious provision that would have empowered the Speaker of  the House to censor the free speech of Members and employees of the  House. What is worse, it would have empowered the Speaker to act as the  sole judge, jury, and executioner, and included no clear guidelines for  how this would be enforced. This proposed rule was downright un- American.   Fortunately, my friends on the other side of the aisle have listened  to reason and removed that provision from this package. I wish they had  further listened to reason and removed the provision taking away the  minority's right to an MTR, which is why I offered a very reasonable  motion to postpone for one day.   Madam Speaker, I could go on all day about the MTR, but there are  other changes in this rules package that need to be highlighted.  Slipped into the package is another change that will effectively  eliminate the paygo rule. Paygo is a useful budgetary control measure  that essentially says that we can't spend money that we don't have. But  if the majority gets their way, paygo will be eliminated for a broad  category of topics, including for measures relating to climate change.  This is doing nothing more than removing a key barrier to the Green New  Deal and other liberal tax-and-spend policies.   But never before has the majority tried to lift budgetary rules on  something as absurdly expensive as the Green New Deal, which is  estimated to cost as much as $100 trillion over the next decade, should  it be enacted.   It is clear that the majority doesn't even want to have a  conversation about the cost of the Green New Deal, and instead wants to  ensure that the American people never find out about the cost of their  extreme plans.   There are other measures in this rules package that are just as  absurd. Not content with having investigated President Trump throughout  his Presidency and subjected him to pointless impeachment, now  Democrats are including provisions allowing them to send subpoenas to  former Presidents, former Vice Presidents, and former White House  staff, long after their administration has ended.   This provision is a continuation of the Democratic majority's  obsession with investigating President Trump and his administration,  and ensures they will be able to keep their investigation gravy train  rolling along long after the President leaves office.   There is a similar provision which will allow certain committee  chairs to reissue subpoenas prior to the committee organizing for the  117th Congress, thus ensuring that existing investigations into  President Trump, no matter how silly or pointless, will not have to  slow down or even let the new Congress consider their current merits or  legislative justification.   Allowing a chair to issue subpoenas without any consultation with  membership or with the minority is nothing less than an abuse of power.  But I suppose I should not expect any less given the other provisions  in this package.   Madam Speaker, despite my affection for my friend on the other side  of the aisle, I have to tell him that this package stinks. It is deeply  cynical and deeply short-sighted. It tramples on minority rights and  it ensures a power grab by Democratic leadership. It will change the  nature of this institution, and not for the better.    Madam Speaker, today, I call on all Members to vote ``no'' on this  rules package. I ask all of my colleagues, regardless of party, to  reject these radical and, at times, ridiculous changes. I call on all  my colleagues to protect minority rights. The future of this  institution depends on it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to my  friend.   I remind my friend that you accepted eight MTRs, or eight were  approved, because Democrats decided the Republican proposals were good  proposals and made the bill better. We couldn't have done it on our  own. So, you are actually limiting the choices in front of your own  Members.   We might not feel so strongly about the MTR if we got more amendments  approved anyway. We only get about 18 percent of the amendments. When  we were in the majority, we gave you 45. We got 38. You now get 68. So,  you are taking a tool away that is important to us.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis), my very good friend and the distinguished ranking member  on the House Administration Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), my very good friend and the distinguished  Republican whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  quickly respond to my friend.   Ms. Scanlon said the eight MTRs that passed this House were poison  pills. By definition, they weren't. They passed the House. Democrats  voted for them. Things like fighting against anti-Semitism is hardly a  poison pill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona  (Mrs. Lesko), my very good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my very good friend and a former member of  the Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith), my very good friend and ranking  Republican member of the Committee on the Budget.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished new  Member from the great State of Texas (Ms. Van Duyne), who will be  making her first address on the House floor.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, Madam Speaker, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately amend the rules package to strike  the complete gutting of the MTR. My amendment will restore this sacred  right to the minority to offer a final amendment to the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished Republican leader, to  discuss this critical amendment in more detail.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte), one of our new Members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy), my very good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), my very good friend and the distinguished  ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Posey).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I want to urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  this rules package. The majority's proposed package will only continue  the ongoing assault on minority voices.   The changes in this package completely gut the MTR. With all due  respect to my friends, we disagree on that. I am sorry you have a hard  time handling it or getting your Members to where you want them to go,  but the fact is, eight times in the last Congress, Democrats joined  with Republicans in deciding that the Republican proposal improved the  bill. It is that simple.   We shouldn't be taking that away, particularly when the record, I  think, is so bad in the last Democratic Congress in granting amendment  opportunities to the minority.   I remind my friends, when we were in the majority, you got 45 percent  of all of the amendments made in order in the Rules Committee; the  Republicans got 38 percent; the remainder were bipartisan. Last time,  you got two-thirds of the amendments, we got 18 percent, and the  remainder were bipartisan.   When you are removing the MTR, on top of not giving us very many  amendments to begin with, we look on that as an effort to limit our  ability to participate openly and effectively in debate. This rules  package moves us in another direction.   I am sorry that the traditional rules of the House that have been  here over 100 years are inconvenient to the Democratic majority.  Sometimes it is good to be inconvenienced when you are in the majority.   You are limiting our ability to participate. Frankly, it will find  other outlets; it always does. I think that is a tragic mistake I think  that you will live to regret.   In addition to that, obviously, we disagree in the proposed rules  package with eliminating paygo in some critical areas. We think you  could drive a truck through those. It is a critical budgetary tool, and  we do think it will be missed, and its absence will be used to pave the  way for the Green New Deal.   In addition, the desire to continue to subpoena Presidents, Vice  Presidents, and White House staff that are no longer in office strikes  us as clearly an effort to just continue to harass the departing  administration. I regret that. I think you will, too. I think people  want us to look forward, not backward.   So we don't see much use in that, nor do we see the automatic ability  to resubmit subpoenas from the last Congress as a good thing. Again, it  is looking in the rearview mirror.  [[Page H34]]    Madam Speaker, I urge rejection of the package, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
