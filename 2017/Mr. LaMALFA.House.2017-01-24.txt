 Madam Speaker, while it might be raining lately in  California, we still need additional water supply infrastructure to  meet the needs of agriculture and a growing population. The Sites  Reservoir is the only project in California that will improve the water  supply for cities, farms, as well as for the environment.  [[Page H618]]    If the Sites Reservoir were in place today, California would have an  estimated additional 600,000 acre-feet of water stored so far this  winter in addition to similar amounts from last year and even water  that could have been impounded during the high flows during the drought  years. Had we had this infrastructure in place, we would have had  enough water to supply 4.8 million Californians for an entire year just  on this winter's flows, and the winter is not even over yet. The Sites  Reservoir will not only capture enough high winter flow, but it will  also allow for the reuse of water released from Lake Shasta so that  human and environmental water use are no longer mutually exclusive.   Madam Speaker, let's not lose this opportunity to conserve water and  to not be delayed again and again.                            ____________________
