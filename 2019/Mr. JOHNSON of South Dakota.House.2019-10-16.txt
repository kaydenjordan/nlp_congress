 Mr. Speaker, I thank the honorable  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) for yielding.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to highlight, to call attention to a  crisis that is facing our Tribal communities--really, our Tribal  communities throughout the country--and that is violence against  American Indian women.   More than 1.5 million American Indian women have experienced  violence--ultimately, sexual violence--during their lifetimes. The  numbers are staggering. They have experienced violence, murder, and  kidnapping at much, much higher rates than other women--1.5 million  women.   I know some of these women. Like my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, I have looked in their eyes. I have heard their heart-wrenching  stories of violence, of trauma. I have held their hands. I have hugged  them as, through tears, they have described to me events that I  otherwise could not imagine.   In just the last few years, we have had 6,000 American Indian women,  our countrywomen, who have gone missing; and just a few, just a handful  of those cases have been logged with the Department of Justice. In that  way, our Federal Government is not doing enough to combat this problem.   We know--every one of us here tonight knows--that we can do better.  That is why I have felt so good about how many of my colleagues today  have mentioned Savanna's Act, which, clearly, I am a cosponsor of, I am  a supporter of.   It is not a perfect bill. It does not do enough, but it tries to  highlight, it tries to call attention to, it brings attention to, it  brings resources to the experiences of those 1.5 million American  Indian women who have faced this violence.   No, Mr. Speaker, it is not a perfect bill, but for those of us who  have looked those women in the eyes, for those of us who have heard  their stories, we know that it is an important first step and one that  this Congress should take.
