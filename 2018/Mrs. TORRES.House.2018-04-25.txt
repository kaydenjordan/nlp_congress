 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   I am proud to be the newest member of the House Rules Committee. When  I expressed my desire to join the committee to the minority leader, I  shared my hope that I could do my part to ensure the committee would  allow the House to work its will in an open way. Unfortunately, the  rule that we are bringing to the floor does not meet that standard. For  that reason, I rise in opposition.   The rule we consider this afternoon is a combined rule for H.R. 3144,  legislation to delay and derail management practices at the Federal  Columbia River Power System in the Pacific Northwest, and H.R. 4, the  Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. There is no reason  for the House to take up these items in a combined rule. We have plenty  of time to give each bill a full, robust debate, and plenty of time to  allow the House an opportunity to vote on some of the 138 amendments  filed to these bills that were not made in order under this rule.   Mr. Speaker, the House appears to be in a rush to leave here every  single week. Last week, we only had three voting days, and with this  combined rule, who knows how long we will be here this week. Perhaps we  could use some of this extra time to take up a number of issues which  Americans have been asking for.   Instead of making this yet another short week, how about we give  Americans a vote on addressing gun violence by giving us a vote on  background checks, bump stocks, assault weapons, gun trafficking  reform; or ensuring that we don't find ourselves in a constitutional  crisis by protecting the special counsel, and making sure that we  address Russian interference in our elections; or allowing the House to  actually take a vote on so many outstanding immigration issues by  protecting DACA and TPS recipients?   There are 244 cosponsors of Representative Denham's ``Queen of the  Hill'' resolution, including over 40 members of the majority party.   Nearly 8 months since President Trump terminated the DACA program,  Congress has continually failed to protect the thousands of American  Dreamers who lose their protections every single day. Dreamers are the  educators, doctors, and small-business owners who make our communities  better and help make our country stronger and safer.   There are very real consequences for the lack of a permanent solution  to this crisis. The American people want us to act. We can respect  their will by taking up the ``Queen of the Hill'' resolution on one of  the many days where we find ourselves with nothing to do. We could work  together to at least provide the House with a path forward where the  best idea wins.   Mr. Speaker, instead of doing what we did last week by canceling  voting days, let's take this time to act on behalf of our constituents.  Why don't we put a stop to the administration's attack on the  Affordable Care Act and work on bipartisan improvements to control the  cost of healthcare, prescription drugs, and increase access to  services?   Finally, why don't we take some time to do what I have been calling  for since my first day in Congress and pass a large-scale  infrastructure package? There are roads and bridges crumbling around  our country, transit systems in need of significant repair, and a power  grid waiting to enter the 21st century. We need robust investments in  our transportation and energy infrastructure.   In its 2017 report card, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave  us our infrastructure a nearl failing grade of a D-plus. But based on  my experiences driving around my hometown, that might be a bit too  generous.    These are all the things that have bipartisan agreement. It is up to  us to address the real problems before us with leadership, security,  and stability that the Nation demands.   That said, as I mentioned before, we have two bills included in this  rule. The first is the FAA Authorization  [[Page H3516]]  Act, the first long-term FAA reauthorization since 2012. This  legislation was developed over 3 years of bipartisan and stakeholder  negotiations. It will provide long-term stability for our Nation's  aviation community, continue investments in research and innovation,  and make necessary reforms to improve American competitiveness and  safety in aviation.   I appreciate Chairman Shuster working with Ranking Member DeFazio to  ensure that this bill is as bipartisan as possible. I would have  preferred that we did more to assist our Nation's airports, but this  bill reflects the committee's will.   Airline safety is on all of our minds, especially after the tragedy  of Southwest Flight 1380. Moving this bill forward, without the poison  bill language we had seen in previous versions, will go a long way in  improving passenger safety, passenger comfort, and the entire  experience on our Nation's airlines.   Following my work to return the Ontario International Airport to  local control, we have seen my hometown airport go through a  renaissance with new flights being added constantly. It is my hope that  this bill continues that growth and allows for more improvements at the  airport.   While I am pleased this rule does make in order an amendment I  offered to assist Ontario International Airport and airports like it,  there are many amendments which were not made in order.   One such amendment I want to mention is Representative Cartwright's  amendment No. 152 on single-pilot operations. I am extremely concerned  with section 744 of the underlying legislation, which establishes an  FAA research and development program in support of single-pilot all- cargo operations utilizing remote piloting or computer piloting  technology.   Unfortunately, I believe moving in this direction--single-piloted  aircraft--will result in excessive workload for pilots and safety risks  for everyone.   I think it would have been fair for the House to give the Cartwright  amendment a floor debate and a simple up-or-down vote.   In addition, I am disappointed that Representative Grace Meng's  amendment No. 28 was not made in order. This amendment would have  standardized the treatment of animals aboard airlines.   I know we were all horrified when we read the reports last month of a  pet who died after being forced into a luggage compartment, or being  flushed down a toilet, or being forced to leave the plane.   According to a U.S. Department of Transportation report issued in  February, 24 animals died in the care of U.S. carriers last year. I  don't think it is too much to ask for a vote on the House floor to  establish standards for the safety of our constituents' pets.   In addition to the FAA authorization bill, this rule will also bring  H.R. 3144 to the floor. This bill is intended to provide for operations  of the Federal Columbia River Power System and delay multiple court  decisions which are intended to protect the local environment.   This legislation would derail the ongoing comprehensive efforts to  improve dam management practices on the Columbia River basin, creating  problematic conservation and management policies. The impact on salmon  and steelhead trout, in particular, would harm not just the  environment, but also tribes and businesses of the Pacific Northwest.   I joined the Rules Committee from my previous role as ranking member  on the Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee. I was  proud of the work I did to protect Tribal communities, and while  serving in that role, I opposed this legislation due to the negative  impact on local tribes.   The 2014 operation plan, which this bill attempts to re-implement,  was developed by the Department of Commerce National Marine Fisheries  Services. That plan was found to violate the Endangered Species Act and  the National Environmental Policy Act, and failed to live up to the  agreement we made with local tribes.   Native peoples of the Pacific Northwest ceded most of their ancestral  homeland to the U.S. in exchange for the right to catch salmon and  steelhead at their accustomed places. This tradition carries great  cultural and religious significance, but the current operation plan  would further harm Tribal fisheries.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule and the underlying legislation  because it fails to include the appropriate input from local tribes. I  urge my colleagues to reconsider bringing this bill forward, and go  back to the drawing board where an agreement can be reached that brings  all affected parties on board.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule we have before  us, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), the distinguished ranking member of the Ways and  Means Subcommittee on Tax Policy.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned on the promise of draining  the swamp, but has instead allowed corruption to run rampant in the  executive office. Several Cabinet officials are being investigated for  ethics violations and the misuse of Federal funds.   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Carson spent over $31,000 on  a new dining room set for his office. Interior Secretary Zinke spent  $139,000 of taxpayer money to remodel three sets of office doors.   One of the most outrageous practices by President Trump's Cabinet is  the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on luxury air travel. Just a  couple of examples: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator  Pruitt spent over $14,000 on a private jet traveling just 300 miles  within Oklahoma.                                time  1315    Interior Secretary Zinke cost the taxpayers $12,000 chartering a  plane belonging to an oil and gas exploration firm.   President Trump recently said: ``Sometimes it may not look like it,  but believe me, we are draining the swamp.''   Well, with a Cabinet like this, I have to agree with President Trump  in part. It does not look like he is draining the swamp, but that is  because he is not.   For this reason, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Lieu's H.R. 3876, the  SWAMP FLYERS Act. This legislation will ensure that senior political  appointees are not using Federal funds for official travel on private  aircraft.   Unlike the restrictive rules we are considering today, this bill  would be brought to the floor under an open rule so that all Members  have the opportunity to amend the bill on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Ted Lieu) to discuss this proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Nevada (Ms. Titus), the distinguished ranking member of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Economic Development,  Public Buildings and Emergency Management.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous  question and the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5447, The Music  Modernization Act. Mr. Speaker, there is broad, bipartisan agreement  that current music licensing laws no longer meet the needs of creators  and music providers in the digital age. Southern California has  established itself as a leader in the entertainment industry, and  supporting our artists and music industry is a job creator for my  constituents.   This bill would address the inefficiencies in the music industry's  licensing system by establishing uniformity in the licensing process.  Licenses will now be managed by one entity which in turn would be paid  for by the licensees. In addition to an increase in efficiency, the  Music Modernization Act would foster a more transparent relationship  between creators and music platforms. Information regarding music owed  royalties would be easily accessible through the database created by  the Music Modernization Act. This transparency will surely improve the  working relationship between creators and music platforms and aid the  music industry's innovation process.   Most importantly, this bill would establish a uniformed rate that  would allow song writers and artists to receive fair market pay for  their ideas and creations.   As a society, we value the work and products of artists, creators,  and the music industry. For years now, creators, and music providers  have spoken out about the outdated music licensing process and the  issues they repeatedly face because of its flawed system. It is only  fair that we address these inefficiencies and bring the music  industries' processes in accordance with the digital age.
