 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his distinguished role on the Committee on Rules.   Now, let us praise the Committee on Rules for the important work that  they do making sure that legislation comes to the floor in a way that  is consistent with the rules of the House, and in this case, a budget  that is consistent with the values of our country.   I thank the gentleman from Colorado and the chairman,  Jim McGovern,  for his leadership as well. And to each and every member of the  Committee on Rules, we have to salute them, on both sides of the aisle,  for the time they put in and how they facilitate the work of the House.    Madam Speaker, today is a great day of pride for our country and for  Democrats. We have a President with a big, bold vision for our country  and unprecedented opportunity to keep our promises for the people. We  promised ``for the people'' that we would lower healthcare costs by  lowering the cost of prescription drugs; we would increase paychecks by  building the infrastructure of America; and we would have cleaner  government by passing legislation.   This rule does all three of those things and much more, enabling the  Congress to vote on some of that legislation today; some of it in the  bill, and some of it for later.   When the President spoke about the infrastructure bill which is  provided for in this rule, he said to our Republican friends, I want to  find our common ground on infrastructure, but I will not confine my  vision to what is in the bill that we can do in a bipartisan way unless  you want to help us build back better. I like to say build back better  for women, because that is what this budget will do; that is in this  rule.   So I salute the President, not only for his vision and his  determination to get the job done, but for the priorities that will be  contained here in this budget as we go forward.   The Build Back Better budget agenda is one that is liberating for  families, not just women, moms and dads, with childcare, with a child  tax credit, with universal pre-K, with home healthcare, with workforce  development. So that not only are we building the physical  infrastructure of America, we are building the human infrastructure of  America to enable many more people to participate in the success of our  economy and the growth of our society. It does so with equity, a 40  percent justice provision that will be in there.                                time  1345    Now, it remains for us to work together, work with the Senate, to  write a bill that preserves the privilege of 51 votes in the Senate. So  we must work together to do that in a way that passes the House and  passes the Senate, and we must do so expeditiously. Expeditiously.   The authorizations for highway, et cetera, will expire September 30.  By October 1, we hope to have in place, that is the plan, to have in  place the legislation for infrastructure. That is bipartisan, and I  salute that, but it is not inclusive of all of the values we need to  build back at a time when we have a climate crisis.   So I salute our distinguished chair of the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. DeFazio, for the knowledge that  he brings, the value system and the knowledge that he brings to looking  at how we do a reconciliation bill, a build back better bill in a way  that is preserving of our planet for the children. For the children.   Exciting in all of this is the fact that we will have the John R.  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This is pretty exciting. And I  commend you, Madam Speaker, for your leadership in making this  possible; for you to be the author of it. But when you are the author,  though, you will no longer be able to preside, you have to come down  and manage us on the floor. So it is appropriate that during the rule  that will enable this to come to the floor, you are presiding, so we  can all congratulate you in a highly visible way.   This legislation is so important. I was very much a part of passing  the previous bill, that was in 2007, we wrote it in 2006, it became  effective in 2007 when President Bush was President. We had Republican  majorities in the House and Senate, and we passed the legislation  overwhelmingly. Over nearly 400 votes in the House, unanimous in the  Senate; signed by President Bush, as bipartisan as anything that has  come to the floor.   We walked down the steps of the Capitol in a bipartisan way, saluting  the fact that we had extended the Voting Rights Act and President Bush  signed it. And with great pride, he came to your neck of the woods, to  Selma, on the 50th anniversary of the Selma march. But he came as the  person who had signed the Voting Rights Act. And even more important  than that, Laura Bush came, too, so their hearts are in this  legislation.   I would hope that there would be some level of bipartisanship on that  as well. We will talk more about that as we go into the debate on that  bill in a little while.   But I do, again, want to thank Congresswoman DeLauro for her  relentless, persistent, dissatisfied until now, I hope satisfied to a  certain extent, more to come, of the child tax credit. For 10  Congresses she has introduced that bill, and now it is being advanced.   And Mr. Yarmuth, the chair of the Budget Committee, will lead us now  as we prepare in our individual committees, our work for the Budget  Committee to put together a package.   Madam Speaker, as you know, a national budget should be a statement  of our national values. What is important to us as a Nation should be  reflected in our budget. And this will be the case. And under the  leadership of Mr. Yarmuth, who is not only values-based, but eloquent  in conveying that message, we are very excited about how we go forward.   Again, I mentioned Peter DeFazio. In terms of the Voting Rights Act,  the very distinguished chair of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler;  and Zoe Lofgren for her work as chair on the Committee on House  Administration; Mr. Butterfield, and so many people; and our  distinguished whip, Mr. Clyburn, who has made this his life work.   Passing this rule paves the way for the Build Back Better plan, which  will forge legislative progress unseen in 50 years that will stand for  generations alongside the New Deal and the Great Society. This  legislation will be the biggest and perhaps most consequential  initiatives that any of us have ever undertaken in our official lives.   Everything we do is about the children. As you have heard me say when  people ask me, what are the three most important issues facing the  Congress? I always say the same thing: Our children, our children, our  children; their health, their education, and the economic security of  their families, a safe environment in which they can thrive, and a  world at peace in which they can reach their fulfillment.   When children come here to the Capitol, it is such an invigoration  for us and an inspiration to us to see them because we are here for  them. And as I say to them, as you see the statues and the monuments to  those who went before, it is appropriate that we honor them, but they  want us to honor you, the future of our country, to make it better for  the children.   Again, any delay in passing the rule threatens the Build Back Better  plan, as well as voting rights reform, as well as the bipartisan  infrastructure bill. We cannot surrender our leverage for the children.  For the first time, I don't remember a time as historic as this, for  the children.   President Biden has given children leverage in his visionary  proposal. The children have the leverage, not those at the high end who  benefitted from the Republican tax bill, and I wouldn't even have  brought it up except you are  [[Page H4363]]  acting as if you don't even know, when you added $2 trillion, or more,  to the budget to give 83 percent of the benefits to the wealthiest  people in our country.   Leverage for the rich, no. We don't begrudge them their success, but  this is about leverage for the children, for them, for their families  for the future.   And guess what? It would be our attempt to pay for this bill so it is  not a burden to those children as we go forward. And that means that  some of the people that benefitted from that tax bill, that tax scam in  2017, are now going to have to pay their fair share, fair share, pay  their fair share, and that we may have to address other ways to pay for  the legislation by putting the responsibility on the high end, both  whether it is corporate or individual, so that we can again  make progress for the children without burdening them with the debt,  some of which they got in 2017.    So it is a pretty exciting day. I congratulate all on the Rules  Committee for going in time and again as we sought clarification on how  we go forward. I thank Mr. McGovern, Mr. Neguse, and so many other  members of that committee.   I thank all of our colleagues for their involvement in all of this.  And I would hope that as we proceed, we could do so in the most  transparent, bipartisan, and fair way for the children.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the recognition,  and I acknowledge his tremendous leadership over time, including right  now on the issue of voting rights in our country. I thank him for  bringing this important legislation to the floor and to do so under the  name of Congresswoman Terri Sewell, the author of the bill, who has  been working on this for a long time, since the assault on the  legislation, on these laws by the Supreme Court.   I also thank Mr. Clyburn, a champion from the civil rights era to  now, always fighting for all of this; and Zoe Lofgren, the chair of the  Committee on House Administration.   We have so many people to acknowledge; Mr. Butterfield for his work  in establishing the constitutional record, as well as Marcia Fudge, now  Secretary Fudge, for her work. So many people worked to build a  constitutional basis to make it ironclad so that the Supreme Court of  the United States cannot once again do violence as it did in Shelby  County v. Holder and the most recent assault on section 2.    Madam Speaker, I think my colleagues will all agree that many  wonderful honors are afforded us as Members of Congress. I can think of  none that is more poignant than being here today to be able to speak on  this important issue named for John Lewis. It is almost a religious  experience because of the sanctity of the vote, which is greatly at  risk.   Our colleagues have mentioned some of the assaults on voting that  have taken place to undermine what we are, a democracy. We talk about  the preamble where 230 years ago our Founders gave us guidance in the  words, ``we the people'' establishing a government in which the people,  not a king, would shape their own destiny.   Ever since, Americans have fought to make real that promise for all  citizens while enshrining in the Constitution the 13th and 15th  amendments and the 19th amendment, which we are celebrating this week  to expand voting rights to women and to passing landmark civil and  voting rights protections, including the Voting Rights Act.   Right here in this very Chamber the Voting Rights Act was passed.  President Lyndon Johnson spoke in a beautiful speech, the ``We Shall  Overcome'' speech, in which he called the VRA's passage, ``The history  of this country, in large measure, is the history of the expansion of  that right to all of our people.''   We all know that the story of America is a story of ever-expanding  freedoms, yet today, that story and those rights are under threat from  a targeted, brazen, and partisan campaign to deny Americans the ballot.   This campaign is anti-democratic, it is dangerous, and it demands  action.   Today, the House will pass H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act to combat this anti-democratic tide. This bill restores  the power of the Voting Rights Act, as President Johnson said, `` . . .  one of the most monumental laws in the entire history of American  freedom.''   Any diminishment of the Voting Rights Act is a diminishment of our  democracy. In America, the right to vote must never be compromised.   Again, I thank Representatives Sewell, Mr. Butterfield, Marcia Fudge,  Jerry Nadler, Zoe Lofgren, Mr. Clyburn, and so many who made this day  possible.   And let me pause to salute our beloved conscience of the Congress,  the late John Lewis, whose words guide us. ``The vote is precious,'' he  said. ``It is almost sacred. It is the most powerful, nonviolent tool  we have in a democracy.''   The previous speaker mentioned that he had been at the christening of  the USNS John Lewis. We were all together in San Diego, and we were  honored that the Congressman was there with us.   As he was saying those words, I was remembering that day. We were all  very excited. It was the largest contingent of Members of Congress to  go to the christening of a ship--and I have been to several, so I  know--and what it was reminding me of is when we had gone a couple  years ago in 2019 to Ghana; John Lewis led us there. It was the 400th  anniversary. You were there, Madam Speaker. Mr. Clyburn and so many  others were there. We were there with John Lewis, and we went to the  door of no return, which now is the door of return as they were  welcoming people back.   I have on this bracelet that I got from the President of Ghana when  we were there as a remembrance of that trip, and I have it on now  because what John Lewis said then, and apropos of the christening of a  ship, We may have all come to this country on different ships, but now  we're all in the same boat. That is what John Lewis said. He said it in  Ghana. He said it many times.   We are all in the same boat. We all should have the right to vote.  And that should not be diminished by anyone. It is unpatriotic to  undermine the ability of people who have a right to vote to have access  to the polls.   As John knew, this precious pillar of our democracy is under attack  from what is the worst voter suppression campaign in America since Jim  Crow. Unleashed by the dangerous Shelby v. Holder in 2013 and 2021,  State lawmakers have introduced over 400 suppression bills.   I am very honored today, Madam Speaker, that we have legislators from  the State of Texas who are fighting the fight for voting rights for  people in their State and in our country. They are patriotic Americans.  And let us hear applause for those Texans who have done so much.   Much has been said about preclearance and thousands of discriminatory  voting changes. But let us just say that in the Shelby decision, the  dissent was written by Justice Ginsburg, and she noted in her dissent  the Court's reasoning in Shelby was nonsensical. ``Throwing out  preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop  discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a  rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   Sadly, the Court has since continued that assault on the ballot.   So H.R. 4, the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, would be  a remedy to this assault and to restore the preclearance provisions.   I have said earlier today on the rule on this vote, in 2006 we all  came together in a bipartisan way to pass the Voting Rights Act. Nearly  400 votes in the House, unanimous in the Senate. We came together in  the center of the Capitol, marched down the Capitol steps celebrating  that.   The bill was signed by President George Bush proudly. He joined us in  Selma, hosted by Congresswoman Sewell. He and President Obama joined us  in Selma, and he came and spoke as the President who had signed the  Voting Rights Act. As I say, more importantly, Mrs. Laura Bush was  there, so their hearts were in all of this. It was bipartisan. I wish  it could be today.   In our work to protect the ballot, let us recall John Lewis' final  message published after his passing. ``Democracy is not a state. It is  an act.'' With H.R. 4, his namesake, the Congress takes this action to  build a future in which we all have equitable access to the ballot and  to our democracy.   In memory of our beloved John, for whom this legislation is named,  and in the interest of passing it and H.R. 1, of which he wrote the  first 300 pages, let us honor our patriotic duty and make justice and  equality there for everyone to vote.
