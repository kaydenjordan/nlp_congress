 Mr. Speaker, one year into Russia's illegal invasion of  Ukraine, the Ukrainians' valiant defense has resulted in tens of  thousands of casualties for the Russians. What the Russians believed  would be a victory in a matter of days or weeks has turned into now  just over a year bloody slog. The Russian bear has turned out to be a  paper tiger on the fields of Ukraine.   The United States must remain committed as a partner with Ukraine to  achieve victory. Victory, Mr. Speaker, or Putin and his allied nations  will attack the Baltic states or take Moldova or try to control the  Black Sea. Turkiye, devastated by Erdogan's economics and the recent  earthquake, will now face a stark choice of remaining in NATO or  becoming a Putin puppet were Putin successful in Ukraine.   Victory in Ukraine, Mr. Speaker, or China will be green-lighted to a  fully nuclear madman in North Korea and attempt a blockade of Taiwan.  In order to achieve that victory, President Biden must get the rest of  the world even more engaged.   In December, Members of this body were briefed by the Departments of  State and Treasury. I recently wrote Secretary Blinken and Secretary  Yellen in follow-up regarding the funding strategy for supporting  Ukraine with humanitarian, defense, and military means, and in their  monthly costs.   I raised two principal points. First, in my view, Congress does not  have the full financial picture of the contributions being made by the  United States and our allies and partners on behalf of Ukraine in a  straightforward and simple manner available to all Members. They don't  paint a complete picture.   As a new member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I look  forward to hearing from the State Department, USAID, and the Defense  Department in the near future on what they have been doing to track our  funding in Ukraine and explain it in thorough detail to the Congress.   Secondly, I raised with the two Secretaries the successful 1990-1991  partnership between Secretary of State James Baker and Secretary of the  Treasury Nicholas Brady in developing an active solicitation of major  countries from around the world to fund the U.S. enforcement of the  United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing use of force to  liberate Kuwait from Iraq's illegal invasion of their sovereign  territory.   The result was the United States received contributions from around  the world of some $53 billion against an estimated total cost to eject  Saddam Hussein from Kuwait of $60 billion. Now, while some of those  contributions were in the form of in-kind material support, more than  90 percent was paid in cash.   The United States must be more strongly engaged with our allies to  share a greater financial burden for the military, humanitarian, and  budget support for the Government of Ukraine.   Just a few days ago, on February 20, Japan pledged $5.5 billion in  additional aid to Ukraine. This is on top of the $1.3 billion in  financial humanitarian assistance it had already pledged. This is a  recent example of precisely what I think the United States Government  should be achieving and achieving in a more aggressive and effective  manner.   The worldwide response in support of Ukraine has been remarkable, but  I believe that significantly more can be done to help Ukraine if  additional countries provide more material and financial support in  Europe and beyond.   The U.S. military has a unique role, an important role as the lead  NATO partner in equipping, training, and providing related military  materials. That mission suits us more than any other country. However,  as demonstrated in my example of Kuwait, obtaining broad financial  support from more sources is essential, in my view, to maintaining  popular political support in Europe and in the United States for  victory in Ukraine.   This also demonstrates how peoples from around the globe benefit from  a prompt success of preservation of Ukraine's sovereignty. Cost of  goods, access to food, fuel, and financing are all impeded by the  Russian Federation's illegal action. That makes the case that all  nations are hurt by Russia's aggression. All nations can support  Ukraine.   President Biden must craft an active and effective campaign to bring  forward the financial and material resources from around the world to  fully support victory in Ukraine.                      Forced Organ Harvesting by the CCP     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the practice of  forced organ harvesting in China.   I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 1154, the Stop Forced Organ Harvesting  Act introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), my friend.  Congressman Smith is also chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on  Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. I  am proud to serve as his vice chair for that subcommittee.   Forced organ harvesting is a disgusting and appalling practice  carried out against minority groups in China by the Chinese Communist  Party. They prey on the Uyghur people and Falun Gong practitioners. As  the world knows full well about their genocide against the Uyghurs, we  should not be surprised with China's lack of medical ethics.   Nury Turkel, the chair of the U.S. Commission on International  Religious Freedom and my recent State of the Union guest has documented  forced blood sampling and organ screening of Uyghur detainees in their  reeducation camps. Nury, a Uyghur who emigrated to the United States at  age 24, is an eyewitness to this barbaric culture.   Just last year, the United Nations was even ``extremely alarmed'' on  credible information that forced organ harvesting continues in  Communist China. What is disappointing is that, despite years of  evidence of this practice, the United States currently has no law on  the books to address this issue.    The Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act will do just that by adding  penalties to those that violate the National Organ Transplant Act, and  it will sanction those that fund, sponsor, or facilitate forced organ  harvesting or human trafficking that leads to forced organ harvesting.   This bill passed unanimously out of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee last week, and I look forward to seeing a strong vote in the  full House in the future. We will pass it here, and I expect the Senate  to pass this legislation and send it to President Biden.   It is long past time for the American Government to address this  challenge through legislation and put a stop to this inhumanity. I  appreciate Chairman Smith for his leadership in introducing this  legislation. It is another sign to the American people of how depraved  the Chinese Communist Party is in their march to violate every norm of  international society.                  National Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Hostage  and Wrongful Detainee Day.   I, along with my Democratic colleague, Congresswoman Haley Stevens,  reintroduced our legislation yesterday that establishes March 9 as the  National Hostage and Wrongful Detainee Day. On March 9, 2007, Robert  Levinson disappeared in Iran. He never returned home.  [[Page H1273]]    The commemoration of this national day brings attention to Americans  that are being unjustly held as wrongful detainees and hostages in a  foreign land.   Since the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking  Accountability Act was signed into law 2 years ago, we have heard from  families and organizations that are dedicated to helping bring wrongful  detainees and hostages home and how that law is working.   We are learning more about how the Levinson act is being used since  it has become law. It is time for the House Foreign Affairs Committee  to conduct oversight and see what potential changes should be made.   I helped create in the last Congress the Congressional Task Force on  American Hostages and Americans Wrongly Detained Abroad because one of  my constituents disappeared on a visit to Syria. Majd Kamalmaz is still  being held by the Assad regime in Syria. Majd and his wonderful family  lived for a time in my hometown of Little Rock.   Every Member of Congress is dedicated to the more than 50 Americans  who right now are held against their will wrongfully in a country  around the world. We all want to bring home Majd and every other  American that is being held wrongfully.   I am proud to be a part of this task force and work alongside my  friend, Congresswoman Stevens. I thank all those who are involved for  their efforts to bring awareness to wrongful detainees and hostages  around the world and for working tirelessly to bring them home to their  families in our great country.                           Recognizing Origami Sake     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the entrepreneurial  creativity of Ben Bell and Matt Bell, who recently founded Origami Sake  in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Although they are unrelated, these two Bells  share the same last name and the same passion for sake.   The pair met in 2016 after Ben returned to Arkansas from a trip to  Japan where he became interested in the art of making sake after living  in that country for 2 years.   After years of collaboration, Ben and Matt joined forces to begin  brewing sake in Arkansas, which led to the opening of their business.  Arkansas is the largest grower of rice in the United States and Isbell  Farms has spent decades perfecting the proper rice to be used for sushi  and now the proper rice that is needed for making high-quality sake.   Additionally, the magnificent water from the famous Hot Springs  National Park has the perfect quality for sake brewing. Ben and Matt  are taking advantage of these resources in Arkansas to make sake even  more popular and distribute it homegrown in Arkansas across the United  States.   I recently led a delegation to meet with leaders in Japan where our  members had the opportunity to present Arkansas-brewed sake to former  Prime Minister Suga and Deputy Cabinet Secretary Kihara. Along with key  members of the Japanese Diet, we also entertained our great Ambassador  Rahm Emanuel with his own taste of a new Thousand Crane Sake brewed in  Arkansas.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Ben and Matt for their originality and  entrepreneurship. I commend them for leading America in the brewing of  sake.                            Victory Over Violence     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the important  partnership between the Arkansas Martin Luther King Commission and FOX  16 and KARK Television.   In 2017, following the horrible shootings at the Power Ultra Lounge  nightclub in Little Rock, FOX 16 and KARK kicked off an important  initiative to build grassroots support to reduce violence in central  Arkansas. They called it Victory Over Violence.   The goal of the campaign is to unite leaders and groups throughout  our local communities to be a resource for reducing violent crime and  changing lives through community improvements.   In January, the Arkansas Martin Luther King Commission presented FOX  16 anchors Donna Terrell and Kevin Kelly with their 2023 Drum Major for  Community Leadership award.   The persistence and successful leadership of Donna, Kevin, and all  those involved at the Arkansas MLK Commission, FOX 16, and KARK, they  are making an impact on improving the lives and safety in central  Arkansas.   I am grateful for their efforts, their persistent efforts over all  these past years to keep that at the forefront of community activism.  Victory Over Violence is something that we need, and I am grateful for  their leadership.                Recognizing 2022 Miss Arkansas Ebony Mitchell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2022 Miss  Arkansas winner, Ebony Mitchell.   Ebony was the 84th Miss Arkansas Scholarship Pageant winner, where  she was awarded $30,000 in scholarship funds provided by the Ted and  Shannon Skokos Foundation and $75,000 in other areas.                                time  1230    Last December, she represented our great State at Miss America in  Connecticut.   Becoming Miss Arkansas was a lifetime dream for Ebony. Her journey  started when she won the Miss University of Arkansas Princess pageant  in 2007, which entered her into the Diamond State Princess mentorship  program.   She had five appearances as Miss Arkansas before finally winning that  title last year. Aside from her accomplishments as Miss Arkansas, she  graduated from the University of Central Arkansas in 2019 with her  bachelor's degree in business administration.   As Miss Arkansas, she will continue her social impact by leading the  A Responsible Digital You initiative which seeks to keep children of  Arkansas safe online.   Ebony is a native of Harrison, Arkansas, where she has been a leader  in civil rights and community spirit in her hometown.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Ebony for her accomplishments, and I look  forward to continuing to watch her proudly represent our great State of  Arkansas.                               Cleburne County     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the addition of  Cleburne County to the Second District of Arkansas.   Last year, during redistricting, the Arkansas State legislature added  Cleburne County to the Second Congressional District. The addition of  Cleburne County brings beautiful nature, economic development, and many  other recreational ideas and opportunities to my district.   An active business and civic community, excellent healthcare and  educational facilities and opportunities, along with Greers Ferry  National Fish Hatchery, Greers Ferry Dam, Rotary Clubs, the Sugarloaf  Mountain Trail, and world-class fly fishing on the Little Red River all  are amazing examples of what the county has to offer.   I am proud to now serve those who live in Cleburne County, and I look  forward to representing them in Washington at their U.S. Capitol.                 Congratulating Debby Meece on Her Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend,  Executive Assistant to the Medical Director at Central Arkansas  Veterans Healthcare System, Debby Meece.   Debby is retiring after 40 years of service to Central Arkansas  Veterans Affairs.   Debby is an Arkansas native, and she always has exhibited kindness  and consideration on a daily basis to coworkers, patients, and visitors  alike. She is a role model for everyone in public service because of  the positive impact she had in her daily work at Central Arkansas VA.   The standard of care she has established will continue for  generations to come in our VA hospital in central Arkansas.   Mr. Speaker, we thank Debby for her dedication and service to  veterans. Without her time and effort, many voices would have gone  unheard. Every day she was at work, she put others first.   I congratulate Debby, and I wish her a very happy retirement.                  Supreme Court Chief Justice Jack Holt, Jr.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Arkansas Supreme  Court Chief Justice Jack Holt, Jr., who passed away on March 5, 2023.   Former Chief Justice Holt began his career in the United States Air  Force  [[Page H1274]]  where he achieved the rank of colonel. He then went on to work in  Arkansas as a deputy prosecutor, chief assistant attorney general, and  ultimately served as the Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court  for 10 years from 1985 to 1995.   Jack Holt will be remembered for his significant contributions to the  modern justice system that exists in Arkansas, including the creation  of our juvenile courts.   Justice Holt is credited with setting up the essential parts of our  court systems in Arkansas. His advancement of the education requirement  for attorneys and the creation of more staff positions to help circuit  court judges has greatly improved the effectiveness of justice in my  State.   I thank former Chief Justice Holt for his many years of service and  contributions to the State of Arkansas. His legacy truly lives on.   My prayers for comfort are with his wife Jane, their family, and  their friends.                                 Rescue Road     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Rescue Road on  rescuing 8,000 dogs.   Rescue Road is a dog fostering organization based in Little Rock.  Their mission is to place adoptable dogs in high-kill shelters into  other networks in order to find a permanent home and a loving family.  The organization works with their team of volunteers and foster  families throughout our State of Arkansas.   In January they placed their 8,000th dog in a home--a great  milestone.   I thank all those volunteers involved with Rescue Road for their hard  work and for their dedication to helping dogs find their forever homes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
