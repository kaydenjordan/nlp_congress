 Madam Speaker, Texas' law to pay vigilantes to sue  anyone who enables an abortion after 6 weeks is just the latest gross  overreach to make it virtually impossible for women to get abortion  care.   These laws take away a woman's right to determine if and when to have  a child. And I can tell you as a doctor that these laws also undermine  a doctor's oath to help her patients and the trust between doctor and  patient, not to mention the women's own health.   It is long past time to stop States from putting up absurd roadblocks  with no medical justification, like hallway size, arbitrary waiting  periods, unnecessary vaginal ultrasounds, government scripted  propaganda, and hospital admitting privileges for procedures that don't  require a hospital.   This bill blocks States from putting up these barriers to care.   As the only pro-choice woman doctor in Congress, I urge my colleagues  to join me in protecting a woman's right to a legal, safe abortion no  matter where she lives by supporting the Women's Health Protection Act.
