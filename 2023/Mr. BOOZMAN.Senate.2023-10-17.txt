 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Arkansas  True Vision Children's Homes for its tremendous work on behalf of  children in foster care.   The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute--CCAI--recently  recognized Arkansas True Vision as a 2023 Angels in Adoption honoree. I  believe it is well-deserved for the organization's clear dedication to  ensuring better outcomes for children in foster care. CCAI coordinates  the Angels in Adoption program and raises awareness about the tens of  thousands of orphans and foster children in the United States and the  millions of orphans around the world in need of permanent homes.   Arkansas True Vision operates three facilities in the State to  address a variety of critical needs--helping children in dire  situations, supporting foster children who need special care, and  keeping sibling groups together. This nonprofit organization supports  40-50 kids daily and is a licensed service provider for the Arkansas  Department of Children and Family Services. In addition to its mission  of caring for kids in emergencies and long-term foster care, the  organization has also assisted in 60 adoptions since 2015. The Florence  Crittenton Home in Little Rock opened in 2004 as True Vision's first  children's home. It serves as a residential group home providing  emergency shelter services and long-term residential care for children  and adolescents in need of a safe and secure environment.   The Maggie House in Charleston provides long term residential care to  foster children, many with complex cases. The kids live in small group  cottages and are supported by house parents, case managers, therapists,  and many other community and school resources.   In addition, Arkansas True Vision's newest mission is the Young  Children's Home in Fort Smith. This unique program has become a model  for home-based foster care where three special houses provide care for  sibling groups on a neighborhood style campus.   As a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I am inspired  by the work of Arkansas True Vision's volunteers, direct care staff,  leaders, and community partners who are working every day to improve  the lives of young people.  [[Page S5045]]    On behalf of the people of the Natural State, I extend my gratitude  and congratulations to Arkansas True Vision Children's Homes for this  recognition and the positive impact it will continue to make in the  lives of youth in need of safe and loving homes.                            ____________________
