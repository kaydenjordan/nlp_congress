 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Raskin for his continued  leadership in our caucus. It is such a pleasure to serve next to him on  the Judiciary Committee. We have a lot of work to do. It is really  terrific to be able to do it with him, to talk about the tax plan.   I don't think this is a tax plan. I think it is tax scam. I think it  is a heist. I think that the middle class in this country is not going  to benefit from this. Middle class Americans who are hoping for a tax  break for the holidays are going to be sorely disappointed. Maybe they  get a few lumps of coal.  [[Page H9749]]    In fact, polling shows, across the country, that this is the  singularly most unpopular bill that Congress has considered in a very  long time. Seventy-five percent of Americans across this country don't  think it is a good idea. They are not fooled by the promises that are  being made about what this bill does.   Let's really talk about what this bill does.   We know that the wealthiest will benefit. The wealthiest 1 percent  will receive 50 percent of the tax cuts. In 2019, 18 percent of the tax  cuts in this bill will go to the wealthiest 1 percent. But by 2027,  that number climbs to 62 percent, with an average tax cut of $33,000.   What else do we know about this bill?   We know that the largest corporations will benefit. To pay for this  massive tax cut for corporations, the Senate tax bill will repeal the  individual mandate part of the Affordable Care Act, something that  Republicans have tried to do over and over again this year.   The American people have spoken up and said: No, we know that  healthcare is a right, not a privilege. We want our healthcare. We know  the Affordable Care Act is not perfect, but it has done much to protect  the healthcare of people across this country.   Yet, in spite of that, the repeal of the individual mandate has been  put into the Senate tax bill, and it would result in 13 million more  people being uninsured. It would also result in a 10 percent increase  in premiums for Americans across the country, according to the  Congressional Budget Office.   We know, also, that this bill is wholly fiscally irresponsible. It is  funny. For years, Republicans have yelled and screamed about the huge  deficits we have, yet this bill would add between $1 trillion and $1.5  trillion in deficits to what we already have. That would lead to a  mandatory cut in critical programs.   Let's just talk for a minute about what exactly this tax scam will  mean for ordinary Americans across the country.   In order to pay for the tax cuts that we have talked about for the  wealthiest and the largest corporations, it means that millions of  working families and poor folks across this country are going to end up  paying more. Not only that, there are incentives in this bill that  would actually create an incentive for American companies to take jobs  off of Main Street, close factories here in the United States, and move  those jobs overseas. It will make it harder for families to make ends  meet.   The Senate bill would raise taxes on 78 million middle class  families, and millions of families across the country would lose their  healthcare. In my district alone, nearly 31,000 constituents would lose  their healthcare.   This bill would also put real roadblocks in the way of young people  looking to get ahead.   Two of the eliminations of tax exemptions in this tax bill that  offend me the most and should offend all Americans across the country  are, number one, there is, essentially, a tax on being sick. There is a  tax on long-term care for Americans across this country.   Right now, if you have a family member who is in long-term care or  has a serious illness, the expenses that you pay for that individual,  that family member, you can deduct those medical expenses. With this  tax scam, the tax heist that is being proposed, you would no longer be  able to deduct those medical expenses. So you are being taxed for being  ill or for needing care as you get older.   In addition, we are taxing education. We already know that there is  $1.4 trillion in student loan debt across this country, more than even  credit card debt in this country. Young people have to make these  terrible choices about whether they are going to go $80,000 into debt  or whether they are not going to get higher education. That is wrong.   This tax bill would actually take away some of the tax benefits that  we give to graduate students, for example, when they get help to be  able to complete their graduate education. It would take away the  exemptions that currently exist.   If you are a teacher and you buy pencils or paper or supplies for  your classroom, that is currently a deductible expense. It would take  that away for teachers, but not for corporations. If corporations buy  supplies, that is tax deductible, but not if you are a teacher. That is  just crazy.   It prioritizes the wealthy by allowing wealthy families to avoid the  estate tax. Let's talk about the estate tax for just a minute.   There are 5,400 families across the country that pay the estate tax.  It is a very small number of the wealthiest families. But, in fact,  what this does is say that is even too much. We are going to double the  exemption. Now, $11 million, even fewer families are going to pay that,  but it is going to cost middle class families a couple of hundred  billion dollars in revenue.   The experts across the spectrum are arriving at the same conclusion:  this bill is bad for regular working families.   The National Association of Realtors has said this: The Senate tax  bill ``puts home values at risk and dramatically undercuts the  incentive to own a home . . . our estimates show that home values stand  to fall by an average of more than 10 percent, and even greater in  high-cost areas.''   How about the Fraternal Order of Police? ``The FOP is very concerned  that the partial or total elimination of SALT deductions,'' something  very important to my home State of Washington, ``will endanger the  ability of our State and local government to fund these agencies and  recruit the men and women we need to keep us safe.''   That is a quote from the Fraternal Order of Police.   The American Council on Education has said this: ``As a result, we  are deeply concerned that at a time when post-secondary degrees and  credentials have never been more important to individuals, the economy,  and our society, the tax reform proposal approved by the Senate could  make college more expensive and undermine the financial stability of  higher education institutions.''   Let's be clear about what is happening here. The Republicans have a  plan, and it is like a little three-step dance:   First, transfer trillions of dollars of wealth from middle class  families and the poorest amongst us to the wealthiest corporations who  are already not paying their fair share.   Second, when you do that transfer, explode the deficit. The estimates  are that $1.4 trillion, $1.5 trillion would be added to the deficit.   Finally, use the fact that you are exploding the deficit to actually  cut programs that are critical to Americans across the country, like  Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. We know that, as written, this  bill would trigger mandatory spending cuts to Medicare and Medicaid of  significant amounts.   So the reality is that we are in a situation where this is incredibly  unpopular. The polling shows right now that Americans are not buying  this tax scam: 68 percent say that the tax bill helps the wealthiest;  54 percent say the tax bill favors big Republican donors; 61 percent  say that Medicare and Social Security cuts would ultimately end up  being the vehicle that is used to pay for these tax cuts to the  wealthiest; and 68 percent say that changes to the Affordable Care Act  should not be in this tax bill.                                time  1745    Here is where we are. The House passed its bill on November 16. In  the early hours of December 2, just last Friday, the Senate passed its  version.   We are going into conference committee now, which means that a group  of legislators from the House and a group of legislators from the  Senate get together and they try to work out the differences between  the two bills. Then, ultimately, whatever that compromise is, if it is  worked out, would come back for a vote in the House and the Senate.   So, now, more than ever, we need the voices of people across the  country to call and to talk about the concerns that working people  across this country have. We do need a real reform of the tax system to  simplify it, to make sure that people are paying their fair share. But  that is not what this is. This is a tax scam. It is a heist. It is  transfer of trillions of dollars in wealth from middle class families  and the most vulnerable to the wealthiest who do not need that money.   The reality is that we need to be investing in the American people.  We  [[Page H9750]]  need to be investing in jobs and in education. We need to be making  sure that middle class families are getting a break, that they can  actually think about a future for their kids, for the next generation,  that is better than the one they have.   We have very little time, but, Mr. Speaker, I am very sure that we in  the Progressive Caucus and we in the Democratic Caucus are going to do  everything we can to fight for working people, for the most vulnerable  among us, and to protect things like CHIP, the Children's Health  Insurance Program, to protect temporary protected status for immigrants  across the country, and to make sure we are passing a clean Dream Act.  These are the kinds of priorities we should be focusing on, not lining  the pockets of the wealthiest corporations and transferring jobs from  the United States to tax havens elsewhere.   We have a lot of work to do to make sure that, in this very short  period of time, people speak up and speak out and make sure that we do  not pass this bill, make sure that we, instead, work together in a  bipartisan way for tax reform that actually benefits working families.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Raskin for his leadership on the  Progressive Caucus.
