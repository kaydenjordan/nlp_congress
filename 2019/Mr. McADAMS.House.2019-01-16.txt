 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 268, the  legislation that we voted on earlier today to provide disaster relief,  including relief for my home State of Utah.   Specifically, this bill includes money for the Utah Reclamation  Mitigation and Conservation Commission for critical environmental work  in the Strawberry River watershed and part of the Diamond Fork  drainage.   Last summer, the Dollar Ridge fire burned an area of almost 70,000  acres, centered over the Strawberry River watershed. This area has been  a critical focal point of the Central Utah Project for almost 40 years.  The Central Utah Project diverts, stores, and delivers large quantities  of water from numerous Utah rivers to meet the needs of central Utah's  citizens.   In cooperation with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and the  U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the mitigation commission is working to  repair tremendous damage to the area, both from the fire itself and  subsequent rain and runoff events.   Water quality has suffered greatly. Money from this legislation will  be used to reseed, replant, and set up monitoring stations to better  respond to the future mudslide and sediment flows.   A portion of the funds will also be used to begin restoring an area  in the Diamond Fork Canyon that was affected by a second fire.   I also commend my Utah colleague Representative Chris Stewart for his  amendment to the bill, providing much-needed funding for fire  protection                            ____________________
