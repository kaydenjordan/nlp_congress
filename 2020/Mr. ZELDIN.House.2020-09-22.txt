 Madam Speaker, as early as today, the House will be  voting to pass the Don't Break Up the T-Band Act, of which I am proud  to be an original cosponsor.   This would mark a great victory for our first responders who use the  T-Band spectrum and bravely and selflessly put their lives on the line  each and every day to protect our communities.   From hurricanes to fires, the T-Band spectrum provides critical  communication between first responders. Even when cell phones,  internet, and electricity cease to function, T-Band is the last line of  defense.   However, the T-Band spectrum is mandated to be sold. According to the  GAO, this misguided sale and the relocation of users would actually  cost taxpayers $5 billion to $6 billion.   Thankfully, this bipartisan legislation would preserve the spectrum,  and help ensure our first responders have the resources to do their  jobs safely and effectively.   I urge the Senate to follow suit and move forward on this vital bill.                            ____________________
