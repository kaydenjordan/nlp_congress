 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would reduce the EPA environmental  programs and management account for the Office of Air and Radiation by  50 percent.  [[Page H5357]]    This office has destroyed an entire industry already and is currently  working hard to bankrupt a family-owned business in my district. The  EPA's OAR used the regulatory process to destroy the glider truck  industry in favor of a Chinese-owned trucking industry. Many of these  glider trucks are operated by small mom-and-pop businesses.   Now, the same EPA is targeting a family-owned business in my district  that supplies the only domestically manufactured outboard motors  preferred by the U.S. Navy SEALs and other Special Operations Forces,  including those of our allies.   They are putting their Green New Deal agenda ahead of our national  security and the safety of our men and women on the front lines  protecting our freedom.                                time  2350    My amendment reduces the number of unelected, unaccountable, and  unrecallable bureaucrats from vetoing the U.S. Navy SEAL military  equipment they direly need, and I ask my colleagues to support me in  joining this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Rose).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we are talking about a rogue agency here  that is not only failing to do the job that they are supposed to do,  but they are out harming people.   They are harming the heroes who are on the front lines that direly  need their supplies while they fiddle or faddle in the back room,  whatever they do, and deny those supplies, while they themselves are  gorging upon $10 million in combat materials and weapons.   I asked the administrator about this in a meeting a couple weeks ago.  I said, Tell me why the EPA needs the $10 million in combat-grade arms.   He said, Well, I didn't know we got it.   He said, I will get back to you. I will explain it to you.   I am still waiting to hear the answer.   There needs to be some accountability for agencies that are going off  the track, and I think this is really a good start.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
