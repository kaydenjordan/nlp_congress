 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the men and women of  the Salem Lakes Fire Department.   As war has ravaged Ukraine, the firefighters in Salem Lakes,  Wisconsin, took action. Led by volunteer firefighter Art Stypula, the  Salem Lakes Fire Department organized a massive equipment drive. The  effort involved fire departments throughout southeast Wisconsin and  even the Chicago area.   Turnout gear and other locally collected lifesaving equipment was  shipped to Poland to help Ukrainian firefighters do their job and keep  people safe.   I am extremely proud of the Salem Lakes Fire Department and the  firefighters for organizing desperately needed aid to the Ukrainian  people.   I know that Wisconsinites and Americans across our country will join  me in thanking them for their efforts. They came up with a creative way  to help Ukraine in its fight for freedom.   Ukraine's firefighters and its people will be given important  resources because of their charity and their compassion.   Thank you again to the men and women of the Salem Lakes Fire  Department for their lifesaving work each and every day.                            ____________________
