 Mr. Speaker, every American--in fact, every human  being--has the right to breathe clean air. If this Congress trammels  that right in the name of corporate profits, that choice is not just an  abstract moral failure, it is a concrete public health disaster, one  that will cause needless suffering, especially for our most vulnerable  friends and neighbors.   The regulations this bill seeks to impede are long overdue. The  earliest form of the Brick and Clay rule dates back to 2003. That was  more than 14 years ago, and now some of my friends in the majority are  seeking even longer delays.   We have been putting pollutants into our air and we can never unring  that bell, but we can do better moving forward, and we need to make  those improvements sooner rather than later.   We all know that justice delayed is justice denied. Justice has  already been delayed by more than a decade. We can measure that cost.   The Brick and Clay rule, in its current form, would reduce the amount  of toxins in our air by hundreds of tons per year. If we delay the rule  another  [[Page H1461]]  year, or 2 years or longer, all of our families, all of our  constituents are going to be breathing dirtier and more dangerous air.   This bill is a direct attack on our right to live in a clean and  healthy environment. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this  misguided legislation.
