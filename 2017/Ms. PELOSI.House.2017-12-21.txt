 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I also thank all of the members of the Rules Committee for the  exceptional service they provide to the House in reviewing legislation  that will come to the floor.   I particularly want to thank my colleagues on the Democratic side for  honoring the values of our country by advocating for an amendment to  include the Dream Act as we go forward. I would hope that most of our  Members would vote ``no'' on this rule and not allow for the previous  question to come forward so that it will allow for the Dream Act to be  considered.    I want to thank the chairman of the committee and the distinguished  Members on the Republican side, as well as the Democratic side, for the  hospitality extended to the Democratic whip, Mr. Hoyer; the chair of  the Hispanic Caucus, Congresswoman Michelle Lujan Grisham; and to me.   At that meeting, Mr. Speaker, I told the colleagues that we are in a  tradition of having great Democratic and Republican Presidents who have  been supportive of newcomers to our country and who recognize that  immigration is the constant reinvigoration of America.   When people come to our country with their hopes and dreams and  aspirations to make the future better for their families, they are  identifying with an American ideal: all of us having the responsibility  to make the future better for the next generation. And their  commitment, their courage, their optimism, their determination for a  better future makes America more American. Every newcomer who comes  here with that determination makes America more American.   Among those people are our DREAMers. This is a very discrete group  that we are hoping to protect in the Dream Act. Certainly, as our  colleagues acknowledged this morning, we have important work to do on  comprehensive immigration reform. We have a responsibility to protect  our borders, North and South, and anything that flies in, East Coast,  West Coast, and through the Gulf. But the fact is that--as was pointed  out by our colleague, Congresswoman Lujan Grisham, the chair of the  Hispanic Caucus: think of the DREAMers as a discrete piece that needs  protection now and not wait for the entire comprehensive immigration  reform to be resolved before we deal with this emergency.   Just as we treat CHIP, 9 million children are depending on CHIP, but  we are not waiting until we revise the whole healthcare system in order  to pass CHIP, nor did we. When we passed CHIP, it was before the  Affordable Care Act had passed.   But let me say why it is really important for this to happen now.  Unfortunately--and, really, I was pleased that our Speaker registered  his disagreement with President Trump when he took the action he did in  regard to DACA in September. When he did that and said, ``I will give  Congress until March to pass a law,'' what he didn't understand is that  he was putting these DREAMers at a distinct disadvantage.   Every day, over 100, 120-some DACA recipients, DACA-eligible  recipients, lose their status. That means, if they are working or  whatever they are doing, they lose their status to do that in our  country. Over 10,000 have lost status since the President's  announcement--well over 10,000.   So we can't wait until March to do this because it had consequences  known to us but unforeseen by the White House and by the President. And  I don't think, in his heart, that the President intended to hurt these  people in the very cruel way that they are being hurt by the actions  that are being taken.   We can't wait until March. We need action. We need it soon. We need  it to be bipartisan. That is what we have been working on--not me;  Members, Member-driven bipartisan cooperation in trying to find a path  that addresses the concerns that some have about the border--and we all  do--and also addresses the Dream Act.   As the President said: Let's call it DACA.   Okay. We will call it DACA.   So here we are. I said at the beginning of my remarks that we have  been blessed in our country by Presidents who have recognized the value  of immigration; that our country would be in stagnation if we didn't  have this constant reinvigoration of visitors to our country.   When President Obama acted because Congress had not acted to protect  the DREAMers and their parents, that was really important for him to do  because Congress had not acted. However, it is important to note that  President Reagan, when he was President and President George Herbert  Walker Bush was at that time Vice President, Congress did act through  the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. They did act. And  President Reagan's observation was they didn't go far enough.   So he took further executive action called Family Fairness to protect  people in our country, immigrants in our country. Actually, President  Reagan and President George Herbert Walker Bush protected a higher  percentage of newcomers to our country than President Obama did with  his DACA and DAPA action, a higher percentage because they understood  the value to our country of newcomers.   President Clinton continued all of that. President George W. Bush was  a champion and continues to be a champion on recognizing the value of  immigration. He has spoken about it intellectually, with respect, from  the heart for people coming to our country, and he has urged us to do  so.   He couldn't get the cooperation of his own party when he was  President to cooperate for comprehensive immigration reform, even  though when we had the power as Democrats, we supported it. But he  could not get the 60 votes in the Senate. But, nonetheless, he  continues to be a champion, really, for immigration reform.   And here we have a new President who campaigned on the backs of  newcomers to our country and who made immigrants villains. It is a  complete change from the Republican Party, from a commitment to valuing  newcomers and diversity in our country. It is a complete departure from  President Reagan, President George Herbert Walker Bush, President  George W. Bush, just to name the Republican Presidents.   So we find ourselves in this situation, but that doesn't change the  fact that we have a responsibility to all of God's children to treat  them with respect, and when we can do something to be helpful, we  should.                                time  1315    There is harm that is coming to the DREAMers every day, because they  are losing status. Regardless of what some may say, some are being  deported. This may be unknown to the President, but it is not unknown  to us in this Congress.   I want to thank Congresswoman Lujan Grisham, the chair of the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and her members. I want to thank  Congresswoman Judy Chu, the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Caucus; Congresswoman Yvette Clarke,  [[Page H10355]]  who, working with the Congressional Black Caucus, has been a champion  in that caucus; and all of the Members on both sides of the aisle who  are striving to find a path.   One path that we have open to us is to defeat this rule, to allow the  Dream Act to come up, and to put that in the mix as we go forward.   Again, this isn't an issue, this isn't a bill. It is a value, and  that is the conversation we had with President Trump. This isn't an  issue, but it is a value. This is about who we are as a nation and how  we respect who we are as a nation. That is why, I believe, that  President Trump will be receptive to signing a bill. He does want--and  we are all concerned for--border security. We will work with him on  that, but let's start by putting on the Record the support of this  House for a recognition that we are immigrants, by and large. Unless  some of you are Native Americans--and how proud we are of our Native  American community in our country and how blessed we are--most of us  come from immigrant families.   It was interesting to me in doing some reading on some of this. I am  very proud of my own Italian-American heritage. My grandmother was born  in Baltimore, Maryland. Her parents were from Venice and Genoa. My  father's family from Abruzzo. We are very proud of all of that, which  makes us respect the pride that other people take in their heritage.   What was interesting to me in recent days, because I remember--I  didn't suffer this, but I know my father and others did: Italians were  called ``wops.''   Do you know what wops means?   It means ``without papers.'' That is what they were called: without  papers.   These people are without papers, but in every way they are American.   I just want to tell you a couple of stories. One is Fernando Meza  Gutierrez. Fernando lives in my district. Fernando's family came to the  U.S. Fernando came to the U.S. when he was 9 years old. In high school,  Fernando was an AP scholar and received the International Baccalaureate  Diploma and the Achievement Award in Foreign Language for French.   Fernando continued to excel academically at Santa Clara University,  where he graduated cum laude with a double major in biology and French.   Now a third-year doctoral student at UC San Francisco, Fernando also  works at UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, where he  is working hard to provide new insights into many diseases and  disorders.   I just want to tell you one other story. Lisette Diaz was just 6  years old when her family brought her to the U.S. from Chile. Growing  up in Long Island, Lisette excelled in school and was involved in her  community. She went on to attend Harvard, where she received numerous  awards and participated in a variety of extracurricular activities.  Lisette recently graduated from Harvard with honors.   Lisette and other DREAMers have so much to contribute to our country,  but Donald Trump and other Republicans have made their agenda clear.  They want to shut down DACA and DAPA and deport hundreds of thousands  of DREAMers and parents of Americans.   That is what DREAMers think. We don't want them to think that. We  want them to think that the President understands their value, the  value of our DREAMers, and the challenges that they face.   If we don't do something soon, Lisette will be deported back to  Chile, a country where she hasn't lived since she was 6 years old.   There are just thousands and thousands and thousands of stories of  success, of those serving in our military, attending our schools,  teaching our children, working in high-level positions, because they  all have that immigrant attitude of hard work, hard work ethic, a work  ethic, a faith ethic, a family ethic, a sense of community.   In the sense and spirit of community, let's defeat this rule and  allow the Dream Act to come forward.
