 Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend for yielding  and very much appreciate his leadership on our committee.   Madam Speaker, I want to rise to oppose both the rule and the  underlying legislation.   Before I do, though, I include in the Record four newspaper articles  discussing the majority's concern about the Postal Service. The first  is a Wall Street Journal editorial; a column by Rich Lowry appearing in  the New York Post; a column by Byron York, appearing in the Washington  Examiner; and a column by Ruth Goldway, a former commissioner of the  Postal Service, appearing in the New York Times.   All four articles make it clear that the majority's reasons for  bringing this legislation, frankly, are ludicrous, and that what they  are proposing actually will make it more difficult to reform.               [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 17, 2020]                    Nancy Pelosi Goes Politically Postal                          (By the Editorial Board)         Speaker Nancy Pelosi is calling the House back into session       this week to address fears that the U.S. Postal Service is       being infiltrated by alien lizard people posing as letter       carriers. OK, it isn't quite that bad. The actual conspiracy       theory holds that President Trump is strangling the USPS to       hack the November election.        But talk about ``unsubstantiated,'' as the press likes to       call Donald Trump's Twitter emissions. Democrats should be       deeply embarrassed that their leadership has embraced such       claims. Two Congressmen, including Democratic Caucus Chairman       Hakeem Jeffries, wrote to the FBI on Monday to urge, if you       can believe it, a criminal investigation of Postmaster       General Louis DeJoy.        ``This conspiracy theory is the most far-flung thing I       think I've ever heard,'' says Stephen Kearney, who worked at       the USPS for 33 years, including as treasurer and a senior       vice president. ``DeJoy was not appointed by President       Trump,'' but by the USPS's bipartisan governors. (Who, as it       happens, selected him unanimously.)        ``You can find valid operational reasons for the actions       taken by the Postal Service so far,'' says Mike Plunkett,       another longtime USPS executive who now leads the Association       for Postal Commerce. ``In no way do I detect any criminality       behind them, and I'm at a loss as to how one would reach that       conclusion.''        The Democratic letter to the FBI cites news reports that       the USPS is decommissioning hundreds of mail-sorting       machines. But the context is that overall mail volume has       fallen 33% since 2006. ``They've been taking machines out of       service for years now, and I've been encouraging them to do       it more aggressively,'' says Hamilton Davison, the president       of the American Catalog Mailers Association. ``I think that's       a good thing for America, because we don't want to pay for       stuff that we don't need.''        Mr. Kearney, who now runs the Alliance of Nonprofit       Mailers, concurs. ``It's obvious, to be efficient and not       waste money, you need to take out some of that capacity,'' he       says. His group has similarly been urging productivity       improvements, ``because if they don't do that, our postage       rates are going to go way up.'' A leaked USPS document       floating in the online ether is titled ``Equipment       Reduction.'' But it's dated May 15, and Mr. DeJoy took over       June 15.        Another claim is that the USPS is pulling blue collection       bins off the street en masse. ``They're going around       literally with tractor trailers picking up mailboxes,'' Joe       Biden said last week. ``I mean, it's bizarre!'' The USPS says       it has nearly 142,000 boxes across the country, which are       adjusted as volume and costs dictate. In August 2016, the       USPS's Inspector General said that ``the number of collection       boxes declined by more than 12,000 in the past 5 years.''       Voter suppression by the Obama Administration?        Alarmed Twitter users last week posted a photo of mailboxes       on a flatbed truck in New Jersey. Oops: ``Morristown Mayor       Tim Dougherty said the mailboxes were being replaced with new       anti-fishing boxes,'' the local newspaper explained. On       Monday the USPS said it would postpone this security upgrade       for 90 days ``while we evaluate our customers' concerns''--in       other words, to keep jittery partisans on the internet from       losing their minds before Nov. 3.        Mr. DeJoy is being knocked for trying to cut overtime       costs. But is it any wonder? The day he was sworn in, the       Inspector General reported that in 2019 the post office       ``spent $1.1 billion in mail processing overtime and penalty       overtime, $280 million in late and extra transportation, and       $2.9 billion in delivery overtime and penalty overtime       costs.'' For context, the USPS's overall loss that year was       $8.8 billion.        Mrs. Pelosi is trying to put on a political show, starring       Democrats as the saviors of the post office. She says she       wants to pass a bill that ``prohibits the Postal Service from       implementing any changes to operations or level of service it       had in place on January 1.'' Also in the mix may be a $25       billion cash infusion. Then Chuck Schumer will demand that       the Senate come back to town for the same vote. By the way       the letter-carriers union endorsed Joe Biden on the weekend.        This is a made-for-TV phony political crisis. The USPS has       long-term challenges, but enough money to last into 2021. Mr.       DeJoy says there's ``ample capacity to deliver all election       mail.'' Some states have startlingly lax ballot deadlines,       but nobody can pretend with a straight face that it's the       post office's fault. Democrats have also scheduled a hearing       for next Monday so they can yell at Mr. DeJoy in person. How       long before Rep. Adam Schiff says it's another Russia-Donald       Trump conspiracy to steal the election?                                   ____                               [Aug. 17, 2020]               The Left's Lunatic `Postal' Conspiracy Theory                              (By Rich Lowry)         At this rate, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy will be lucky       if he isn't arrested and tried for treason before a people's       tribunal.        DeJoy has quickly replaced Vladimir Putin as the man that       progressive opinion will hold responsible if Trump wins a       second term in November.        According to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, DeJoy is a       ``complicit crony'' aiding Trump's effort to sabotage       American democracy. She believes the two have hatched a plot       to delay mail-in voting and disenfranchise countless       Americans prior to the election.        Protesters over the weekend showed up at DeJoy's Washington       apartment and North Carolina home. Two Democratic congressmen       have called for a criminal inquiry into his changes at the       postal service, and he will testify at a House hearing next       week.        In tried and true fashion, President Trump has stoked       suspicions by saying that he opposes a $25 billion postal-      service bailout in the latest Democratic COVID-relief bill.       According to Trump, blocking this measure--and $3 billion in       election aid to the states--will prevent universal mail-in       voting.        But the bailout doesn't have anything to do with mail-in       voting, and given the billions of pieces of mail handled by       the post office every week, it surely can handle the       increased volume from mail-in voting.        It is true that Postmaster General DeJoy is a major Trump       donor. He made his fortune in shipping and logistics, though,       and he was selected by the postal service's board of       governors.        Little did he know when he took over the agency in June       that he'd soon have a starring role in the country's latest       psychodrama. Every change at the postal service is now seen       through the prism of a belief that the agency is a tool of       creeping authoritarianism.        Letter collection boxes are being removed--never mind that       this has been an ongoing process for years. Underused boxes       are decommissioned or moved to higher-traffic areas. In 2009,       The Washington Post reported that 200,000 boxes had been       shelved over the prior two decades. In 2016, the inspector       general noted that another 12,000 collection boxes had been       cut over the previous five years.        Letter collection boxes all of the sudden have big red       locks on them--well, yeah, as an off-hours device to prevent       the theft of mail, something the service has also done for       years.        The postal service is deactivating mail-sorting machines--      right, and there was a plan for this prior to DeJoy becoming       postmaster general, and it has been long discussed in       response to the declining volume of mail.        DeJoy is cutting back on overtime--indeed he is, because       artificially swollen overtime is an enormous expense that he       hopes to eliminate with a more rational delivery system.        Democrats and much of the media make it sound as though the       post office was an efficient, smooth-running agency before       DeJoy took charge and then, at Trump's behest, transformed it       into place struggling to keep up with broadbased changes in       how we communicate.        In reality, the post office has lost nearly $80 billion       since 2007, and it lost more than $2 billion last quarter.       Unless the service finds a way to innovate, it is headed for       bankruptcy.        This is the impetus for DeJoy's reforms, which should be       welcomed by all the people now caterwauling about how       essential the post office is to the American way of life.        DeJoy has been adamant that the postal service will do its       job regarding mail-in ballots. The post office's recent       warnings to states that they should be mindful of how quickly       ballots can be delivered were played up as yet another       assault on mail-in balloting. To the contrary, they were       intended to avoid unrealistically late deadlines for mail-in       voting that could create a train-wreck in November.        But in their inflamed state, Democrats want a villain--if       not a foreign potentate,  [[Page H4260]]       then the guy in charge of delivering the mail.                                   ____                        [From the Washington Examiner]             A Reality-Based Look at Trump and the Post Office                              (By Byron York)         The news is filled with reports of President Trump's       ``assault'' on the U.S. Postal Service. The president,       Democrats and some in the media say, is deliberately slowing       mail delivery and crippling the Postal Service so that it       cannot handle an anticipated flood of voting by mail in the       presidential election. Former President Barack Obama said       Trump is trying to ``actively kneecap'' the Postal Service to       suppress the vote. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called the House       back into session this week and has set an ``urgent hearing''       for Aug. 24, demanding Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and the       head of the Postal Service Board of Governors testify ``to       address the sabotage of the Postal Service.''        Some of the accusations have grown so frantic that they       resemble the frenzy of a couple of years ago over the       allegation, from many of the same people, that Trump had       conspired with Russia to fix the 2016 election. Now, it's the       Postal Service. But what actually is going on? Here is a       brief look at some of the issues involved.                         142.5 billion pieces of mail         The idea that the Postal Service will not be able to handle       the volume of mail in the election, or not be able to handle       it within normal Postal Service time guidelines, does not       make much sense. According to its most recent annual report,       last year, in fiscal year 2019, the Postal Service handled       142.5 billion pieces of mail. ``On a typical day, our 633,000       employees physically process and deliver 471 million       mailpieces to nearly 160 million delivery points,'' the       report says. This year, that number is higher, given the       Postal Service's delivery of census forms and stimulus       checks. Those alone added about 450 million additional pieces       of mail.        In 2016, about 136 million Americans voted in the       presidential election. The number will probably be a bit       higher this year. If officials sent ballots to every single       American registered to vote, about 158 million people, and       then 140 million people returned ballots, the roughly 298       million pieces of mail handled over the course of several       weeks would be well within the Postal Service's ability to       handle. Of course, officials will not send a ballot to every       American registered to vote, and not every voter will vote by       mail. Whatever the final number is, the ballots that are cast       by mail will not cripple a system that delivers 471 million       pieces of mail every day.        There are, of course, compelling examples of election       dysfunction, most notably the mess New York made of some of       its congressional primaries this summer. But rather than       representing a Postal Service problem, that was because some       states are unprepared for a dramatic increase of voting by       mail. The states have to prepare the ballots, address them,       and process and count them when the Postal Service delivers       them. That is the focus of the entirely legitimate fears of a       possible vote-counting disaster this year. But it's not the       Postal Service.                            $25 billion for what?         Some news reports have left the impression that the Postal       Service will not be able to handle mail-in ballots without an       immediate infusion of money from Congress. That is not the       case.        The Postal Service is not funded by a regular       appropriation. It is, instead, an ``independent agency'' and       is expected to support itself, beyond a yearly appropriation       of about $55 million to cover the costs of mail for the blind       and overseas balloting in elections.        The Postal Service has lost money for a very long time. In       fiscal year 2019, it had operating revenues of $71.1 billion       and operating expenses of $79.9 billion, leaving it with a       deficit of $8.8 billion. At the moment, Postal Service       officials have told Congress, it has about $14 billion in       cash on hand, putting it on the road to fiscal insolvency       (without further aid) in late 2021.        In the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act,       or CARES Act, the $2 trillion relief measure passed in March,       Congress gave the Postal Service a $10 billion borrowing       authority. After the bill became law, there were negotiations       between the Postal Service and the Treasury Department on the       terms of the borrowing; a deal was announced in July. The       ability to borrow $10 billion, the postmaster general said,       would ``delay the approaching liquidity crisis.''        That was all the aid for the Postal Service in the CARES       Act. Completely separately, the bill also gave $400 million       to something called the Election Assistance Commission for       distribution to states to ``prevent, prepare for, and respond       to coronavirus, domestically or internationally, for the 2020       federal election cycle.''        The next mega-relief package, a $3 trillion bill known as       the Health and Economic Recover Omnibus Emergency Solutions       Act, or HEROES Act, was passed by the House in May by a vote       of 208 to 199. The winning total of 208 votes was comprised       of 207 Democrats and one Republican. Fourteen Democrats and       one independent voted against the measure. The bill has so       far gone nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate.        The House HEROES Act would give $25 billion to the Postal       Service in what is essentially a bailout. The bill mentions       nothing about helping the Postal Service handle the upcoming       election or any other election. Indeed, the only stipulation       at all placed on the $25 billion is that the Postal Service,       ``during the coronavirus emergency, shall prioritize the       purchase of, and make available to all Postal Service       employees and facilities, personal protective equipment,       including gloves, masks, and sanitizers, and shall conduct       additional cleaning and sanitizing of Postal Service       facilities and delivery vehicles.'' If the House Democrats       who wrote and passed the bill intended the money to be spent       specifically for elections, they did not say so in the text       of the legislation.        Separate from the Postal Service provisions, the bill would       give $3.6 billion to the Election Assistance Commission for       distribution to states ``for contingency planning,       preparation, and resilience of elections for federal       office.'' There has been some confusion about that; some       discussion of the current controversy has left the impression       that Democrats want $3.6 billion for the Postal Service for       the election. In fact, the $3.6 billion would be for the       states' election use. In neither the CARES Act, which is now       law, nor the HEROES Act, which has been passed by the House       but not the Senate, is there any money given to the Postal       Service specifically for the election. In any event, the       Postal Service has the capacity to handle the election and       does not need any additional money specifically to do the       job.                          The latest reform proposal         Whatever its other concerns at the moment, the Postal       Service does have chronic financial problems. This year,       Trump chose DeJoy, who made a fortune in shipping and       logistics and whose former company was a contractor of the       Postal Service for many years, as the new postmaster general.       (DeJoy is also a major donor to Republicans and the Trump       campaign.) DeJoy has attempted to deal with some of the       Postal Service's systemic problems with a pilot program to       make deliveries more efficient while reducing the Postal       Service's crippling overtime costs, which added up to more       than $1 billion in fiscal year 2018.        In the past, postal delivery worked this way: A worker       would arrive in the morning and work on various things in the       office--sorting mail, handling holds on mail, waiting for       incoming mail to arrive to prepare for delivery. That often       involved waiting around for hours and then starting an actual       delivery route later in the day. Once started, a route has to       be finished, and that involved workers going into overtime as       they delivered through their route as evening approached.        DeJoy's plan, now being implemented in a pilot program in       about 200 cities, is called Expedited to Street/Afternoon       Sortation, or ESAS. Under it, a worker would arrive in the       morning, collect all the mail that was ready to go out, and       head out for delivery--``retrieve, load, and go.'' Then,       after finishing the delivery route, the carrier would return       to the office and do in the afternoon the office work that       used to be done in the morning. That way, when the end of his       or her shift arrived, that would be the end of the workday,       with no overtime incurred. Mail that arrived to the office in       the afternoon, while the carrier was doing office work, would       be delivered in the next morning's route. It would be ready       and waiting when the carrier arrived for ``retrieve, load,       and go.''        The effect to customers would be that mail that was       delivered to the office in the afternoon would be delivered       the next morning, instead of that evening. The effect to the       Postal Service would be to save an enormous amount of money       in overtime.        In addition, there have been reports of the Postal Service       removing collection boxes and sorting machines. While some       Democrats and journalists have portrayed that as another       effort toward voter suppression, the fact is the number of       letters the Postal Service handles each year has declined for       20 years since the arrival of email. In those last two       decades, the Postal Service has downsized its capabilities as       the number of letters handled has decreased. Here is how the       Washington Post described the situation, specifically       concerning sorting machines: ``Purchased when letters not       packages made up a greater share of postal work, the bulky       and aging machines can be expensive to maintain and take up       floor space postal leaders say would be better devoted to       boxes. Removing underused machines would make the overall       system more efficient, postal leaders say. The Postal Service       has cut back on mail-sorting equipment for years since mail       volume began to decline in the 2000s.''        Some Democrats have characterized the current reform       efforts, much needed in an agency losing so much money, as       part of the president's master plan to steal the election.       But together, the Expedited to Street/Afternoon Sortation       program and the cutback in sorting capacity would seem to be       reasonable measures of the type the Postal Service needs to       implement, and indeed has been implementing over the years.       Yet this is what Democrats, and some of their allies in the       press, have labeled as an ``assault'' on the Postal Service.                             Nightmare scenarios         Many news accounts have included stories of Americans       suffering from interruptions in Postal Service deliveries.       For example, a story in the New York Times headlined ``Postal       Crisis Ripples Across Nation As Election Looms'' included the       story of Victoria Brownworth, a freelance journalist in  [[Page H4261]]       Philadelphia. ``For Ms. Brownworth, who was paralyzed four       years ago, the mail is her lifeline,'' the New York Times       said, ``delivering prescriptions and checks and mail-in       ballots to her Philadelphia home. But that lifeline has       snapped. She said she had received mail just twice in the       past three weeks, and she dreaded November's election,       worried that her ballot would suffer the same fate as the       oxygen tube that she ordered three weeks ago--and that had       still not arrived.''        Other news reports have included many other examples. They       are largely, if not entirely, anecdotal. While each is       serious for the person involved, at the moment, it is       impossible to tell how much of a national problem they       represent. People who keep track of the Postal Service       suspect that many of the stories are rooted in workforce       availability problems related to the coronavirus pandemic,       plus the changes in operations (for example, closing a       facility to clean it during an outbreak) that have become       part of life during the pandemic. The Postal Service would       not be the only large organization that has found it       impossible to operate as usual during the crisis.        There is also the fact that the Postal Service does, on       occasion, fail to deliver the mail. In its annual reports, it       includes data on ``performance outcomes.'' For example, for       first-class mail, which is the type of mail that would be       most employed for election purposes, the goal in fiscal year       2019 was to deliver 96% of letters in one to three business       days. Its actual performance was 92%. So 8% of first-class       letters were not delivered on time. Now, consider that the       Postal Service handled 54.9 billion pieces of first-class       mail in fiscal year 2019. That is more than 4 billion pieces       of first-class mail that were not delivered on time. And       that, in a fraught political situation, could be the basis       for a lot of anecdotes in news articles.        Many of those anecdotes, by the way, appear to have made it       to the media with the help of the Postal Service unions.       There are two major unions representing Postal Service       workers. On Friday, the largest postal union, the National       Association of Letter Carriers, endorsed Democratic candidate       Joe Biden for president. In June, another union, the American       Postal Workers Union, endorsed Biden as well. In 2016, both       unions endorsed Hillary Clinton. In 2008 and 2012, both       unions endorsed Barack Obama. In 2004, they endorsed John       Kerry. And so on.        One more note about delivery times. A few days ago, the       Washington Post published a story headlined ``Postal Service       warns 46 states their voters could be disenfranchised by       delayed mail-in ballots.'' The paper obtained letters from       Postal Service leadership to various states informing them       that some of their election deadlines are ``incongruous with       the Postal Service's delivery standards.'' The resulting       ``mismatch,'' the Postal Service said, ``creates a risk that       ballots requested near the deadline under state law will not       be returned by mail in time to be counted under your laws as       we understand them.'' In other words, several states are not       giving the Postal Service long enough to deliver a ballot to       a voter and then deliver the filled-in ballot to the state       election board. For example, if a state's law allows a voter       to request a ballot seven days before the general election       but also requires that votes must be received by election day       to be counted--that would be a recipe for a lot of votes not       being counted. It was an entirely reasonable concern on the       part of the Postal Service, and it is a problem more for the       states than the Postal Service. Yet media discussion of the       story suggested it was just another chapter in what one       source in the Washington Post account called ``the       weaponization of the U.S. Postal Service for the president's       electoral purposes.''                          Trump confuses everything         Despite the heated rhetoric, many of the Postal Service's       problems are relatively clear, if extremely difficult to       solve. In the context of the upcoming election, Trump has       repeatedly added confusion to the situation, most recently       with extended discussions in a television interview on       Thursday and a press conference on Friday.        In the press conference, Trump was asked, ``If the       Democrats were to give you some of what you want . . . would       you be willing to accept the $25 billion for the Postal       Service, including the three and a half billion dollars to       handle mail-in voting?'' As has happened many times in this       controversy, the question conflated the Democrats' proposal       for $25 billion for the Postal Service and the request for       $3.6 billion for the Election Assistance Commission. In any       event, Trump answered, ``Sure, if they give us what we       want.'' He then began to elaborate on other policy       priorities.        ``So, if they were to give you that, you would sign off for       the money for the Postal Service?''        ``Yeah, but they're not giving it to me,'' Trump said.       ``They're giving it to the American people.''        ``But if they were to agree to that--``        ``Yeah, I would,'' Trump said. ``I would certainly do that.       Sure, I would do that. Yeah.''        The next day, Friday, Trump spoke to Fox News's Maria       Bartiromo. ``They [Democrats] want $3.5 billion for the mail-      in votes, OK, universal mail-in ballots, $3.5 billion,''       Trump said. ``They want $25 billion for the post office. Now,       they need that money in order to have the post office work so       it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots.       Now in the meantime, they aren't getting there. By the way,       those are just two items. But if they don't get those two       items, that means you can't have universal mail-in voting       because they're not equipped to have it.''        In fact, while the $3.5 billion proposal for the Election       Assistance Commission (it is actually $3.6 billion) is       specifically for the purpose of facilitating mail-in voting,       the $25 billion for the Postal Service is basically a       bailout. In April, the previous postmaster general, Megan       Brennan, citing a ``steep drop'' in mail volume during the       coronavirus crisis, had asked for far more--$75 billion. The       Postal Service didn't get anywhere near that much money in       the first relief bill, the CARES Act--just $10 billion in       borrowing authority. So when the second relief mega-bill came       up, Democrats threw in $25 billion for the Postal Service. It       was not about mail-in voting. (On Sunday morning, White House       chief of staff Mark Meadows, who as a congressman followed       postal issues closely, said the administration offered House       Democrats $10 billion for the Postal Service.)        Nevertheless, the president connected the two and suggested       that the Postal Service needed the $25 billion, and the       Election Assistance Commission needed $3.5 billion, to handle       ballots in the election, and that he would not give it to       them for that very reason.        ``How would you like to have $3.5 billion, billion, for       mail-in voting?'' Trump asked. ``So, if you don't have it--do       you know how much money that is? Nobody has any idea . . .       Oh, $3.5 billion. They want $25 billion for the Post Office       because the Post Office is going to have to go to town to get       these ridiculous ballots in . . . Now, if we don't make a       deal, that means they don't get the money. That means they       can't have universal mail-in voting. They just can't have       it.''        The bottom line was that Trump made a mess of the issue. He       didn't make a case against universal mail-in voting, which       does not exist in the United States. He didn't make clear why       Democrats wanted $25 billion for the post office. He       suggested that not agreeing to the $25 billion was a way to       stop universal mail-in voting, which it is not. He didn't       address the serious problems at the Postal Service which need       attention and do not have anything to do with voting. In all,       he left the issue more confused than it had been beforehand--      and that was saying something.                           Democrats smell victory         On Friday, the Washington Post published a story headlined       ``Trump's assault on the U.S. Postal Service gives Democrats       a new campaign message.'' Put aside the casual use of the       word ``assault.'' The fact is, Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader       Chuck Schumer, and other top Democrats are jumping on the       Postal Service controversy with both feet. ``Democrats are       already blanketing the airwaves, latching on to the       opportunity to highlight support [for the Postal Service],''       the paper reported. Obama has joined in, tweeting that       seniors and veterans and small businesses ``can't be       collateral damage for an administration more concerned with       suppressing the vote than suppressing a virus.''        The Democratic commentariat cheered and signaled it is       ready to press the issue until election day. ``Trump donor &       Postmaster General Louis DeJoy should be in the crosshairs of       every relevant congressional committee, inspector general,       prosecutor, investigative journalist, whistleblower, class       action lawyer, editorial board, etc. etc. etc.,'' tweeted       former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. No doubt that is       precisely what will happen in the Democratic world and some       major media outlets between now and Nov. 3. But shouldn't       someone, sometime take a look at what is actually happening?                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, Aug. 18, 2020]        I Was a Postal Service Regulator for 18 Years. Don't Panic.                            (By Ruth Y. Goldway)         President Trump has threatened to withhold funds from the       United States Postal Service. The new postmaster general,       Louis DeJoy, has embarked on cost-cutting measures to       eliminate overtime and remove sorting machines. These actions       have created worries that Americans, reluctant to walk into       voting booths because of Covid-19, will be unable to vote by       mail this year.        I served as a regulator of the Postal Service for nearly 18       years under three presidents and I urge everyone to be calm.       Don't fall prey to the alarmists on both sides of this       debate. The Postal Service is not incapacitated. It is still       fully capable of delivering the mail. The focus of our       collective concerns should be on how the Postal Service can       improve the speed of delivery for election mail.        First, the president is wrong about the Postal Service's       finances. While the agency indeed has financial problems, as       a result of a huge increase in packages being sent through       the system and a credit line through the CARES Act, it has       access to about $25 billion in cash. Its own forecasts       predict that it will have enough money to operate into 2021.        The Postal Service's shaky financial situation has to do in       large part with the drop in first-class mail (typically used       for letters), about 30 percent less than a decade ago. But       the service's expensive, overbuilt infrastructure can absorb       the addition of more mail in 2020--including election mail       that is mailed to and sent back by every voter in every       state.  [[Page H4262]]         The new postmaster general's management team still includes       many knowledgeable and seasoned executives. And the Postal       Service has over 500,000 employees who are remarkably honest,       dedicated and used to working through emergencies:       hurricanes, snow storms, social unrest and pandemics.        While the Postal Service has contemplated many different       approaches to modernizing and improving efficiency, there has       not been a consensus on how much the service should reduce       costs. It is not at all surprising that Mr. DeJoy's choice of       particularly visible cuts has raised alarms.        The Office of the Inspector General of the Postal Service       has agreed to a review of the changes. And Congress has been       called back to conduct its own review next week, restore       trust in the institution and ensure that voting by mail       proceeds smoothly.        Given that there is enough money and perhaps more if the       president agrees to additional bailout funds; that there is       plenty of capacity in the system; and that voting by mail can       alleviate a health threat to the nation, the Postal Service       should be made to handle all election mail as if it were       first-class mail. This is where the policy discussions       surrounding the Postal Service should settle.        Most election-related mail is sent at nonprofit rates. The       1993 National Voter Registration Act requires the Postal       Service to charge state and local election offices the same       price for postage as nonprofit mailers. The Postal Service       has a history of providing extra care and attention to       election-related mail, on the level of first-class mail:       usually two to four days for delivery. A special logo and bar       code identifiers were created so that mail sorters were able       to pull election mail out from the routine mail stream to be       sure it was delivered as soon as possible.        But a recent letter sent by Thomas J. Marshall, the general       counsel for the Postal Service, to election officials around       the country seems to suggest that election mail will now be       treated like regular nonprofit mail (typically three to 10       days for delivery) and may take as long as 15 days. This is       not acceptable.        The Postal Service has the capacity to ensure that ballots       sent to voters arrive on time and that ballots dropped into       the system by voters are postmarked and delivered in times       that accord with state and local guidelines. In their meeting       with Congress next week, the leaders of the Postal Service       should guarantee that election mail will continue to be       treated as first-class mail. The Congress should agree that       there will be no additional financial support for the Postal       Service without this promise.        But state and local election officials must also recognize       the possibilities of delays and plan for earlier mailings so       there will be more days for ballots to be returned. Voters       must be reminded to send in requests for ballots, change of       address, voter registration forms and especially filled-out       ballots as early as possible.        The Postal Service does indeed need a bailout from Congress       so that it can be counted on to deliver the mail, medicines       and other vital products for years to come. It needs funds to       rebuild its more than 30,000 post offices and aging vehicle       fleet to reduce its reliance on temporary workers and to       broaden the range of services it provides. But these problems       do not affect this year's election.        Americans must continue to support the Postal Service,       whose existence is enshrined in our Constitution, by using       its vote-by-mail services to save lives now and to protect       our democracy in the future.     Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule for a very simple  reason. It is a silly rule. It actually violates the rules that my  friends passed at the beginning of this Congress. The legislation  before us has not gone through any committee, has not been marked up,  has not been debated, has not been amended.   My friend said at the beginning of the Congress they wouldn't bring  legislation like that to the floor, they conveniently waived that rule  yesterday. So here it comes with no committee procedure or markup. We  had a number of amendments, Madam Speaker, that were presented to the  committee, none of them were made in order.   I offered an amendment for what is called an open rule, where any  Member could come down here and put forward what they thought would be  a better idea since we had no opportunity to do that in committee. That  too was rejected.   So this rule is a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum from the majority,  and it means you can pass it in the House, but it is not going anywhere  else.   Now, let's turn to the bill itself. My friends say that--we are going  to hear a lot of bad things about the Postmaster General in the course  of the morning. I have never met him. I don't know him. The people that  do know him say that he is a really good guy, but I don't know. We are  going to hear a lot of terrible things about him. But at the end of the  day my friends are going to vote to give him $25 billion, and they are  going to do it in a bill that has no reforms in it, just says you can't  change anything. Now, how smart is that?   You can't change anything in an institution that is losing $8 to $9  billion every single year. We don't trust the person who heads this,  but we are going to give him $25 billion. Do we need that money?  Absolutely not. The post office tells us they have $15 billion on hand,  they have access to a $10 billion line of credit that will more than  take them for a year from now. So we don't need to be spending this  money right now. It is a silly, silly bill.   But I want to give my friends some free political advice. They want  to pass this bill. They want to get it through the Senate. They want to  get it to the President's desk. They want to get it signed. I believe  that. If that is true, make it bigger. Do exactly what my friend, the  distinguished chairman of the committee said, let's put some stuff in  it that we agree on.   The President of the United States says, I think every family in  America that makes less than $75,000 a year needs help right now, they  need $1,200 per adult, $500 per kid, that would be $3,400, a one-time  payment for a family of four. Attach that to this, it would pass the  floor unanimously in a bipartisan fashion and be picked up by the  Senate. And the President said, through his chief of staff, I will sign  something like that.   You could do something a little bit different. We are all having our  schools open right now all across the country. My friends passed $100  billion in the HEROES Act for it. The President said, actually, we  think it would take about $105 billion. Put that on this and help every  school district in America. But my friends chose not to do that, but if  you do, it will pass here, it will pass the Senate, and the President  would sign it.   Let's talk about unemployment. The President said, hey, we think the  $600 extra is a little high, but while we are negotiating, by the way,  we will keep paying it. My friends on the other side said, no, they can  do without the $600. And then the President said, well, we think $200  is the right number, but we can go to $400. Put that on here. Every  unemployed person in America would get $400 a week. Right now, thanks  to the Speaker and the minority leader in the United States Senate,  they are getting zero. The only help they are getting is from the  President who is using Herculean executive orders to try and get them  some additional relief.   So this is a joke. This is, as my friend the distinguished Member  from Georgia said, a theatrical moment punctuating the two conventions,  the Democratic Convention and leading into ours. No legislation is  going to happen because my friends aren't serious about legislation.   No money is going to get to the post office because it can't pass the  Senate, and the post office doesn't need it anyway. So we are going to  have an entertaining couple of hours. Fortunately, it is on a Saturday  morning, so I don't think very many Americans are going to waste their  time listening to this.   When my friends want to get serious, when they want to negotiate,  when they want to move something to the floor, we will be ready.   With that, Madam Speaker, I urge rejection to the rule and rejection  of the bill.
