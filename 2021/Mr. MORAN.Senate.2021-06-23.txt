 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, earlier this week--in fact, yesterday-- the Senate Democrats attempted an unprecedented power grab in the  Senate that, in my view, clearly would have affected the sanctity of  our elections and violated our Constitution.   S. 1 was one of the most monstrous bills I have seen during my time  in Congress, and it certainly didn't meet my standard of doing things  that are constitutional.   In doing so yesterday, the Senate Democrats underscored for me  something I thought I knew well, and they reaffirmed it, and that is  the importance of maintaining the legislative filibuster, the 60-vote  threshold for legislation.   I am sorry we went down the path of changing the rules for judges,  then for the Supreme Court, and now, potentially, for legislation.  Sixty votes is a good thing. Sixty votes allow--people say they want us  to work together--60 votes require us to do that. In the absence of 60- vote rule, everything becomes political. In the absence of 60-vote  rule, there is no certainty.   A party in power, one that has the majority of the Senate, the  President--the election changes, and there is a new majority, and then  we change what we just passed 2 years before. There is nothing good for  job creation and economic security. There is nothing good for families  and trying to figure out what is next in their life when the law can  change every time a new, a different party has the majority in the U.S.  Senate and House or there is a new President.   My view is that what happened yesterday was not by design. As a  matter of fact, the vote, among others, was designed to fail in order  to pressure Democratic Senators into altering the rules of the Senate  and render this place a majority-run institution.   Democrats achieved control--the voters gave them control of both  Chambers of the Congress and the White House--and are convinced that  they have a mandate to erode the governing norms of the Senate. By my  count, the Senate stands at an evenly divided, 50-50, and the majority,  by a slight number, Democrats have in the House of Representatives.  Surely, this is hardly a mandate for a radically progressive agenda,  much less changing the threshold for which minority rights are  protected and bipartisan cooperation is promoted.   Should the legislative filibuster meet its demise at the hands of  this Senate because Democrats decide on a majority vote, that the rules  that have been in place for decades should be changed overnight on a  whim, the august U.S. Senate will be condemned to a partisan spectacle.   The idea that everything should be decided by one vote means that  everything here becomes political and that the American people become  even more partisan. If every vote in the U.S. Senate--every outcome--is  determined by one person, then politics become the passion of the  American people by necessity. The 60-vote rule is designed to moderate  both sides of a question, to bring us together, to pull us to the  middle in something that is more acceptable to the American people than  anything we might decide if we could decide it on our own, Republican  or Democrat. It means that every citizen would feel the need to lobby  us.   The normal course of life becomes much more about politics. While  politics is important to the country and while it is important for the  American people to be engaged, they send us here to make decisions.  That 60-vote rule allows us to make decisions that are more acceptable  to them so they can spend their lives living their lives, not worrying  about what, on any given day, the U.S. Senate might pass.   I don't think the motivation by the Senate Democrats is what it may  seem to some. The suggestion is that we can't seem to pass any  legislation here. I read this week in the Wall Street Journal an  editorial, an op-ed piece, by Mike Solon and Bill Greene, and this was  a comment that stood out to me:         The movement to end the filibuster is less about a Senate       that doesn't work than it is about a socialist agenda that       doesn't sell.    The idea that everything is decided on the margin of one means that  we become politics, that politics rules in this country. The freedoms  and liberties that the American people enjoy every day because they can  rely on not radical change but modest change--on improvements day by  day, not improvements overnight--means that we have a different  country. We certainly would have a different Senate, but a consequence  of having a different Senate means America is not what it is today.   Again, I say this in a way that would, I hope, remind my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle: I stand ready to work on many issues on  which we can bring ourselves together. I hope this week--tomorrow,  today--that we learn there is an infrastructure agreement, a bipartisan  agreement. This isn't a belief that I have the ability to dominate the  agenda of the U.S. Senate or that one party should. It is a reminder  that America is better when we work together and that eliminating the  60-vote  [[Page S4723]]  rule, ending the filibuster, changes America for the worse.   I yield the floor.
