 Madam President, I would like to recognize a critical  member of my staff, Mike Anderson--he is known as ``Big Mike''--who  left my office in August to pursue a legal career in his hometown of  Anchorage, AK--something he has aspired to do since a young age.   Mike was my communications director, but it was much more of an  appropriate title for Mike because he directed so many things in my  office, so much of our communication both internally and externally.  You would often find Mike going from staff member to staff member,  asking them questions, relaying information from one team to the next.   In our office, if you had a question about what anybody was up to,  what anybody was doing in Alaska, here in our DC office, in our Alaskan  offices, you would ask Mike. That is a special quality. He is an  incredibly hard worker, incredibly gifted young man, and we are going  to miss that talent in Mike very much.   Mike is no stranger to Alaska political offices. Fresh out of college  at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, he took a job with Congressman  Young and then worked for Senator Murkowski.   In 2014, he was looking for a little more adventure on the calm side.  I was looking for someone to help with my communications on my  campaign. It was my first run for office. I was running against an  incumbent with big name recognition in our State. Mike came on board  and took a chance on me. It is something I will never forget--loyal,  great worker.   He had been taking a lot of classes at night at Catholic University  of America for the past few years, working in my office, and balancing  it all. He was on the clock around the clock and did it with grace,  humor, hard work, and excellence.   As I mentioned, he was our office communicator, but he was also the  office friend, the person you would go to for advice on things big and  small, the person you would call on for an assist if you needed to  move. It helped that he lived up to his name--6 feet, 8 inches. He is a  big guy. Mike always showed up, working together--as we called in our  office one team, one fight. We got big things done for our State.   Speaking of one team, one fight, my office has a pretty good hoops  team. Mike, as you can imagine--UAF varsity basketball player back in  Alaska--was the critical member of that team. We have won a lot of  games, particularly against the Cruz Texans. In fact, Senator Cruz once  gave Mike the nickname ``Denali'' for his size and how he dominates the  middle of the key on the hoops court.   Mike is going to make a great lawyer in Alaska. As a State, we have  so much potential--the biggest fisheries in the country, the largest  energy fields, huge military complexes, and fascinating, important  Alaskan Native legal issues. More than anything, Alaska needs good  leaders with integrity, brilliant lawyers, hard-working people like  Mike who love their State and give it all back to their State, and that  is what he is going to do.   We haven't seen the last of Mike. He has always been part of our  team, and I am sure that is what he will do, working continually in the  great State of Alaska to make sure our State thrives.   Mike, great job. Good luck to you. You are going to be missed. Best  wishes on a bright future ahead.                            ____________________     Madam President, despite what you might be reading in  the press, there are a lot of recent, important, bipartisan  achievements happening right here in the Senate. We are going to vote  soon on another major COVID relief bill, which is really important.  That will be our fourth major COVID relief bill this year--much needed,  of course, for the health of Americans and for our economy. I think  that when the history of this very challenging year is written, that is  what is going to be remembered--four major, bipartisan, important  pieces of legislation, not the rancor in the Senate, which has been  part of our history, part of the Republic since the founding of the  Republic.   A number of other major bipartisan accomplishments have also occurred  just in the past few months--the National Defense Authorization Act,  which passed with over 80 Senators; the Great American Outdoors Act,  probably the biggest conservation act in over 50 years; and the Save  Our Seas 2.0, a bill I was proud to author, the most comprehensive  ocean cleanup legislation ever to come out of the Congress. This is  just to name a few.   Let me name another important bipartisan accomplishment that is  starting to occur in the Congress, and that is dealing with China, the  important issue of China and China policy. I know people might be  saying: Wait, are you crazy? China? There is bipartisan agreement on  what is happening with regard to this relationship, the United States  and China?   The answer is, yes, we have made significant progress on this issue,  too, and it is important. I want to explain that a little bit because I  think it is a topic that we need to be focusing on more and more in the  U.S. Senate.   Like the Presiding Officer, I am honored to be completing my first  term as a U.S. Senator and honored, like the Presiding Officer, to have  been reelected to continue my service.   Six years ago when I started my time here in the U.S. Senate, I  started a series of speeches that focused on the U.S.-China  relationship and the importance of it. We all have been focused post-9/ 11 certainly on al-Qaida, ISIS, the big issue of violent extremist  organizations, which has been the appropriate focus. But as I started  my career here 6 years ago, I started to give a series of speeches  where I said the biggest challenge that we face long term from a  geostrategic standpoint for the United States for decades to come is  going to be our relationship with the rising power of China.   What I was saying 4 years ago, 5 years ago in this body is that  nobody is talking about it. It is really important, and we are not  focused on it. You can't say that anymore. Now everybody is talking  about China. There has been an American awakening about China. And that  is good. That is important. That is progress. And it has been  bipartisan.   I want to thank President Trump and his team because I think they  deserve a lot of the credit.   They laid out their national security strategy, their national  defense strategy. These are very well-written strategies that, in  essence, said that in the United States of America, post 9/11, it was  appropriate to focus on al-Qaida, ISIS, violent extremist  organizations, getting weapons of mass destruction. That was clearly  the main focus of our national security.   But what their strategies have been saying is that, yes, we need to  continue to focus on that, but now we need to prioritize the great  power competition  [[Page S7905]]  that is upon us with China as the pacing threat.   As you know, most Senators--Democrats and Republicans--particularly  the ones who focus on national security and foreign policy issues,  particularly those on the Armed Services Committee--they agree with us.  They agree with this reorientation. Again, this is important. This is  progress, bipartisan progress, on what is really going to be one of the  most--what is the most important bilateral relationship in the world.   What we need to start doing--and I say ``we,'' this body, the  Congress, the executive branch--is we need to start putting details and  principles into a long-term strategy, a bipartisan strategy that will  be enduring to address this challenge, to address the challenge that is  the challenge for the next decade--the rise of China and how we, as the  United States of America, need to deal with it. As I mentioned, I  believe this is going to be the defining national security issue for  our Nation for the next 50 to 100 years.   What I want to do today is lay out a couple of key principles on what  I see are some of the ways in which we can bring a bipartisan approach  to addressing this challenge. Last year, I was honored to be invited by  the heritage center--the Heritage Foundation--as part of their lead  lecture series on the Asia-Pacific to talk about this issue. I gave  remarks, an address that I called ``Winning the New Cold War with China  and How America Should Respond.''   Some of the principles that I laid out in that address from some of  my experiences in the U.S. relationship with China over the last  quarter century are what I would like to talk about. Those experiences  for me have kind of run the gamut as a U.S. marine; as a National  Security Council staffer and Assistant Secretary of State under the  exceptional leader, Condoleezza Rice, when she was National Security  Advisor and then Secretary of State; as the State of Alaska cabinet  official in charge of energy and natural resources--which are so  important to my State but also to Asian markets--and as a U.S. Senator.   First things first: I believe, as I mentioned, there has been an  awakening about the challenge posed by China. As I mentioned, 6 years  ago in this body, not a lot of Senators were talking about it. Now  everybody is, and that is important. I also think that there is a  recognition--whatever you want to call the tensions that have arisen-- that the U.S. and China have entered into a much more strategic  competition era--phase--with tensions that I have referred to as a  ``new Cold War'' with each other. This state of relations has only been  exacerbated by the pandemic, which, of course, started in China and was  covered up by the Chinese Communist Party.   When I talk about this issue of a new Cold War with China, I want to  be clear on one thing. This is not a challenge--or tensions--of our  choosing. It is the result of a conscious decision by the Communist  Party leadership of China to overturn key elements of the U.S.-led,  rules-based international order, despite that order enabling China to  emerge prosperous and strong from its so-called century of humiliation.  This new Cold War is not an inevitable consequence of China's rise or  our status as an established power. Rather, I believe, it stems from  China's rejection of becoming a ``responsible stakeholder'' in the  international system that the United States has led since the end of  World War II--a system from which China probably, more than any other  country in the world, has benefited from.   But recognizing that we have this new tension, that we have a new  Cold War with China, does not mean that the nature of the global  challenge is identical to that posed by the Soviet Union or that our  response should be the same. However, it does mean that the United  States and our allies need to recognize this challenge, address it,  counter it in ways that avoid major conflict but in ways that also  avoid compromising our core values and interests and principles in  liberty.   Let me talk a little bit about what I call America's awakening.   Since President Nixon initiated the opening of relationships with  China, many hoped that the country's political and economic system  would open as the country developed and joined this broader, Western- led international system. Others believed that even if the Chinese  Communist Party remained in control, its external behavior and  relationship with the United States would not be affected. When the  United States supported Chinese entry into the World Trade  Organization, President Bill Clinton remarked that American workers and  consumers would be the greatest beneficiaries--American workers.  Ultimately, this has proven not to be true.   Equally misguided was the hope that as China grew economically, it  would liberalize politically. The expectation was that China would  lower its trade barriers and follow WTO practices, respecting  intellectual property rights, promoting basic safety standards for  exports, curbing subsidies of its main industries, and not subjecting  imports--our imports--to illegal, nontariff barriers. None of that has  turned out to be true. China did not meet most of its commitments under  the WTO and still hasn't. Rather, it has employed its new access to  Western markets--American markets--to pursue large-scale theft of  technology, exploiting the openness of the American economy without  allowing American companies reciprocal access to its markets as it is  required to do.    Let me give one example of this that I have seen in my experience. In  2003, over 17 years ago, I was in an Oval Office meeting as a National  Security Council staffer with President George W. Bush, Condoleezza  Rice, and the Vice Premier of China, Madam Wu Yi, at the time. The  President, President Bush, strongly believed in the protection of  intellectual property rights, and he raised this issue with Madam Wu Yi  right there in the office--very aggressively, leaning over in his  chair. Madam Wu Yi looked at the President of the United States and  said: Mr. President, I am in charge of this. We are going to fix this.  We are working on it. You have my commitment, Mr. President. That was  in the Oval Office, 17 years ago.   Where are we on intellectual property theft from China? It is worse  today than when Madam Wu Yi made that commitment in the Oval Office. As  a matter of fact, the U.S. Trade Representative Office estimates that  Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs the U.S. economy  an estimated $600 billion annually, not to mention the thousands of  jobs lost. President Obama also tried to stem these blatantly unfair,  nonreciprocal practices, but Beijing did not honor the common  understanding reached by President Obama and Xi Jinping in 2015,  curbing cyber hacking of government and corporate data for economic  gain. Such theft continues unabated today.   These episodes raise an even bigger problem between the United States  and China. It is the problem that I call ``promise fatigue'' with  China. Think about it. Broken promises extend well beyond the economic  sphere, like intellectual property.   Here is another example. Standing next to President Obama in the Rose  Garden in 2015, President Xi Jinping promised the President of the  United States not to militarize the South China Sea. The commitment was  broken within months, when China took a very aggressive policy of  militarizing many of the islands and built up islands in the South  China Sea to the consternation of every single country in the region.  After enduring this promise fatigue with the Chinese for decades, we,  the Congress, the executive branch of the U.S. Government, are finally  getting wise. Everybody thinks trade should be a win-win, but Chinese  leaders appear to view it much more as a zero-sum game.   Ironically, this promise fatigue and China's predatory, nonreciprocal  trade practices have brought about--and did bring about--the new, much  tougher, and, in my view, much needed approach from the Trump  administration that we had prior to the pandemic.   We have this situation where we are not trusting our relationship  with China with promises that have been made but have not been kept  across a whole host of spheres, where the tensions in the South China  Sea are growing. But this current state of affairs was not preordained.   In 2005, then Deputy Secretary of State and future World Bank  President Robert Zoellick encouraged China in a very well-regarded  speech to become a  [[Page S7906]]  ``responsible stakeholder'' in the international system, which had done  so much to enable China's rise in prosperity. Zoellick's speech  challenged China to change its behavior, to support and promote and,  certainly, not undermine the U.S.-led economic order that had brought  peace and prosperity to China and so many other countries in the Indo- Pacific.   For a time, it appeared that China's leadership was contemplating  this American offer to be a responsible stakeholder in this global  system--the one that we had set up after World War II. In my trips as  an Assistant Secretary of State to China, I heard China's leadership in  many meetings--including in meetings with Hu Jintao, the President, and  other senior leaders--where they talked about being a responsible  stakeholder, where this invitation on working through the system we had  developed was clearly something they were contemplating. But over time,  it has become increasingly clear that the Chinese Communist Party has  rejected this concept, this idea to be a partner with us in bolstering  the international order that has benefited China so significantly.   In fact, the opposite has happened. China is now working to  systemically build an illiberal sphere of influence that threatens to  exclude America and erode our alliances in the region that have kept  the peace in the region for decades. The challenge we face today is  rooted in the attempt by the Communist Party of China to popularize its  authoritarian model abroad to ensure China's rise as a great power  under the Communist Party's leadership. President Xi made this clear at  the 19th Party Congress, where he championed China's model as a new  option for other countries and nations that want to speed up their  development. We must always remember, the Chinese Communist Party's  primary goal in domestic and foreign policy is to ensure the survival  and preeminence of the party.   The key driver of U.S.-China competition and tension today is China's  ambition to project its authoritarian model abroad. China's development  under a Leninist political model serves as an inspiration for many  illiberal actors and aspiring autocrats around the world. It uses its  economic influence as a means of exerting political pressure.  Additionally, Chinese companies and state-owned and state-subsidized  industries are not bound by the anti-corruption laws that American and  Western companies must adhere to.   Chinese indifference to establishing standards of transparency, which  we have certainly seen now with the pandemic, and project  implementation through its Belt and Road Initiative result in elite  deals that concede corruption abroad, weaken prospects for long-term  prosperity, and undermine the sovereignty of weaker nations.   China is seeking to undermine democracy and human rights and the rule  of law and international institutions--from pushing its norms for  controlling cyber space to silencing critics of its human rights  record, including critics in the United States, to pushing for the  enforcement of the Belt and Road Initiative at the United Nations.  China is using its growing voice on the global stage to legitimize an  approach at home and abroad that undermines American interests.   A recent Hoover Institution study argues that China is looking to  gain influence in the United States to shape attitudes and, ultimately,  American policy toward China. And although we have not experienced the  same level of political interference as, say, some of our allies, like  Australia, where politicians and donors linked to the Chinese Communist  Party try to sway the country's policies on sensitive issues, China is  clearly engaged in what the National Endowment for Democracy calls a  significant, sharp-powered campaign to influence American policy here  at home. This recent spy scandal with a Congressman from California is  just a recent example of this.   Fortunately, the Trump administration and Members of Congress on both  sides of the aisle have awakened to the long-term challenge that China  poses to America's national security and economic security interests.  As I noted, the Trump administration's more realistic approach on  China, laid out in its national security strategy and national defense  strategy, offers a clear-eyed view of Chinese ambitions and our need to  counter them. At a time when there is not enough bipartisan agreement-- although, I think there is more than, certainly, we get credit for-- there is broad, bipartisan focus and support within the U.S. Government  and, I believe, in the U.S. Senate on the strategic challenges posed by  China.   So we have had an important American awakening and a good beginning  with the recent U.S. national security and national defense strategies,  and I believe it is strongly in America's interest for the incoming  Biden-Harris administration to continue these strategies that have  strong bipartisan support here. In fact, in my recent meeting with  Secretary of Defense nominee GEN Lloyd Austin, I encouraged such an  approach on national security issues, particularly as it related to  China.   Yet these strategic documents that we are talking about need more  meat on the bones. What are more details and principles that we can add  to the national security strategy of our Nation that can ensure  bipartisan support for a longer term U.S.-China strategy? Let me  recommend five core elements that, I think, should be key in moving  forward with regard to our relationship with China.   First, we need to demand reciprocity in all major spheres of the  U.S.-China relationship. Second, we need to reinvigorate American  competitiveness so we can outcompete and outinnovate China. Third, we  need to continue to rebuild our military's strength and capability.  Fourth, we need to deepen and expand our global network of alliances.  Finally, we need to remember that employing our democratic values is a  huge, critical, comparative advantage in countering China's global  authoritarian influence around the world. So let me briefly touch on  each of these.   First, we need to demand reciprocity. The United States must insist  that the relationship with China be defined by reciprocity and  fairness. For too long, the United States has ignored the promise  fatigue--that I have talked about--with China and accepted unfulfilled  Chinese promises across so many spheres of the bilateral relationship.  You have seen it. When you raise the issue of reciprocity with senior  Chinese officials, whether that be in Beijing or with the Ambassador,  and they finally acknowledge that, yes, the relationship isn't  reciprocal, they say it is because ``China is still a developing  country.''   I would respectfully tell senior Chinese officials: Don't use that  argument anymore. It is an insult to the intelligence of American  officials. We need a reciprocal relationship because every American  understands and agrees with this--that it is about fairness, basic  fairness.   I posed an important question of reciprocity to former Secretary of  State Henry Kissinger at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing a  couple of years ago, and he acknowledged that, to have an important,  sustainable, great-power relationship between two of the most important  countries in the world, reciprocity was critical. The citizens of our  country need to feel that the relationship is fair and that a general  policy of reciprocity is important and critical in that regard, but we  all know it hasn't been that way.   The Trump administration has made significant progress on pressing  for more reciprocal relationships in our trading relationships, which  is very important, but we all know that the reciprocal relationship  doesn't exist. Chinese companies and government-backed investment funds  can come to the United States and buy companies, but we would have no  opportunity to do the same. Yet it needs to go much further than  economics. Let me give you an example. We need reciprocity in the free  exchange of ideas. American journalists are not allowed to travel  freely in China, and if they are not, then, why should Chinese  journalists be allowed to travel freely in the United States?   Similarly--and this body is focused on this--there are over 100  Confucius Institutes, established by the Chinese Communist Party, at  American universities. When I was in Beijing a couple of years ago and  met with senior Chinese officials, I mentioned this.   I said: I was recently with the Ambassador, and he said that just to  go on the campus of Beijing University you need to be accompanied by a  Chinese  [[Page S7907]]  official. So if there were real reciprocity in the relationship, if you  can have Confucius Institutes at American universities, how about we  get James Madison Institutes of freedom and liberty at Chinese  universities?    Of course, the Chinese wouldn't accept that.   They said: Well, Senator, Confucius Institutes only teach culture and  language, and a James Madison Institute of freedom and liberty and  democracy in China would be teaching propaganda.   That is what they said.   This is just one of many examples wherein we must have a reciprocal  relationship between the United States and China going forward.   Second, we must reinvigorate American competitiveness. The United  States is no stranger to global military and economic cooperation, as  we have known throughout the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Our  comparative advantages globally remain significant, but we can and  should do more to bolster other areas at home. We should bolster STEM  education, double down on basic research, and support Federal agencies  like the National Science Foundation.   We need to be able to outcompete and outinnovate China, and,  importantly, better understand China, its culture, its language, its  history, and its strategy with the new generations of Americans who are  focused on these issues, just as Russian and Soviet studies were  emphasized during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Many of our most  significant challenges--our national debt, infrastructure projects that  take years to permit, an education system that leaves too many  Americans behind, a dysfunctional immigration system--are all self- inflicted wounds.   I believe that the real challenges posed by China, as they become  more broadly apparent throughout our country, will start to spur the  bipartisan motivation that will be needed to address these significant  but solvable American challenges in order to make us stronger.   Third, we must continue to rebuild our military. From 2010 to 2016,  the Department of Defense's budget was slashed by 25 percent. Readiness  plummeted, and at the same time, the Chinese undertook a massive  building of its military and the modernization of its forces while it  also made concrete moves to militarize the South China Sea. History  shows, particularly with regard to America's authoritarian rival, that  American military weakness encourages authoritarian provocations  globally. We must make sure that, as we continue to engage China, a  strong U.S. military provides a hedge against Beijing's contemplating  risky and destabilizing military actions as its military strength and  capabilities continue to grow. China has a long history of using its  military to achieve strategic ends when countries are not ready, and we  must be ready.   As the Presiding Officer knows, I have mentioned that, gosh, almost  25 years ago, I was a young marine infantry officer who was deployed as  part of an amphibious task force to the Taiwan Strait, which included  two carrier battle groups as part of the U.S. response to Chinese  provocations on the eve of the Presidential elections in Taiwan. It was  a long time ago, but it was certainly an example of the American  commitment and resolve of one of our allies during a period of  heightened tensions in the Taiwan Strait that we need to remember and  be able to react to with a strong military.   Fourth, we need to expand and deepen our alliances. The recalibration  of our relationship with China should be done in partnership with our  allies. The cultivation and nurturing of these relationships must be a  foundational pillar of any American strategy as it deals with China.   Our greatest strategic advantage in dealing with China is this: We  are now a rich nation with longstanding historical ties that have been  reinforced by decades of diplomatic, military, and economic cooperation  based on shared values with our friends and allies in the region. By  contrast, China is an ally-poor nation, with North Korea as its closest  friend and ally. The unity of the West and our Asian allies is  essential to maintaining high global standards and transparency,  accountability, anti-corruption, a peaceful resolution of conflict, and  the importance of international law, particularly in the global areas  of sea, space, and cyber space.   Finally, we must employ America's democratic values as a critical  comparative advantage. We should never forget that our democratic  values were critical in our successful victory over the Soviet Union  during the last Cold War. In President Reagan's famous Westminster  speech before the British Parliament in 1982, in which he launched the  National Endowment for Democracy, he argued that America would win the  Cold War not through hard power alone but through the power of our  ideals.   As he reminded our audience and our close allies in Britain, ``Any  system is inherently unstable that has no peaceful means of  legitimizing its leaders.'' China's unelected leaders, like all  authoritarians, ultimately fear their own people. Our leaders do not.   It is fear that has driven China to develop an Orwellian social  credit score to rank its people, while detaining as many as 1 million  Chinese workers in concentration camps. Why else does the Chinese  Communist Party invest so heavily in facial and gait recognition  technology to monitor their own citizens? Why comprehensively censor  the internet to preclude even the most glancing criticism of the  Communist Party and its leaders? Why do China's internal security  services employ more people than the People's Liberation Army, the  world's largest military? The answer lies in fear, and the goal, above  all else, to make sure the Communist Party remains in power.   President Reagan saw the power and promise of our democratic ideals  as a potent critical instrument to challenge America's global rival,  then the Soviet Union, because the aspiration of freedom is universal  and remains the core commonality that underpins the strongest  partnerships of the United States with other nations. The belief that  liberty, democracy, and free markets reflect and strengthen the size of  our alliance system is something that is fundamental to the United  States and our allies during the Cold War with the Soviet Union and now  during our challenges with China. Helping countries protect their  sovereignty so they can be responsive to their citizens and effective  partners of our Nation is imperative at a time when Chinese influence  risks pulling nations into a new ``Sinosphere'' hostile to American  interests and our democratic ideals.   Let me conclude by predicting that the new challenges I describe with  China are going to be with us for decades. We must face this fact with  confidence and strategic resolve and bipartisan work in the U.S.  Senate.   America has extraordinary advantages relative to China: our global  network of alliances, our military power and economic leadership, our  innovative society, our abundant energy supplies--we are now the No. 1  producer of oil, natural gas, and renewables in the world--our world- class universities, the world's most productive workforce, and a  democratic value system that makes countries far more comfortable as  American partners than subservient members of a new ``Middle Kingdom''  led by China.   As a result of the long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union, we  also know what works--maintaining peace through strength, promoting  free markets and free people at home, and having the confidence in  George Kennan's insight that the Chinese Communist Party, like the  Soviet Communist Party, likely bears within it the seeds of its own  decay.   While democracies are resilient, adaptive, and self-renewing, there  are many vulnerabilities embedded in China's perceived strengths.   One-man rule creates acute political risks. Historical grievance can  breed violent nationalism. State-directed economic growth can produce  massive overcapacity and mountains of debt. The gradual snuffing out of  freedom in places like Hong Kong creates spontaneous protests of tens  of thousands and huge global backlashes across the world. China's  budding military power and historical view of itself as a nation and  culture superior to others is beginning to alarm neighboring states,  inspiring them to step up security cooperation with our Nation. Nearly  half of all wealthy Chinese want to emigrate--and these are the winners  from China's four decades of heady economic growth.  [[Page S7908]]    As we have in the past, Americans can prevail in this geopolitical  and ideological contest, but doing so will require a new level of  strategic initiative, organization, and confidence in who we are and  what we stand for. This also means that we must redouble our efforts in  making this strategic case to others around the world, particularly our  allies, and we must continue to work on bipartisan solutions that have  enduring support in this body for decades to come as it relates to our  challenges with China.   I yield the floor.
