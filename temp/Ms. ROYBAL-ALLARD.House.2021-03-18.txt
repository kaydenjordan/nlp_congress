 Mr. Speaker, as a co-author of H.R. 6, I rise in  strong support of the American Dream and Promise Act.   I thank Speaker Pelosi for making the American Dream and Promise Act  one of the top 10 Democratic priorities in the 117th Congress.   I also thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren and the Judiciary Immigration  Subcommittee for their invaluable hard work on this bill.   Today, this House has another opportunity to pass H.R. 6 and, once  and for all, end the fear and uncertainty that have plagued the lives  of our Nation's Dreamers, who have become an integral part of the  fabric of American society.   According to the Center for American Progress, each year Dreamers  contribute over $17.3 billion in Federal taxes, nearly $9.7 billion in  State and local taxes, and their households have $75 billion in buying  power.   Over the course of this deadly corona pandemic, an estimated 202,500  DACA recipients have risked their lives to protect the health and  safety of Americans.   Yet, in spite of the critical role they play in our society, over 2.1  million Dreamers live in a state of limbo, doubt, and anxiety of being  deported to a country most do not know.   H.R. 6 eliminates the ambiguity in their lives and recognizes the  talents and indispensable contributions Dreamers make to our country.  While their individual stories may vary, they share the common  denominator of embracing and exemplifying American values and love for  this country, the only country they call home.   The American Dream and Promise Act has the support of Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents, as well as businesses, organized labor,  faith groups, educators, health professionals, former cabinet  officials, and the majority of the American public.   This unprecedented coalition of support highlights that protecting  our Dreamers and providing them with a path to citizenship is not a  partisan issue. It is an issue about who we are as Americans, and what  is in the best interest of our country.   By passing the American Dream and Promise Act, we will live up to our  American values of fairness, justice, and compassion. And these  incredible young Dreamers, like generations of immigrants before them,  can continue to play their vital role in the well-being our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the American  Dream and Promise Act today.   Mr. Speaker, as a co-author of H.R. 6, I rise in strong support of  the Dream and Promise Act.   I thank Speaker Pelosi for making the Dream and Promise Act one of  the top ten Democratic priorities in the 117th Congress.   I also thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren and the Judiciary Immigration  sub-Committee for their invaluable hard work on this bill.   During the last Congress a similar version of the Dream Act passed  the House with bipartisan support. But unfortunately, the Senate failed  to take up the bill.   Today this House has another opportunity to pass H.R. 6, and once and  for all end the fear and uncertainty that has plagued the lives of our  nations Dreamers who have become an integral part of the fabric of our  American society.   According to the Center for American Progress, each year Dreamers  contribute over $17.3 billion in federal taxes, nearly $9.7 billion in  state and local taxes, and their households have $75 billion in buying  power.   During this health emergency they also demonstrated the vital role  they play in American society.   Over the course of this deadly Corona pandemic, an estimated 202,500  DACA recipients have risked their lives to protect the health and  safety of Americans.   Dreamers are amongst the essential workers helping to package and  stock our food, the teachers of our children, and the doctors, nurses,  and caregivers who daily have sacrificed their lives to save the lives  of others.   Yet inspite of the critical role they play in our society, over 2.1  million Dreamers live in a state of limbo, doubt, and anxiety of being  deported to a country most do not know.   H.R. 6 eliminates the ambiguity in their lives and recognizes the  talents and indispensable contributions Dreamers make to our country.   I have the privilege of representing the 40th Congressional district,  home to 24,000 Dreamers--the largest number in any congressional  district.   Since I co-authored the original Dream Act twenty years ago, known  then as the Student Adjustment Act, I have met many of them and  hundreds more, from all over the country, who have traveled to our  nation's capital to tell their personal stories of hope, fear,  exclusion, and heartbreak.  [[Page H1514]]    While their individual stories may vary, they share the common  denominator of embracing and exemplifying American values and love for  this country, the only country they call home.   They are American in every way, except on paper.   They are Dreamers like Gabriela Cortes who was brought here at age  two and will graduate in May with a Bachelor of Science degree. She  says the Dream Act gives her hope because quote,'' This is the only way  I can fully contribute to my country, the only home I know.''   They are Dreamers like Sheila Salinas Navarro who is a first year PhD  student at USC Leonard School of Gerontology. She says, quote, ``We  need permanent solutions so that folks like me can contribute to this  nation. All I ask is an opportunity to do so.''   And they are Dreamers like Marvin Perez, brought to this country at  age five and now attending Glendale Community college. He says he wants  the opportunity to continue working on becoming a physician.''   H.R. 6 will give them and all our Dreamers the opportunity to reach  their full potential, contribute to their community, and help ensure  America remains the strongest and greatest nation in the world.   The Dream and Promise Act has the support of Democrats, Republicans,  and Independents, as well as businesses, organized labor, faith groups,  educators, health professionals, former Cabinet officials, and majority  of the American public.   This unprecedented coalition of support highlights that protecting  our Dreamers and providing them with a path to citizenship is not a  partisan issue.

I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Dream and Promise Act today.                                time  1245
