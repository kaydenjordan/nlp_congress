 Mr. Speaker, today, the brutal conflict in Syria enters  its eighth year. As we meet, safe and secure in this Chamber, the  Syrian regime, with the support of its principal ally, Russia, is  pulverizing Eastern Ghouta.   On February 24, the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed a  resolution demanding a 30-day cease-fire across Syria. This was  supposed to permit a ``durable humanitarian pause'' so that aid could  be delivered and people who are critically sick and wounded could be  evacuated.   It hasn't worked. Instead, a brutal campaign of airstrikes, shelling,  and ground offensives has intensified. Populated areas remain under  siege. The targeting of civilians continues, and hundreds more men,  women, and children have been killed.   In the words of the U.N. Secretary General: ``Syria is bleeding  inside and out.''   Mr. Speaker, our failure to stop this terrible slaughter is shameful.  It is unacceptable. We must urgently work with our allies, put an end  to this nightmare, and find a path forward.                            ____________________
