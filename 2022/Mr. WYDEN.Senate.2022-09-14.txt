 Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss the new  Graham legislation to create a national abortion ban. The centerpiece  of the Senator's argument is that Senator Graham wants our country to  believe that his national abortion ban is a moderate proposal--his  words. Wrong, wrong, wrong.   A moderate bill would not institute criminal penalties for doctors  providing lifesaving medical care. That is what this so-called moderate  bill does. A moderate bill would not take rights away from American  women, no matter where they live. That is what this so-called moderate  bill does. A moderate bill would not create a presumption of women's  guilt by requiring them to report a rape or seek counseling before they  get an abortion. This so-called moderate bill does that, too.   Just think about that last point. If you are trying to assess our  colleague from South Carolina's argument that his bill is moderate,  under Senator Graham's new restrictions, a 12-year-old rape victim,  regardless of the terror she feels or the danger she faces, would have  to find a way to report her assault to police before she could get the  care she needs. That is a stunning overreach and there is absolutely  nothing that is moderate about this proposal. The reality is this is  not a moderate proposal. It is an extreme proposal, way out of step  with the overwhelming opinion of the American people.   The other important argument I wanted to discuss was this whole  matter of how so many of my colleagues on  [[Page S4596]]  the other side of the aisle have pledged loyalty--pledged loyalty--to  the importance of States' rights that they are going to leave the  decision on abortion to the States. But Senator Graham has shown us  that all his talk about States' rights means that the States have to  agree with Senator Graham. That is what his idea about States' rights  is all about.   His bill tramples, for example, on the rights of Oregonians, who sure  don't share Senator Graham's view on this, and people in many other  States, women and men who voted to protect abortion, women's  healthcare, and women's individual freedom.   Senator Graham's bill is about control. It is about government-- government--mind these words--government having control over women's  bodies rather than women having control over their bodies.   It is also clear that what has always been envisioned is not just a  nationwide ban on abortions but criminalizing this with women and  doctors at some point, I gather, possibly locked behind bars.   It is election season and Senator McConnell wants everybody to forget  the Republicans' top priorities include passing these extreme  restrictions through Congress and the courts. I believe that Americans  know better. When it comes to this kind of legislation that is so far  removed--far removed--from the moderate claim of its sponsor, I think  we ought to recognize what we are looking at is a total national  abortion ban, criminalization, and the rights of women curtailed and  the power of government over them increased.   Senator Graham's bill is the next step in that direction for  Republicans. Introducing his proposal, Senator Graham basically  confirmed that:         If [we] take back the House and Senate, I can assure you       we'll have a vote [on our bill].    Madam President, I think we have a lot of speakers coming, but I  think the American people ought to take Senator Graham at his word.  This is what his agenda is about. This is what he is going to be  championing from sea to shining sea. I just hope we do everything we  can here in the Senate--in this country--to make sure that the Graham  bill does not see the light of day.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
