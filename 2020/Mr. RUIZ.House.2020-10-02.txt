 Mr. Speaker, I recently received a letter from a  constituent named Jeffrey. Jeffrey was laid off in March and hasn't  been able to find work during the pandemic.   He wrote to me and said: ``I have been scraping by on my savings and  borrowing, and I am now finally broke with a disabled brother, a 13- year-old kid to feed, and a house.''   Another constituent wrote about his 83-year-old mother, who survives  on a small pension and Social Security. The pandemic has required her  to have a caregiver for much longer hours. Her and sons' bank accounts  are running dry.   The American people need relief now, which is why the House passed  the updated Heroes Act this week with another round of stimulus checks;  extended unemployment benefits; small business support; and money for  local, State, and Tribal governments to pay for essential services like  first responders, police, firefighters, and teachers.   The House is doing their job. The Senate must do theirs and bring  this bill for a vote for the people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Judiciary Committee and  the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for organizing the trip to Irwin  County Detention Center. I was one of those who went to witness  firsthand what was going on.   I want to thank Representative Jayapal for this resolution and her  leadership in this matter.   As a medical and public health expert, I have found three gross  categories of violations in Irwin County Detention Center.   One is there were not sufficient precautions to prevent COVID-19 from  causing an outbreak in the facilities. There was only one mask issued  upon arrival, and the second mask was not issued until the day before  we arrived, knowing we were going to arrive. Some women were there for  6, 7 months.   The second is that there was a COVID-19 positive patient in the  facility, yet at the medical quarters, nobody was wearing an N95 mask,  which could put the staff and other people in jeopardy. The COVID-19  patient was reported to be in isolation during the time that we were  there.   Furthermore, the second problem in public health is the lack of  hygiene maintenance in the facility. There were reports that the  curtains were infested with mold. There was mold in the showers.  Clothing hadn't been washed. They were issued sweatpants and  sweatshirts; they were visibly dirty and torn.   When I inspected the showers myself, I saw that, in fact, there was  mold in the showers. The curtains were replaced the day before or 2  days before we had arrived. So that is a problem in the face of human  dignity and also in requiring personal hygiene to stay safe from COVID- 19.   Furthermore, going back to the first category, I forgot to mention  that the bunk beds were very small, and they were only 3 feet apart in  their sleeping quarters, so that was also not following CDC  recommendations.    In terms of the third violation, which is the most  outstanding and outrageous violation, it was that procedures were done  without the women's informed consent. There were gynecological  procedures, as was mentioned: total hysterectomy; partial hysterectomy;  most of them were oophorectomies; most of them were cystectomies.   But the point here is that whenever you have any gynecological  procedure, that can result in scarring, future pain, possible chronic  pain, and also infertility. Therefore, you need informed consent.   It is medical practice to have informed consent, which requires an  explanation of your disease, of the illness, of the procedure,  including risks and any alternative options, including the option of  doing nothing, in the language that the patient understands.   Not doing so, not documenting it, is a violation of that informed  consent. Violating informed consent and putting a blade to a woman's  body, without her understanding or her informed consent, is an assault.    That is why we need fully to condemn this practice. That is why we  need to fully investigate through the inspector general, through the  FBI, through the Georgia medical and surgeon license board to ensure  that this doesn't happen, that it is not happening in other private  detention facilities throughout the country, in rural areas where  perhaps they think they might get away with it because, after all,  these are very disempowered women without very strong advocacy in those  locations.   I am very thankful for the lawyers, for those that brought this to  light,  [[Page H5651]]  that have empowered the voices, including a 22-year-old woman who now  will never be able to have children.   I support this resolution to send a very strong message to all  facilities and all doctors that every woman requires fully informed  consent before any procedure.
