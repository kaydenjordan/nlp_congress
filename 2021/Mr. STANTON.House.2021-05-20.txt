 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this important bill  to better secure our Capitol complex, which includes my legislation to  provide body-worn cameras to Capitol Police officers and require their  use.   Implementing a body-worn camera system for the United States Capitol  Police was recommended in General Honore's important report.   In the wake of the January 6 attack, is there any doubt that the  Federal criminal investigations would have greatly benefited from  additional body camera footage?   In addition, in my experience as a mayor of a major American city,  the city of Phoenix, I know that body-worn cameras improve safety,  improve safety for officers, for the public, and for everyone in the  community. They will improve safety for the people who work here at the  Capitol complex.   I thank Chairwoman DeLauro and Congressman Ryan for working with me  on this important issue.                                time  1000
