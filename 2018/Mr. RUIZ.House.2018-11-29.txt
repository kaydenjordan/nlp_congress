 Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to acknowledge November as  Eye Donation Month, dedicated to increasing awareness of the need to  register as an eye, organ, and tissue donor.   Since 1983, the Eye Bank Association of America, EBAA, and each of  its 75-member eye banks across the U.S. have dedicated this month to  honoring the Nation's eye donors and their families, and to celebrate  the transformative impact of corneal transplants on the lives of their  recipients.   With a 97 percent success rate, corneal transplants are the Nation's  most successful organ transplant procedures. Since the Association's  founding in 1961, nearly 2 million corneal tissue recipients have  regained their sight.   In 2017, EBAA member eye banks recovered 135,203 corneas from 68,565  donors across the United States. This made it possible to provide the  gift of sight to approximately 51,000 men, women, and children in the  U.S., and over 26,000 recipients internationally. These eye banks also  provided more than 24,000 corneas for research and educational  purposes.   My home State of California is served by eight eye banks that  recovered nearly 8,000 corneas last year, making it the largest source  of corneal tissue for transplant and research in the country. These  donations allowed thousands of Californians to regain their vision and  resume the lives they had planned on living before disease or injury  deprived them of their sight.   In addition to improving their recipients' quality of life and giving  comfort to donor families, corneal transplants also have a considerable  economic impact on America's healthcare system. A recent EBAA analysis  found that the net lifetime economic benefits of cornea transplants  performed in 2017 will exceed $6 billion, due to the elimination of  medical expenses related to vision care and the increased productivity  of both the cornea recipients and their caregivers.   I thank the Eye Bank Association of America for its decades-long  dedication to the restoration of sight. I thank all of those who list  themselves as an organ donor on their driver's license. I thank all of  those who are willing to give of themselves for others. I want to  reassure and thank their loved ones, because those who have passed have  done a great good for society, for people who have lost their sight,  and for future generations who will one day benefit from the research  they have contributed to by donating their corneas.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in urging all Americans to give  the selfless gift of vision and life by registering to become eye,  organ, and tissue donors.                            ____________________
