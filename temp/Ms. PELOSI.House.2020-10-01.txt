 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be on the floor today to  support a bill brought to the floor by the distinguished chair of the  Appropriations Committee, Nita Lowey from New York. Her service on that  committee for decades has been a blessing to our country.   I have seen firsthand her leadership for America's families, for our  country, for our communities, and for our children. We have worked  together on women's issues, HIV/AIDS, you name it, every subject,  minority health issues and the rest.   And here we are today with this legislation that is so needed for our  country.   It is really hard to understand what it is that people would oppose  in the legislation. The Appropriations Committee has done a masterful  job.   You have been a maestro, Madam Chair, as well as your staff, for  putting this legislation together.   I am in Congress because of children. I am always here for the  children. I wanted to start my comments by saying what this legislation  would mean to a family of four.                                time  1800    This is a lifeline for workers and families who are facing this  coronavirus disaster. For a family of four earning $24,000, Heroes 2  would mean direct payments, a $3,400 direct payment; unemployment  benefits of $600 per week in enhanced UI benefits; tax credits up to  $5,920 through the EITC, and a fully refundable $4,000 tax credit,  equaling an additional $1,200 in refunds.   I mention that because some have said: Why don't you like this other  bill and that bill? None of that that I just said, the tax credits, the  earned income tax credit, the fully refundable child tax credit, none  of that is in any of the Republican bills. None of the bills that you  have seen other than this bill has that consideration for children.   So when people say: Well, why don't you take a half a loaf? Because  the children need more than the heel of a loaf of bread. They need the  best we can do for them.   It has an increase in SNAP benefits, an increase of $100 a month in  most States, plus rental assistance and the ACA premium subsidy. This  gives immediate eligibility for parents losing their jobs for the  maximum health insurance premium subsidy under the Affordable Care Act,  a benefit worth $1,386 per month.   Now, we can't do everything in a bill that is coronavirus focused. We  have challenges in our country that we must address in a bigger way.  But what we have here is coronavirus-centric, and that is important to  note because people are suffering in a different way. Many of these  families are food insecure. Millions of children in our country are  food insecure, and this Heroes Act addresses some of that.   So in addition to thanking Nita Lowey for her leadership, I salute   Bobby Scott for our children and for our workers. We want our children  to go back to school. We want them to do so in a way that is safe. And   Bobby Scott has provisions in here for that, whether it is actually in  school, whether it is virtual, whether it is hybrid, or whether it  calls for the ventilation that is needed.   And, again, for their fathers and mothers to go to work in a safe  atmosphere by having strong OSHA language in here to protect workers.  That is not in the Republican bill. That is not in the Republican bill.   We can come to terms on money, but the language is what is important.   The Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Frank Pallone, 4\1/2\  months ago, and even before that, proposed a strategic plan that I am  sure he will talk about, and I thank him for that, a strategic plan in  order to crush the virus.   The Republicans want to crush the Affordable Care Act in a time of a  pandemic, going into the Supreme Court to crush the Affordable Care  Act. Why don't we just come together, crush the virus? We can open our  economy and our schools in a safe way.   And I thank you, Chairman Pallone, for your leadership.   The Natural Resources Committee, Chairman Raul Grijalva, what he has  in the legislation is so important, especially addressing the needs of  our Tribal communities in our country, which are so disproportionately  affected by the coronavirus. I thank him for his leadership that in so  many ways is in the legislation, but that being such an essential  piece.   I thank the Oversight Committee chairwoman, Carolyn Maloney, for her  leadership for the Postal Service, and I think we have finally gotten  the message across on the Postal Service. Hopefully, we will get some  cooperation there.   But not yet on the Census. The Census is so important. It is the life  blood of who we are, the DNA of America, the people, and we are having  a problem with that. It is not even about money. It is about policy. So  I thank Representative Maloney for her ongoing leadership, 4 years  culminating in this legislation now.   Small Business Committee Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez, so  knowledgeable, for decades the chair or ranking member of the Small  Business Committee. She knows about women and minority-owned  businesses, and the most optimistic thing a person can do is to, I say,  plant a flag for a small business.   How more optimistic can you be than to start a business? Perhaps, get  married, but you kind of know what your risks are there.   But a small business, so needed the help in here for PPP, other help  for hospitals--excuse me, for restaurants. Hospitals are in Mr.  Pallone's section of the bill and the language for the healthcare  providers is there.   But back to Nydia Velazquez. This is a big piece of the bill.  [[Page H5426]]    So what do we do for PPP? What do we do for restaurants? What do we  do for arenas, small spaces around the country for entertainment and  bringing people together--spatially distanced, of course. How do we  balance all of this?   That is language that we are trying to resolve in our negotiations. I  am optimistic that we can get there, but we couldn't do the best job  possible without the leadership of Nydia Velazquez.   The Veterans' Affairs Committee, I thank Mark Takano for his  important work for our veterans and the resources we have in the bill  for our veterans.   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richie Neal just has been brilliant  in how we put money in people's pockets with direct payments and some  of the other tax provisions that I talked about earlier for children  that have no reference in the Republican bill as far as the children  are concerned. And, again, my top priority is the children.   I thank Peter DeFazio, the chair of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee for his leadership and having the language in  here, not just for the airlines, which is very, very important, and  that is important because it is an essential--it is important, but  people should know, when they say, ``Well, why should we help airline  employees?'' well, we do because they have to have special  certifications and special security clearances and the rest. If they  lose a job and come back, it is months before they can come back, not  like any other industry. So that is important.    But Mr. DeFazio also has an important chunk of money in the bill for  transportation, writ large and some other ways, that is urgent and  coronavirus connected. And that is very important, as well, and I thank  him for his leadership in that regard.   But read the bill. I salute the chairs. This is about having  scientific, institutional, academic bases for the amount of money that  we are asking for.   We had a bigger bill, 3.4. The other side said: We are not going  there.   So we came down a trillion dollars.   No, not yet.   We came down another $200 billion, not by violating any of our  priorities, but by shortening the time, just shortening the timeframe  and moving some issues to the other arena that Madam Chair works in and  that are in our regular appropriations bills as we go forward.   So this is really important. One bill is not as good as another.   Why not take something instead of nothing?   Why should that be the standard for America's children? We have to  fight for the best that we can get for them, and I feel certain that we  will have a level of success. People have to know.   One of the problems that I have, the difference between the Democrats  and the Republicans on this issue is, in the Republican bill, they have  a $150 billion benefit for some of the wealthiest people in our  country--$150 billion.   In our bill, we strive to have $149 billion for our children for the  earned income tax credit, for full refundability and the rest.   No.   So we took it down to $54 billion, and it was still waiting to see if  we get acceptance of that.   $150 billion for the wealthiest people in America, tax, net operating  loss.   149 for America's working families, no. We took it down to 54. We  took off $100 billion to gain agreement.   This is not just a money debate and a language debate; it is a values  debate. It is important for people to know what this fight is about.   So it is called the Heroes Act, and it is called the Heroes Act  because we are honoring our heroes. Everybody wants to wave and have  cutouts at the game and all that. Honor our heroes by making sure they  have their jobs.   These are our healthcare workers, our police and fire first  responders, our teachers, our transportation, our sanitation, our food  workers and the rest who make our lives function. We couldn't do what  we do without them doing what they are doing. Many of them are risking  their lives to save lives, and now they may lose their jobs.   Why?   Let the States go bankrupt. That is what Mitch McConnell said. Let  the States go bankrupt.   And what did the President say? Well, those blue States, why should  we send them any money?   Because the people have needs, and we have to meet them.   We lose all ability to thank them if we say: That is nice, but we  don't care if you lose your job. You can go on unemployment insurance.   What have we accomplished? We have diminished the services to people,  probably raise taxes in some of these places, and people lose their  jobs. Over a million, closer to a million and a half of State and  locals have lost their jobs already, and it is predicted that 3\1/2\  million more will lose their jobs if we don't act on this.   So this is an important pillar of this bill, supporting State and  local government. That is one of the areas that we are, shall we say,  negotiating.   Next, crush the virus. Mr. Pallone has a plan. Crush the virus so  that we can again open our schools, our businesses, our economy. And we  are long overdue.   Well, this bill is 4\1/2\ months old because, at the time we passed  it, the leader in the Senate, Mr. McConnell, pushed the pause button.  He pushed the pause button. We have got to wait and see.   Since that time, over 100,000 people have died. Hundreds of thousands  have become infected because he pushed the pause button and said: Let  the States go bankrupt.   So this is why we come here today, to debate policy on how we think  we can best meet the needs of the American people. And we think we can  best meet the needs of the American people with the provisions in this  bill. I thought it was really important for us to formally put forth  the work of our chairs, which is excellent, which meets the needs of  the people.   Representative Waters, you heard from her earlier. Families are on  the verge of eviction. Families on the verge of eviction get support in  this legislation.   People who can't pay their mortgages are helped in this legislation.  I thank Chairwoman Waters for that as well. It is her work on the  restaurant legislation to help many more small businesses get help from  this legislation.   This is a tall order.   People say, well, we should have a skinny package. No, we don't have  a skinny problem; we have got a massive problem.   Now, you don't believe so much more in the role of government than we  do. Let's come together, find our common ground, but let's not just say  let the children pay the price because we want to have a bipartisan  bill.   No, we don't want the children to pay the price so we can have a  bipartisan bill. We want to have a bipartisan bill that supports the  children. I feel confident that we can do that.   But we can't do that if we take the path of least resistance and just  say let's do whatever they put forth. That is doing their bill. That is  not doing the people's work.   So, again, over 200,000 people, we know 207,000 people have already  died, more than 7 million affected. A million people in the world have  died.   We have legislation because of Chairwoman Lowey's expertise, respect  in the world. We have provisions in the bill that affect our  relationship in terms of how we fight the COVID virus globally, because  none of us is safe unless we make sure that all of us are safe.   So I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation. It goes a long way to  doing what we need to do. It sets an example that, as I say, we cut a  lot out by just cutting the time on it. Pretty soon, we will have to  have legislation again. That will be probably next year. And this  legislation goes to early next year rather than later next year, but  the timing is really important to do it now. It is long overdue. It is  what this country needs.   And, again, I say thank you to our heroes. We thank you by making  sure you have the job, the benefits, and the rest that you have earned,  and by not just giving you empty gratitude but the gratitude of  supporting you and the important roles that you play in our lives with  assurance that you will have your job as you risk your lives to save  lives.                                time  1815    Your children will be able to go to school safely whether it is  virtual, actual, or a hybrid, and when they do  [[Page H5427]]  that, they will do so in a way that we have enabled, because education  has some funds in here, but without State and local, the education  function cannot be borne out to its fullest extent.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the distinguished chairwoman for yielding  me the time. I have great excitement because of the work of our chairs  about the quality of this legislation and the necessity that we come as  close to it in a negotiation for the children.
