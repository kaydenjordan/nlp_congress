 Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with my  colleagues Senator Whitehouse, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Murphy,  legislation to designate river segments within the Wood-Pawcatuck  watershed as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.   Following more than three years of intense study, this legislation  would formally recognize the recreational, natural, and historical  qualities of portions of the Beaver, Chipuxet, Green Fall-Ashaway,  Pawcatuck, Queen-Usquepaugh, Shunock, and Wood Rivers in Rhode Island  and Connecticut while providing access to Federal resources and  promoting strong partnerships for their restoration and protection.   The Wood-Pawcatuck watershed is a national treasure that not only  holds natural and scenic value, but is also an important economic  driver for the area. Indeed, the twelve local river communities  experience direct economic benefits from their proximity to these  rivers through increased recreation and tourism. The watershed provides  a range of opportunities for visitors, from viewing early industrial  mill ruins, to trout fishing, to bird watching, to kayaking.   I have long been a supporter of protecting and restoring these  rivers, which is why I sponsored the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed  Protection Act in 2013. The study that was initiated by that  legislation has been a critical tool for bringing together stakeholders  from Rhode Island and Connecticut including representatives from State  agencies, local governments, and conservation groups in order to  develop a collaborative path forward. The resulting stewardship plan,  which was formally adopted by the study committee and supported by all  twelve local river communities, builds upon currently existing efforts  to preserve and manage the river ecosystems while also considering what  steps will need to be taken collectively in the future to protect them.   I would like to commend Representatives Langevin, Cicilline, and  Courtney for introducing companion legislation. It is particularly  fitting this week, as we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the  landmark Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, that we are continuing our work to  protect these special places. I look forward to working with all of my  colleagues to pass this legislation so that we can preserve the rivers  of the Wood-Pawcatuck watershed for the enjoyment of future  generations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with my  colleagues Senator Whitehouse, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator Murphy,  legislation to designate river segments within the Wood-Pawcatuck  watershed as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
