 Madam Speaker, April is Limb Loss and Limb Difference  Awareness Month. More than 2 million Americans live with limb loss or  limb difference, and an additional 28 million are at risk of amputation  surgery. It is estimated that more than 500 Americans lose a limb each  day. With great advances in prosthetics, sometimes we may not even know  that those around us may be missing a limb.   There are many causes of limb loss, some not immediately apparent to  us, including, number one, vascular disease, 54 percent of which  includes diabetes.   Americans of all ages, from children to our seniors, are affected.  Eighty-eight percent are over 45 years old. Of course, many of our  brave servicemembers suffer injuries resulting in limb loss, over 1,500  currently from Iraq and Afghanistan.   Each of these Americans has their own story and faces unique  challenges. Many amputations result from some preventable disease and  have preventable issues, such as diabetes and peripheral vascular  disease. This is another reason to raise awareness of limb loss and  educate ourselves and others about what it is like to live with limb  loss and limb difference.                            ____________________
