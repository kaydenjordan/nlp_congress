 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act.   The Department of Education's decision to block funding for hunting  and archery education under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  eliminates valuable opportunities for students to participate in safe  and responsible firearm handling, recreational shooting sports, and  outdoor recreational activities.   School programs such as hunting and archery have enjoyed longstanding  bipartisan support, and for good reason. The National Archery in the  Schools Program has served over 18 million students since 2002. Forty  percent of these students claim to be more engaged in the classroom,  and a remarkable 91 percent pursue, or express their desire to pursue,  other outdoor activities.   Hunting and archery programs provide more than dexterity and mental  skills. They foster character development, a sense of responsibility,  and a profound connection with the natural beauty of our Nation.   In Utah, hundreds of thousands of Utahns spend quality time with  their family, friends, and neighbors during the hunting season.  Additionally, these sports provide 13,000 jobs and generate $550  million for the Beehive State's economy annually.   There is a bipartisan consensus that students should be able to  receive safe, responsible hunting and archery education.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support H.R.  5110, bipartisan legislation to stand behind student hunters and  archers, and ensure these programs are preserved for future generations  of Americans to use these recreational tools safely.
