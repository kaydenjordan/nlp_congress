 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use leader  time.    Thank you, Madam President.   Before I get into the substance of my remarks, I always listen  diligently to my friend from Kentucky. There is a number that is  missing in his charts; it is 1.5 trillion. The reason we don't like  government spending is--he thinks--a lot of it is wasteful, but,  ultimately, the reason is also that there is a huge deficit.   Our side scratches our heads not only with our friend from Kentucky,  but with everyone on the other side who rails about too much government  spending and creation of the deficit when they created the deepest hole  they could have with the tax break that could have been paid for by  closing loopholes. A group--a bipartisan group--had put something  together that would have reduced the corporate rate to 25 percent,  brought the money from overseas at 8, 9 percent, increased the child  tax credit, left the individual side alone, and would have barely  increased the deficit. So our side, at least, rankles when we hear  these budgets that relate to deficit spending when, on the tax side,  that doesn't seem to apply at all.   I say that with due respect to my good friend, who I know is sincere  in his beliefs. He will argue with me that cutting taxes increases the  economy. I would say that spending money on education and  infrastructure also increases the economy. It is a slippery slope once  you say: We can cut all the taxes we want; the deficit doesn't matter.  It would be like our side saying: You can spend all the money you want;  the deficit doesn't matter. We don't quite say that.   I thank my friend.                                Net Neutrality    Madam President, yesterday was a good day for the future of the  internet. Democrats forced the Senate to take an important step closer  to restoring net neutrality. It is another step closer to ensuring that  large internet service providers don't get to hold all the cards,  another step closer to protecting equality of access to the internet.  In doing so, Senate Democrats stood with the 86 percent of Americans  who oppose the repeal of net neutrality.   I am proud to say that Senator Markey's Congressional Review Act  resolution passed yesterday afternoon with the votes of every single  Democrat, as well as three of our Republican colleagues. I thank  Senators Collins, Murkowski, and Kennedy for supporting this fine  legislation.   Here is what my friend the Republican Senator from Louisiana had to  say after the vote:         If you trust your cable company, you won't like my vote. If       you don't trust your cable company, you will like my vote.    He is right. It is that simple. So you have to wonder why 47  Republicans voted no yesterday. Do they trust the cable companies and  the large ISPs to do what is level best for the average American  family? Do they believe that cable companies are really popular with  the American people? I don't think so.   Now Republicans in the House have to take up this bipartisan  resolution. We hope they will.   This isn't some partisan stunt. Absolutely not. It is a real,  bipartisan effort to right the FCC's wrong and protect the free and  open internet. It is very crucial to the future of the country.   House Republicans don't have to choose the same path that the vast  majority of Republicans in the Senate decided to follow. Speaker Ryan  should bring this up for a vote immediately. The American people have  spoken. The Senate has spoken. Speaker Ryan should listen and bring the  net neutrality CRA to the floor of the House.                             Russia Investigation    Madam President, 1 year ago, former FBI Director Robert Mueller was  appointed to lead the FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in  the 2016 election. Of course, the investigation began long before that.  According to the New York Times, it began in the middle of 2016 as a  result of information we received from the Australian Ambassador, who  told the FBI that Russian intelligence was working to share information  with the Trump campaign.   At that time, we heard a lot about the FBI's investigation of Hillary  Clinton's emails, but remarkably, we heard nothing about this other  investigation. Now we know that one of those two investigations is much  more serious than the other one was. We also know that if it were a  witch hunt--as the President seems to think it is--if they were out to  get him, they certainly would have leaked information about that during  the election campaign. They didn't.   The probe led by Special Counsel Mueller, a Republican and decorated  marine veteran, concerns the campaign of a hostile foreign power to  interfere in and influence the outcome of an American election. There  is nothing--nothing--more serious to the integrity of a democracy than  the guarantee of free and fair elections.   The Founding Fathers warned about foreign interference. When I used  to read that clause in high school, I said: What do they mean? That is  not going to happen. Well, they were a lot smarter than we are--as  always. They knew this danger. Here it is, 2018, and we see how real it  is. It is the core of the special counsel's investigation.   The investigation has already yielded multiple indictments and guilty  pleas. Yesterday the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a bipartisan  manner, confirmed that Russia sought to interfere with our elections,  sow discord, and tip the scales toward Donald Trump and against  Secretary Clinton. The Trump administration itself has even taken  punitive action against Russia's actors named in Mueller's  investigation.   I salute the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, the Republican  Senator from North Carolina, for being straightforward about this. Not  so many on the other side of the aisle are.   Yet, again this morning, President Trump called the investigation a  ``disgusting, illegal, and unwarranted witch hunt . . . the greatest  witch hunt in American history.'' The rhetoric this man uses is  amazing.   I say to the President: It is not a witch hunt when 17 Russians have  been indicted. It is not a witch hunt when some of the most senior  members of the Trump campaign have been indicted. It is not a witch  hunt when Democrats and Republicans agree with the intelligence  community that Russia interfered in our election to aid President  Trump.   Any fair-minded citizen, even the most ardent partisan, should be  able to look at the facts and say that this investigation is not a  witch hunt. The FBI Director, Christopher Wray, appointed by President  Trump, a Republican, said as much yesterday.   Truly, we should all be aghast, on this 1-year anniversary of  Mueller's appointment, at the smear campaign by the President and his  allies. We should all be aghast at the relentless parade of  conspiracies manufactured by the most extreme elements of the  Republican Party and conservative media to distract from the special  counsel's investigation. From ``deep state'' leaks to unmasking  requests, phone taps at Trump Tower, Uranium One, Nunes's midnight run  to the White House, and the Nunes memo--these are all attempts to  derail a legitimate and important investigation.  [[Page S2742]]    Now House conservatives are badgering DOJ officials for classified  documents, hunting desperately for any scrap of information that would  help them sully the investigation. By the way, for all of their ranting  and raving and interfering, they don't have a scintilla of evidence to  support that this is a witch hunt, that this is unfair, or that this is  politically motivated.   The President and his allies don't quit with all these conspiracy  theories, with all these ridiculous fomentations. Frankly, it is  because they are afraid of what Mueller's investigation will reveal.   Every American who looks at the President's actions says that he is  afraid of what the Mueller investigation will reveal. Yet the volume of  mistruth, the weight of all the distortion and fabrication is hurting  our democracy.   The double standard is enormous. The Times article shows no leaks  when Trump was under investigation during the campaign; obviously, it  was made public when Hillary Clinton was. Again, if this were a witch  hunt, why didn't the FBI, which the President seems to feel is  politically motivated with no scintilla of proof--why wouldn't they  leak it?   One more point before I leave the floor--yesterday, the words of  former Secretary Tillerson were these: ``If our leaders seek to conceal  the truth or we as a people become accepting of alternative realities  that are no longer grounded in facts, then we as American citizens are  on the pathway to relinquishing our freedom.''   He is exactly right. When distortion, lies, and intimidation come  repeatedly from the other side and some conservative news media, and  that becomes the accepted way, when it is just he said, she said, where  one side is blatantly lying, and that becomes accepted, our democracy  is at risk.   We are a beautiful thing here--founded on facts, real facts. What we  have seen from the President and some of his allies, the way they are  behaving, makes you worry about the future of this democracy.   Ultimately, I have a firm belief that they will not succeed. The  Founding Fathers were geniuses--geniuses--when they set up a system of  checks and balances that we read about in our classes and we study, but  it is almost mystical. It always rises to the occasion. It will again,  despite the efforts of the President, despite the efforts of some of  his allies who have gone way overboard; I might mention Chairman Nunes  on the other side. I believe the checks and balances of this country  will hold, and we will eventually find out the truth, no matter where  it leads.   Today is a good day to remember that the special counsel's  investigation is serious, it is nonpartisan, and it is critical to the  integrity of our democracy. We must allow it to proceed without  political interference, without intimidation, to follow all the facts  in pursuit of the unvarnished truth on such an important issue.   I yield the floor.
