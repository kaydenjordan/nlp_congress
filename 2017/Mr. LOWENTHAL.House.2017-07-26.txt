 Mr. Speaker, ``irresponsible, reckless, duplicitous,''  all words used to describe Iran during the JCPOA negotiations.   Soon, if this administration abrogates the JCPOA, those words would  apply to us: ``irresponsible'' for shredding an agreement that makes  the world a safer place, ``reckless'' in giving Iran an excuse to  immediately restart the nuclear program, and ``duplicitous'' in  breaking an international agreement for no legitimate reason but to  fulfill a campaign promise.   Make no mistake, Iran is still a bad actor. It destabilizes the  region. It funds terrorist activities. That is why we voted to increase  nonnuclear sanctions on Iran yesterday. But the Iran nuclear agreement  is being adhered to, and it is working.   Under this administration, are we, as a nation, no longer as good as  our word?                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, my district is a poster child for the  need for ocean coordination and information sharing. In my district, we  have the busiest port complex in North America, we have offshore  drilling, we have San Clemente Island, which is a naval training ground  where they have a ship-to-shore firing range. We have abundant wildlife  in the district. On top of that, sea level rise and extreme weather  threatens neighborhoods and businesses all along the coast of my  district.   With so much activity happening, it simply makes sense to have the  various stakeholders at the table, to make sure ships come in and out  of port safely, to ensure that our thriving economy stays thriving, and  to give the military space to train. We want these collaborations to  happen because we want to have a sustainable ocean economy.   By developing regional plans and having a framework for multi- stakeholder involvement, we can promote a robust ocean economy that  also conserves our precious ocean resources. The country and my  district needs a comprehensive approach to our ocean resources, which  the National Ocean Policy provides.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.
