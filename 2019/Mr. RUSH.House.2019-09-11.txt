 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address how racially  discriminatory housing policy has contributed to the unjust racial  wealth gap in our Nation.   Currently, Madam Speaker, 72 percent of White households own their  own homes, while just 41 percent of Black households do. The roots of  this disparity can be traced to the discriminatory practices  implemented by the Federal Housing Authority, which resulted in only 2  percent of federally backed loans being issued to African Americans  between 1934 and 1968. This was a supra-classic form of kinematic,  organic, and institutional racism.   The ongoing ramifications of this most insidious example of  discrimination continue to be felt acutely by people like many of my  constituents. A recent study by Duke University found that the systemic  denial of federally guaranteed loans led to the widespread use of  predatory home sale contracts in Chicago's Black communities.   These contracts, Madam Speaker, led to a situation where Black home  buyers paid, on average, over $71,000 more--I repeat, Madam Speaker,  over $71,000--for their homes than White homeowners who had unfiltered  access to federally backed loans.   In total, Madam Speaker, redlining, the practice of rating  predominantly Black neighborhoods as ``high risk'' for traditional  mortgage lenders, stole $3.2 million--this is by conservative  estimates, $3.2 million--stole up to $3.2 million from Chicago's Black  families.   This is just one example of how homeownership, a pillar of the  American Dream, has been placed out of reach of far too many Americans  due solely to the color of their skin. It is incumbent, Madam Speaker,  upon all of us to make this American Dream equally available to all,  regardless of their skin color and regardless of their ZIP Code.   Fortunately, Madam Speaker, there are steps that this Congress can  take to support Black American homeownership. For example, as the Urban  Institute notes, factoring rental payment history into credit-scoring  models could increase financial opportunities for Black home buyers.   Passing the Home Loan Quality Transparency Act, a bill I am proud to  cosponsor, will restore a critical provision of Dodd-Frank, requiring  mortgage lenders to report crucial details about their borrowers,  including credit scores, racial and ethnic breakdowns, and other data.   Madam Speaker, $3.2 million stolen.                            ____________________
