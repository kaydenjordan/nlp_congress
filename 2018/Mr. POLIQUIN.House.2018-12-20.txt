 Mr. Speaker, I don't quite understand what the other  side is saying today, talking about politics and being irresponsible  and not compassionate. Are you kidding me?   Here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate we take an  oath to support and defend our Constitution. That means keeping our  families safe. There is no more important responsibility, nothing more  important than keeping our families safe. That means rebuilding our  military, and, yes, it also means securing our borders and knowing who  is entering our country.   I don't know why it is so hard to make a distinction between what is  legal and what is illegal entry. I come from Maine. We have a 600-mile  border with Canada. They are great neighbors. But I feel for the people  down in the southwest part of our country. It is common sense to secure  our borders, know who is entering our country.   I will tell you, my heart goes out to these folks who have made their  way from Central America to the other side of the border fence with  Texas, in Mexico, wanting to come in here. But we don't know who they  are, beyond the fact that we do know, according to Homeland Security,  there are 600 folks who have criminal backgrounds.   These folks have been offered asylum and work permits by the country  of Mexico--every single one of them--and they have refused. Now they  want to enter our country. Fine, but they have got to do it legally.   In rural Maine, we have been hard-hit by the opioid epidemic. There  is nothing more difficult than this issue in rural America. Eighty  percent of this terrible, cheap heroin--deadly heroin--which is a  substitute for the opioid pills comes over that southwest border.   The House should pass this bill and secure our borders. It is common  sense. The best Christmas gift for America is securing our borders, and  I support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, during this joyful time of year, I would  like to give thanks for the improving health of my great State of  Maine.   Because we have cut taxes and regulations, our small businesses are  growing and hiring more workers and paying them more. Maine's 2.7  percent unemployment is the lowest rate in 50 years.   We are rebuilding our military to keep our families safe, while  supporting 6,000 shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works.   We have passed legislation that guts online human trafficking, which  protects our daughters and our sons.   We have made the biggest financial commitment ever to combat the  opioid epidemic, giving thousands of struggling Mainers hope for  recovery and better lives.   Child poverty in Maine is dropping, while education is closer to  home, where it belongs.   We have strengthened Social Security and Medicare so our seniors have  more peace of mind.   Our veterans, our beloved veterans, are now able to receive their  healthcare closer to home, and our small hospitals that provide those  services must get paid on time; otherwise, interest accrues on the  outstanding bills.   And Maine's pristine natural environment is living up to our brand:  Vacationland. The way life should be.   Mr. Speaker, Maine families are doing better and better, and I am  grateful to have the opportunity to help.   Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all, and may God always bless  the United States of America and our great State of Maine.                            ____________________
