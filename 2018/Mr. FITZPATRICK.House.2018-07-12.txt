 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and the  memory of an extraordinary individual from Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  Carl Wallnau of Newtown passed away on June 29 at the age of 99.   A man of many talents, Carl paid for his education by playing trumpet  in a jazz ensemble. He later served in World War II under General  Patton, retiring from the Air Force with the rank of major in 1979.   After his service, Carl began a successful career as a lawyer and as  an engineer, eventually becoming acting CEO of Swan Oil Company.   Despite his success, Carl always made time to give back to our  community, serving on many charitable boards, including those of the  Bucks County Industrial Development Corporation, the Bucks County  Chamber of Commerce, the Delaware Valley Philharmonic, the Red Cross,  and the United Way of Bucks County.   Mr. Speaker, we send our condolences to Carl's children, Carl, Lance,  Kurt, and Joyce, along with the rest of his family. We thank them for  sharing him with our community.              Recognizing the Northampton Patriots Flag Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Northampton  Patriots Flag Program, a longstanding tradition of Northampton Township  in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   The Northampton Patriots Flag Program, established in 2003, honors  Northampton residents who have served in the Armed Forces, recognizing  their deployment and their return home to Bucks County. While these  heroes are serving, a flag signifying their military branch is hung  within the administration building of Northampton Township. Upon their  return, it is replaced with an American flag.   This program recently recognized Austin Fizel, a Southampton resident  who currently serves in the Air Force and who is stationed in the  United Arab Emirates. We would like to extend our gratitude to Austin  for his service and would like to recognize his  [[Page H6117]]  parents, George and Marie, along with his siblings, Derek, Kyle, and  Meredith, who all attended the ceremony.   I would also like to thank a local hero who helps run the Northampton  Patriots Flag Program, Pete Palestina, along with Northampton Township  Chairman Barry Moore, for their work in recognizing our community's  bravest citizens.               Recognizing Patrol Officers of Lansdale Borough     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three of the  newest additions to the Lansdale Police Department in Montgomery  County, Pennsylvania, who will serve as full-time patrol officers.   James McVeigh, who studied at Upper Perkiomen High School and Lock  Haven University, graduated from the Montgomery County Police Academy  in 2008. Before joining the Lansdale force, Officer McVeigh served with  the Upper Perkiomen Police Department for 10 years and is now joining  Lansdale.   Christian Gregory is a graduate of my alma mater, LaSalle University,  and the Philadelphia Police Academy. Before joining the Lansdale force,  Officer Gregory served with the SEPTA Transit Police Department.   Corey Pfister is a graduate of the Souderton Area High School,  Gwynedd Mercy University, and the Montgomery County Police Academy.  Before joining the Lansdale force, Officer Pfister served with the  Pottstown Borough Police Department.   Mr. Speaker, I commend these officers for their bravery and their  service to our community, and we wish them well in this new chapter of  their careers. I would also like to recognize Police Chief Mike Trail  for leading such a fine group of law enforcement professionals in our  community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today in memory of Ensign Sarah Mitchell, a naval officer serving on  Active Duty who passed away on July 8 due to injuries sustained in a  training accident in Aqaba, Jordan.   Sarah was raised in Feasterville, Pennsylvania, and attended Lower  Southampton Elementary School and Poquessing Middle School before  attending Neshaminy High School in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   While at Neshaminy, Sarah excelled in the classroom, as well as being  a member of the school's field hockey team, basketball team, and track  and field team.   Lisa Pennington, Sarah's field hockey coach, described her as the  person you would always remember as smiling and working hard to be  successful.   Upon graduation from Neshaminy High School, Sarah attended and  graduated from Virginia Tech University, where she was a member of the  Corps of Cadets.   Regarded as an exceptional student athlete and member of our  community, Sarah's decision to serve our Nation came as no surprise to  those who knew her best.   Her longtime friend Emily Curtin had these amazing words about Sarah  in our local paper, the Bucks County Courier Times: ``She was fearless  in the pursuit of everything she wanted, never settling for less. Sarah  never left anyone behind. Sarah's loyalty to her family, fiance,  friends, and country was undeniable. She carried the burdens of others  and helped every person'' she encountered who was in need.   Mr. Speaker, may all of us use the legacy Sarah left us as a guide to  live in a way that exemplifies patriotism and courage.   We send our deepest condolences to Sarah's fiance, Dave Collins; her  parents, Jack and Betsy; her siblings, Kevin, Kristy, John, and  Jillian.   Mr. Speaker, I ask our colleagues to join us in a moment of silence  for Ensign Sarah Mitchell, an American hero.                            ____________________
