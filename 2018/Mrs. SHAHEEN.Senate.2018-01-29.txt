 Madam President, I join my colleagues on the floor  today to speak in opposition to the pending legislation to outlaw  abortion procedures after 20 weeks.   This is yet another extreme effort to allow the government to  interfere in the healthcare decisions that should be strictly between a  woman and her family and her physician. This latest attempt is  particularly dangerous. It would impose prison sentences of up to 5  years on physicians who don't fulfill the law's deliberately burdensome  requirements for documentation and reporting, and it would even impose  a prison sentence of up to 5 years on doctors who fail to inform a law  enforcement agency about another doctor who fails to meet the law's  requirements. Viewed more broadly, this bill is part of a continuing  campaign to take away women's constitutional right to privacy--a right  that protects profoundly personal decisions concerning our bodies and  our families.    I remember very well the days prior to 1973, when abortion was  outlawed in most States. An estimated 1.2 million women each year  resorted to illegal abortions, typically performed in unsanitary  conditions by unlicensed practitioners and often resulting in  infection, hemorrhage, and even death. Well, I think women remember  those days, and we are not going back.   As Governor of New Hampshire in 1997, I signed into law a bill that  repealed our State's archaic law that dated back to 1848 and made  abortion a felony. Like that 1848 law, the legislation now before the  Senate would also threaten physicians with criminal charges and  imprisonment.   Abortion later in pregnancy is extremely rare. Indeed, almost 99  percent of abortions occur before 21 weeks. When an abortion is needed  later in pregnancy, it typically involves very complex, life- threatening, and heartbreaking circumstances--for example, the  discovery of a severe and likely fatal abnormality, as described by  Senator Hirono. In these difficult circumstances, a woman consults with  her doctor and with other people she trusts. A woman needs the freedom  to consider every medical option, including serious risks to her own  life.   The extremely narrow exceptions in the bill before us--exceptions if  the pregnancy results from rape or incest--are deliberately designed to  impose burdens, complications, and shame on women who have chosen to  terminate a pregnancy. The victim must provide written verification  that she has obtained counseling or medical treatment from a very  specific list of ``medical providers'' who do not provide abortions and  who are often strongly anti-abortion. This requirement is a completely  unnecessary burden on a woman who is already dealing with a crisis. It  is also insulting and condescending to all women. We are not children  who need guidance from an adult. We can consult those we choose to  consult, and we can make our own decisions. To impose this requirement  in this crude manner is something right out of a handmaid's tale.   Then, if the rape victim is a minor, she is allowed access to an  abortion only if she can provide proof that she reported the crime to  law enforcement. Again, this is completely out of touch with the real  world. Only a small percentage of sexual assaults and rapes are  reported to police. Nearly 80 percent of rape and sexual assault  victims know their offender.   So let's say this plainly. The reporting requirements in this bill  are an outrageous attempt to judge and shame women and girls who have  been victims of a violent crime.   I heard from Rachel, who is a registered, board-certified nurse in  New Hampshire. She told me that bills to impose blanket rules and  arbitrary limitations--bills like the one before the Senate today--are  out of touch with the reality she sees in her practice every day.  Rachel said:         While procedures at 20 weeks and beyond certainly comprised       a small portion of the  [[Page S536]]       care we provided, it was absolutely critical for those that       needed it. Many pregnancies are not surveyed with ultrasound       until 19-20 weeks, at which time previously unforeseen       complications can be detected. Then, there are often further       procedures needed to finalize a diagnosis and a prognosis.       For people who receive devastating news about a pregnancy       after 20 weeks, abortion may be the best option, and they       deserve access to that care.    The American Medical Association opposes this bill. The AMA says: We  ``strongly condemn any interference by the government or other third  parties that causes a physician to compromise his or her medical  judgment as to what information or treatment is in the best interest of  the patient.''   I urge my colleagues to respect the women of this country and their  right to make their own healthcare decisions without the unwelcome  involvement of politicians and law enforcement agencies. Let's reject  this partisan, extreme, and, frankly, unnecessary legislation today.  Then, let's focus our bipartisan attention on the urgent business of  passing a budget, funding our military, combating the opioid crisis,  and the other needs that this country faces.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor to pay  tribute to George Twigg III, a long-time Granite Stater and former New  Hampshire State representative, who passed away last month at the age  of 85. Though he was raised in Massachusetts and retired to Maine,  George was in many ways a quintessential Granite Stater, with a big  personality, a great sense of humor, and a lifetime passion for  politics and public engagement.   After graduating from Boston University, he served 2 years in the  U.S. Navy and later worked as a marketing representative for General  Electric and other Fortune 500 companies. In 1968, he left his  corporate career behind and moved to Gilmanton, NH, where he became a  proud jack-of-many-trades, working in real estate sales, auctioneering,  and appraising. George also worked as a justice of the peace,  officiating at hundreds of weddings. He once married the same couple  twice, though he felt obliged to warn them that, if they divorced again  and later decided to marry for a third time, they would have to find  someone else to officiate at the wedding.   Throughout his adult life, George was active in politics and public  service and gave generously of his time as a volunteer in many  different capacities. A lifelong Republican, he shared many Granite  Staters' fiscal conservatism and distaste for taxes. Indeed, in one  campaign for election to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, he  crisscrossed his district in a snowplow painted with the message ``No  Tax Snow Jobs.'' While always true to his conservative convictions,  George was a practitioner of the New Hampshire way in politics, always  ready to reach across the aisle in order to advance the best interests  of our State. In 1974, then-Governor Meldrim Thomson asked him to chair  New Hampshire's eminent domain commission. He went on to serve 21 years  on the board of tax and land appeals.   George was a man of exceptional generosity. In 2014, he sold more  than 85 acres of scenic land in Gilmanton at a price below fair-market  value on the condition that it be preserved as open space for future  generations to enjoy. He was equally generous in giving his time and  talents to a wide range of volunteer activities. For decades, he  refereed high school and college basketball games. He served on  numerous town and county committees and volunteered his considerable  skills as an auctioneer for countless charity auctions, including  fundraisers for New Hampshire's public television station.   The Granite State, and the Gilmanton community in particular, are  grateful for his many gifts and acts of selfless service. Family and  friends hope to gather for a memorial service later this year. I will  be with them in spirit as they celebrate the life of this good and  generous man.                            ____________________
