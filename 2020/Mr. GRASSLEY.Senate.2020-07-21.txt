 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement entered into force on  July 1, and I am eager to see the modernized agreement deliver on its  promises to spur job growth for American farmers, workers, and  businesses, and even help our innovators. Also, at the same time, it  will create new opportunities with our North American trading partners.   The U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement fixes many problems we had for 30  years under NAFTA, and it also creates several new, modern trade  provisions for our 21st century economy--things that were negotiated  that weren't even thought of 30 years ago when NAFTA was negotiated.  However, even with this agreement going into effect and being a tough  agreement to negotiate, it isn't going to be simple from here on out.  There is plenty of work remaining to ensure the agreement is  implemented fully and properly.   I urge the administration to be expeditious in addressing any  enforcement issues or noncompliance from our trading partners under the  dispute settlement mechanism. I also encourage close consultation  between Congress and the administration so we may continue to be  successful in the U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement implementation efforts-- allowing Americans to reap the benefits of this agreement.   I raised questions with the administration, but I have no doubt that  they are going to be on top of it. I remember President Trump as a  candidate, 2015 to 2016, running on a platform to get rid of NAFTA.  Trump was elected. By May of his first year in office, Trump started  negotiations. They were successful negotiations. NAFTA is now gone. Now  USMCA is going into effect.   Trump delivered on his campaign promise. I have no doubt that he will  see that the U.S-Mexico-Canada Agreement is properly implemented.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
