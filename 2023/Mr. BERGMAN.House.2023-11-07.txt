 Mr. Speaker, I am reminded of Proverbs 18:21, which  says: ``Words kill, words give life; they're either poison or fruit-- you choose.''   I take no joy in standing here today to censure a fellow Michigan  Representative, but Congresswoman Tlaib's words and actions are  abhorrent and beneath her office.   Representative Tlaib has tripled-down on her anti-Semitic and anti- Israel rhetoric, recently posting a video with protesters chanting,  ``from the river to the sea,'' with a follow-up comment explaining that  that phrase is a peaceful aphorism about human rights.   However, that quote has long been a rallying cry for supporters of  Hamas and other terrorists hell-bent on destroying Israel. ``From the  river to the sea'' refers to the area, of course, between the Jordan  River and the Mediterranean Sea, which is the State of Israel.   Jewish Americans are being targeted in their schools and on our  Nation's streets. Just yesterday, a California man supporting Israel  was murdered during competing pro-Israel, pro-Palestinian rallies.   Words matter and words have real-world implications. Congresswoman  Tlaib's continued assault on the only Jewish state in the world,  Israel, is reprehensible and this body should come together to support  this censure resolution to say to Representative Tlaib: Enough.
