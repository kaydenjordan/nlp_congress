 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is Wednesday. Now, normally it is  Thursday when I come down here to talk about somebody who is making a  huge difference in my State, somebody we refer to as the Alaskan of the  Week, someone who is doing something for the community or the State or  the country or maybe all of the above. I know we have a new set of  pages, but I think it is commonly known that this is the most  anticipated speech of the week by the pages. I see the heads nodding,  so that is great.   You guys are learning well, early, so that is wonderful, and I know  that the Presiding Officer really enjoys it as well.   I am going to talk today about Calvin Williams, whom everybody in  Alaska knows as Cal, who is our Alaskan of the Week, who lives in  Anchorage via Louisiana. I am going to talk a lot about Cal here and  why he certainly deserves this great honor, but also when I give these  remarks, I like to talk just a little bit about what is going on in  Alaska at the time.   We have just celebrated the summer solstice, which in a lot of States  isn't a big deal, but in Alaska, it is actually a huge deal. It is the  longest day of the year, which was last week, and that really means  something. You get the 12 midnight Sun energy, and everybody is out.  There are celebrations throughout the State. Friends and neighbors  gather at parties and community events well past 12 midnight. I had the  opportunity to spend last weekend in Fairbanks, AK, where there was a  12 midnight Sun baseball game and a 12 midnight Sun 10K run. I got to  participate in some of that. There was just great energy and a great  feeling and a lot of sunlight all night.   Across the country and in Alaska, we also just celebrated Juneteenth,  which marks the anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Anchorage  celebrated the weekend before last, and Cal Williams, our Alaskan of  the Week, was there, as he has been there nearly every year since the  first celebration in the 1980s. Cal is a staple at that event and has  been at so many other events in Alaska over the decades where people  get together, where he has been a community leader and has tried to do  good things for our communities throughout the State. So let me tell  you a little bit about Cal and how lucky we are to have him in the  great State of Alaska.   He was born in 1941 in Monroe, LA. I know we have some Louisianans as  pages here. That was the segregated South, and he was born 7 days  before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He is from a very patriotic  family. His parents immediately joined the cause of fighting and  supporting our Nation during World War II. His mother worked in the  factories to help out the war effort, and his father joined the Army  and was sent to the Pacific theater to defend America.   Basically, Cal was raised by his grandmother, who happened to live  across the street from church and a K-12 Catholic school, built and run  by the Franciscans to serve the African-American Catholic community in  the area. Nobody in his family was Catholic, but it was the best school  in the area, so that was where he went. The lessons he was taught at  this school, the Little Flower Academy--to serve the less fortunate, to  feed the hungry, to help all in need--have stayed with Cal forever and  have really driven his sense of service.   The much beloved Sister Consuela, who was the longtime principal and  homeroom teacher, made sure that he learned all this.         Sister Consuela was feared and respected. If you did       anything bad, if the Sister didn't see you [do something       bad], you knew that God did. I carry that with me today.    After high school, he attended Grambling State University--another  all-Black school--where he pursued theater and singing. Anybody who  knows Cal knows this is another thing that has stayed with him  throughout his life.   Then, like his patriotic mom and dad, he decided to enlist in the Air  Force. He was stationed at Vandenberg Air Force Base, where he worked  on the Titan II Missile System--an elite position, something that he  credits to the schooling he received at Little Flower.   When he got out of the Air Force, he made it back to Louisiana to  take care of his father, who had gotten sick. This was during the  height of the movement for civil rights--one of the greatest movements,  of course, in our Nation's history, a lot of which took place here on  this Senate floor. As he often does, Cal jumped in. He jumped in with  both feet. He began working with CORE, the Congress of Racial  Equality--one of the leading civil rights organizations in the early  years of the civil rights movement. He and six other students were the  first Black students to proudly integrate what was then called  Northeast Louisiana State College.   Eventually, a friend who had moved to Alaska talked him into coming  up to our great State. This was in 1965. Cal brought all of his  intelligence, his theatrical and musical talents, his abiding deep  faith, his fun, and his deep commitment to civil rights and community  service to our State in 1965.   In some ways, it was a good time to be an activist in Alaska. Our  State certainly isn't perfect. It is a State, though, that is very  committed to equal rights and justice for all. Yet, just like  everywhere in the country, we had our problems, and we had our  challenges. As I mentioned, we certainly were not perfect in that  realm, so Cal had work to do.   Initially, he was a dishwasher in the hospital by day and was a  community activist by night. He helped to lobby the mayor's office in  Anchorage to get paved roads and to bring electricity to predominantly  African-American neighborhoods. He also helped bring people into the  voting booths, which was so important.   The same friend who brought him to Alaska, Charles LeViege, started a  newspaper that focused on the African-American community. He joined  with the Alaska Native leadership to lobby for the landmark legislation  that, again, took place on the Senate floor, here, in 1971--the Alaska  Native Claims Settlement Act. He became the president of the Anchorage  chapter of the NAACP, of which he is still a vice president to this  very day.   I have only gotten to 1971, and you can see how much he has done.   In the 1970s, he had a little sojourn in Hollywood to fulfill a  lifelong dream of being in the movies. He was. He got some gigs--a spot  in a film with Angie Dickinson. The pages don't know who she is, but  she was a great actress.   But like some people who leave Alaska, he missed it too much, so he  decided to come back, and he did.  [[Page S4547]]    So over the years since he has been back, he has helped raise funds  for an African-American economic development venture. The group built a  building in the Fairview community of Anchorage, which is still there  today. They had a social club on the top sponsored by the Alaska Black  Caucus--a place to meet with executives and bank officers in a nice  setting, community leaders.   He worked in television. He worked for the Alaska Housing Finance  Corporation, which has been key to helping people get home ownership.   All through these years, he clung to his roots and his faith. He is a  member of the Knights of Columbus and a faithful parishioner at St.  Anthony's Catholic Church in Anchorage, where he is the director of the  church's Filipino gospel choir, which sounds like angels. ``When we  sing,'' he said, ``we sing for the Lord.'' And no doubt, when they  sing, the Lord is listening.   He visits prisons to read the Bible with inmates, sings every week to  the patients at Providence Extended Care and every other week to our  senior home, which we call the Pioneer Home in Alaska. The residents  there love Cal's Elvis impersonations.   If you are in Alaska and happen to be there for Christmas, you should  stop by Bean's Cafe, a place where the hungry go for a meal, and Cal  will be there every Christmas wearing a Santa cap, singing for hours  for everybody who comes in the door.   This is a gentleman who has done so much for his community and my  State, and what is he most proud of? When asked, ``My greatest  achievement was in 2017 when I received the St. Francis Stewardship  Award from the Archdiocese of Anchorage,'' Cal said.   St. Francis was the patron saint of the Little Flower Academy. ``I  have come full circle,'' he said. ``Sister Consuela would be proud of  me.'' Then he adds: ``But nothing was ever enough for her.''   It is enough for all of us, though, Cal. I thank him for all he has  done for Anchorage, for so many different communities, for Alaska, and  as an example for our country--for his generosity, kindness,  enthusiasm, faith, and faith-filled service throughout his life.   Congratulations to Cal for being our Alaskan of the Week.                          Tribute to Thomas Mansour    Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that my office is saying  goodbye to my very first Coast Guard fellow, recently promoted-- actually, promoted yesterday--to lieutenant commander, Thomas Mansour.   Thomas happens to be sitting right next to me here on the Senate  floor. Tom is from Montgomery County, MD. He graduated from Eckerd  College in St. Petersburg, FL. We were lucky to have him join my office  as a Coast Guard fellow for the last 2 years, and he has done great  work.   I am going to brag about him a little bit here on the floor. I will  probably embarrass him.   Among other things, he was instrumental in the 2018 Coast Guard  Authorization Act. The subcommittee that I chair on the Commerce,  Science, and Transportation Committee is in charge of the Coast Guard.  We were the ones drafting that. It had many provisions in it for the  whole Coast Guard, certainly many for Alaska and other parts of the  country.   He also brought his expertise to the 2017 and 2018 Homeland Security  budgets. His efforts helped secure landmark appropriations for the  first Polar Security Cutter, an icebreaker for the Coast Guard, the  first one in 40 years, and for critical infrastructure projects for the  Coast Guard around Alaska and around the rest of the country.   Probably his signature initiative--and very, very hard work--was on a  bill that we affectionately know in my office as the Save Our Seas Act,  both the first one, which our offices worked closely on with Senator  Whitehouse from Rhode Island and was signed by the President last fall  to much fanfare in the Oval Office, and our Save Our Seas Act 2.0,  which Senator Whitehouse and Senator Menendez and I rolled out in a  press conference just this morning.   SOS 2.0, as we call it, is an innovative piece of legislation that  really sets us on a promising path as a nation to tackle the serious  problem of plastics, ocean debris, and trash that enter our oceans and  harm fisheries, marine life, and possibly human life. This litter ends  up on the shores of Alaska, all around America, and threatens the  livelihoods of coastal communities throughout America.   Tom did yeoman's work to ensure that we introduced in the Senate  today a comprehensive, substantive bill that all stakeholders-- Democrats, Republicans, the Trump administration, environmental groups,  industry--are all working on together. Literally, all of the key  stakeholders on this critical issue are pulling on the same oar.   He did incredible work on this bill. He is a great team player,  someone I am proud of and we are going to miss.   Tom is getting married this summer to his fiance Meg, and they will  be entering a whole new chapter in their lives. It will be an exciting  one, I am sure. We wish them all the best.   I can't thank Tom enough for all of the work he has done for my  State, for our country, and I ask that all of my colleagues in the  Senate recognize the great work that he did. Just here on the spot, I  might even make him an honorary Alaskan of the Week for the great job  he has done.   Thank you for the opportunity to say a few words about Tom.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my Coast  Guard fellow, Thomas Mansour, be granted Senate floor privileges until  the end of the week.
