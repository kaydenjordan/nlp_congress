 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I appreciate  the passion with which the Senator from South Carolina has delivered  his remarks today. I am also grateful for his willingness to adopt a  minor modification in the savings clause, clarifying that nothing in  this legislation may be construed as independently authorizing the use  of military force against Iran or any country. It is something we  should do independently.   So I am grateful for the Senator from South Carolina's willingness to  work with me on that and that he has agreed to do it.   The junior Senator from Kentucky, Senator Paul, has suffered a death  in his family and is away today attending the funeral of that immediate  family member. At his request, I am here to object on his behalf.   On behalf of Senator Paul, I object.
