 Mr. Speaker, recently we celebrated our national  libraries. I rise today to discuss the important role they play across  many Kansas communities.   I have visited libraries throughout The Big First, stopping in  Manhattan, Salina, Dodge City, Quinter, Great Bend, and Scott City. I  recently visited the Marion City Library that was awarded the 2019  five-star honor for its welcoming facility with well-targeted programs.   Communities from Colby to Abilene have partnered with organizations  such as the Library of Congress, National Archives, and Smithsonian  Institution to shine a spotlight on the great qualities and rich  history that is unique to Kansas. These programs, run by our local  libraries, are vitally important to our small communities and reached  more than 27,000 Kansans in 2018.   I am so proud of our Kansas libraries that are constantly going above  and beyond.                            ____________________
