 Mr. President, I rise today to honor Shannon  Newton on 20 years of dedicated service to the Arkansas Trucking  Association. Shannon began her career with ATA working with the  organization's self-insurers' fund after starting in the trucking  industry at Maverick Transportation in North Little Rock. She quickly  advanced within ATA after demonstrating her talents and skills to  support and enhance the trucking industry. Since 2014, Shannon has  served as president of ATA. Under her leadership, the organization has  been tremendously strengthened and serves as a professional, organized,  and effective advocate for Natural State truckers.   The work Shannon has done on behalf of Arkansas trucking is  remarkable. Her leadership in such a critical industry has received  national recognition. Shannon was awarded the Mike Russel Trucking  Image Award from the American Trucking Association in 2017 and received  the American Trucking Associations' President's Trucking Association  Executives Council Leadership Award in 2018. The trucking industry in  Arkansas has benefited from Shannon's guidance and steady hand. She has  worked tirelessly to build coalitions, create relationships and ensure  pro-safety, pro-trucking policies are enacted at the State and national  levels.   I have worked closely with Shannon during her tenure at ATA and have  always been impressed by her passion and dedication in service to the  men, women, and industry suppliers who help keep our country moving. I  look forward to many more years of partnering to champion policies and  reforms that will improve the trucking industry in Arkansas and across  our country.                            ____________________
