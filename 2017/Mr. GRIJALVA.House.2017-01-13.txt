 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell my constituents that  I will not be attending the inauguration of Donald Trump as our next  President.   My absence is not motivated by disrespect for the office or motivated  by disrespect for the government that we have in this great democracy  but as an individual act, yes, of defiance at the disrespect shown to  millions and millions of Americans by this incoming administration and  by the actions we are taking in this Congress.   The majority of voters rejected Trump. They deserve respect. The 20  million-plus Americans threatened by the repeal of the Affordable Care  Act without a replacement deserve respect. The millions who did not  vote because they blame both parties deserve respect.   I will be at home in Arizona meeting with seniors, the immigrant  community, folks who care about the environment and climate change,  healthcare providers, and marching in Tucson with folks who will demand  respect. I will be talking about the need to defend and protect the  future for all Americans.   Rather than participate in the inauguration, I will be participating  in my district and reaffirming and renewing this democracy and the  people that are part of it.                            ____________________
