 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  impending crisis in Africa. More than 20 million people in Yemen, South  Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria face starvation and famine, according to  the U.N. Secretary-General.   At a time when the mainstream media and the Washington press corps is  obsessed with President Trump, they remain silent when there is a  mounting disaster that could make the Syrian refugee crisis look like  child's play.   All four of these countries have weak or failing governments, and  each is in the midst of a seemingly endless conflict perpetrated by  evil terrorist groups, such as Boko Haram, al Shabaab, and al-Qaida.   Pouring the billions of needed dollars into the region will help stop  the coming famine, but it will take American leadership working with  partners in the region willing to take a stand to rid their continent  of these terrorist threats.   I will continue to bring light to the imminent crisis in Africa, and  I urge my colleagues to focus on this critical issue.                            ____________________
