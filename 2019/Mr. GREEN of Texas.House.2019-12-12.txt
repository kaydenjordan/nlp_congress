 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, with love of  country at heart and my mnemonic notes in hand.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, remembering something from my childhood.  My grandfather was a minister, and he reminded the grandchildren that  there is no one so blind as he who chooses not to see. 20/20 vision,  but the person who chooses not to see is the blindest of all. No one is  so blind as those who choose not to see.   I bring this to the attention of those who are listening for a  specific reason. I cannot impose understanding. I cannot cause people  to say that they understand that which they already understand but  choose not to acknowledge.   What I can do is this: I can encourage us to open our eyes and see  what is happening to our country, the country that I assume we all  love. I encourage us to see what is happening to public discourse, to  pay attention to things that are happening in the public arena that are  greatly different than the things we have been acclimated to.   Mr. Speaker, I don't believe that we should have, in our public  discourse, the Chief Executive Officer saying things that we don't want  our children to repeat. The Chief Executive Officer is to be a leader  in many ways.   We tell our children: One day you can grow up and be the Chief  Executive Officer. You can be the head of state. And we want people to  look up to the Chief Executive Officer, to the head of state.                                time  1600    I don't think most of us would have our children go to a public rally  and engage in some of the discourse that we have seen, some of the  scatology, the profanity that seems to become a part of this discourse  and is almost commonplace now from the Chief Executive Officer.   My dear friends, there is something happening to us. While it may not  occur all in 1 day, over a period of time, it can become commonplace.   Have you not noticed how on the various talk shows people are using a  level of discourse that we would find unacceptable, that I find  unacceptable, that was not commonplace some years ago, not so very long  ago? I am hearing more profanity being used.   I am not a perfect servant. I am a public servant. I am not a perfect  person. I don't claim to be perfect. But I can say to you that I want  to live in a country where children are proud to grow up and say they  want to be like that person who happens to be the Chief Executive  Officer.   At some point, something has to say to us that something is going on  here that is unacceptable. When you weaponize hate so that you can have  an advantage, there is something wrong. We ought not weaponize hate and  bigotry to gain an advantage. We ought not try to, with intentionality,  create ashes on the dreams of others, turn them into ashes so that we  can fulfill some desire. We ought not, with intentionality, say things  that we know are not true that can be harmful to others.   I am not a perfect servant, but I see something happening to my  country, and I beg that we open our eyes and look at this for what it  is. The level of hate is increasing. The level of harm being done to  people by others that they don't know who will traverse great distances  just to hurt them because they happen to be of a certain ancestry, who  go into a certain neighborhood to hurt people because they happen to be  of a certain religion, we are seeing more of this level of hate.   I say to you that we must open our eyes and see what is happening to  our country. There is a desire to believe that this is just something  that we can laugh at, that it is just amusing. This discourse that we  see when the Chief Executive Officer has throngs of people around him  making light of things that at one time we would not tolerate.   There is something wrong when you start to tolerate this. Those who  tolerate hate perpetuate hate. We are going to be a part of the reason  why this continues to grow, to propagate, to infect our society.   We can do something about this. We should not allow this level of  discourse to continue.   By the way, the something that we can do about it is not allow it to  be something that we accept. We don't have to do anything more, for  some of us, than change the channel. Maybe that will send a message,  when they don't get good ratings. Or don't attend events where these  kinds of things are taking place. We don't have to make this something  that is acceptable to any one of us.  [[Page H10237]]    I mention all of these things because I know that this level of ugly  discourse is going to be something that we are going to have to live  with for a lot longer than we choose, unless we choose to do something  about it.   I ask of you just to pay attention to what is happening to our  society. Pay attention to the words that are being said and the way  people are being demeaned by the Chief Executive Officer, who sets the  standard, who is a standard-bearer. Pay attention to what is going on.   I beg that, please, let's open our eyes and see how a single person  is corrupting the discourse, not only, by the way, at rallies and among  those who are on talk shows but also here in the Congress of the United  States of America.   I arrived here in 2005. Since then, the discourse in Congress has  changed to the extent that people are saying things that I thought we  would never hear in the Congress in terms of scatology, profanity,  demeaning commentary.   Now, I am not saying don't speak truth. Speak truth. But what I am  saying is what we are saying to hurt people just to be harmful, to let  people somehow be demeaned just to demean people, I find that  unacceptable.   I just beg that we would not be so blind as those who choose not to  see. I think that society is not lost overnight, but the genesis of the  loss is discourse, public discourse that degenerates to the extent that  the humanity of every person is lessened, where people at some point  conclude: Those people, they don't belong. Those people, they don't  count.   Every human being means something and counts. We ought not allow  ourselves to allow things to happen to babies in cages. We ought not  allow ourselves to conclude that certain religions are unacceptable.  What can happen to one religion can happen to any religion. Every child  is precious. We ought to respect the humanity of every person and  accord a certain amount of decency to all people. I cannot believe some  of the things that we are now tolerating.   There was a time in this country when we would not tolerate having a  person acknowledge that, among racists and bigots, there were some very  fine people or nice people. There was a time when we wouldn't tolerate  that, but we do now. There was a time when certain tropes that are  being used and propagated, we wouldn't tolerate it, but we do now.   My comment to America, to our country, and to the people who care is,  at some point, this level of hate is going to become a bigger problem  than we care to deal with, unless we deal with it now. We should. We  should deal with it. We cannot allow it to become something that future  generations will have to contend with. It is easy to believe that this  is a temporary condition until it is no longer a temporary condition.   ``Irreparable harm'' is a term that we use in law. At some point,  this becomes irreparable harm. At some point, there are some people who  will suffer to the extent that they can't recover.   I know of people in the Latino community who live with a great degree  of apprehension. People born in this country, Americans, live with a  great degree of apprehension because of what happened in El Paso.    I know of people who are of a certain faith, citizens of this  country, who live with apprehension because of what happened in  Charlottesville.   We ought not allow the discourse, this incitive discourse, to create  circumstances where people are harmed. We are seeing it happen, but I  think that some of us choose not to see the harmful impact that it is  having on our society.   My message is very simple today. I beg, let's take a look, just open  our eyes and let's look at what is happening to our country. If we can  do this, we can change this.   This ought not be the case in the greatest country in the world.  There is no one so blind as he who chooses not to see. I hope that  understanding will prevail and that we will decide that we will not  tolerate the level of hateful discourse that we are suffering and that  many people suffer from because there are other persons who hurt them  after being exposed to this incitive discourse, this incendiary  language, this weaponization of hate. People are hurting.   I don't say these things because I want to make sure I personally am  protected. I come to this podium to bring these words and this message  because I know of the suffering in various communities.   Those who are suffering from anti-Semitism, I know about it. Those  who are suffering from racism, I know. Those who are suffering from the  various insidious forms of hate related to who you happen to be, I know  about it. The homophobia, the Islamophobia, the xenophobia, all of the  various phobias that are harmful to people, I know.   I have constituents, and I know that they expect me to do this. They  expect someone to say that people are quietly suffering. They expect us  to do this. They send us to Congress to do this. We ought not tolerate  this level of hate because we perpetuate it, and we ought to do  something about it.   In the beginning was the word. This is the word. I am talking about  it now. But there is much more that we can do, and I pray that we will  become, each of us, a committee of one to do something about the hate  that is being perpetrated among people in this country that is causing  harm to other people in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 4 o'clock and 12 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Friday, December 13, 2019, at noon.                            ____________________
