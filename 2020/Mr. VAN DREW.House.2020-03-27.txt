 Mr. Speaker, the pain being felt in south Jersey and in  this Nation is real. I have listened, and  [[Page H1839]]  I have heard the stories. What we are doing today will soothe some of  the pain, but it is just the beginning.   America was founded and has thrived with the idea that we are an  exceptional Nation. We are exceptional not because of our differences  but because of what unites us in times of adversity. This legislation  is a testament to our strength that we show in that unity.   While we must maintain a physical distance from one another to slow  the curve of our hidden enemy, we must remain closer than ever in our  hearts and in our souls to one another.   I stand with my colleagues ready to fight this disease, fight for our  families, fight for their jobs, and fight to keep our Nation.   May God bless America, and may God bless all of us as we go forward  with our work.
