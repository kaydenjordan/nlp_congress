 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the incredible  life of a great man. The Reverend Billy Graham spent his life serving  God and proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ.   Many who heard him share the Good Word considered him to be America's  pastor. But throughout his life, he was always a humble and faithful  servant.   Decades ago, I had the opportunity to attend a Billy Graham Crusade  at Notre Dame with my family. I will never forget seeing so many people  having the opportunity to hear the message that God loves you--a very  simple message. No matter who you are, no matter your background, Billy  would declare: God loves you.   Billy Graham brought this message of compassion, hope, and the power  of God's grace to millions of people from all walks of life. He also  brought it to the leaders of the free world as a friend and counselor  to the Presidents of both parties.   Tomorrow he will lie in honor in the Capitol rotunda. It is fitting  to honor him as we honor our Nation's leaders, not just because they  changed history, but because he changed our hearts.   His greatest legacy is the people he helped to be closer to the Lord.   Mr. Speaker, Billy Graham is home now. We give thanks to God that He  raised up such a humble man with a servant's heart, and we pray that  his powerful message will live on.
