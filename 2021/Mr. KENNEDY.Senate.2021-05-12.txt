 Mr. President, I am going to talk for a few minutes  about mental health for our kids. I think many Americans have known  and, unfortunately, some Americans have loved some of our fellow  citizens who suffer with depression and anxiety and thoughts of  suicide. It is a particular problem for our young people. CDC reports  that one in four young Americans have actually considered suicide, and,  in fact, the second leading cause of death for young people is suicide.   I am sure there are a lot of reasons for this. I think it is harder  to be a young person today. Many of our kids see things that those of  us who are older didn't have to deal with until we were adults--drugs,  of course; alcohol; also, social media. You can still find kindness in  America, but unfortunately you have to go offline to do it.   Some of our young people--many of our young people--just need someone  to talk to. Some of them, when their anxiety and their depression is  acute, need medical treatment, and this bill will simply provide a  mechanism for our young people to receive it.   The bill, as I said, is called the Improving Mental Health Access for  Students Act. It would provide that schools--our universities--be  required to print phone numbers for the National Suicide Prevention  Lifeline, the Crisis Text Line, and a campus mental health center or  program on the student ID cards.   This bill would not require our schools to tear up current ID cards.  It would be phased in. And if a school doesn't use an ID card, they  don't have to start using an ID card. My bill  [[Page S2470]]  would simply require that the schools put the information on their  website.   This bill passed unanimously by UC in our last Congress, but,  unfortunately, the House ran out of time to take it up.   Toward that end, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I am  going to ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 1585, introduced earlier today.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by title.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 1585) to add suicide prevention resources to       school identification cards.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read  the third time.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the bill.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate on the bill,  the bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the  bill pass?   The bill (S. 1585) was passed as follows                                  S. 1585         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Mental Health       Access for Students Act''.       SEC. 2. ADDING SUICIDE PREVENTION CONTACT INFORMATION TO                     SCHOOL IDENTIFICATION CARDS.         (a) In General.--Section 487(a) of the Higher Education Act       of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1094(a)) is amended by adding at the end       the following:        ``(30)(A) In the case of an institution that creates and       distributes identification cards for students at any time       after the date of enactment of this paragraph, such       institution shall include phone contact information on each       such card for the following organizations:        ``(i) The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.        ``(ii) Crisis Text Line.        ``(iii) A campus mental health center or program, as       determined by the institution.        ``(B) In the case of an institution that does not create       and distribute identification cards for students at any time       after the date of enactment of this paragraph, such       institution shall publish the suicide prevention contact       information specified in subparagraph (A) on the website of       such institution.        ``(C) If an organization in clause (i) or (ii) of       subparagraph (A) ceases to exist, the Secretary may designate       a different entity with a similar purpose to be included on       the identification card.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect beginning on the day that is 1 year after       the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
