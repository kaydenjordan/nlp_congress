 Mr. Speaker, I absolutely denounce the brutal  and Communist regimes of Castro, Maduro, Stalin, and other dictators in  the whereas clauses of this resolution.   But, sadly, instead of spending our precious moments in the people's  House expanding opportunity for hardworking Americans, supporting  ranchers, farmers, and rural communities, lowering healthcare costs,  and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, we are spending hours,  actually days in pure political theater.   In the Rules Committee, when I offered Mr. Takano's amendment to  clarify that this resolution does not also condemn Social Security,  Medicare, and veterans' health benefits, Republicans blocked it.    Yet, I still know that our love and respect for our veterans,  seniors, and retirees will always guide our work to ensure they receive  all the benefits they have earned. I will not stray from our obligation  to create prosperity, hope, and a future everywhere in America.
