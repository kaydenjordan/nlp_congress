 Madam Speaker, I rise before you today to share the  heartbreaking stories from Americans around the country, including my  own district, who were cut off from their loved ones in long-term care  facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.   For the next several months in this Chamber, I will share harrowing  testimony submitted to my office from these families.   Essential caregivers were prohibited from entering nursing homes,  group homes, and other long-term care facilities to provide an extra  level of care and love, which is so desperately needed and deserved by  those who call these facilities home.   Over the past year, long-term care facility residents suffered in  isolation. Alone, many lost the will to live, and many others  deteriorated physically and mentally.   While we cannot go back in time to fix what has been done, we can  take steps today to prevent this from ever happening again. If Congress  fails to act, we could see thousands more Americans die or suffer in  isolation again.   I have introduced the bipartisan Essential Caregivers Act to fight  for the rights of our seniors, our constituents living in group homes  with disabilities, and anyone who resides in a long-term care facility.  This also includes young children with developmental disabilities.   Under Federal law, residents in long-term care facilities have a  right to receive visitors at any time. But during the pandemic, this  right was curtailed completely. Many residents, including children with  disabilities and seniors, were not allowed access to loved ones who had  been caring for them prior to the pandemic. This took a tremendous toll  on them.   My bipartisan bill addresses this issue by striking a commonsense  compromise. It implements a new Federal standard that will end this  indignity. This bill permits each facility resident to designate up to  two essential caregivers who will be provided safe, reasonable, and  transparent access to residents during any future public health  emergency.   The Essential Caregivers Act is a compassionate step to ensure the  most vulnerable among us never suffer alone again.    Why is this so important?   Because essential caregivers aren't just visitors; they are, as the  name implies, caregivers who help with activities of daily living and  provide emotional support and companionship.   This care enriches the lives of residents, enhances their well-being,  and helps them thrive personally and socially. Without it, residents  ultimately suffer. This is exactly what we saw during the 15-month  lockdown.   The importance of the essential caregivers in no way diminishes the  critical role that facility staff place in residents' lives, which  during this pandemic was nothing short of heroic. Essential caregivers  simply supplement the care provided by facility staff. They are a force  multiplier that enhances the ability of residents to thrive and to live  their lives fully.   Importantly, this bill upholds strict safety and health standards to  protect residents, staff, and caregivers. Any essential caregiver must  comply with whatever health standards are put in place by a facility.  This includes requirements for testing, PPE, and social distancing.  [[Page H3302]]    In my home State of New York, one of the greatest tragedies of the  COVID-19 pandemic was the suffering of those living in nursing and  group homes. First, they suffered because of Governor Cuomo's negligent  policy to return COVID-positive patients to long-term care facilities.  Then they suffered by not being able to access the caregivers they  depended on for so many years.   Today I want to tell their stories not only from the constituents I  represent in New York, but also from those around the country who  similarly suffered.   First, we remember the life of Ana Martinez. Vivian Zayas and Alexa  Rivera are the cofounders of Voices for Seniors. Their mother is Ana  Martinez, who was supposed to undergo a few weeks of physical therapy  in West Islip, New York. But because of Governor Cuomo's COVID  mandates, Vivian and Alexa were unable to tell their mother good-bye  before she passed away after contracting COVID in the facility.   Vivian and Alexa has since made it their life's mission to see that  no one else endures the hardships they experienced being cut off from  their own mother.   We remember the life of Daniel Alvino. Tracey Alvino is the daughter  of Daniel Alvino. Daniel was a veteran and a football fanatic. His  family meant the world to him. His laugh was the highlight of all of  their holiday parties.   In March 2020, Daniel was placed into a rehab facility in a New York  nursing home after having neck surgery. Under Cuomo's nursing mandate,  Tracey had no access to her father for a significant period of time.  Daniel fell very ill and had to be rushed to a hospital and placed on a  ventilator.   On April 14, 2020, Daniel Alvino passed away at the age of 76. It  wasn't until a year later that his family finally held his funeral to  commemorate his life that was cut far too short.   This evening, we remember Mr. Alvino.   We also remember the life of John Daly. John Daly was a husband,  father of five, grandfather of nine, and a Marine veteran who served on  the front lines in Korea. He and his wife, Mary, were together for 63  years until the day he entered the Gurwin Jewish Nursing Home and  Rehabilitation Center at the time lockdowns were put in place.   John spent 20 days at the facility after having been hospitalized  with pneumonia. Having suffered a minor stroke previously, John had  limited use of his left arm and needed assistance.                                time  2110    Madam Speaker, his wife was the one who was normally there to help  him in the facility, but she was cut off from him completely. She was  no longer able to see John and received only infrequent phone calls.   Once his rehab was over, the family picked him up to find that he was  no longer able to walk. His condition had deteriorated significantly.  In a matter of days, the family had to choose between hospice or  fighting for his life. They chose to fight.   Sadly, because of the isolation he faced, John was not eating enough  to live. Sadly, John lost his life on May 24, 2020.   The family feels strongly that if his wife had been by his side,  giving him the love and care that he needed, he would be with us today.   This evening, we remember John Daly.   Madam Speaker, we also remember the life of Rosemary Abraham. Karla  Abraham-Conley is the daughter of Rosemary Abraham. Rosemary was  admitted to a long-term care facility in September 2019.   Before the pandemic, Karla was by her mother's side as a caregiver.  She took her to lunch, brought her to family dinners, and provided help  with the day-to-day activities.   When March 2020 arrived, Karla was cut off from her mother  completely. After months of isolation, speaking only over the phone,  Karla noticed the toll that it was having on her mother's health.   Window visits were brutal and confusing for her mother. Karla's  mother simply did not understand why Karla wasn't allowed in to see  her.   As they spoke over FaceTime, Karla watched her mother deteriorate.  Only after Karla pleaded for someone to care for her mother was she  eventually sent to the emergency room due to poor health.   Sadly, Rosemary Abraham died 7 days later, on October 4, 2020. She  died from isolation, failure to thrive, and neglect.   If Karla had been allowed to be in the facility with her mother, she  would likely be alive today.   This evening, we remember Rosemary Abraham and remember that Karla  Abraham-Conley was one of the people who inspired us to put together  and to draft the Essential Caregivers Act.   Madam Speaker, we also recognize the suffering of Susan Wilson.  Robert Wilson is married to Susan Wilson. She is a retired pediatric  nurse who suffered a major hemorrhagic stroke that left her paralyzed  on the right side. Her speech was limited, as was her ability to  perform daily living activities.   She did not get COVID, nor did she die in the long-term care  facility, but she has suffered severe damage by the extended lockdown.   For a full 7 months, he was excluded from seeing her. Even though she  was in an excellent nursing home, her care and her emotional, physical,  and mental state deteriorated significantly.   No staff, no matter how good, can provide only what an essential  caregiver can provide. His wife was admitted to the hospital twice. Her  speech deteriorated. She lost the ability to use her nondominant hand.  She lost progress on relearning how to walk and is now confined to a  wheelchair.   In his formal testimony, Robert said: ``I am not a visitor. I am  Susan's voice, her only voice. She should never have been subjected to  the isolation, and you all have the ability to keep it from happening  again.''   This evening, we recognize Susan's suffering. The Essential  Caregivers Act would have protected Susan's rights and allowed critical  access for John to continue for her care.   Madam Speaker, we also recognize the suffering of Gina Zanchelli.  Dolores Zanchelli was the caretaker of her mother, Gina, who lived in a  skilled nursing facility in Long Island, New York.   Dolores visited her mother every day to provide the extra care that  the facility was not able to deliver each day. Having access to her  mother allowed Dolores the chance to monitor her mother's health  closely.   Once lockdowns went into effect, Dolores was cut off from her mother,  who became depressed from being isolated. Physical therapy stopped, and  the necessary care she needed was deemed unessential in the facility.   Delores and her mother were limited to only video calls during the  lockdown. After Dolores went through a rigorous process to see her  mother, she was able to have three socially distanced visits over the  course of 13 months, about 10 to 15 minutes each, but the isolation had  already taken its toll.   Gina's rights were violated, and the damage that resulted physically  and mentally has been irreversible. In Dolores' words: ``This should  never be allowed to happen again.''   This evening, we recognize the suffering of Gina Zanchelli.   Madam Speaker, we also recognize the suffering of Lynn Ray Leljedal.  Prior to COVID, Carrie had never been away from her son, Lynn, for more  than 9 days. He was 32 when COVID shut down all the long-term care  facilities.   Lynn was born with a rare seizure disorder called Sturge-Weber  syndrome. At 16 years old, he had to have the right side of his brain  disconnected to control seizures.   Lynn moved into a long-term care facility in 2013. His mother,  Carrie, has always been a hands-on mom. She never just went to visit;  she would spend hours with her son, cleaning his room and eating meals  with him and the other residents. Some nights, she would just go over  to help him get ready for bed.   In March 2020, Carrie was told that the facility was closed to all  visitors. Her heart dropped. For over 4 months, she was only able to  see Lynn through a window or through a virtual visit.   When she was finally allowed to see Lynn, it was only at doctor's  appointments. The distance took its toll on them.  [[Page H3303]]    As Carrie said in her testimony to me: ``There is only one way to  ensure that any resident of long-term care never faces this again. This  is by passing H.R. 3733, the Essential Caregivers Act.''    Madam Speaker, these are heart-wrenching stories that show exactly  why we need to pass the Essential Caregivers Act. Had this law been in  place, these residents would not have suffered alone in isolation, and  their caregivers would have been there to safely provide the  supplemental care that is so critical. Individuals we lost may have  been with us today.   This bill is about protecting the rights of the most vulnerable among  us.   Madam Speaker, the stories I shared with you this evening only  scratch the surface of the suffering individuals and families endured  around the country.   Madam Speaker, I have personally received hundreds of pages, and I  will show them to you. This is just some of the gut-wrenching testimony  from families who have been through excruciating circumstances fighting  for their loved ones' rights.   To read it all would take hours, which is why I will post every page  of it on my website. Let it be a permanent reminder of the need for  this body to pass the act.   Each of these stories, we will try to get them through. We have  another year and a half left of the term to try to get them through  Special Orders or other ways on the floor so that these people can be  properly recognized.   Before I close, I want to share some additional names of people who  also submitted their stories, so that their names are in the Record:   Bill Borelle, essential caregiver to his 96-year-old mother.

Each of these individuals submitted testimony to my office that is  just as powerful and compelling as the seven stories I shared with you  this evening.   As I said, I will post these testimonies on my website and,  hopefully, throughout the next year and a half, I will be able to speak  about each one of these people who have given essential care on behalf  of a family member and the loss that these people suffered over the  next several months.   I encourage each member of this body to take time to read these  stories and hear the pleas of those who suffered. The one bit of solace  I take from these stories is that the elected Members of Congress here  tonight can do something to prevent these tragedies from ever happening  again.   We stand together and support passage of the bipartisan Essential  Caregivers Act. It will protect these individuals and their loved ones  from any future harm.   I want to close by thanking Congressman Larson from Connecticut for  leading this bipartisan effort with me. I also want to thank the bill's  other cosponsors: Elise Stefanik,   John Rutherford, Yvette Herrell,  Madison  [[Page H3304]]  Cawthorn, Abigail Spanberger, Ted Budd, Jeff Van Drew, and   Steve  Cohen.   Tomorrow morning, I will be joined by caregivers from all over the  country at the Capitol steps to call for the House to take up our bill  and make right this injustice. No individual deserves the indignity of  suffering alone. We can fix this, and we must.   May God bless all of those who suffered and all of those essential  caregivers around our Nation. We are grateful to you.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
