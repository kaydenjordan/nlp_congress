 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2685, the Understanding  Cybersecurity of Mobile Networks Act, which was introduced by  Representatives Eshoo and Kinzinger.   Congress tasked the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration with ensuring the national security of our Nation's  telecommunications networks. In recent years we have seen large scale  cybersecurity attacks that put Americans at risk.                                time  1600    While mobile service providers take numerous steps to address  vulnerabilities in their networks and respond to threats, we know that  threats to our mobile networks continue to exist.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has focused on securing our  communications supply chains, and today we are taking another step  forward to understanding these challenges. This legislation requires  NTIA to study the cybersecurity of mobile networks and the  vulnerabilities of these networks and mobile devices to cyberattacks  and surveillance conducted by our adversaries.   This report will not only help inform NTIA's cybersecurity  activities, including its work on the Communications Supply Chain Risk  Information Sharing Program, but will also help providers understand  the risks their networks face so they can respond appropriately.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the majority for working with us on this  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2685, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4045, the FUTURE  Networks Act, which was introduced by Representatives Doyle, Johnson,  and McBath.   This legislation will establish a task force at the Federal  Communications Commission to follow industry-led progress in the  development of 6G. The task force will be required to publish a report  on the status of industry-led standards development, possible use-cases  of 6G technology, and how best to facilitate the siting and  infrastructure deployment of 6G technology.   While many parts of our country are waiting to see the new use-cases  that 5G will drive, trusted vendors--including American companies--are  leading the way on the fundamental aspects that will inform 6G. As the  private sector identifies the contours of what this next generation of  technology will look like, we must make sure that our regulatory  environment will facilitate investment and innovation.   Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee have been  spearheading efforts to deploy mobile  [[Page H6690]]  broadband like 5G and eventually 6G across the country through the  Boosting Broadband Connectivity Agenda. I appreciate the majority  including provisions in this bill to support comprehensive broadband  deployment solutions to expand connectivity and fuel wireless  innovation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4055, the American  Cybersecurity Literacy Act, which was introduced by Representatives  Kinzinger and Eshoo.   The Cybersecurity Solarium Commission identified cyber hygiene as a  key challenge affecting our readiness as a country. As many  cybersecurity professionals will attest, there are common steps that  Americans can take to prevent disruption to networks and the theft of  personal information.   This legislation directs the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration to establish a cybersecurity literacy  campaign to educate Americans on cybersecurity risks and best practices  to reduce those risks. By increasing awareness of the simple steps that  can be taken every day, we can reduce cybersecurity incidents. I urge  my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is a very important piece of legislation. I  have had about seven different cybersecurity events with the FBI in my  district for my constituents. One of the things that they have always  stressed is good hygiene, and over 80 percent is good hygiene, to  prevent these cybersecurity attacks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
