 Madam President, I am proud to recognize Emily Kim  Ae Sun Hunter of Chester as April's Granite Stater of the Month. In  response to the surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans and  Pacific Islanders, AAPI, Emily is organizing a peaceful gathering in  downtown Portsmouth to demonstrate support for New Hampshire's AAPI  community.   Emily was born in Seoul, South Korea. When she and twin sister were 5  months old, they were adopted by a couple in New Hampshire. Growing up  in a predominantly White community, Emily and her sister quickly  learned what it was like to be the only people of color in a room. The  sisters were also the target of hate, which left a lasting impression  on both of the girls.   Emily--now a mentor for Asian-American women at her company and a  strong voice in the AAPI community--was shocked and horrified, as so  many Americans were, by the mass shooting in Atlanta, GA, that left  eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent.   In response, Emily decided to take action by organizing a peaceful  gathering to show support for the AAPI community and help share  resources to combat discrimination. Emily, who has never organized an  event like this before, has also taken to social media and raised more  than $6,500 for AAPI organizations across the country.   Emily's dedication to uplifting members of the AAPI community and  encouraging others to do the same embodies the best of the Granite  State. Amid a challenging time for the AAPI community, Emily has shown  true strength by elevating her message of inclusivity and acceptance. I  am honored to name her as a Granite Stater of the Month as we join  together to stand with the AAPI community and condemn the un-American  attacks that we have seen.                            ____________________
