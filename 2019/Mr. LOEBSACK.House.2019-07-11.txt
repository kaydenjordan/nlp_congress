 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Iowa Safe  Schools' second annual Pride Camp. This week-long event invites LGBTQ  youth and allies from across Iowa to participate in a summer camp where  they have the opportunity to learn new skills, connect with their  peers, share their experiences, and grow as individuals while also  having fun.   This year, over 100 LGBTQ youth from across the State will be  attending Pride Camp, despite this only being the camp's second year.  This truly goes to show the importance of programs like Pride Camp, and  I am proud that Iowa is a leader in the fight for acceptance and  equality for everyone.   I want to extend my sincerest thanks to Iowa Safe Schools for  creating this wonderful opportunity and for all of their efforts  advocating for Iowa's LGBTQ youth. Their work in developing a safe and  inclusive summer camp is making a difference in the lives of so many  young Iowans, and I am honored to recognize them here today.                            ____________________
