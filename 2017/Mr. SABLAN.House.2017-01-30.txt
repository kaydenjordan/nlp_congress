 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, wow, just listening to my good friend from California  explain and give us a description of what happened in the life of this  American hero, Sergeant Sky Mote, I am truly touched by the many other  stories that I have heard from families of our men and women in  uniform, our veterans in service of our country.   And as we have just heard, this bill designates a mountain peak in  the John Muir Wilderness of the Sierra National Forest in California as  ``Sky Point'' in recognition of a fallen Marine Corps Staff Sergeant  Sky Mote.   Sky served our country honorably as a U.S. marine for 9 years. He had  a tour of duty in Iraq and two in Afghanistan.   By designating that mountain as ``Sky Point,'' it will honor his  memory and ensure his selfless sacrifice for his country and fellow  marines is not forgotten.   We passed this legislation last Congress by voice vote, and I urge  that we do the same again today.   I thank my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from California,  for introducing this bill today.   As I have no further speakers, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H711]]    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Rob Bishop for allowing  my bill to come to the floor again.   We passed the same bill in the House on December 6, but the Senate  adjourned 3 days later without acting, and the problem has not gone  away.   The economy of the Northern Mariana Islands grew 3.5 percent last  year, the fourth straight year of growth for my district.   This strong economic expansion is good news for the people I  represent. We desperately want this growth to continue because our  economy is still smaller than it was in 2000.   The Northern Mariana Islands Economic Expansion Act addresses that  problem and is broadly supported back home.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from Governor  Ralph Deleon Guerrero Torres of the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands; from the Commonwealth's Strategic Economic Development  Council; the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation; the Hotel Association  of the Northern Mariana Islands; and from the Saipan Chamber of  Commerce.                                            CNMI Strategic Economic                                             Development Council,                                                   December 1, 2016.      Hon. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Sablan: The CNMI Strategic Economic       Development Committee is in strong support of H.R. 6401,       critical legislation that will provide short-term relief from       the labor shortage threatening the growth of the Northern       Marianas economy.        The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis indicates the       Commonwealth economy grew for the fourth consecutive year, a       recent high of 3.5 percent. This is attributable to increased       private investment and tourism now threatened by the lack of       available qualified workers on the island.        The modest one-year increase in Commonwealth-Only       Transitional Workers (CW) proposed under H.R. 6401, will       provide the business community with the necessary human       resources to continue to operate and propel an expanding       economy.        It is imperative that we do not stymie our plan for fixture       economic growth, now beginning to come to frutition, with a       labor shortage in critical areas.        The bill also provides additional funds for the job       training/education programs proven effective at expanding the       pool of qualified and skilled U.S. workers in the CNMI.        The CNMI Strategic Economic Development Council fully       supports H.R. 6401 and appreciates all of your efforts in       addressing the labor crisis in the Northern Marianas.            Very truly yours,      Alexander A. Sablan,        Sub Committee Chairman, Labor & CW Task Force, CNMI       Strategic Economic Development Committee.                                   ____                                       Saipan Chamber of Commerce,                                                   December 2, 2016.      Hon. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Sablan: The Saipan Chamber of Commerce is       in strong support of H.R. 6401, critical legislation that       will provide short-term relief from the labor shortage       threatening the growth of the Northern Marianas economy.        The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis indicates the       Commonwealth economy grew for the fourth consecutive year, a       recent high of 3.5 percent. This is attributable to increased       private investment and tourism now threatened by the lack of       available qualified workers on the island.        The modest one-year increase in Commonwealth-Only       Transitional Workers (CW) proposed under H.R. 6401, will       provide the business community with the necessary human       resources to continue to operate and propel an expanding       economy. It will also provide additional critical funds for       job training and education programs that are steadily       expanding the pool of qualified and skilled U.S. workers on       Saipan.        The Saipan Chamber of Commerce fully supports H.R. 6401 and       appreciates all of your efforts in addressing the labor       crisis in the Northern Marianas.            Very truly yours,      Velma M. Palacios,        President of the Board, Saipan Chamber of Commerce.                                   ____                                            Hotel Association of the                                        Northern Mariana Islands,                                                   December 2, 2016.      Hon. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Sablan: The Hotel Association of the       Northern Mariana Islands is in strong support of H.R. 6401,       critical legislation that will provide short-term relief from       the labor shortage threatening the growing hospitality       industry in the Northern Marianas.        Due in large part to increased private investment and       tourism the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis recently       announced that the Commonwealth economy grew for the fourth       consecutive year.        However, our hotel and resort properties are in critical       need of labor, particularly those with skills and experience       in the hospitality industry, culinary arts and property       maintence. The inability of employers to renew or hire new       Commonwealth-Only Transitional Workers (CW) threatens their       continued operations and chills future investment in our       islands.        The modest one-year increase in CWs, proposed under H.R.       6401, will allow the hospitality industry to continue to       provide first-class service to our tourists.        The Hotel Association of the Northern Mariana Islands fully       supports H.R. 6401 and appreciates all of your efforts in       addressing the labor crisis in the Northern Marianas.            Very truly yours,                                                Gloria Cavanagh,                                 Chairman, Hotel Association of the       Northern Mariana Islands.                                   ____           Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation, Commonwealth of the             Northern Mariana Islands,                                                  December 2, 2016.      Hon. Gregorio ``Kilili'' Camacho Sablan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Sablan: Commonwealth Healthcare       Corporation (CHCC) is in strong support of H.R. 6401.        This critical legislation would provide an increase in the       FY 2017 limit on Commonwealth-only Transitional Workers (CW)       and allow the CHCC to petition for renewal of 39 essential       healthcare workers impacted when the CW cap was reached just       two weeks into the Fiscal Year.        Our Commonwealth Health Center (CHC) is the only hospital       in the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, providing       inpatient and outpatient acute, chronic, and emergency health       care services to the people of the CNMI. We also maintain       community health centers on the populated islands of Saipan,       Tinian, and Rota.        Our ability to continue to provide these essential on-      island health care services, and maintain quality patient       care and safety as well as maintain overall public health,       depends on being able to maintain current staffing levels and       specialized expertise.        Without an increase to the CW cap this year, CHC stands to       lose the services and experience of 34 staff nurses, two       infection control nurses, a clinical laboratory scientist and       specialists in mammography and ultrasonography.        For the foregoing reasons, we are in full support H.R. 6401       and are grateful for your work in addressing this critical       health care issue.            Sincerely,                                                    Esther L. Muna,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                                 Commonwealth of the                                        Northern Mariana Islands,                                                   December 4, 2016.      Hon. Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Sablan: I write to support H.R. 6401,       critical legislation that will provide short-term relief from       the labor shortage facing the Commonwealth that threatens our       growing economy and public health.        The latest report from Bureau of Economic Analysis       indicates the Commonwealth economy grew for the fourth       consecutive year. A growing economy needs a qualified       workforce. And while there are now more U.S. workers than       foreign workers in the Northern Marianas for the first time       in decades, there are still not enough to meet the labor       demand. The temporary increase in the number of Commonwealth-      Only Transitional (CW) workers provided in your bill will       particularly help small businesses retain the workers needed       to maintain operations.        Most importantly, the Commonwealth's only hospital, stand       to lose critical staff including 34 staff nurses, two       infection control nurses, a clinical laboratory scientist and       specialists in mammography, ultrasonography without the       relief provided in H.R. 6401.        Building a qualified U.S. workforce in the Northern       Marianas is a priority for my administration. The CW worker       fee increase in the legislation will provide additional       funding for efforts to recruit, educate, and train these       workers and establish a permanent pool of workers to fill       local jobs.        H.R. 6401 is critical to continued economic growth in the       Northern Marianas. The bill has my full support.            Sincerely,                                                  Ralph DLG Torres,                                                          Governor.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again Chairman Rob Bishop of  the Natural Resources Committee for his understanding and support. I  also thank Chairman Don Young who held a hearing on this issue last  September and agreed that action was needed.   I appreciate the support of Ranking Member Raul Grijalva and our new  Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee Ranking Member  Norma Torres.   Mr. Speaker, I am indebted to the minority whip, Mr. Hoyer, and to  the  [[Page H712]]  majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, and to my friend Mr. McClintock of  California who agreed to bring H.R. 339 to the floor today.   I ask for support of H.R. 339.   Having no further speakers, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill authorizes the National Park Service to conduct a special  resource study of Fort Ontario in Oswego, New York. Fort Ontario was a  military installation used during the French and Indian Wars, which was  later used to house refugees fleeing the Nazi Holocaust during World  War II.   Many Americans remember our Nation's role in World War II through  events like the Invasion of Normandy or the Battle of Iwo Jima, closer  to my district, which have been re-imagined in film and memorialized in  stone, but the story of Fort Ontario is an equally important component  of our historical legacy. Providing physical refuge from persecution  says as much about our national character as the bravery and sacrifice  of the millions of Americans who were deployed overseas.   The site has been managed as a New York State historic site since  1949 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places  since 1970. The study authorized by this bill will look into the best  available options for the continued preservation and management of Fort  Ontario, including the possibility of turning it into a unit of the  National Park System.   Fort Ontario has had many uses throughout our Nation's history, and  it has had a particularly relevant place in the story of Jewish  Americans. As we work to ensure that our public lands tell the story of  all Americans, Fort Ontario and its unique story could be a fitting  addition.   This bill passed the House last September but was, unfortunately, not  acted upon by the Senate.   I would like to thank Representative Katko, the sponsor of this bill,  for his continued efforts to ensure the Nation knows about the story of  Fort Ontario.   This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption and support of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 374 would reward the States of California, Oregon, and  Washington for their long legacy of successful cooperative management  of the West Coast Dungeness crab fishery in Federal waters. These  States have, with oversight from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, or NOAA, managed this fishery sustainably, and this  bill would make that management arrangement permanent.   The specifics of the Dungeness crab fishery, including robust stock  assessments, accurate catch reporting, and little conflict between  commercial and recreational crabbers, make regional management a good  choice. This is basically the opposite of a fishery like Gulf of Mexico  red snapper, where there is a lack of cooperation among States and  fishing sectors.   I agree with the goals of this legislation, and I ask my colleagues  to stand with me in support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 374, and I have no  further speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  sponsor of the bill, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I urge all of my  colleagues for the adoption of H.R. 538.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill adjusts the boundary of the Kennesaw Mountain National  Battlefield Park in Georgia to include two historically significant  structures, the Wallis House and Kolb's Farm, and to assist in the  preservation of the story of the Atlanta campaign. Additionally, the  bill authorizes the National Park Service to acquire by donation  approximately 8 acres that will be added to the Kennesaw National  Battlefield Park.   The Civil War was a significant event in the history of this country  and remains relevant as we grapple with the civil rights discussions  today. The preservation of these sites reinforces Congress' dedication  to equality and enables the National Park Service to interpret and tell  our national story.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for continuing to  support the preservation of the history of this great country.   This bill passed the House last Congress by voice vote, and I  encourage its swift adoption today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I urge the  adoption of the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill, H.R. 560, amends the Delaware Water Gap National  Recreation Area Improvement Act to extend a waiver for certain  commercial traffic on U.S. Route 209, a federally owned highway that  runs through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.   When Congress decided to restrict commercial traffic on the portion  of the highway that runs through the recreation area, the law included  an exemption for certain vehicles that belong to nearby businesses and  municipal governments. This bill provides a 5-year extension of that  exemption in order to facilitate continued access for local residents.   The National Park Service, which manages the area, supports the bill;  and it passed the House, as my colleague from California mentioned,  last year by voice vote. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption  of this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague, Mr.  Marino, for his leadership and his effort in the introduction and  efforts towards the hopeful passage of H.R. 560. I want to also thank  my good friend from California for this afternoon's wonderful time  managing these six bills.   I urge the passage of H.R. 560.   I yield back the balance of my time.
