 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in support of  protecting people with preexisting conditions.   Not that long ago, hardworking people who did everything right would  be denied insurance coverage just because they had diabetes or asthma  or they wanted to start a family.   We passed the ACA and ended discrimination against people with  preexisting conditions. Millions of Americans were able to sign up for  coverage for the first time in their lives, and millions who already  had coverage knew it wouldn't be taken away from them.   Remember the stories of people's insurance being canceled as they  were being rolled into operating rooms; that was the truth.    The ACA has done a lot of good. Could we work to improve it? Yes. And  I will work with any Republican or Democrat on those efforts. But when  this Congress and this administration attempt to roll back protections  for people with preexisting conditions, I will always stand against  those policies.   Mr. Chair, 2 years ago last week, House Republicans passed a bill to  rescind the whole ACA and take healthcare away from 20 million  Americans. Because Americans spoke up, that bill failed.   I am proud to cosponsor Representative Kuster's bill. Healthcare  should be affordable to every American.
