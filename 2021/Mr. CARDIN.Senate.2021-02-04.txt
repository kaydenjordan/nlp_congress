 Mr. President, first, let me thank Chairman Menendez, the  chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for his advocacy in  getting into this budget resolution the $10 billion for the global  response to COVID-19.   I just want to underscore what Chairman Menendez said from the  beginning: This global response will not only save lives around the  world, it will save lives here at home.   In 1 year, 450,000 Americans have lost their lives to COVID-19; 2.6  million worldwide. The United States has the distinction of having the  largest number of fatalities and infections of any country in the  world.   This is a challenge that requires the leadership of the United States  of America. If we are going to beat COVID-19, America must be in the  leadership to do this as quickly and as efficiently as possible.   So what does that require? It requires us to take the right steps at  home, and the budget resolution before us gives us the resources to do  that with the production and distribution--fair distribution--of  vaccines and dealing with the needs for testing, dealing with the needs  of those businesses and individuals who have been directly affected by  COVID-19, all that is dealt with in this package, but we also need to  work responsibly in the global community, and that is what this $10  billion will allow us to do--to be leaders globally as well as what we  do at home.   President Biden has already taken the initial steps by rejoining the  World Health Organization and joining the COVID-19 Vaccines Global  Access Facility so that 190 countries in the world can join together to  make sure that everyone gets access to this vaccine, particularly in  low- and middle-economic countries that otherwise would be challenged.  Why? Because those are our values--humanitarian concerns globally, but  it is also in our individual interest because if this virus is not  contained in a country, it will get to the United States.   And as Chairman Menendez said, the longer this virus goes globally,  the more variants we are going to see and the tougher it is going to be  for us to control the COVID-19 around the world and in the United  States of America.   With 104 million infections globally, this is a global pandemic and  requires a global response, and this budget resolution gives us the  wherewithal in order to do that.   And as Senator Menendez has pointed out, it is not only to deal with  the direct eradication of the virus, which we have to do, but the  consequences of the virus in world poverty and hunger and those issues  that are important for the United States to lead the global community  in dealing with the aftermath of this terrible virus.   So I just really wanted to come to the floor to underscore there are  so many reasons to support this budget resolution, but the one that I  just really wanted to underscore today is that we are not only dealing  with the issues at home, we are being responsible citizens of the  world, leading by example and leading by engagement, which will help  the healthcare of the people in America and our national security.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  rollcall be dispensed with and we use voice votes.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 716 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that 30  seconds of my time be devoted to Senator Portman.    I thank Senator Portman and Senator Menendez for  cosponsoring this amendment. Each of our States has challenges in the  adequacy and fairness of vaccine distribution systems. This amendment  would provide that there would be State and Federal support to the  States for implementing a transparent and consistent vaccine  administration program and bolstering States' awareness campaigns to  increase awareness and knowledge of the safety and effectiveness of  COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among vulnerable communities, including  ethnic minority populations.    I ask for the yeas and nays.  [[Page S438]]     Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. We  all know about the inequities in our criminal justice system, and we  have worked together to try to bridge some of those inequities. The SBA  tools help to bridge the inequities in regard to the opportunities in  America.   The Kennedy amendment would attempt to impose a lifetime prohibition  for a conviction of a misdemeanor for a civil disorder. It may have  happened 10, 20, 30 years ago. A person may have paid their price for  that, but this is moving in the wrong direction, and I would urge my  colleagues to reject this amendment.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on agreeing to the concurrent  resolution, as amended.   Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.
