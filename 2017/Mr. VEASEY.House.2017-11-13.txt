 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  co-anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour.   I also want to take the time to acknowledge our chair, the Honorable  Cedric Richmond from the State of Louisiana.   For the next hour, we have a chance to speak directly to the American  people on issues that are important to the Congressional Black Caucus.  The issue right now that seems to be of the most importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus and the constituents that we represent, and  the American public, for that matter, is tax reform, and the plan that  is being considered that the Speaker has indicated that he would like  for us to vote on this week.   We have a few Members here who would like to take the time to also  express their interest in this. This is a very big deal, obviously. We  don't do tax reform that often. The last time we did tax reform was in  the early 1980s, and that was, obviously, something that was very  bipartisan. This experience has not been bipartisan whatsoever, and we  are concerned also about the effect that it is going to have on our  constituencies.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to open it up for Members to talk about  whatever it is that they would like to, but I did want to let you know  that the main topic was going to be tax reform.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Payne for his participation again  and for always participating in the CBC Special Order hours. We know  that these are very important. Our constituencies, again, want to hear  how we stand on these issues. They are getting a lot of press right  now. So I thank the gentleman very much for being here this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), my  friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Payne very much for  speaking this evening on the importance of this tax bill and that we  debate this and really, again, just keep or constituents informed. Mr.  Payne takes every one seriously, and I know he has tried to participate  in as many of these as he can, and I thank him for that--again, the  importance of talking about this tax bill, talking about the  Republicans' past attempts at failed trickle-down policies and trying  to bring those same policies and put them in this tax reform bill and  trying to rush us into a floor vote this week.   We should all be working together to try to come up with some sort of  bipartisan solution, some sort of bipartisan policy position that will  be good for everyone, because I can tell you, Mr.  [[Page H9161]]  Speaker, that for many of the low-income and working class and lower  middle class constituents and middle class constituents in the district  that I represent, I know that people are going to be hurt.   Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. Payne is concerned about that. I know the 49  members of the Congressional Black Caucus are concerned about that.   This is very serious, and it could have very long-lasting  implications, as has been pointed out by advocacy groups and others  from all sides of the political spectrum. It is not just Democrats or  the Progressive community that is concerned about this. There are a lot  of people who are concerned about a variety of the different programs  here that are going to be affected.   Mr. Speaker, again, I appreciate everything that Mr. Payne brings to  this, particularly with him representing New Jersey, because we know  that, for that particular part of the country, housing and other goods  can sometimes be even more expensive, and it can be a very tough  hardship on families. When you add this tax bill to the fold, it makes  it even more daunting.    Mr. Speaker, we want to make sure the American Dream  doesn't become the American nightmare while people are trying to figure  out how they are going to make their house payment and pay for their  house.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Payne very much for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the city of Houston, Harris  County, our country's fourth largest city, Sheila Jackson Lee. I thank  Representative Jackson Lee for always participating in these Special  Order hours.   Mr. Speaker, I know that, in particular, the gentlewoman's concern is  Houston, being such a large part of our State, a large part of our  Nation's capital economy, and the effects of this tax bill. When you  start talking about something affecting Houston, with it being the  fourth largest city, it can have very consequential effects on our  entire State, because their economy is such a big part of what makes  Texas go.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gentlewoman for being a part of this.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague, my fellow Texan,  for her eloquence in laying out the issues with the Republican tax  plan.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), my  friend and colleague, for being here. I thank the gentleman for always  offering his insight on these matters. I know that, in addition, just  like the gentlewoman from Texas, that he is open to a broad array of  topics. I appreciate any insight the gentleman wants to give us on tax  reform or any of the other issues that the American public wants to  hear from their congressional representatives on this day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for laying  out those concerns about the tax plan, and he did so very eloquently. I  always appreciate the gentleman's participation.   Kind of building on what the gentleman talked about, I just want to  give the American public out there and the constituents that we  represent in the Congressional Black Caucus just a quick outline of who  exactly this plan will hurt.   I am very concerned about this terrible tax plan because it is going  to cut rates for the highest 1 percent of earners and corporations,  while increasing the tax burden on lower and middle class families,  while the Republicans are falsely going around claiming that they are  going to be helping these individuals and these families. That is just  not the case. That is not the case at all.   For example, let me give you one area that has been touched upon that  I am concerned about, and that is State and local taxes. You won't be  eligible any longer for the deduction, which means many individuals end  up paying twice the amount of taxes on the same income.   The elimination of deductions for student loan payments: we have  talked extensively on this House floor, on the Democratic side, about  what students loans are doing to this country and the costs of a higher  education. We know that a lot of people seek out higher education just  because of the benefits that it can yield incomewise, and everybody is,  again, always trying to see  [[Page H9165]]  how they are going to live that American Dream. They want to be able to  pay their taxes, pay their car payment, pay their house note, whatever  it may happened to be. When you look at the fact that people won't be  able to write off their student loans to help pay for their education  anymore, that is really going to hurt and probably convince a lot of  young people that they just shouldn't seek out higher education.                                time  2015    We want young people to seek out a higher education. I mean, even the  blue-collar jobs out there we know are becoming harder and harder to  keep and maintain, and they require some form of education. Even going  to community college for a couple years after they graduate from high  school almost seems to be something that they have to do.   The Center for American Progress found that 78 percent of Black  students, in comparison to 57 percent of White students, took out  Federal loans for their undergraduate studies. And again, just not  being able to write those off means that dream that everyone has,  regardless of race, being able to buy their first home, the American  Dream, they are going to have to put that off because they can no  longer pay off these very costly student loan interest payments. These  tax deduction eliminations are going to be very troubling for so many  people in the community in light of the fight just to build  generational wealth.   Again, these trickle-down tactics, we have been talking about  trickle-down economics now for a very long time, but some of these  trickle-down tactics are proving not to work, and it is disheartening  to see the finish line just being moved again and again, just over and  over again. Every time people seem like they are doing better, just to  see that finish line moved once again and making it just hard on these  families that I talked about earlier that fall in those lower middle  class, working class, middle class tax brackets.   You are talking about, when you look at this really closely, the  restructuring of these tax brackets under the Republican plan would  make it so that the lowest income earners' tax rates are going to  increase from 10 to 12 percent, the lowest earners out there. Some of  the poorest amongst us will have their tax burden increased, and it  will make it so much more difficult for them to climb that economic  ladder of opportunity. It is already hard to climb that ladder of  opportunity.   Just think about it for just a minute, if you have two kids and you  have a 10 percent tax burden, and you are making a small amount of  money a year but you are out there working hard every day. You are  trying to get overtime. You are punching the clock as much as you  possibly can. You are having Grandma watch the kids just so you can  pull that extra shift to get those hours in, but you are a single mom  and you are just really out there just busting it each and every day,  week after week, and you still don't have any money in the bank. You  are still having a hard time making ends meet. You are still getting  rent notices put on the door once a month. It is just so tough, and  just to know that we are not really going to be doing anything at all  in this body. The Republicans aren't going to be doing anything to help  these individuals be able to climb out of that hole and just be able to  see the light. Just knowing that that mom and those kids are going to  probably struggle under this tax plan until the kids leave the house,  it is just really disheartening.   In addition to that, even the tax provisions that are aimed at  helping working families are actually reserved, again, for just the  wealthiest few in the community.   White House Republicans highlight their expansion of the child tax  credit. Many of the lowest income parents who are in need of assistance  will only be eligible to receive a partial amount of the tax credit, if  any of the expansion at all.   According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the GOP  child tax credit keeps the lowest income workers from benefiting from  the expansion of the credit, despite numerous studies finding that the  child tax credits benefit children by improving school performance,  higher college enrollment, and increasing earnings in adulthood.   Further, this tax plan refuses to take the interests of African- American communities as a whole into consideration, ensuring those who  are striving to reach the American Dream will simply fall short.   Again, there is just so much in this bill that is going to be tough.   You are talking about repealing the estate tax. There are so many  people whom I have heard--Rockefellers, Buffetts, Bill Gates, and  others--who are saying that they are fine paying that, that they are  absolutely okay with paying that. You think about what we are going to  take away from people so they don't have to pay that estate tax. I  mean, it is just amazing.   You have heard so many of my colleagues talk about it earlier here,  but when you start talking about the local and State tax deductions,  when you start talking about the student loan deductions that people  really count on, when you start talking about child tax credits, when  you start talking about new market tax credits, so many programs and so  many things out there that are really helping individuals, helping our  economy, and we want to give it back so a few wealthy people don't have  to pay estate taxes? I mean, it is just really sad, Mr. Speaker, when  you think about that.   One of the things that I think that we ought to do, instead of giving  ultrarich people a pass on paying a billion dollars that they can pass  down to heirs, is that we ought to start thinking about doing something  to help grandparents who are raising grandchildren.   I will never forget, when I was in the State legislature, I had a  principal come up to me on the house floor, and I was showing the  kids--I believe it was on the senate floor. We had walked to the other  side. And there is a picture of the Battle of San Jacinto that hangs  there in Austin at the capitol, and I was showing the schoolchildren,  and the principal pulled me aside and she said: I want to thank you for  talking about grandparents who are raising grandchildren.   She said: Over 50 percent of the kids at the elementary school where  I am principal are raised by someone other than their parent, and 99  percent of the time it is the grandparent.   Instead of giving superrich people, ultrarich people a pass on paying  the inheritance tax, why don't we give grandparents who serve as  primary caregivers for their grandchildren out there a $500 refundable  tax credit? That would help out so much, because you have to think  about what these grandparents are facing.    They didn't think that their Social Security check or their pension  check was going to have to be used to help pay for school supplies,  help pay for school clothes, help pay for backpacks, help pay for  school uniforms, help pay for kids' haircuts, prom dresses. The  grandparents of America out there are really balancing a lot now, more  than any other generation of grandparents have.   We could take the money that we are going to give away to the Bill  Gateses and the Warren Buffetts and the Rockefellers and other folks  like that, and we could give it to these grandparents, grandparents who  represent people from every congressional district in this country.   Oftentimes, you start talking about grandparents who are raising  grandchildren, there has been some kind of issue with drugs or alcohol  in the kids' parents' life or some other reason why the parents can't  take care of the kids. We know that that is true, particularly with the  issues that we have had with the opioid crisis. We know that this is an  area that is growing in all congressional districts, all races, all  backgrounds.   Again, why not give our grandparents out there that are buying  backpacks with their Social Security check, why not give them a $500  refundable tax credit to help them make ends meet? If we were to do  that, these grandparents would be able to have a little bit more money  to buy healthier foods instead of buying processed foods. They could  buy fruits, vegetables, other things like that that could really go a  long way in just helping them maintain their household.   That is what I am eager to do. I want to sit down with colleagues and  come up with something that is fair. I think  [[Page H9166]]  that everybody here that I have talked to has said that they want to  work in a bipartisan manner to be able to pass a tax reform bill that  is fair, that is done under regular order, that is done with  transparency and done in the light, but the way that this is happening,  it is just not right.   We know, again, that these trickle-down economics just simply do not  work, and we need to start all over. We need to head back to the  drawing board and sit down as Democrats and Republicans like they did  back in the eighties when Reagan was President and Tip O'Neill was  Speaker and work out some of these issues that the American public has.   We know that people are very anxious about some of the things that  they have been hearing about this tax reform bill, people from all  congressional districts and, again, all backgrounds. We in the  Congressional Black Caucus, we are concerned about the impact that this  is going to have in the African-American communities around this  country--and all of the communities, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker.   Again, let's just sit down at the drawing board, talk about some of  these things, and come up with something that is fair that the American  public can feel good about, knowing that Members of Congress, that they  are not trying to gain advantage over one another, that we are trying  to come up with a fair way how to reform our Tax Code, keep our  businesses here, and keep a little bit more money in people's pockets  at the end of the week or the end of the month, whenever they get paid,  so they can take care of their families and buy a home, take care of  their grandkids, do whatever it is they need to do in order to make  ends meet.   Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for this evening, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                            ____________________
