 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  51.   For more than 200 years, Americans living in the District of  Columbia--many of whom serve the people of this great Nation as public  servants--have been denied the right to self-government. That is a  founding principle of our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, today, D.C. is home to more than 700,000 Americans and,  yet, they have no voting Members of Congress and no voice in the  Senate.   Establishing Washington, Douglass Commonwealth would not create our  Nation's smallest State by population, nor would it be reliant on the  Federal Government to survive.    There are States with smaller populations and many other States that  are far more dependent on Federal assistance.   Despite paying more in total Federal income tax than the residents of  22 other States, D.C. is continually treated like a territory instead  of a State in funding bills. These calculations starve the local  government of the funds they rightly deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues listen to the voice of our Founding  Fathers, who we keep hearing about. ``No taxation without  representation.'' Well, D.C. pays its taxes. It deserves a voice in  Congress. And let's be clear about who is playing politics.
