 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this is not about the budget, but it is  about something that all of us can, unfortunately, understand the  importance of.   On Sunday, October 1, U.S. naval aviation instructor, LT Patrick L.  Ruth, and student naval aviator, LTJG Wallace Burch, were both killed  when their Goshawk training jet crashed in Tellico Plains, TN.  Lieutenant Ruth was a native of Louisiana, growing up in Metairie.  Lieutenant Ruth served in the Navy for 9 years, beginning his career in  the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at Tulane University. He was  commissioned in May of 2008. After flight training, he joined Carrier  Airborne Early Warning Squadron 126, based in Norfolk, VA, in 2012.   Lieutenant Ruth flew the E-2C Hawkeye as part of the tactical air  forces of the U.S. Navy. His primary mission was early warning defense  of the carrier battle group, as well as air strike control, ocean  surveillance, and search and rescue coordination.   In April 2015, he moved to Naval Training Squadron 7, based in  Meridian, MS.   As an instructor, Lieutenant Ruth trained the next generation of  naval aviators in strike aviation, basic aircraft maneuvering, and  landing skills.  [[Page S6618]]    Lieutenant Ruth was a dedicated naval aviator. As evidence, he earned  two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals during his distinguished  career.   Our brave men and women in uniform take extreme risks every day to  defend our Nation. The risks are necessary, made to ensure that our  military is fully prepared to face any threat. We are forever grateful  for Lieutenant Ruth and those who answer the call of duty to keep us  safe.   We must also think of the incredible sacrifices of Lieutenant Ruth's  family and all military families. They may not be wearing uniforms, but  they, too, serve our country.   I had the privilege of speaking with Lieutenant Ruth's family. I  learned that his younger brother Shane is Active Duty Navy. His older  brother is retired Navy. His sisters were, and are, so supportive.   Lieutenant Ruth's parents, David and Mary Ann Ruth, still grieve. How  could any parent not?   But to borrow from President Lincoln's letter to a grieving mother:         I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of       your bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of       the loved and lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours       to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the alter of freedom.    Lieutenant Ruth is survived by his parents, David and Mary; his  fiance, Jessica; and his four siblings. We grieve with you. You are in  our prayers.   Lieutenant Patrick Ruth will not be forgotten.   I yield the floor.
