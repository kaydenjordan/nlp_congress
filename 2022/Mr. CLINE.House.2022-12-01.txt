 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great  Virginian, WDBJ7's legendary meteorologist, Robin Reed, as Reed  recently announced his well-deserved retirement from local news.   Since graduating from James Madison University in 1978, Reed pursued  a career in local journalism. Forty of his 44 years in the business  have been at WDBJ7 out of Roanoke.   Even though weathermen take undeserved hits for nasty weather  forecasts, Reed's long-running weather reports were a favorite of the  community, sunshine, rain, or snow.   Additionally, Reed teaches as a professor of practice at Virginia  Tech School of Communication, a position he will continue in, preparing  the next generation to improve their communication skills for the  betterment of society.   Reed is also a devout family man, as his children remember him  regularly coming to big events in their lives, from marching band  performances to camping in the Adirondacks with the Scouts.   Among numerous journalistic accomplishments, Reed received the  Citizen of the Year Award in Media from the Roanoke branch of the NAACP  and was honored as a favorite member of the Virginia Tech faculty after  being nominated by numerous students.   I join countless Roanoke Valley residents and viewers in wishing Reed  a great retirement and thank him for his lasting contributions to local  journalism.                            ____________________
