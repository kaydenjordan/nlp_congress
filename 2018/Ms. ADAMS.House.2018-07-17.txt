 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I offer this amendment to underscore the  importance of the EPA's Environmental Justice Program.   H.R. 6147 cuts more than $700,000 in funding from this important  program that has made an incredible difference in many communities  across the country, including in my State of North Carolina.   The Environmental Justice Program supports and empowers communities  as they work to address significant environmental and public health  issues at the local level.                                time  2215    In North Carolina, this program has provided funding for 13 different  initiatives since 2001, including the Environmental Justice Education  and Research Center at Shaw University, which engages high school and  college students in environmental justice research; the Healthy Homes  Greensboro collaborative, which works to reduce housing-related asthma  hospitalizations in low-income, minority neighborhoods resulting from  exposure to toxic chemicals; and Clean Energy Durham, which runs a  volunteer-driven, neighbor-to-neighbor energy education program for  low-income residents of Lee County.   Nationally, this program has helped do everything from cleaning  contaminated soil on reservations to managing oil spills from an  abandoned power plant in Cleveland.  [[Page H6452]]    This program has had a measurable benefit for the people who live  closest to pollution sites. This is crucially important, as people of  color and people with little means are often the most affected by  environmental injustice.   In fact, the environmental justice movement began in Warren County,  North Carolina. In 1982, a small, predominantly African American  community in Warren County was designated to host a hazardous waste  landfill. In response, the NAACP and others staged a massive protest.  More than 500 civil rights activists were arrested during the  nonviolent sit-in protesting the landfill. While their protests failed  to prevent the landfill's construction, it did spark a movement, and it  has served as a model for fighting against environmental injustice  since.   The EPA's Environmental Justice Program helps communities fight  against these same forces. It works to ensure that no group of people  should bear a disproportionate share of negative environmental  consequences from commercial operations or policies.   H.R. 6147 cuts more than $700,000 in funding from this program, and  that is unacceptable. Funding for this program should be increased, and  substantially more than the $6.7 million that was appropriated in  fiscal year 2018.   Cutting out funding for this program neglects dozens of communities  of color, subjecting them to filthy air, unsafe drinking water, and the  health impacts that go along with that. This amendment simply  highlights that fact and challenges that Congress must do better.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman, but I respectfully  disagree with my colleague.   The EPA's Environmental Justice Program provides substantial help to  communities directly affected by pollution and negative environmental  consequences.   Too often, it is communities of color or low-income communities that  are disproportionately affected by negative environmental effects.   A study released this February by EPA scientists found that, in 46  States, communities of color are more likely to be exposed to higher  levels of dangerous air pollution than White communities. Additionally,  in 2012, a study by the NAACP found that coal-fired power plants are  disproportionately concentrated near communities of color.   Thankfully, the Environmental Justice Program and their initiatives  like the Environmental Justice Small Grants Program have helped to  support and empower underserved communities across the Nation as they  develop solutions to environmental pollution.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  McCollum).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
