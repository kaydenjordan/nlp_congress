 Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Illinois  that there ought to be a legislative solution to the DACA children. In  fact, we had one in 2013. We worked on it in a bipartisan way--solved a  large number of immigration issues, trying to have a legal immigration  system. We sent it to the House, and the House didn't consider it. I am  ready to continue to do that.   I disagree with one thing that happened today, though, about bringing  bills to the floor. He talked about the importance of bringing the DACA  legislation to the floor. That is important once we have an agreement  either in the committee or among us informally.   The second bill that is very important to bring to the floor is the  National Defense Authorization Act, which has been enacted for more  than 50 years and to which members of the Armed Services Committee have  a chance to offer amendments.   But Senator McConnell is the majority leader, and because he is, he  has one right, really, which is to decide what to bring to the floor.  He pushed aside the National Defense Authorization Act, which is  important, and said: In these times, I think the important thing for me  to do is to bring to the floor legislation on police reform and racial  justice and allow the Senate to have an open amendment process. He did  that in what would be the logical way. Since he is the majority leader,  he offered a majority bill sponsored by Senator Tim Scott and  cosponsored by a number of us on the Republican side.   The vote we had a little earlier today was, shall we proceed to the  issue of racial justice and police reform, starting with the Scott  bill, with an open amendment process?   Now what does that mean? That means that any Democrat could offer the  House bill, or any Democrat could offer any other amendment. Now we  have gotten into a bad habit around here, which I know the Senator from  Illinois doesn't like either, which is if he offers an amendment and I  object to his amendment, and then, if I offer an amendment, he says:  Well, you objected to mine; I will object to yours. And so we don't  have any amendments. But we should be able to bring an important bill  to the floor, whether it is DACA or national defense or whether it is,  criminal justice, and say that it is open for amendment, and let's have  amendments.   I think that has happened so little over the last several years that  people have forgotten how to do it. If you don't like the amendment,  someone can move to table it. That takes 51 votes, and sometimes it is  60 votes. If we get to the end of the process and the minority side  doesn't like the bill the way it is, they can keep it from going off  the floor by refusing to give 60 votes. So it was very disappointing  when the majority leader has taken a limited number of weeks and said:  OK, I will give a week and a half to racial justice and police reform,  starting with a majority bill and offering to the entire Senate a  chance to amend it. For the other side to say: No, we will not even let  you go to the bill, I think is very disappointing. Senator Scott is  disappointed, and many of us are, and I don't believe it distinguishes  the Senate when that occurs.                             Pandemic Preparation    Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk briefly about a  hearing we held yesterday in the HELP Committee on the next pandemic:  What do we need to do to prepare for the next pandemic?   That caused at least one Senator to say: What are we doing talking  about the next pandemic when we are in the middle of a big one right  now and we have a lot of work to do?   We do have a lot of work to do, but I want to answer that question.   The reason we have to talk about the next pandemic is that we have  short memories. Memories fade. We go on to the next issue, and we don't  do everything we needed to do.   We have had public health emergencies before. Some Senators were here  when anthrax drove Senators from their offices. There was SARS and the  2009 flu pandemic. There was Ebola. There was MRSA. Four Presidents-- Bush, Obama, Trump, and Clinton--all reacted to those in the way you  would think. They issued reports, and they made proposals. We passed  nine laws and many new regulations. We tried to do some things to be  ready for the next public health emergency. We built buildings to  manufacture vaccines. We created a new structure for managing public  health emergency. We changed the way the national stockpile is managed.  We did a number of things.   One of our witnesses yesterday was Senator Bill Frist, who was the  majority leader during the mid-2000s. He said he made 20 speeches on or  about 2005 when he said the only question about the next pandemic is  not whether it is coming but when it will come. He listed six things  that needed to be done back then. Well, the reason we had the hearing  yesterday was that we didn't get all of those things done.   Now, some people might say: Well, weren't we prepared for this  pandemic? And most experts felt that we were pretty well prepared. I  read yesterday in the hearing a front-page story from the New York  Times on March 1 of this year about COVID-19. Let me just go back.  March 1 was 6 weeks after we knew about the disease. At the time, we  had about 100 cases in the United States and only 2 deaths. There were  many cases around the world. But at that time, the New York Times  reported that experts said it is ``far from certain'' that this disease  would spread to all parts of the country, especially at the same time,  and experts believed that the United States was as well prepared as any  country to deal with this pandemic. That was on March 1. Two and one- half weeks later, we began to shut down the whole country by order of  the Government.   So we were prepared, but we were surprised, too, and we  underestimated this virus and how aggressive it is and how contagious  it is and the fact that it can travel silently without symptoms.   So Dr. Frist was one of the witnesses yesterday. Mike Leavitt, a  former Secretary of Health and Human Services, former Governor of Utah,  was another. Julie Gerberding, who was former head of the Centers for  Disease Control, was yet another. She is now at Merck. Dr. Khaldun, who  is the chief medical officer of the State of Michigan was there.   We talked about the next pandemic. Why talk about it now? Because of  the things that Dr. Frist mentioned 20 years ago and the things that  really need to get done, we didn't get that all done in between  pandemics. Why? We have short memories. Four or five months ago we were  in the middle of an impeachment of the President. That sounds like  ancient Roman history today.   Our minds go on to the next crisis if we don't get things done. So  the time to look at the next pandemic is while we are in the middle of  this one and say: What are we lacking? What could we do better? And  let's fix it while the iron is hot, while our eye is on it.  [[Page S3185]]    For example, one of the things that they suggested that we do--all of  the witnesses--is that we have a dedicated source of funding for  stockpiles and for research.   Do you think that is easy to do? I don't think it will be easy to get  done. It took us years to pass the outdoor recreation bill, the Great  American Outdoors Act, because of those kinds of funding issues. We are  more likely to create a dedicated stream of funding for preparedness  for the next pandemic if we do it in the middle of this pandemic, when  we have our eye on the ball.   Another recommendation is that we should have an office in the  National Security Council to provide coordination between epidemics and  during the next one. That is not easy to do, either. When is the best  time to do it? Now, during this pandemic, when we have our eye on the  ball.   Another proposal that came up very often is that we ought to build  manufacturing plants for vaccines that we don't use between pandemics  and that we ought to spend the money to keep them ``open and warm,'' in  the words of Mike Leavitt, so that they are ready when suddenly a  pandemic comes   Remember, this one hit us fast. There were not many cases on March 1  and shutting down the government by the end of March. We need those  manufacturing plants and that is something we haven't gotten done in  the way we should have gotten done--some of it. When is the next best  time to do it? Now, while we have our eye on the ball.   Strengthening our State and local public health systems--Governor  Leavitt said that over the last 40 years, we have consistently  underfunded our State and local health systems. They are the leaders in  our effort to deal with this or any pandemic, including the next one.  When is the next time to get over this bad habit of underfunding our  State and local public health systems? Right now, when we see that we  need it and we see what deficiencies we might have.   Now on stockpiles, in between some of these earlier pandemics, we  changed the management of the stockpile, spent some money to ensure  protective equipment was in there and the things we need. It turned out  not to be sufficient. Why? The problem was that between pandemics, we  took our eyes off the ball and budgets got tight and States and  hospitals began to save money by getting rid of the things in their  local stockpiles. So for all of those reasons, the things that we need  to do need to be done now.   I put out a white paper a few weeks ago inviting comment from experts  around the country on what we need to do now to prepare for the next  pandemic. Item No. 1 was tests, treatments, and vaccines. How do we  accelerate research and development? We are doing a good job now.  Hopefully, we will learn from that for the next pandemic.   On disease surveillance, there is a lot of criticism of the Centers  for Disease Control's inability to gather all the data it needs to  track emerging diseases in the way that it should. Now is the time to  deal with that.   Stockpiles, distributions, and surges in hospitals. We had to shut  down hospitals' elective surgeries, creating enormous costs all across  the country. We had to come up with $175 billion just over the last 3  months to try to help hospitals recover that. Can we not do a different  job of preparing for the surge of patients that will come with a  pandemic? Maybe the best time to do that is while we are in the midst  of a pandemic.   On public health capabilities, I mentioned strengthening the local  public health system. Then, who is on the flagpole? Is there a better  way to have a Supreme Allied Commander with all the various agencies  that we have today.   Those plus the need for dedicated funding are difficult issues. The  answer to the question, ``Why in the world are we having a hearing on  the next pandemic when we are in the middle of this one?'' is because  for the last 20 years, between pandemics, we hadn't gotten the job done  on some of the things that needed to be done that Dr. Frist mentioned  when he was majority leader in 20 speeches, 20 years ago. So if we  can't do it between pandemics, let's do it during a pandemic. That is  what our hearing was about.   It was a good hearing--terrific witnesses, good suggestions. At the  end, I asked all four witnesses to please summarize the three things  that each one thought should be done this year if they could. As it  turns out, they are all hard to do, and, second, most of them would not  only help with the next pandemic, but they will help with the current  one that we are in.   That was our fourth hearing this month by the HELP Committee. We have  had a hearing on going back to college safely. We had one on going back  to school safely. Those two hearings made clear to me the need for us  to consider if we have another piece of COVID legislation in July, that  it needs to include sufficient funds to make sure our 100,000 schools  and 6,000 colleges can open safely in the fall. The way to open the  economy is to go back to school and back to college and back to  childcare. That will get us back to work. Two-thirds of the married  families in this country have parents, both of whom work outside the  home. Children aren't learning when they are let out of school in March  and don't go back to school in 6 months or maybe even in 8 or 10  months, if they don't go back in the fall. So there is some health  risk, but if we do our job here to provide sufficient funds in July to  make sure our 100,000 schools and 6,000 colleges can open safely, that  will be the surest avenue toward normalcy in the year 2020 before we  have a vaccine.   We also had a hearing last week on telehealth. We have had 10 years  of experience crammed into 3 months. We have gone from very little  telehealth medical services delivered remotely to, in some cases, 40  percent or 50 percent of the doctor-patient visits being done remotely.  Many people think that will level off at 15 to 20 percent. That would  probably be the biggest change in delivery of medical services in our  Nation's history. I can't think of a bigger one. Hundreds of millions  of visits will be done remotely instead of in-person.   I recommended that at least the two major changes that we have made  temporarily in telehealth be made permanent. Yesterday was what to do  about the next pandemic.   Next Tuesday will be our fifth hearing this month, and it will  include Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Hahn, and Admiral Giroir, who will  give us an update on going back to school and college and work.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have my opening statement  from yesterday's hearing printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             Opening Statement          COVID-19: Lessons Learned to Prepare for the Next Pandemic                              [June 23, 2020]         Less than four months ago, on March 1--when the coronavirus       had caused a little more than 3,000 deaths worldwide and 2       deaths in the United States--The New York Times reported:       ``With its top-notch scientists, modern hospitals and       sprawling public health infrastructure, most experts agree,       the United States is among the countries best prepared to       prevent or manage such an epidemic.''        Even the experts underestimated the ease of transmission       and the ability of this novel coronavirus to spread without       symptoms.        Those qualities have made the virus--in the words of       infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, ``my worst       nightmare.''        ``In the period of four months, it has devastated the       world,'' Dr. Fauci said recently in remarks at a virtual       convention.        This committee is holding this hearing today because, even       with an event as significant as COVID-19, memories fade and       attention moves quickly to the next crisis.        While the nation is in the midst of responding to COVID-19,       the United States Congress should take stock now of what       parts of the local, state, and federal response worked, what       could work better and how, and be prepared to pass       legislation this year to better prepare for the next       pandemic, which will surely come.        On June 9, I released a white paper outlining 5       recommendations for Congress to prepare Americans for the       next pandemic:        1. Tests, Treatments, and Vaccines--Accelerate Research and       Development        2. Disease Surveillance--Expand Ability to Detect,       Identify, Model, and Track Emerging Infectious Diseases        3. Stockpiles, Distribution, and Surges--Rebuild and       Maintain Federal and State  [[Page S3186]]       Stockpiles and Improve Medical Supply Surge Capacity and       Distribution        4. Public Health Capabilities--Improve State and Local       Capacity to Respond        5. Who Is on the Flagpole?--Improve Coordination of Federal       Agencies During a Public Health Emergency        I have invited comments, responses, and any additional       recommendations for the Senate Committee on Health,       Education, Labor and Pensions to consider. This feedback will       be shared with my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican.        This is not a new subject for any of the witnesses we have       today.        Fifteen years ago, then Majority Leader of the Senate, Bill       Frist, said in a speech at the National Press Club that a       viral pandemic was no longer a question of if, but a question       of when. He recommended what he calls a ``6 point public       health prescription to minimize the blow--communication,       surveillance, antivirals, vaccines, research, stockpile/surge       capacity.''        Sen. Frist is one of our witnesses today. I am including       two of his speeches in the hearing record.        Our next witness, Dr. Joneigh S. Khaldun (jo-NAY kal-DOON)       serves as the Chief Medical Executive and Chief Deputy       Director for Health at the Michigan Department of Health and       Human Services, where she has worked with other state and       federal agencies to coordinate Michigan's response to COVID-      19.        Another witness is Dr. Julie Gerberding, who served as the       Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       under President George W. Bush, and helped lead preparedness       efforts and the response to SARS, West Nile Virus, H5Nl avian       influenza, and the rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria like       MRSA.        Another witness is Governor Michael Leavitt, who served as       Governor of Utah and as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human       Services and Administrator of the Environmental Protection       Agency under President George W. Bush.        Following the emergence of HSN1 avian flu, Governor Leavitt       increasingly focused his efforts on pandemic preparedness. As       Secretary in 2007, he said this: ``Everything we do before a       pandemic will seem alarmist. Everything we do after a       pandemic will seem inadequate. This is the dilemma we face,       but it should not stop us from doing what we can to       prepare.''        Congress has passed legislation to prepare for pandemics       before: During the past 20 years, four Presidents and several       Congresses enacted nine significant laws to help local,       state, and federal governments, as well as hospitals and       health care providers, to prepare for a public health       emergency, including a pandemic.        Congress provided over $18 billion to states and hospital       preparedness systems over the last 15 years to help them       prepare as well.        In writing those laws, Congress considered many reports       from presidential administrations, Offices of Inspectors       General, the Government Accountability Office, and outside       experts.        The reports contained warnings that the U.S. needed to       address the following issues: better methods to quickly       develop tests, treatments, and vaccines and scale up       manufacturing capacity: better systems to quickly identify       emerging infectious diseases; more training for the health       care and public health workforces; better distribution of       medical supplies; and better systems to share information       within and among states, and between states and the federal       government.        Many reports also warned that while states play the lead       role in a public health response, many states did not have       enough trained doctors, nurses and health care professionals;       had inadequate stockpiles; and struggled with funding       challenges. In some instances, overreliance on inflexible       federal funding contributed to these problems.        Looking at lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis thus       far, many of the challenges Congress has worked to address       during the last 20 years still remain.        Additionally, COVID-19 has exposed some gaps that had not       been previously identified. These include unanticipated       shortages of testing supplies and sedative drugs, which are       necessary to use ventilators for COVID-19 patients.        Memories fade and attention moves quickly to the next       crisis. That makes it imperative that Congress act on needed       changes this year in order to better prepare for the next       pandemic.        I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and I       also appreciate the feedback we are receiving on the white       paper. I have set a deadline for June 26 on that feedback so       the committee has time to draft and pass legislation this       year.     I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         Committee on Armed Services    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Wednesday, June 24, 2020, at a time to be  determined, to conduct a hearing on nominations.                            ____________________
