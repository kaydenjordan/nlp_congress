 Madam Speaker, this week, the House will  pass major legislation to reassert America's leadership on climate  change.   America's leadership on this issue cannot be more urgent and needed.  The current administration has ignored the consensus of scientists and  the need to act in a responsible manner.   Nearly 50 years ago on the first Earth Day, tens of millions of  Americans demanded change from their government. Later that year, seven  major pieces of legislation were signed into law--the Clean Water Act,  the Clean Air Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act--with overwhelming  bipartisan support.   Last week was Earth Day, and I saw firsthand that my community of  western New York continues to lead to confront this challenge. With  students finding ways to reduce the carbon footprint, Re-Tree Western  New York celebrated 30,000 new tree plantings, and the Western New York  Land Conservancy is preserving green space for generations to come.   Now Congress needs to follow this example and restore America's  leadership role on the environment.                            ____________________
