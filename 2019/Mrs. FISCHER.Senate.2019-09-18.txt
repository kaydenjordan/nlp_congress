 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life and  legacy of Chief Standing Bear. In about an hour, Members of the  Nebraska congressional delegation, Governor Ricketts, and House and  Senate leaders will gather in Statuary Hall to dedicate a statue in his  honor. I am proud that the State of Nebraska put forth his statue  because America needs to hear his story.   When Joe Starita, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln  and esteemed author, speaks on Chief Standing Bear's life, he often  begins with reciting a quote from novelist, poet, and farmer Wendell  Berry. Wendell Berry once wrote: If you do not understand where you  are, you do not understand who you are.   If you live in Nebraska, you understand this fully. This knowledge  doesn't come from maps or directions. It springs from a true love of  the land--working on it, cultivating it, raising a family, building  strong communities, taking pride in your life's work, and the sweat and  tears that generations of your family put into it. It means enduring  its disasters and enjoying those cool peaceful nights full of  stars. Chief Standing Bear and the Ponca Tribe understood this.    Imagine his surprise when on a cold January day in 1877, he and his  Tribe were told to leave their beloved land. His Tribe had lived on  their reservation for more than 200 years, and now they were being  forced to travel nearly 600 miles to the south to Indian territory in  Oklahoma.   Under the threat of bayonets, the young and old, men, women, and  children packed up their possessions and began to walk. By the time the  Tribe reached the territory, they were enduring the scorching months of  summer.   Harvest season had passed, and the Tribe could not grow crops for the  winter months. Starvation was rampant, and mosquitoes swarmed the  reservation with malaria. After a year and a half, the Ponca lost over  one-third of their Tribe, including Chief Standing Bear's son.   In the final moments of his life, his son made him promise that he  would be buried in the Ponca Tribe's homeland in Nebraska.   To give his son the sacred burial he wanted, Chief Standing Bear led  a 600-mile quest back to Nebraska, but with only an estimated 2 days of  travel left ahead, he was stopped by the U.S. Cavalry and arrested.  Chief Standing Bear was thrown in prison and was forced to prove that  he had God-given rights as a human being.   During this time, word began to spread throughout communities about  his journey. Suddenly, people began to rally around this devoted  father's story. Eventually, cries for justice resulted in a historic  trial in the U.S. District Court in Omaha.   The lawyers made their arguments. Then the judge granted Chief  Standing Bear the opportunity to speak. The Chief rose and stood in  silence while the packed courtroom anxiously waited. What followed was  one of the greatest speeches in American history.   Turning to face the judge, he held up his hand and said:         This hand is not the color of yours, but if I pierce it, I       shall feel pain. If you pierce your hand, you also feel pain.       The blood that will flow from mine will be of the same color       as yours. I am a man. The same God made us both.    Reports tell us that when Chief Standing Bear was finished speaking,  the courtroom was filled with sounds of sobbing. A local Omaha World  Herald reporter recounted that he saw tears on the judge's face. GEN  George Crook, the defendant in the case, was one of the first in the  sea of people to shake the Chief's hand. Days later, the judge ruled in  favor of Chief Standing Bear.   At long last, the landmark decision extended ``equal justice under  law'' to Native Americans.   Nearly 75 years later, a courageous woman carried a similar message  of equality in Montgomery, AL. Rosa Parks, whose statue is also in  Statuary Hall, knew that standing strong for her God-given dignity was  worth risking everything she had.   Months after her arrest, she said she ``would have to know for once  and for all what rights I had as a human being and a citizen.''   I will close with this. The room we will gather in later for the  dedication ceremony is known as Statuary Hall. Until 1857, the House of  Representatives met there, and their business was overseen by another  statue, Clio--the muse of history. She was the source of inspiration  for the political leaders at the time and served as a reminder that  they were part of history.   She is still there above the door leading to the Rotunda, keeping  notes, documenting who we are now and where we are going. Today she  will turn a new page.   In Statuary Hall, the very room where she observed Congress  shamefully passing the Indian Removal Act, we will dedicate a statue to  honor the life of Chief Standing Bear. It is another important lesson  in our Nation's story that in the end, with bravery, determination, and  empathy, human freedom will always prevail.   It is a great honor to celebrate the life and contributions of Chief  Standing Bear. I know his statue will inspire millions of visitors who  visit the U.S. Capitol every year. I am proud that Chief Standing  Bear's legacy and the message of equality lives on in our great  cathedral of democracy.   I yield the floor.
