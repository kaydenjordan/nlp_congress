 Mr. Speaker, December is National Impaired Driving  Prevention Month. We know that during this time of the year, with so  many holidays in a compact amount of time, that the risk is higher.  Indeed, over one-third of traffic-related deaths in the United States  involve a drunk driver; and we know that, throughout the holiday  season, drunk-driving crashes increase.   For example, last December nearly 1,000 people in the U.S. died in  alcohol-related crashes, and 35 of those happened on Christmas Day.  Every single one of those deaths is preventable.   I sincerely thank our law enforcement and our first responders for  being there on the scene during these tragedies and working to prevent  them from being worse and from having these impaired accidents happen.  However, the decision to drive sober comes from taking personal  responsibility for all of our actions and making travel plans before  your holiday celebrations begin.   Let's keep every seat at our Christmas tables and at our holiday  tables during this time of year safely filled with family and friends  instead of tragedy. Let's make sure our loved ones are making smart  choices and help them out to be smart and safe during this time of the  year.                            ____________________
