 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  30 seconds in morning business.    Madam President, as the Congress considers the defense  authorization bill--called the NDAA--this week, I hope that my  amendments to improve the Pentagon's financial management systems and  crack down on wasteful spending will be supported.   Thirty years after Congress passed the Chief Financial Officers Act,  the Department of Defense remains the only executive agency in our  Federal Government that cannot get a clean audit opinion.   Every dollar of defense spending should be used to ensure our  Nation's security and support for our men and women in uniform, which  is why the Department of Defense needs to be held accountable for  waste, fraud, and abuse. A clean audit has something to do with proof  that they can do that.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, since I reclaimed chairmanship of the  Finance Committee at the start of this Congress, one of my top  priorities has been to fix the failing multiemployer pension system and  to help secure retirement benefits of more than 10 million workers and  retirees in these multiemployer plans.   This is especially important since 150 multiemployer plans have  failed or terminated, and many others are expected to run out of money  in the coming 10 years. In the decade after that, many more plans are  expected to fail. In all, more than 1.5 million Americans would be  affected by the failure of these multiemployer pension plans.   Now, the coronavirus has had its effect on these plans as well. We  don't yet have a firm read on how much the economic downturn has  affected plans' funding or even the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation's insurance fund backing up those plans that have failed.  We expect more details on those issues later this summer.   Now, one thing that we do know for sure is that this problem is only  going to get worse and more costly to resolve if we wait longer to  solve it. That is why all this concentration at this point. Now we have  a real opportunity to get it fixed--and hopefully this year.   Last November, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee  chairman Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and I released a draft plan to  reform the multiemployer pension system, protect retirees, and at the  same time secure the PBGC's insurance fund. We received many thoughtful  and constructive comments, and we worked over the past several months  to address those comments to make our reform plan as effective and  balanced as possible.   So what is standing in the way? The usual thing: You have got to have  bipartisanship to get anything done in the U.S. Senate. The short  answer is that the Democratic leadership doesn't seem to be very  interested in working to find that bipartisan solution. They seem to  think the no-strings bailout which they tried to force into the CARES  Act in March and which now appears in the House's HEROES Act is somehow  a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. That doesn't work very well,  particularly in the Senate, where it takes bipartisanship to get  anything done.   I would also hope that they are not playing election-year politics.  If they are, then they are playing those election-year politics with  the retirement security of millions of Americans. As every day goes on,  the prospects of people retiring on what they thought they were going  to retire on--these multiemployer plans--is getting less and less.  Delaying a solution until next year is only going to make it more  costly, and it will still require bipartisan support.   We can and we must do better if we want a healthy multiemployer  system for the long haul. We have a chance to fix this problem long  term. Otherwise, we will be right back here in 5 or 10 years dealing  with the same problem.  [[Page S3994]]    To put this in perspective, let's consider what it means to do  nothing and to leave the current law unchanged, versus what Chairman  Alexander and I propose in several key areas.   First, for retiree benefits, doing nothing means the PBGC insurance  fund runs out of money in 2027. If the fund goes broke, that means the  PBGC will only be able to pay benefits equal to the premium revenues  that it receives, which are minimal compared to the potential claims.  That means retirees could receive cuts in the range of 90 percent.   Let me say that another way. If these plans go broke and these people  are forced into the government-run insurance backup plan, they are  going to potentially get 90-percent cuts in their retirement. That is  the necessity for us to work hard now to get this job done   Now, in contrast, the plan Senator Alexander and I are proposing  would preserve benefits and ensure solvency of the PBGC's multiemployer  system over the long run. It would save many failing plans by having  the government pay a portion of benefits earlier than under current  law. That would help the plan to stretch its assets much longer and at  the same time preserve benefits as promised under that plan.   Second, for plans that aren't able to be saved, our proposal would  increase the insurance guarantee amount from the current $12,870  maximum for a retiree with 30 years of service to over $20,000.   Benefits will be preserved with the help of additional support from  employer and union stakeholders and a modest retiree insurance premium  for retirees in plans that face financial challenges. That premium  would be no more than 10 percent and eliminated entirely for older and  disabled retirees, as well as for plans that are well funded. That is  far better than the 90-percent cut that I already told you about if we  just do nothing.   Doing nothing also means more and more plans will become underfunded  or maybe even worse, insolvent, resulting in major benefit cuts and  then only that very small benefit that is covered by the government's  guaranty program, the insurance fund that we call the PBGC.   The Grassley-Alexander plan would provide relief to the failing  plans, and, without an upfront benefit cut, it would restore the  benefit cuts that some plans chose to make under the Multiemployer  Pension Reform Act in 2014. It would also increase the PBGC insurance  guarantee amount by more than 50 percent.   Third, for other plans not on the brink, doing nothing would mean  that the current minority of multiemployer plans that are better funded  would continue to shrink, with many more likely to move into the danger  zone in the coming years. Our plan would provide significant funding  reforms--with emphasis on reforms--to help prevent that from happening.  In other words, those that are in pretty good shape wouldn't get worse.   Key variables, like the discount rate that plans use to estimate  future assets and liability values, would be subject to new standards  to help ensure that plans are funded to provide the benefits they  promised. But we have taken to heart comments we have heard from  stakeholders that those changes need to be phased in over a sufficient  period of time to allow plans to transition smoothly.   Our plan would institute other changes to improve the early warning  system so multiemployer plans can avoid flirting with the underfunding  danger zone. It also provides needed oversight for plans in trouble,  and it would provide unions and employers the opportunity to set up  composite plans--a new type of hybrid retirement plan that enjoys wide  bipartisan support.   Something pretty important to note, the fundamental tenet of the  Grassley-Alexander reform plan is that all stakeholders have a role in  fixing the multiemployer pension system that has been on the current  path to failure now for four decades.   Employers and unions have a role in ensuring that adequate  contributions are made to the plans to ensure sufficient funds to pay  the promised benefits.   Plans have a role in ensuring that the PBGC insurance fund backing up  those benefits is adequately funded through reasonable premiums, with  higher risk plans contributing more for that insurance backup.   Employees and retirees have a role in contributing to the insurance  coverage that protects their benefits, just like they do now for auto,  home, and life insurance.   Last, but not least, is the Federal Government. I don't want to shock  people, but if you study this, you will know that the government had a  role in setting out the rules that have governed these plans and  regulating the operation of these plans, so the government has a role  in fixing the resulting situation we are in this very day. That means  taxpayer funds may be needed to help the PBGC provide the partition  relief for plans on the brink of failing, but those funds must come  with important reforms to ensure that taxpayers are not back here on  the hook again in 5 or 10 years.   This legislation I am talking about looks way ahead, solving two  problems: the multiemployer pension plans individually--dozens of  them--and also the insurance fund, the PBGC, that the government has  for backup so it doesn't go broke by 2027. We take care of two big  problems all at once. As I just said, we don't want to be back here in  5 or 10 years.   Unfortunately, no matter how sensible of a reform plan we come up  with, it has no chance of success unless our Democratic colleagues are  willing to sit down and discuss a comprehensive solution.   The other side has the idea of ``my way or the highway.'' That  approach is not the pathway to a successful solution. That was clear  when they tried that tactic during the negotiations of the CARES Act in  March.   So how many times do I have to say it? We all know it, all 100  Senators know it--nothing happens in Congress without bipartisanship.   I invited our colleagues on the other side of the aisle--I have had  more than one conversation with Speaker Pelosi--asking all to join me  and Senator Alexander in finding a bipartisan solution. That invitation  still stands, and we remain ready to talk. Let's use the time that we  have to negotiate a balanced, sensible solution to this increasingly  critical problem so that we are ready whenever that opportunity  presents itself to enact that solution this year. The retirees in each  of our States, the businesses in each of our States, and the unions in  each of our States that support these pension plans and our long-term  Federal budget deserve no less consideration than what I have laid out.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
