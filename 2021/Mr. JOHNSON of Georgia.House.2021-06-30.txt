 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the INVEST  in America Act, which is landmark legislation that provides critical  funding to repair our crumbling infrastructure, makes long-overdue  investments in public transit, and improves overall safety.   Together, the reforms respond to the climate crisis by reducing  emissions from transportation, which represents the largest share of  greenhouse gas emissions in our economy. This bill includes several  provisions that I authored, including a boost to disadvantaged business  enterprises, a requirement that trucks be equipped with lifesaving,  automatic emergency braking systems, and critical funding for public  transit.   The bill would also fund five projects in my district to expand or  add public transit service and improve rider safety, including the  Stonecrest Transit Hub.   Moving forward, I am hopeful that a final law will include a  dedicated public transit operating program, such as the one that I have  proposed, to grow and improve service around the Nation.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the chairman for his leadership.
