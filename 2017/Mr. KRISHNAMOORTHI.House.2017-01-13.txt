 Mr. Chairman, I am Congressman Raja  Krishnamoorthi, and I represent the hardworking families of Chicago's  west and northwest suburbs.   I rise today in strong opposition to S. Con. Res. 3.   Repealing without replacing the Affordable Care Act at the same time  would devastate our economy and harm millions of middle class families.  [[Page H493]]  Within the Eighth District of Illinois alone, we could lose upwards of  $550 million from our economy, and over 4,000 jobs.   Before joining Congress, I ran small businesses in the Chicago area  in the national security and technology sectors. I know firsthand how  important health coverage is to our workers and to our businesses.  Without the protections of the ACA, we will see fewer entrepreneurs  take the risk of starting a business and fewer workers taking the risk  of working for a startup.   Middle class and working families need good-paying jobs and  affordable health care. And, unfortunately, the bill before us today  would rob them of both.
