 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's fiscal crisis threatens all Americans. We are  here today to debate legislation that accomplishes so much of what the  American people want. Specifically, it begins to get Washington's  spending habits under control. It starts to slow the flow of special  interest handouts to the wealthy and well-connected, and it throws  much-needed water on the fire of inflation burning through the wallets  of American families.   Unlike the Inflation Reduction Act, the Limit, Save, Grow Act under  consideration today actually does what it says it is going to do. It  puts real limits on future spending, so that we begin to turn the ship  back in a more fiscally sound direction.   It saves taxpayer dollars by clawing back unobligated pandemic  spending, a sensible solution given the fact that the President himself  has declared the pandemic over.   It saves taxpayer dollars by ending welfare for the wealthy and  loopholes for big corporations in the Inflation Reduction Act. Ninety  percent of these special interest green tax breaks go to companies with  over 1 billion in sales. Financial institutions alone pocket three  times as much as any other industry, and these tax dollars are being  funneled to China, enriching the Chinese Communist Party and allowing  it to dominate critical mineral supply chains.   I know my friends on the other side share in frustration in how that  law has ended up so different than what they thought they were voting  for.   In this bill, we propose proworker, pro-small business policies like  work requirements in our welfare programs that will not only support a  more vibrant economy, but also help more Americans realize the dignity  of work. This plan will also take the target off the backs of low- and  middle-income taxpayers under threat from a supercharged army of 87,000  at the IRS.   The Biden administration brags about the $400 billion in revenues  they plan to bring in by unleashing the new agents. To do that, audit  rates will have to go up on low- and middle-income Americans. In fact,  under the so-called historical audit rate the administration says it  will adhere to, we will see a million--a million new audits with  650,000 of them falling on folks who make $75,000 or less.   I find it curious to hear my Democrat colleagues and the President  say they will not negotiate on spending when it comes to the debt  ceiling, while at the same time complaining there is no plan over which  to negotiate.   Well, here you go. Republicans have a plan. It is time for the  President to negotiate overspending reforms as part of addressing the  debt ceiling just as we have done many times before. In fact, just as  the President himself has done many times before as a Senator and as  Vice President.   Eleven of the previous debt ceiling increases going back decades have  included fiscal reforms. President Biden voted for such agreements as a  Senator, and he negotiated them as a Vice President. The President's  current position of refusing to discuss commonsense spending restraints  when it comes to the debt ceiling is a reckless abandonment of past  precedent and in his own history.   Under one-party Democratic rule, we got $10 trillion in new spending.  The consequences have been very real. Since President Biden took  office, we have seen a spike in prices by 14.9 percent. Real wages have  declined by 3.5 percent and interest rates have increased more in the  past year than in the prior 15 years combined.   The American people are demanding something to be done about all of  this. Let's pass this legislation and put the interests of workers,  families, farmers, and small businesses first and foremost. Let's do as  Congress has done before and address the debt ceiling with policies  that also address the Washington spending habits that got us here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), the chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of comments  just recently about tax provisions that helped the wealthy, the well- off, and the well-connected. Let's point out the Democrats' tax  policies that we are ripping out from the roots are helping the  wealthy, the well-off, and the well-connected.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record analyses from the Joint  Committee on Taxation, showing that big corporations with more than $1  billion in sales receive over 90 percent of all special interest  electricity subsidies, and that financial institutions receive three  times more benefits from these tax credits than any other industry  where the wealthy, the well-off, and the well-connected benefit.

Subject: Distribution Data.        This memorandum is in response to your request of March 28,       2023, for data on the distribution of claims for certain       energy credits by the gross receipts of the taxpayer. Below       we report the tentative claims for credit under Code section       45, the credit for electricity produced from certain       renewable resources, and the tentative claims for credit       under section 48, the energy investment credit, by C       corporations for the 2019 tax year and 2020 tax year. The       amounts reported are the tentative claims for credit before       any limitation that the taxpayer might face and before any       audit adjustment that might occur. For each of section 45 and       section 48 we report the dollars of credit claimed       categorized by gross receipts reported on line 1c of Form       1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return.

Subject: Tentative Energy Credits by Industry.        This memorandum is in response to your request for data on       claims for certain energy credits by industry, including       credits claimed by management companies. Below we report the       tentative claims for credit under Code section 45, the credit       for electricity produced from certain renewable resources,       and the tentative claims for credit under section 48, the       energy investment credit, by C corporations for the 2019 and       2020 tax years. The amounts reported are the tentative claims       for credit before any limitation that the taxpayer might face       and before any audit adjustment that might occur. For each of       section 45 and section 48 we report the dollars of credit       claimed by industry using the North American Industrial       Classification System (``NAICS'') code level. Presenting       these data at a finer level of detail potentially would       create concerns of disclosure of information specific to       taxpayers. For example, for section 45 we removed 2020 data       for the wholesale and retail trade industry as the sample       size became too limited.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this JCT  analysis from 2022, suggesting that the total costs of the special  interest tax credits for the rich in the Inflation Reduction Act would  be $271 billion.   Mr. Speaker, I also include in the Record yesterday's CBO score,  which shows that the cost has more than doubled to $570 billion, and it  is growing every day.

Components may not sum to totals because of rounding. Budgetary effects are relative to CBO's February 2023 baseline projections and include updates to incorporate new information about certain programs. a This estimate incorporates the assumption that future appropriations will match the proposed caps, where applicable, and that funding that would not be constrained by the caps (such as   funding designated as an emergency requirement) will match amounts in CBO's baseline projections. Deficits could be larger or smaller, depending on whether the amounts appropriated are   larger or smaller than the amounts that CBO projects in this analysis. b Estimates provided by JCT are preliminary and subject to change. c Changes in CBO's estimates of public debt for the 2023-2033 period under the bill are driven primarily by changes to estimated annual budget deficits. However, changes to the government's   cash flows associated with the federal student loan program (not shown in this table) also affect CBO's estimates of public debt and of the interest required to service that debt.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an  article detailing how Ford is using a loophole in the IRA to partner  with CATL, a major Chinese battery company, on a project intended to  harvest EV battery tax credits. Chinese companies are lining up to cash  in on Democrats' green corporate welfare that we are rescinding in this  bill.                        [From Forbes, Feb. 13, 2023]    Ford To Build $3.5 Billion Lithium Iron Phosphate Battery Plant in                       Michigan Using CATL Technology                  (By Sam Abuelsamid, Senior Contributor)         Ford plans to build a $3.5 billion factory in Marshall,       Michigan, which will produce 35 gigawatt-hours of lithium       iron phosphate (LFP) cells annually for electric vehicles       starting in 2026. The move comes after the automaker said it       would use LFP batteries in the Mustang Mach-E from mid-2023       and F-150 Lightning from early 2024. However, those batteries       will be sourced from CATL in China, the leading cell       manufacturer in the world and one of the leaders in LFP       production. Ford will license CATL technology but it will own       the new factory and operate it, rather than creating a joint       venture.        While Ford will start using CATL LFP batteries later this       year, shipping them from China won't help the company reach       its sustainability goals. Batteries are heavy and bulky and       the emissions associated with shipping them halfway around       the world will significantly cut into the gains from       eliminating the tailpipe from these vehicles. Those vehicles       also will not qualify for any clean vehicle tax credits.        This is why Ford and other OEMs are moving so aggressively       to localize battery production to wherever vehicles are built       and sold. Ford previously announced a joint venture with       Korea's SK ON for three cell plants in Kentucky and Tennessee       that are already well under construction. Those plants will       produce nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells.        Nickel-rich cell chemistries such as NMC (also referred to       as NCM), nickel-manganese-cobalt aluminum (NMCA, which GM       uses for its Ultium cells), nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA,       which Tesla uses) have a higher energy density than LFP.       However, Nickel and cobalt are much more expensive than iron       and phosphorus and also more volatile. When there is an       internal short circuit in a nickel-rich cell, it is much more       likely to experience thermal runaway. LFP cells are       inherently more stable and are nearly impossible to       experience thermal runaway or fires.        Despite LFP having a lower energy density than nickel-rich       cells, much of that can be offset by adopting cell-to-pack or       structural battery pack designs rather than the modular       designs that are typical today. In addition to lower cost,       LFP cells have much longer charge cycle lifetimes. A typical       nickel cell can do between 500 and 1,000 charge cycles before       it loses enough capacity to be no longer useful in a vehicle.       LFP cells can withstand thousands of cycles and some       manufacturers, including CATL, have claimed EVs with LFP can       go 1 million miles.        The added stability of LFP cells means they can better       withstand charging to l00% without degrading. Nickel-rich       cells typically have to leave unused buffers to prevent       overcharging. Thus some of the energy density disadvantages       can be safely recovered.        The decision to structure the new operation as a wholly       owned subsidiary of Ford rather than a joint venture is       likely driven in part by the content requirements in the       Inflation Reduction Act. Since China is a foreign entity of       concern, batteries and materials from that country do not       qualify for clean vehicle credits. Thus the Mach-E and       Lightning with Chinese-sourced batteries won't be eligible.       Limiting the equity stake of CATL in this deal and only       licensing some technology along with local sourcing of most       materials will probably enable Ford to claim its cells meet       the domestic content requirements.        ``This is how we look at the recipe to create one of the       lowest cost, U.S.-produced batteries when this plant comes       online in 2026 and this helps us contribute to Ford's goal of       an 8% Model E EBIT in 2026,'' said Lisa Drake, Ford VP of EV       industrialization. ``It strengthens our domestic supply chain       and helps us ramp production, getting more EVs to more       customers sooner.''        As with the Mach-E and Lightning, the new LFP batteries       will likely be used mainly in standard range and lower cost       EVs and many of the commercial vehicles Ford sells. Most of       those commercial vehicles, such as Transit vans used for       everything from last-mile deliveries to plumbers and       electricians, rarely go outside of a limited geographical       area and don't need more than 100 miles of range. With more       availability of domestic LFP batteries, future electric       versions of vehicles like the compact Maverick pickup and       Escape crossover are likely at prices that more consumers can       afford.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a March  8, 2021, Politico article titled: ``Biden's welfare flip-flop,'' which  points out that President Biden was once an ardent supporter of  commonsense welfare reforms, including work requirements.                       [From POLITICO, March 8, 2021]               West Wing Playbook--Biden's Welfare Flip-Flop      (By Alex Thompson and Theodoric Meyer with help from Allie Bice)         Joe Biden, the young senator, would be surprised at Joe       Biden, the elderly president.        When he first ran for president in 1988, 44-year-old Biden       was one of the Democrats challenging what he called ``liberal       orthodoxy'' on issues like welfare.        ``Our handouts are not enough,'' Biden said at Princeton       University in a May 1987 speech meant to beef up his policy       profile ahead of a June campaign launch. ``Government subsidy       is not the ultimate answer to the problems of the poor.''        In November 1988, he penned a column in his local Newark       Post: ``We are all too familiar with the stories of welfare       mothers driving luxury cars and leading lifestyles that       mirror the rich and famous,'' he wrote, parroting Republican       critiques of the program. ``Whether they are exaggerated or       not, these stories underlie a broad social concern that the       welfare system has broken down--that it only parcels out       welfare checks and does nothing to help the poor find       productive jobs.''        In 1996, Biden was one of 24 Democratic senators who voted       for the welfare reform bill that President Bill Clinton       signed, but which progressives and much of Clinton's Cabinet       opposed. ``The culture of welfare must be replaced with the       culture of work,'' Biden said on the Senate floor. Bruce       Reed, who's now Biden's deputy chief of staff, was an       architect of the legislation. He helped coin Clinton's pledge       to ``end welfare as we know it.''        And yet, the first piece of major legislation Biden is       poised to sign as president represents the largest expansion       of the welfare state in decades. It even undoes some of the       reforms Biden, the senator, helped enact.        The 1996 bill, for instance, imposed time limits and work       requirements on money sent to parents to support their       children. Biden's American Rescue Plan would at least       temporarily resume sending money directly to impoverished       parents without any strings attached--and some Democrats are       already pushing to make the aid permanent.        The bill would also send poor and middle-class parents       checks of up to $300 per child each month--a provision that       the Biden team believes could dramatically cut child poverty.        The legislation won't recreate the welfare system that       Biden voted to reform in 1996. Instead, it will expand the       existing child tax credit for poor and middle-class families       alike. The credit starts phasing out at $75,000 a year for       single parents and $150,000 a year for married couples.        Part of Biden's evolution on welfare spending is tied to       the pandemic and the massive economic hole that it has       caused. But another part of it reflects the evolution the       Democratic Party has undergone in recent years.        Once fearful of race-baiting rhetoric on supposedly lazy       ``welfare queens,'' the party now is largely unapologetic       about spending money to strengthen the social safety net.        ``One of the side effects of the pandemic has been to       change the profile of poverty in America,'' said Robert       Reich, Clinton's Labor secretary who clashed with people like       Reed over the welfare reform measure. ``It's no longer just       `them,' people of color, people who conservatives accuse of       taking handouts. It marks a huge shift in public policy from       quite punitive welfare to giving needy families money.''        White House spokesperson Michael Gwin emailed a statement       saying, ``As a Senator, Joe Biden worked to make welfare       reform more progressive by supporting childcare and       maintaining funding for children's health and safety, and as       President, Joe Biden is meeting the unique crises we face by       giving children and families a financial lifeline, reopening       schools safely, and securing the resources we need to defeat       the virus.''        Reed declined to comment.        Donald Trump, during his presidency, seemed to usher in a       Republicanism that was more comfortable with spending more       money on things past Republicans would have bashed as       handouts. But so far Republicans in the Biden era are making       a different calculation. They unanimously voted against the       plan and are betting that the pandemic hasn't changed       perceptions around welfare programs so completely.        On the Senate floor last Friday, Sen. Mitch McConnell       blasted the welfare provisions in the package for paying       ``people a bonus not to go back to work when we'll be trying       to rebuild our economy.''        He added that: ``There's an effort to create a brand-new,       sprawling cash welfare program--not the one-time checks, but       constant payments--that ignore the pro-work lessons of       bipartisan welfare reform and which the White House has       already stated they want to make permanent.''    Biden was one of 24 Democrat Senators who  voted for the 1996 welfare reform bill that President Bill Clinton  signed.   That bill imposed time limits and work requirements for welfare  recipients. In fact, Biden's Deputy Chief of Staff was a key architect  of the 1996 welfare reform bill and helped coin Clinton's pledge to end  welfare as we know it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a New  York Times article titled: ``Poverty, Plunging,'' from September 14,  2022.                 [From the New York Times, Sept. 14, 2022]   Poverty, Plunging: Child Poverty in the U.S. Has Fallen by More Than                         Half Since the Early 1990s                            (By David Leonhardt)         When President Bill Clinton signed a bipartisan bill       tightening the rules around welfare eligibility in 1996--and       making many benefits conditional on work--critics on the       political left predicted terrible effects.        A few members of the Clinton administration quit in       protest. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned of       devastating increases in child poverty. The New Republic       proclaimed, ``Wages will go down, families will fracture and       millions of children will be made more miserable than ever.''        A quarter-century later, these predictions look very wrong.       As my colleague Jason DeParle wrote this week:        ``A comprehensive new analysis shows that child poverty has       fallen 59 percent since 1993, with need receding on nearly       every front. Child poverty has fallen in every state, and it       has fallen by about the same degree among children who are       white, Black, Hispanic and Asian, living with one parent or       two, and in native or immigrant households''        How did this happen? The 1996 welfare law turned out to be       a case study of different political ideologies combining to       produce a result that was better than either side would       likely have produced on its own.        Some conservative critiques of the old welfare contained an       important insight, Jason told me. Poor single mothers (the       main beneficiaries of welfare) were better able to find and       hold jobs than many liberals expected. Over the past few       decades, increased employment among single mothers has been       one reason for the decline in child poverty, according to the       study, which was done by Child Trends, a research group.        But the biggest cause was an expansion of government aid.       And progressives were the main force behind this expansion.       With welfare less generous, Democrats (sometimes in alliance       with Republicans) pushed for policies to help low-income       workers, such as expansions of the earned-income tax credit       and food stamps. Increases in state-level minimum wages also       played a role.        ``I don't know where I'd be right now if I didn't have that       help,'' said Stacy Tallman, a mother of three and a waitress       in Marlinton, W. Va., referring to Medicaid, tax credits and       food stamps.        After welfare reform, the focus of the government's anti-      poverty efforts shifted from  [[Page H2035]]       people who weren't working to people who were--and, thanks       partly to the generosity of the new programs, child poverty       plummeted. The size of the decline, Dana Thomson, a co-author       of the study, said, ``is unequaled in the history of poverty       measurement.''        Dolores Acevedo-Garcia of Brandeis University pointed out       that 12 million additional children would be poor today if       the poverty rate were still as high as it was in the 1990s.       The reasons to cheer this development are both immediate and       longer term: Children who spend even modest amounts of time       in poverty earn less money and are less healthy as adults on       average, research has shown.                            Hiding in plain sight         I am guessing that many readers are surprised to hear about       the big drop in child poverty since the 1990s. I'll confess       that I was and I have been covering economics for much of the       past two decades. As Jason told me, ``It is odd that such a       big decline in child poverty has gone almost completely       unnoticed.''        In part, the lack of attention stems from a theme I've       mentioned before in this newsletter: bad-news bias.       Journalists and academic experts are often more comfortable       reporting negative developments than positive ones. We worry       that we come off as blase or Pollyannaish when we report good       news.        The poverty statistics add to the confusion because there       are so many different versions. The measure that the Census       Bureau calls ``official'' does not include government aid,       which is bizarre, as Dylan Matthews of Vox has noted. And       every measure has limitations. The one that Jason used in his       story overestimates the impact of the earned-income tax       credit and underestimates the impact of the food stamps, for       technical reasons. (Neither alters the basic conclusion, as       Robert Greenstein, a longtime progressive policy adviser,       says.)        Still, I understand why many people are reluctant to focus       on the poverty decline. The U.S. has not solved poverty. More       than 20 million Americans are poor today, and many others       above the poverty line also struggle to afford a decent life.       As successful as President Biden has been in passing many       parts of his agenda, Congress failed to pass several of his       anti-poverty proposals. Those measures would have expanded       access to child care and increased the child tax credit,       among other things.        Despite these caveats, the decline in poverty deserves to       be a major news story. For one thing, it's legitimately       surprising: Even Jason--who has spent more time writing about       American poverty than almost any other journalist--      acknowledges that welfare reform did less damage than he       expected, in part because of the subsequent expansions of       aid.        At a time of deep cynicism about government, the drop in       poverty is an example of Washington succeeding at something       big. ``The decline in child poverty is very, very       impressive,'' Greenstein said, ``and it is overwhelmingly due       to the increased effectiveness of government programs,''     Mr. Speaker, this article found that child  poverty in the U.S. has fallen by more than half, 59 percent, since the  early 1990s. When President Clinton signed the 1996 welfare reform bill  implementing time limits and work requirements, the far left predicted  terrible effects. Twenty-five years later, these predictions have been  proven wrong.   The simple fact is work requirements worked. Caseloads dropped, and  families moved into the workforce and left the cycle of dependency.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard the other side numerous times today say  that we need to just pick up and pass a blank-check debt limit  increase.   The United States Senate, which is controlled by the Democrats,  couldn't even pass what President Biden and the  [[Page H2037]]  House Democrats have been suggesting on this floor. If they could, they  would have already passed it. Even Democrat Senators on the other side  of the building said they will not support an absolute blank-check debt  limit because they are concerned about the fiscal state of America.   Today, the contrast could not be clearer.   On the one hand, we have President Biden and Washington Democrats who  have proposed zero solutions for getting America's fiscal house in  order or addressing the inflation crisis. For months, they have delayed  and denied real discussions while they fought to preserve special  interest tax breaks for big banks, corporations, and the Chinese  Communist Party.   On the other hand, Republicans stand with working families. We have  an actual plan that will rein in runaway spending to fight inflation.  It will save taxpayer dollars by canceling handouts to the wealthy and  big corporations, and it will grow the economy.   The American people are sick and tired of business as usual in  Washington. With today's vote, we are sending a message to the  President: It is time to stop your reckless behavior and negotiate and  stand up and talk with Congress and deliver for the American people.  The American people are demanding it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
