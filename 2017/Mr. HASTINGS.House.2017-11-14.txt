 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Garamendi for bringing this  Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to tell you, in 7 minutes, I, along with the  other members of the Rules Committee, will be meeting on what is  described as an emergency meeting. That emergency is what you all have  been describing. We were originally scheduled to meet at Rules  tomorrow, and now, in an effort to jam this measure through, we are  meeting in an emergency capacity.   What the American public needs to know is the substance of what you  two gentlemen and others have been talking about, but please know this:  every Member deserves the right to contribute to these bills when they  affect all of our constituents and will lead to millions of Americans  paying more in taxes.   You all will handle the substance, but I thought that I would add  that in with my thanks to Mr. Garamendi. It is just atrocious what is  going on, and not just Democrats or Republicans, but many persons who  sent their Representatives here are not going to have their  Representatives be heard.    Mr. Speaker, no hearings whatsoever, and yet the  Speaker stood up and said that we are following regular order.   We are not following regular order at all.    Mr. Speaker, in addition to hearing from experts and  from affected entities around the country, now we are doing it in 2  weeks.   Mr. Speaker, I have to go to the Rules Committee, but I thank you all  for what you are doing.
