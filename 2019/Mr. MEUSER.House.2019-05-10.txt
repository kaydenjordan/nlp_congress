 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the ninth  annual Berks County March for Life, which I attended this past weekend.  I was proud to join over 250 participants, and I would like to thank  Helen MacMinn for organizing the event and Donna Lea Merritt for  inviting me.   Madam Speaker, I am proudly pro-life and believe in the sanctity of  innocent, unborn human life. I was deeply troubled to see a Democratic  Pennsylvania State representative openly berate, verbally attack,  threaten and, in fact, terrify peaceful advocates of the unborn.   This behavior is reprehensible for anyone, but particularly appalling  from an elected official. This type of hostile discourse should be  repudiated by all, Democrats and Republicans.   The Berks March for Life event was a wonderful reminder of the unity  and kind spirit found among the pro-life  [[Page H3719]]  community in Pennsylvania's Ninth Congressional District. I commend  Pro-Life Berks for their dedication.                            ____________________
