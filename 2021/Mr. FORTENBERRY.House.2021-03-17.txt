 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 88.    Mr. Speaker, a hallmark of America is that we have  opened our arms and have been a just and generous nation to people who  are fleeing political violence elsewhere, who have been persecuted in  their native lands, and who are coming here to seek a better way of  life. But here is the problem, Mr. Speaker: chaos and disorder at our  border undermine the ability of our country to extend that generosity.   A little-known fact about all of this is that for many years we have  been working to get this question off of the one-yard line. But here we  are again, seeing the trauma of unaccompanied children at our border  and people receiving the wrong message that they can simply come here.   We spent hundreds of millions of dollars in the Northern Triangle  countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to try to rebuild the  conditions for the rule of law, to stop crime, and to give people  economic opportunity. That is the right policy, and we had cooperative  agreements with those countries to begin to halt the messaging that it  is proper or appropriate to come here illegally. Of course, this feeds  human trafficking and children being left alone.   It is unjust. We need to return to the previous policy in which we  are cooperating with those countries.                            ____________________
