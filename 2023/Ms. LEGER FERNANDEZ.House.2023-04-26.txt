 Madam Speaker, I left the Capitol at 3 a.m. this  morning, after fighting Republicans' plans to default on America unless  we impose drastic spending cuts, cuts that are so severe they will hurt  farmers and ranchers, kids and families, and this beautiful place we  call home. Nobody in any State will be protected from their draconian  cuts.   When I asked how to explain the bill's drastic cuts to rural  communities in my district, the Republicans' response was, ``You should  tell them that we have to prioritize.''   The Rules Committee Republicans then blocked my amendment to protect  rural water, housing, and business development programs. In essence,  they said to rural America, you are not a priority.   The Republicans blocked my amendment to protect veterans' healthcare,  the Indian Health Service, and clean energy investments. Veterans are  clearly not their priority. Healthcare is clearly not their priority.  Addressing the climate crisis that is fueling disasters across America,  across the United States, and across this planet is clearly not their  priority.   Do you like knowing your food is safe?   The Republicans' bill could cut 1,800 USDA food inspectors and cost  our farmers, ranchers, and restaurants $89 billion in lost production  and $2.2 billion in lost wages.   The majority blocked my amendment to protect the Food Safety and  Inspection Service from cuts.   When Republicans now demand we cut spending on healthcare, safety,  and housing, what is it for?   To pay for the tax cuts for the rich that they pushed through in  2017. Protecting the rich and the wealthy tax cheats clearly must be  their priority.                                time  1300    Through backroom dealings, the Republican majority has now settled on  a bill that backstabs working families. Their bill delivers poison, not  prosperity.   Congress must not default on America. America pays its bills. America  knows how to prioritize what is essential for our prosperity.
