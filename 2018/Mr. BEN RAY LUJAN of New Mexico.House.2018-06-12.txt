 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  the Better Pain Management Through Better Data Act.   Current data collection models used by the Food and Drug  Administration to measure clinical effectiveness are not ideally suited  to accelerate development of opioid-sparing products. This bipartisan  legislation will better allow the FDA to obtain the data they need to  more quickly approve label claims for nonaddictive pain medications.   I think I have said this at least 100 times at this point, but we  must work with our pharmaceutical partners and the FDA to make sure  that patients across the country have nonaddictive pain management  options.   I come from a blue-collar district with ironworkers and ranchers and  a whole lot of jobs where wear and tear on the body is inevitable. It  is simply unrealistic to think that we won't have people who need  access to pain therapy. That is where nonaddictive therapies come in.  This bill is another step forward in making sure that everyone has more  options to treat pain.   While we are talking about nonaddictive pain medications and how  important they are to break the cycle of addiction back home, I want to  take a second to direct my comments toward all the pharmaceutical  manufacturers who are developing or plan to develop drugs in this  space: This is important. We need you to be innovative, and we need you  to be aggressive.   That being said, Mr. Speaker, I am already starting to be concerned  regarding the cost of these drugs. Let me put this in plain English. I  am worried that the people living in different parts of America may be  able to afford these drugs but families who are struggling and worrying  about how to make that family budget work are going to be left out. If  people can't afford these therapies and these treatments, they are not  going to make a bit of difference.   We cannot create another layer of people who can afford medications  and therapies and people who cannot, especially not when this issue is  so important. All nonaddictive pain medications must be affordable,  accessible, and of high quality.   I appreciate the hard work of the committee staff, Chairman Walden,  Ranking Member Pallone, and all the stakeholders who helped get this  bill to the finish line.   This epidemic is affecting too many New Mexicans, too many Americans,  to not think about long-term strategies for preventing opioid use  disorder in the future.   I appreciate Chairman Walden's remarks. I thank him for acknowledging  that this is not the end of our work.   This committee has much work to do not just with this package, but  into the future, until we are able to help everyone who is fighting  addiction in America. I look forward to working with our colleagues,  with the administration, and with anyone and everyone out there to make  a difference when it comes to addiction in our country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Guthrie and  Dr. Bucshon for working with myself and Mr. Gene Green of Texas on this  bill.   I rise today in support of the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers  Act. This bill would fund at least 10 comprehensive opioid centers  across America. These centers will focus on community engagement,  prevention, treatment, and also recovery services.   They can be newly established centers or can build upon existing  infrastructure. They will be located in areas hit hardest by this  epidemic, and they will serve those who need help the most.   Since 2008, New Mexico has had one of the highest rates of drug  overdose deaths in the country. According to the CDC, New Mexico had  the third highest drug overdose death rate in the Nation in 2013 and  the second highest in 2014.   Almost every county in New Mexico has a higher rate than the national  average. In some of the most hard-hit New Mexico counties, the overdose  death rates were more than five times the national rate.   Now, we know 10 centers across 50 States will not solve this problem.  Still, we hope that these centers can stand as examples for what  substance use disorder facilities could strive to be.   I hope that these comprehensive centers will give families hope,  researchers data, and communities across this country the resources  that they so desperately need.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone for  the time and for his leadership. I thank Chairman Walden and his team  for their work on this important piece of legislation, and, again,  special recognition of the work of Mr. Johnson and his staff of Ohio  for being so willing to work on this important policy and for the  incredible team that he has assembled as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Peer Support Communities  of Recovery Act.   Anyone who has heard me speak about opioids knows that I believe  strongly that to address this opioid epidemic, we must address our  Nation's workforce challenges. We have phenomenal providers in New  Mexico, and Mr. Johnson has them in Ohio, but what we both know is that  we don't have enough of them.   This is a numbers game. Unfortunately, the number of people with  substance use disorder far surpasses the number of providers and  treatment staff. That is where peer support recovery specialists come  in.   For those of you who haven't heard me talk about this or who did not  tune in to hear our Energy and Commerce Committee witnesses throughout  the hearing process, peer support recovery specialists are people who  have lived and experienced, sadly, the challenges with substance abuse,  who have fought against their addiction and are in recovery, and who  have received training to help others who are in the midst of the fight  now. Peer support recovery specialists provide immediate, ongoing  support and treatment linkages to individuals in recovery.   As Carlene Deal-Smith, a peer support recovery specialist of the  Totah Behavioral Health Authority program in Farmington, New Mexico,  testified:         Being able to connect to our patients both through our       shared heritage and shared struggles with addiction has       allowed me to function as a bridge between them, the staff,       and the community. This work has enabled me to be effective       as a community support worker and mentor. Most importantly, I       am living proof that recovery can happen.    These people provide an incredibly important service to the  community. Peer support programs also mean jobs for individuals who may  not otherwise find those opportunities. Ms. Deal-Smith explained to us  this job got her through hard times in her own journey with substance  use and made her feel proud to serve the community and help her people  in such an important way.   I am grateful that the House has acknowledged the importance of these  programs, and I am hopeful that the Senate will do the same very soon.                                time  1800
