 Mr. President, today is going to be an exceedingly busy  and productive day on the Senate floor.   Later today, after months of hard work and countless rounds of talks,  Senators will vote to move forward on legislation that our country  desperately needs--a chips bill that will lower costs, boost American  manufacturing, and protect American security interests.   Over the past 24 hours, both parties have continued working on the  final details to the chips package that we will vote on later today. We  will see if Members can come to an agreement on adding other provisions  to the bill, but the bottom line is that we must come up with a package  that is capable of passing this Chamber without delay. We must act as  soon as we can to make sure we bring chip manufacturing back to America  because our Nation's security depends on it.   I urge my colleagues, if you want to fight inflation, if you want to  create more good-paying jobs right here at home, if you want to keep  America strong and competitive and innovative in the 21st century so  that we can lead the economy as we did in the 20th, then this chips  bill is the way to go. It is a very important bill.   The chips shortage is one of the most damaging trends over the past  few years. This technology, which originated, of course, right here in  America, is the bedrock for much of modern life. Cars, refrigerators,  cell phones, medical devices--they all depend on chips to function. But  when chips suddenly become scarce, as is the case today, the  consequences are felt across the board by companies but also by average  Americans. Americans see higher prices and longer wait times for all  sorts of consumer goods because of this chip shortage.   It wasn't always this way, but thanks to the pandemic, this crisis is  now being felt across the country.   A quarter century ago, the United States was the undisputed leader in  global chip production. In 1990, we produced 40 percent--nearly 40  percent--of the world's semiconductors. Today, that figure is going  down to 12 percent and will get even lower if we don't pass this bill.  We have a chance of leading the way on chip manufacturing once again if  we pass this legislation.   As we speak, the country's most important chip manufacturers--these  are  [[Page S3344]]  American companies--are waiting on congressional action--mostly  American companies, not all. But they are waiting on congressional  action before they decide where to invest in chip production. From Asia  to Europe, other nations have copied the American playbook and have  already invested billions of dollars to incentivize chip manufacturers  to come to them. If we do not match the efforts of other countries to  boost chip manufacturing, the consequences could be dire and long- lasting. Countless good-paying American jobs are on the line. Costs  that Americans are now paying--higher costs--getting them lowered is  now on the line. Billions of dollars in economic activity is on the  line, and our national security is on the line.   As Secretary Austin and Secretary Raimondo told us last week, our  economic and national security depends on our ability to invest in the  technologies of today and tomorrow.   If we allow other nations to lead the way on chips, the days of  America leading the world in scientific innovation, the days of America  being the leading economic and military power in the world may actually  be over. Nobody wants that. So vote for this bill. This is a future  none of us wants to see.   Again, vote for this bill. I urge my colleagues to move forward later  today.    Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will take  the first procedural vote on the chips bill that will fight inflation,  boost American manufacturing, ease our supply chains, and protect  American security interests.   This is one of the important votes that we will take this session,  because advancing this bill is crucial for lowering costs, solving our  Nation's chip shortage, and making sure America remains competitive in  the 21st century.   America will fall behind in so many areas if we don't pass this bill,  and we could very well lose our ranking as the No. 1 economy and  innovator in the world if we can't pass this.   Lower costs, more jobs, a stronger economy--that is the recipe behind  this bill, and it spells good news for the American people today and  for decades to come.   I want to thank both my Democratic and Republican colleagues for  working together for more than a year on these policies. I want to  thank Senator Cantwell, our very able, dedicated, and hard-working  committee chair, as well as Senators Wicker and Cornyn and Warner and  Kelly and Sinema, as well as our conference members, as well as the  many individual Senators on both sides who contributed to this  legislation. This has been bipartisan work in the Senate at its best-- something we have done on several pieces of legislation this year--and  I hope we can do more and do it more often.   Now, on the procedure, Members should know this vote will be a test  vote, and a favorable outcome will allow the science portion of USICA  to be included in this bill.   Let me explain. This vote will be a motion to proceed on a House  message, which we will use as a vehicle to pass our chips legislation.  It only requires 50 votes to proceed, but if we can get enough votes to  comfortably withstand a filibuster, I will amend this chips, ITC, and  ORAN bill to include the science provisions that so many of my  colleagues, led by Senators Cantwell and Wicker, have worked on so hard  to secure.   I want everyone to understand, a ``yes'' vote on this motion to  proceed indicates Members will vote yes on cloture on a package that  includes chips, ITC, ORAN, and the science provision.   As you all know, I am a strong supporter of the science provisions. I  was the original author, along with Senator Young, of many of these  policies under the Endless Frontier Act.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this vote, and I thank Senator  Young for his 2-year partnership on this legislation. However, folks,  if this vote doesn't produce enough votes to comfortably withstand a  filibuster, we will move forward with the chips, ORAN, and ITC  provisions here on the floor. It is my preference for the Senate to  include the science provisions in this bill because they are so  important for the future of our country.   I am very optimistic we will see a strong bipartisan vote later  today.  [[Page S3362]]                                ____________________     Now I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senate  has received a message from the House of Representatives to accompany  H.R. 4346.    I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message  to accompany H.R. 4346, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I was gratified, as many of us were on  both sides of the aisle, with these large votes--64 votes--for this  motion to proceed on to the new bill. It bodes very well that we can  get this bill done with a large vote and get it done as quickly as we  can, so I hope we move forward because this bill is so important for  jobs and for the future of the American economy.                   Motion to Concur with Amendment No. 5135     I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 4346, with an amendment.    I ask consent that further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I have an amendment at the desk.    I ask consent that further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I move to refer H.R. 4346 to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation with instructions to report back forthwith  with an amendment.    I ask consent that further reading of the motion be  dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I have an amendment to the instructions at the desk.    I ask consent that further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I withdraw my request.    Madam President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to  be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider  the following nomination: Calendar No. 922; that there be 10 minutes of  debate equally divided in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding  back of time, the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or  debate on the nomination; that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate; that no further motions be in order; that any related  statements be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative  session; further, that Calendar No. 1051 be considered under the same  agreement.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 3, Treaty  Document No. 115-3; that the treaty be considered as having advanced  through the various parliamentary stages up to and including the  presentation of the resolution of advice and consent to ratification;  that any committee conditions, declarations, or reservations be agreed  to as applicable; that any statements be printed in the Record as if  read; further, that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action, and the Senate resume legislative session.
