 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8294.   For 83 years, the National Apprenticeship Act has helped local  economies grow by providing unprecedented career opportunities to young  people. However, the National Apprenticeship Act has not supported  apprenticeships in the Northern Mariana Islands and other insular  areas. That inequity changes today.   H.R. 8294 incorporates my bill, the Outlying Area Apprenticeship  Expansion Act, investing more than $11.2 million over 5 years to create  and expand apprenticeships to the insular areas. Our schools already  provide students with the skills employers seek. But we need to build  the connection between the classroom and real-world work.  Apprenticeships provide that link.   I thank Congresswoman Davis and Chairman Scott for their leadership  on apprenticeships and for working with me to include a technical fix  to fully include the insular areas in the act. With widespread  unemployment due to the coronavirus, we need to help people get to  work. H.R. 8294 will help accomplish that goal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 8294. I am  going to miss Chairwoman Susan Davis as well.    Mr. Speaker, the Titus amendment is simple. It includes  hospitality and tourism as an eligible industry for expansion of  registered apprenticeship opportunities.   The hospitality and tourism industry is a major source for the  Marianas. The GAO's February 2020 report on Economic and Workforce  Trends in the Marianas found that hospitality and tourism account for  45 percent of GDP.   We are not unique. The industry is critical to many communities  across the Nation, but it is considered a nontraditional industry for  apprenticeships and has been unable to take full advantage of the  apprenticeship system. The Titus amendment fixes that.   As I stated earlier, for 83 years, the National Apprenticeship Act  has helped local economies grow by providing career opportunities to  young people. The Titus amendment guarantees that H.R. 8294 will build  on that  [[Page H5982]]  success by ensuring that the apprenticeship system is modernized to  address the workforce needs of the 21st century.   I support the Titus amendment and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   I also am grateful that the ranking member is supportive of the Titus  amendment. I thank everyone for their consideration, and I wish  everyone a happy Thanksgiving, a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American Hotel  and Lodging Association.                            American Hotel & Lodging Association,                                                  November 18, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       American Hotel & Lodging Association (AHLA), the sole       national association representing all segments of the U.S.       lodging industry, including iconic global brands, hotel       owners and franchisees, lodging real estate investment trusts       (REITs), hotel management companies, independent properties,       bed and breakfasts, state hotel associations, and industry       suppliers, I write in support of H.R. 8294, National       Apprenticeship Act of 2020. This important legislation would       expand the national apprenticeship system to include       nontraditional apprenticeship industries and create a grant       program to support registered apprenticeship, pre-      apprenticeship, and youth apprenticeship programs. AHLA also       strongly supports the bipartisan amendment offered by       Representatives Dina Titus (NV-1) and Gus Bilirakis (FL-12)       that would specifically identify the hospitality and tourism       industries as a nontraditional apprenticeship industry under       Sec. 201 of the Act.        Prior to the pandemic, filling service positions was one of       the hospitality industry's most significant challenges.       According to the Department of Labor (DOL), it was estimated       that nearly one million job vacancies remained unfilled. In       order to meet the needs of the industry, AHLA and the AHLA       Foundation, the charitable giving arm of the association, are       developing innovative programs that invest in our workforce       and are designed to open opportunities for underprivileged       communities, build careers, and strengthen the lodging       industry. The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 would       enable our Foundation to achieve this mission through grant       programs specifically targeted to our industry. Additionally,       the legislation updates the National Apprenticeship Act to       provide the flexibility we need to reflect modem practices       while maintaining the high standards set forth by DOL.        On behalf of the more than 33,000 small business hotels,       which represents over half of hotels in the country, and the       millions of associates they employ, I urge the House of       Representatives to swiftly pass H.R. 8294 and provide       nontraditional apprenticeship industries, like the       hospitality and tourism sectors, an avenue to continue to       grow our workforce and support our communities. Thank you for       your consideration of this critical matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Brian Crawford,                                           Executive Vice President,                                                Government Affairs.                                time  1645
