 Madam Speaker, last week the administration made yet  another attempt to strip healthcare away from our families.   Let me be clear: My community in the Central Valley needs more health  coverage, not less. We need more doctors; we need more nurses; we need  [[Page H3073]]  more mental health services; and we need everyone with a preexisting  condition to have coverage.   Each and every one of us in this Chamber has a loved one or a  neighbor who would be hurt by this effort. This includes my friend  Vicky, from Modesto.   She was healthy her whole life until she had her first seizure. She  was hospitalized and was having four to five seizures a day until her  doctor was able to find a medication that worked. She has to pay $400 a  month even now for this medicine, and she has insurance.   Imagine if this lawsuit goes through. Vicky will completely lose her  insurance. There are 100,000 other people in my community with a story  just like hers. These are real people who would be hurt.   Folks in my community have been crystal clear on this issue: We need  more healthcare for more people.   My community needs us to move this discussion forward, not backwards.                            ____________________
