 Mr. President.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't  think there is a single Member of the U.S. Senate who doesn't have  serious concerns about Turkey's behavior both historically and  currently. In fact, I support the spirit of this resolution. I suspect  99 of my colleagues do. At the right time, we may pass it, as Senator  Cruz has stated; however, I don't think this is the right time. If  there is a right time, this certainly isn't it. It is largely because  just hours ago, our President returned from the NATO summit in London  with NATO leaders, where this was a topic of discussion with the  leadership from Turkey--this being the acknowledgement of genocide, as  well as the purchase of the S-400.   I want to have a clear readout of the President's interaction and  discussion with President Erdogan and our delegation's negotiations  with Turkey before adopting this resolution. I don't think we can take  the risk of undermining the complex and ongoing diplomatic efforts  which are in our national security interests as a country.   I, too, want to be on the right side of history. I believe we will be  on the right side of history, but these negotiations that the President  is currently in are a part of getting on the right side of history.   I appreciate the ongoing conversations and still hope we will be able  to overcome the challenges in the bilateral relationship with Turkey.  We know what these challenges are, and we all share the goal of seeing  them appropriately addressed, but there is no good alternative right  now. In my view, adoption of this resolution today is unnecessary and  might very well undermine that diplomatic effort at a key time.   I do not intend to continuously object to this resolution, but I  believe it is appropriate for me to do so at this time, so I object.
