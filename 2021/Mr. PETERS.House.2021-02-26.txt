 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, like many, my district has been hit hard by this  pandemic. The virus has claimed the lives of 3,200 San Diegans. Nine  out of ten small businesses in the region report suffering in the face  of COVID-related closures.   I am voting to send this bill to the Senate because this plan will  safely reopen schools, get vaccines in arms, and help people get back  to work and the economy back on track. And the bill allows States and  localities to provide financial relief to our Nation's ports, like the  Port of San Diego, which expects a loss this year of over $98 million.   Still, I remain concerned about the targeting and accountability  around some of the funding, so I am urging the Senate to make some  comments and some improvements: Extend the duration of unemployment  payments, ideally with automatic triggers; adjust the amount of timing  of State aid based on real revenue shortfall resulting from COVID; and  expand funding for industries bearing the brunt of this crisis, like  small restaurants, public attractions, and live entertainment.    Mr. Speaker, I am voting ``yes'' because this is a good start. We  have to keep it on track, but there is more work to do.
