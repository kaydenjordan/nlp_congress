 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple and straightforward. It would  change the way our official taxpayer-funded mass mailings to  constituents look by limiting the mailer to the size of a standard  postcard.   As Members of Congress, it is our job to set the standard for  responsible stewardship of taxpayer funds, and public resources should  not be spent on excessive campaign-style mailers.                                time  1815    A significant part of our duties as elected representatives is to  keep our constituents informed about what we are doing in our offices.  I support mass mailings to our constituents, but we can keep them  informed by sending a simple postcard, without all of the glitz and  gloss.   Also, when official mail looks like campaign mailers, people are more  likely to toss it out, thereby defeating the very purpose of informing  our constituents. Our official mail should not look like campaign ads  or junk mail. Our constituents don't want large mailers. They just want  information. This amendment delivers.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, while I certainly appreciate my  colleagues' opinions on this and I recognize that it is not a perfect  solution, I don't think that this is a surprise.   We certainly have heard from our constituents, pretty much every  election cycle, when they start talking about all the mass mailings  they are receiving, with many pictures and lots of ideas about what has  been accomplished by the incumbent in office. It has been around for a  while. Like I said, I do appreciate it, but they are still able to mail  directly to a response from their colleagues or from any of their  constituents.   The reality is that most people are not looking at just a postcard in  this world. They do look online. I understand what you are talking  about. I have rural areas as well. They look online. Also, they can  receive a number of other correspondence from us. It does not in any  way impact the correspondence when they write to us.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
