 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, which states that this  legislation will dramatically cut Medicaid services that are vital to  people with disabilities and seniors.                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               with Disabilities,                                                     April 28, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: The Consortium for Citizens with       Disabilities (CCD) is strongly opposed to the amended       American Health Care Act. The amended American Health Care       Act retains the original bill's proposals to dramatically but       Medicaid services that are vital to people with disabilities       and seniors through per capita caps, which CCD has opposed.       The new amendments--including permitting states to seek       waivers from the protections for people with pre-existing       conditions and from the requirement to provide essential       health benefits--makes the amended AHCA even more harmful to       people with disabilities. We urge you to oppose this       legislation.        Medicaid provides services and supports that maintain the       health, function, independence, and well-being of 10 million       enrollees living with disabilities. For many people with       disabilities, being able to access timely needed care is a       life or death matter. The American Health Care Act changes       the way that the Federal Government funds Medicaid--rather       than paying states based on the actual costs of healthcare       for people in Medicaid, it sets a cap on the amount of       federal support, a cap that is totally unrelated to the       actual costs of needed care for enrollees. This cap is       designed to cut Medicaid, and the bill uses those cuts to pay       for unrelated tax cuts. Slashing federal support for       Medicaid, which is already a lean program, will force states       to cut services and eligibility that put the health and       wellbeing of people with disabilities at significant risk.        The newest amendments to the American Health Care Act make       the bill even more harmful to people with disabilities. The       new amendments would allow states to easily obtain waivers,       that would allow them to charge higher premiums to people       with pre-existing conditions, including people with       disabilities. They also would allow states to seek waivers       from the Affordable Care Act's requirement to provide       essential health benefits, including crucial services for       people with disabilities such as mental health and substance       use disorder services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and       habilitative services and devices, preventative and wellness       services and chronic disease management, and pediatric       services. These waivers jeopardize the Affordable Care Act's       protections for people with pre-existing conditions,       including people with disabilities, and CCD opposes any roll-      back of those protections.        The ACA helped millions of people with disabilities and       others to gain access to affordable and comprehensive health       insurance. The amended American Health Care Act is       insufficient to help people with disabilities meet their       healthcare needs, and we urge you to oppose the bill should       it come to a vote.

Mr. Speaker, there are 7 million veterans who are  eligible for VA care but not enrolled at the VA. All of them could be  denied access to the tax credits in this bill, and each in this Chamber  needs to understand how.   On page 10, line 6 of manager's amendment No. 4, it states that an  individual is not eligible for tax credits if they are eligible for  care, as defined by U.S. Code 5000A(f)(1)(A). This code specifically  includes VA care. So this means that those 7 million veterans who are  eligible for VA care, even if they are not enrolled, would not have  access to the tax credits in this law.   This is not fear-mongering. This is not hyperbole. This is the text  of the bill we are voting on today. This bill jeopardizes health care  for up to 7 million veterans, and everyone should oppose it.                                time  1245
