 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this  legislation. First, I thank the ranking member of the Natural Resources  Committee for yielding.   Climate change is an existential threat to the United States and the  world. Without action to reduce emissions, the damage to our Nation,  economy, and future generations will be immeasurable.   Americans understand the severity of this moment. That is why polling  shows that most Americans want to prioritize the development of  alternative energy sources over expanding the production of fossil  fuels.                                time  1430    The bill before us today will do the exact opposite. H.R. 1, the  polluters over people act, is a brazen giveaway to the oil, gas, and  mining industries.   As Big Oil reaps record profits thanks to billions of dollars in  taxpayer subsidies, this bill will rubberstamp the construction of new  natural gas pipelines and shut government agencies out of the review  process.   H.R. 1 will also mandate the auctioning of our public lands for oil  and gas leases, make it easier to export liquefied natural gas to  foreign adversaries, and allow oil companies to price gouge working  families.   This bill effectively gives energy companies a license to pollute.  Simply put, it is a disaster for our environment and our fight against  climate change.   Americans do not want energy policy to come at the expense of public  health. Many of my constituents have suffered for years from air  pollution emitted from a local plant that runs on burning natural gas  and fuel oil. This pollution has resulted in generations of families  developing asthma in what is colloquially known as asthma alley.   H.R. 1 will encourage this dangerous pollution in communities across  the country. That is why I have submitted two amendments. One will  protect these at-risk localities by removing restrictions preventing  individuals from suing in response to a violation of NEPA if they bring  a claim related to protecting public health. My second amendment would  require publicly traded companies to disclose their goals and actions  related to greenhouse gas emissions and meeting the goals of the Paris  climate accord.   These amendments were rejected by the Rules Committee, as were over  90 percent of the amendments proposed by my Democratic colleagues. So  much for the open amendment process Republicans promised when they took  over the majority.   H.R. 1 is a reckless bill that empowers polluters to boost profits  for Republicans' industry friends.   Last year, Democrats acted to lower energy costs for working families  and weaken our dependence on fossil fuels by passing the Inflation  Reduction Act. The IRA was the largest-ever investment in fighting  climate change while creating thousands of good-paying jobs, attracting  billions of dollars in investment, and lowering the average American  family's energy costs by about $1,800 a year.   H.R. 1 seeks to reverse the progress we have made since passing the  IRA. Mr. Chairman, this bill will take us backward both economically  and environmentally, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.
