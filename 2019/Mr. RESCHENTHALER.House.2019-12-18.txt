 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Collins for  yielding.   You know, in the Navy, we had a saying: BLUF, bottom line up front.   Well, I will give you the bottom line. Democrats are terrified that  President Trump is going to win reelection.   They can't beat him on the merits, so Democrats are caving to their  far left radical base and they are using the thoughts and feelings and  the assumptions of some unnamed bureaucrats rather than relying on  facts and law to impeach a duly elected President.   Let me be clear: This is nothing more than a political hit job.   You know, I have been on all sides of the courtroom. I was a  prosecutor in the Navy, I was a defense attorney in the Navy, I was a  district judge in my hometown.   And let me tell you, as a lawyer, I would defend this case every day  of the week. As a judge, I would dismiss this on day one for lack of  merit. There is no prima facie case here.   I will tell you who I would prosecute, though. I would prosecute Adam  Schiff for abuse of power. Why? How about the fact that he used his  position as chairman to leak phone records of Ranking Member Devin  Nunes? How about the fact that he dumped over 8,000 pages of documents  on Republicans less than 48 hours before a hearing? That is the abuse  of power.   And obstruction? I would prosecute the Democrats for obstruction. How  about the fact that the Judiciary Committee Democrats voted down my  request to subpoena the whistleblower? How about the fact that Chairman  Nadler refused every single Republican request for a fact witness? That  is obstruction of Congress.   So, again, let me be clear: Today is nothing more than a political  hit job.
