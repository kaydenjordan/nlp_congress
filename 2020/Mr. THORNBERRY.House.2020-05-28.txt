 Madam Speaker, yesterday, we lost a former colleague,  a patriot, and a true American hero.   Calling the gentleman from Texas, Sam Johnson, a hero is not some  sort of inflated rhetoric or hyperbole; it is the best description I  know of Sam Johnson and his life.   Born in San Antonio, raised in Dallas, a graduate of SMU, Sam then  served 29 years in the United States Air Force.   He was a fighter pilot, and some of those fighter pilot traits came  through in everything he did, from how fast he drove across the  highways of Texas to the way he approached legislation.   Sam was a veteran of the Korean conflict and, of course, the Vietnam  war.   On his 25th combat mission in Vietnam, he was shot down, severely  injured, and spent the next 7 years as a prisoner of war in the prison  known as the Hanoi Hilton.   Many Members have read his book ``Captive Warriors,'' which describes  the hellish conditions and the courage and fortitude of Sam and his  fellow prisoners as they fought to survive.   After serving in the Texas State House, Sam was elected to Congress  in 1990 and served until January 2019, including, for a time, as acting  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.   He now goes to join his wonderful wife, Shirley, and his son, Bob.   Madam Speaker, I know of no one in the House who was more universally  admired across the Chamber than Sam Johnson.   Sam sacrificed much in service of our Nation, but always with courage  and good humor and a deep, deep love of country.   He inspired those of us who worked with him, and his memory will  continue to be an inspiration to follow his example of service,  sacrifice, and love of country.   Madam Speaker, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence in  memory and in honor of this great American.
