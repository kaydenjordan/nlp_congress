 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Otto Frederick Warmbier as we approach the fourth anniversary of his  tragic death on June 19, 2017.   Otto was a kind and studious young man, raised in Ohio, was  salutatorian of his high school and attended the University of  Virginia. At the age of 22, he was imprisoned and tortured by the North  Korean regime following a school tour in 2015 and died a few days after  he was released.   Mr. Warmbier experienced what no American or human being should ever  have to go through. The United States will not back down from holding  the North Korean regime accountable for human rights abuses.   As one of the first Korean-American women to serve in Congress and a  member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I will continue to do my  part to advocate for global human rights and hold violators  accountable.   We remember and honor Otto, always.                            ____________________
