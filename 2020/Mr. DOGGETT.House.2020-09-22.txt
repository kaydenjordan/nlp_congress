 Madam Speaker, Saturday Libby and I joined many at the  Supreme Court to honor Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a true defender of  our most fundamental rights at a time when this President and his  enablers increasingly threaten the very preservation of our democracy.  [[Page H4654]]    Having fought her entire professional life against double standards,  it is essential that a double standard not apply to her replacement.   When Justice Scalia died 8 months before a Presidential election,  Republicans blocked any consideration of President Obama's nomination  to the Court. Only total hypocrisy would permit Republicans to name a  replacement after voting for President has already begun in a number of  States.   Why Trump's big rush? Because he wants this court packed with judges  that will take away healthcare and protection for preexisting  conditions for millions of Americans. And just in case, when he loses  the popular vote once again, he needs some judges to help him cling to  power. The best tribute to Justice Ginsburg is demanding consistency  and then replacing a President who shares absolutely none of her  values.   With everything at stake, we need to give it everything we have got.  Let's protect the equality and justice she worked a lifetime to defend.                            ____________________
