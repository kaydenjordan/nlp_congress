 Madam President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize Xusana Davis, who delivered the keynote address for Vermont's  24th Annual Women's Economic Opportunity Conference earlier this year.  Each year, Marcelle and I host this conference to bring together  Vermonters to learn how to navigate, grow, and succeed in today's  workplace. While public health concerns led to an online conference  this year, the dedication of the women who participated shone through.  I hope the participants were as inspired by Ms. Davis's words as I was.   Xusana Davis is Vermont's first Executive Director of Racial Equity  and was appointed in 2019 by Vermont Governor Phil Scott. In her  position as the Director of Racial Equity, she works with Vermont  agencies and communities to address systemic racial disparities,  ensures the State's operations meet its equity goals and objectives,  and guides policy on equity issues. She offered an insightful view of  how we can all advance equity in our communities and offered her  remarks with grace and eloquence.   Ms. Davis's leadership comes at a time when we continue to see great  need for equity in the workplace. The pandemic has worsened preexisting  disparities that have effected women, especially those who identify  with historically marginalized communities. As Ms. Davis emphasizes in  her speech, we must all work to promote equity as we collectively  participate in our Nation's economic recovery. I would like to share  her inspiring words by submitting them for inclusion in the  Congressional Record in the hopes that we may all take her message to  heart.   I ask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [Oct. 23, 2021]                   ``Opportunity Is Not a Fungible Good''                             (By Xusana Davis)         Thank you, Senator Leahy, for inviting me to join you       today.  [[Page S9158]]         Hola, buenos dias, everyone. As you might have heard, the       Executive Director of Racial Equity is a relatively new       position for Vermont state government. While it got its share       of fanfare in the summer of 2019 when I was first appointed,       I'd like to share with you a little bit of the work we've       been doing since then. We've worked hard with our sister       agencies across state government on internal and external-      facing policy. Things like the Fair and Impartial Policing       policy, stimulus funds to get communities through tough times       at the outset of the pandemic, and how we provide health       services to people by treating the whole person. We've been       poking our noses into conversations all over the state to       help people at the local level figure out how to grow--or at       least retain--their town populations. And of course, we've       been a sounding board for leaders of all kinds who want to       take bold action to be and do better on matters of equity.        But you probably knew all that. What you may not have known       is that all of this work is bigger than race and ethnicity.       It always has been. This work is essential in all corners of       the state and in every sector, because there's a collective       benefit to equity, and a collective harm to inequity. But       before we jump into that, let's back up a bit . . .        First, let's talk about ``opportunity.'' Do you ever notice       that we talk about ``opportunity'' like it's a fungible good?       Like it's some sort of coupon that we can pass to the person       behind us in the checkout line. We talk about ``giving''       opportunities. Or ``seizing'' them--maybe you're a bit more       aggressive, and that's okay! Or we talk about ``creating''       opportunities, as if they can just materialize.        But out of all the verbs we choose to deploy on these       opportunities, there's always the implication that there's a       transfer. That there's a person who holds or creates       opportunities, and that the rest of us are just trying to get       a piece. That's our first mistake--thinking that an       opportunity is something that must be given or surrendered to       us, something that we must wrestle from someone's firm grip.       And there are a few reasons for this thinking: After all,       there's a lot of money to be made from commodifying ``girl       power.'' We can produce highly dramatized films about long-      ignored women historical figures. Or sell a self-help book       about how to be the next successful businesswoman who ``can       have it all.'' But for a lot of us, the barriers to       opportunity are not something we can unlock with three easy       payments of $39.99 but wait, there's more. No, many of the       barriers to opportunity are systemic. They are structural.       They are bigger than any of us as individuals, but they       absolutely impact all of us as individuals.        That's what I meant when I said racial equity is bigger       than race. You see, when we think of women's economic       opportunity, many people incorrectly assume that these       opportunities are only for the benefit of women. They are       not. Women are 51 % of the U.S. population--we're not a       ``special interest.'' We are the interest. Something that       impacts the numerical majority is inevitably something that       impacts the whole. Think about it: Childcare. Reproductive       justice. You think these are only women's issues? Well, have       you ever been a child? Or cared about a child? Then childcare       and child development should matter to you. I'm reminded of       the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who for years       was, well, rather indignant about parental leave and       childcare issues. He didn't get it and he didn't want to get       it . . . until his daughter had children and struggled to       balance her parental duties with her professional life. Then       suddenly Grandpa Scalia was dropping off children here and       there, and babysitting, and you know what? He changed his       stance. He suddenly realized that the burden did not simply       fall on his adult daughter--and that even if it did, it       shouldn't have. And that's the point: there are ripple       effects to the ways in which we treat people in society. And       when we talk about women's economic opportunity like it's a       hobby or a solo mission, like it's something that can be       bartered or restricted to only during nap time, then we're       ignoring the network of people surrounding us who will be       impacted by those choices and resources.        This is true in the racial equity space, too. In workshops       and trainings, I often ask people to consider the benefits       and rights they enjoy today that were fought and won by       people of color. For example, Ernesto Miranda. Do you know       him? You do . . . You just may not know you do. Ernesto       Miranda is a Latino man who is the reason that you get read       your Miranda rights if you get arrested. Sylvia Mendez. Ring       a bell? You know her--sure you do! She was on a postal stamp!       Mendez v. Westminster. 1946. That's the court case that gave       us Brown v. Board. And Brown v. Board is the case that gave       every child--including your child--the right to a free and       fair basic education. Truth is, in the United States, every       gain accomplished by members of dominant groups always       benefits members of dominant groups, and only sometimes       benefits members of historically marginalized or oppressed       groups. But every gain accomplished by historically oppressed       groups always benefits members of dominant groups.       Affirmative action. Do you know what is the number one       beneficiary group of affirmative action policies in       education and employment in the U.S.? That's right, White       women.        So when we think about equity and reducing structural,       systemic barriers, there is always a collective benefit to       equity. And that's why Senator Leahy has been doing this       conference since 1996--you think he likes making people wake       up early on a Saturday? No! Well, maybe . . . But really,       it's because he knows what's been right in front of us all       along--that when we stop disempowering people, we all move       forward. We all win. And you know why? Because life isn't       zero-sum. And your winning does not equate my losing.        And we know this now, but people didn't always recognize       this truth. Let's think back to the women's suffrage       movement. Susan B. Anthony was pretty racist. That's why       people like Sojourner Truth and, later, bell hooks had to ask       the question ``Ain't I A Woman?'' This is reflective of a       bigger concept--a concept you've likely heard of--called       Intersectionality. Intersectionality is what makes us dynamic       and multi-faceted. It's what multiplies our strength as a       movement and as a community. Because I'm not just a woman.       I'm also a person of color. I'm also a Millennial. I'm right-      handed. These are only some of my many identities, and not       even the more important ones. And when we allow ourselves to       represent all of our selves, without letting it come between       us, that's when we will have used intersectionality for good.        Of course, intersectionality sometimes has its thorns. Two       days ago was Latina Women's Equal Pay Day in the U.S. I'll       explain what that means: You see, we already know that in the       U.S., women statistically make less money for the same work       than men do. And separately, we also know that people of       color statistically make less money for the same work than       White people do. So statistically speaking, my intersecting       identities as a woman and as a person of color make me more       likely to earn less than my male counterparts of all       ethnicities, and less than my women-identified peers who are       White. So what is Women's Equal Pay Day? Well, it's the       symbolic date that represents how much more a woman has to       work in order to match the earnings of a man in a given       calendar year. In 2021, Women's Equal Pay Day was March 24th       So that means if a woman and a man started working on Jan 1,       2020, then it would take the woman until March 24 of this       year to catch up to the earning of a man by Dec 31 of 2020.       But that's not the full story: for most women of color, Equal       Pay Day comes much later. For example, Equal Pay Day for       Asian American and Pacific Islander women was March 9th. But       for Black American women, it was August 3rd. For Indigenous       women in the U.S., Equal Pay Day was Sept 8th of this year.       And for Latina women--that's the bucket where you'll find       me--it was Oct 21st. So in other words, statistically       speaking, I would have needed to work all of calendar year       2020, plus an additional 9 months and 3 weeks to earn the       same that a White man earned in calendar year 2020. And       remember intersectionality? Well, it goes beyond just race.       There are different Equal Pay Days for mothers and for       members of the LGBTQIA+ community. And I need to make an       important point, one that my best friend frequently raises:       the goal is not to look at what White men are doing and       saying ``Yeah, we want the right to do that . . .'' That's       not the standard. It's not about making the same money for       the same work if that work is only fueling oppression and       ecological harm.        All of this is to say that it's not enough to lump us all       into one large bucket and think we're doing enough. That's       not true equity. Equity means recognizing that within our       communities there are certainly different challenges, but       also different skill sets for finding solutions to those       challenges. Trust each other more. Trust one another's       experience more.        And on the topic of trust, and speaking of solutions, let's       think about how we can we turn this dialogue towards action.       First things first: action by whom? Who gets to do the thing?       And who gets to decide what the thing is? If your rights and       liberties are restricted and determined by someone else, then       your power is contingent upon them giving you permission to       exercise it. Like asking men who can vote to vote on whether       you can vote. As Upton Sinclair said, ``It is difficult to       get a man to understand something when his salary depends on       his not understanding.'' Or holding hearings on reproductive       justice without any women present--don't ever forget:       ``nothing about us without us.''        So we're through asking for permission. For those who want       to join us in advancing justice, what we need is genuine and       sincere support. And support is different from permission--it       is not about asking to be ``given'' opportunities, and it is       not about having to ``seize'' them either. It's about the       recognition that opportunity just exists--it always has. And       the question is not whether or how to grant it, but rather,       how to stop blocking it. This is an important point: People       often see equity work as some kind of handout, as if people       who have been oppressed are asking to be given something.       Incorrect. What's needed is that we stop actively blocking       and suppressing people's ability to move and thrive and grow       and exist. That's the key.        So how do we stop blocking? Well, first we must make       meaningful investments of time, effort, and finances--not       token gestures. It means when we talk about mentorship, we       don't just shuttle women into the same paths where they still       wind up working for rich men to make those men richer. It       means when your staff tell you they want you to revise       workplace policies because they unjustly prejudice your       women-identified  [[Page S9159]]       workers, you listen. And don't just listen for the sake of       saying ``Okay, we listened and we're still going to keep       doing things the same way we've always done them because       that's how we've always done them . . .'' it means listening       for the purpose of action. Take a broad view: if you don't       provide parental leave to a male employee, you know who       suffers? A new mother who might have to delay her re-entry       into the workforce--perhaps permanently--because her partner       can't participate in childrearing duties. That's a       withholding of a women's economic opportunity. And you need       to turn your thermostats up in the office. I'm serious--this       has ``Patriarchy'' written all over it. You see, the so-      called ideal office temperature is based on a formula that       calculated the average of workers' resting metabolic rates,       but the workers in question were all men, an average of 40       old, and an average of 154 pounds. Oh, and they were wearing       suits and ties. Today's workforce doesn't look the same.       There are women in the workforce--and remember, the rigid       gender binary has created the expectation that women wear       things like skirts and sandals in warmer months, so the       clothing differences already create more exposure for us. We       also have seniors working longer before retirement, so the       workforce also has an aging population that may be more       thermosensitive.        That's what we mean when we say inequity is ``systemic''--      the formulas are actually built in to our lives through       infrastructure, fashion, and employment practices. So anyway,       when half the office is shivering and stepping into the       service stairwell every couple hours to thaw out, you need to       bump up the temperature.        So as I bring my remarks to a close, I want to share with       you a quote from James Joyce's Ulysses, in which the speaker       says ``We feel in England that we have treated you rather       unfairly. It seems history is to blame.'' And I really enjoy       that line because it speaks to how we distance ourselves from       the oppression of others. You see, by stating that       ``history'' is to blame, it implies [a] that there was       nothing we could have done about it, and [b] that we're not       responsible for fixing things. But of course, that isn't       true. We are absolutely in control of how we invest, how we       govern, how we vote, and how we envision ``opportunity.'' As       you engage with workshops, panels, and networking settings       throughout today's event, keep these things in mind: who is       at the table, who is missing, which intersecting identities       are at play here, and who shapes the agenda for action.       Remember what Senator Leahy said: ``a stronger and more       equitable economy.'' We can get there, but it must include       all of us . . . whatever your career might be, equity is       still your job. Thank you for your time.                            ____________________
