 Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington and the  Distinguished Ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce, Science and  Transportation Committee yield for a colloquy on some issues related to  the committee's substitute for S. 2800?    The Commerce Committee substitute, as proposed, contains  three provisions that are cause for concern for my colleague and me. I  would yield to my colleague from Maryland, a distinguished member of  the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds NASA, to outline these  concerns.    Will the Senator from Washington confirm that it is not  the committee's intention or desire to force NASA to establish a  university affiliated research center or to see either sections 818 or  section 819 enacted without sufficient peer review, to avoid even the  appearance of a perception that any favorable recommendation is  predesignated for a specific institution or set of institutions?    I thank the Senator for her assurances and ask her,  knowing that the future of this bill's fate in this Congress is  uncertain, if she will agree that she will work with my colleague from  Maryland and me to fix these provisions to our satisfaction early in  the next Congress before a new NASA authorization bill is introduced?
