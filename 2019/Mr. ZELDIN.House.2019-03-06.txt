 Mr. Speaker, there is no room for anti-Semitism anywhere  in this Chamber.   This past January, the House voted nearly unanimously to condemn  white supremacy, and it named a Republican Member as we did that. I  voted for that.   Back in January, around the same exact time, we had a Member  apologize for remarks about how Israel had hypnotized the world, an  anti-Semitic trope; a month later, apologizing for an allegation that  if you support Israel, then you have been bought off by Jews; and now,  claiming that if you support Israel, then that means that you have  allegiance to a foreign government.   But this time there will be no apology. I commend my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle who have spoken out against it. This  Chamber today should be taking action to condemn anti-Semitism, to be  naming names; and where that Member in January was removed from his  committees, including the Small Business Committee, the Member who has  been putting out all those anti-Semitic tropes should not be serving on  her committees, especially the House Foreign Affairs Committee, for  many reasons.   I encourage a vote today and to remove Congresswoman Omar from the  House Foreign Affairs Committee.                            ____________________
