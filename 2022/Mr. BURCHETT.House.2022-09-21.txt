 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Brigadier General Thomas  Cauthen, an American patriot who served 38 years in the Tennessee Air  National Guard.   He was inspired as a child by watching his dad's career as a pilot in  the Tennessee Air National Guard's 134th Fighter-Interceptor Group,  which later became the 134th Air Refueling Wing.   In 1984, General Cauthen followed in his dad's footsteps and started  his commission right after getting his bachelor of science in civil  engineering from the University of Tennessee.   After getting his pilot training, he flew combat support missions  during Operation Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Joint Forge, Allied  Force, Enduring Freedom, and Noble Eagle. He eventually went to the  134th Air Refueling Wing and ended up serving as its commander for 7  years. He then became the director of staff at the Joint Force  Headquarters Tennessee and then chief of staff for the entire Tennessee  Air National Guard.   Mr. Speaker, last month, he retired after 38 long years of faithfully  serving his country. He plans to spend more time with his wonderful  wife, Penny, their two kids, and their grandchild. He also plans to get  more involved with the community by volunteering with the Employer  Support of the Guard and Reserve and get more involved with the East  Tennessee Military Affairs Council.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Brigadier General Thomas  Cauthen as Tennessee's Second District's September 2022 Veteran of the  Month. I thank him for his incredible service and congratulate him on a  well-earned retirement.     Congratulating Ethan and Ari Klasky Powerlifting Champions in East                                 Tennessee     Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to appreciate some  powerlifting champions in east Tennessee. That is correct, I said  powerlifting.   Last week, I was on the plane back to Knoxville from Washington. This  fellow sitting next to me talked excitedly about his set of twins, 17- year-old Ari and Ethan, who go to Webb School of Knoxville. They are  powerlifting champions.   Their dad, Scott, used to powerlift as a hobby, and he got his boys  into the  [[Page H8019]]  sport when they were about 9 years old. They all trained together, and  as time went on, they ended up loving the sport as much as their dad.   This year, the boys decided to compete for the first time in the  Southern Powerlifting Federation championship, and they blew the  competition out of the water. Both boys won their divisions, and Ari  set a world record--a world record, Mr. Speaker--for his age and weight  class by lifting a total of 1,660 pounds between his deadlift, bench,  and squat.   It is very cool to me to have a world record holder who goes to  school in my district, but it is even cooler to hear how the shared  love of powerlifting bonded this father and his sons in a very unique  way.   Ari and Ethan didn't grow up as bickering brothers as most do. They  grew up as training partners. They supported each other, kept each  other safe, and pushed each other to keep pursuing their goals.   Unfortunately, Ari tore his ACL and won't be able to compete in the  squat or deadlift this year, but he isn't letting that fact get him  down. He still plans to compete in the bench press competition, and he  credits his perseverance to his brother's constant inspiration. Ari  isn't giving up on his dream of competing in the USA Powerlifting  competition.   I have a teenage daughter, Isabelle, and she is also an athlete. She  does horseback riding competitions. She is a barrel racer, and she is  pretty good at it. I know exactly how awesome it is to be a dad who is  incredibly proud of their kids' accomplishments.    We all want our kids to do well in life. To see them push themselves  and exceed everyone's expectations is a feeling like no other.   Scott, Ari, and Ethan are prime examples of what we can accomplish  when we set goals and work hard every day to achieve them.   Mr. Speaker, I take just a moment to recognize their accomplishments.                            ____________________
