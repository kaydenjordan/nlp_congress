 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of this evening's special  order.    Mr. Speaker, this evening the Congressional  Progressive Caucus is going to be sharing some thoughts with the  American people about this extremely horrible zero-tolerance policy  that Mr. Trump has subjected our Nation to.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this administration's  cruel and inhumane zero-tolerance policy at the border that has  resulted in the separation of more than 2,000 children from their  families and their loved ones.   This policy calls to mind the worst of our history, including the  internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, our refusal to  grant safety to Jewish refugees during the Holocaust, and the treatment  of Africans who were brought here as chattel slaves during and  throughout the Middle Passage.   Unlike what the administration says, this policy is not required by  law, and I think that has been made plain to all Americans. It is not  President Obama's doing, and I think that has been made plain to all  Americans. It is not in any way justified by the Bible. In fact, as a  Christian and someone who grew up in the church, I know that these very  same verses were falsely used to justify four centuries of chattel  slavery, and that the Bible teaches us to welcome the stranger and to  beware of spiritual wickedness in high places.   So don't be deceived. This policy of choice is solely the result of a  racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, and antifamily values agenda  adopted by this administration to intimidate immigrants of color  seeking asylum from violence and persecution for their own political  gain.   The Trump administration has also sought to avoid responsibility for  its decisions by cowardly claiming that no such policy exists, as  Secretary Nielsen claimed in a reply to my March 20 letter and then  reiterated more recently via Twitter--more lies and deception.   However, when 2,000 children are separated from their families, many  of whom have been dispersed across this Nation as a result of a  decision made by the Trump Department of Justice, a policy of depravity  indeed exists.   But that is not all. Children are now, as I have stated, being  shipped all across this Nation, including to New York City where there  are currently at least 239 children being detained just a few miles  from my district and thousands more who are miles away from their  caregivers.   Yesterday, Donald Trump finally gave way to public pressure by  signing an executive order that he claims will end this horrific  policy. Unfortunately, he did so by abrogating his responsibility under  the Flores agreement to release children without unnecessary delay and  to keep those who are in custody under the least restrictive conditions  possible. This means that children will be detained with their  families, which is also unacceptable.   Unfortunately, this body, too, is neglecting its responsibility to  the American people by debating the most restrictive immigration bills  that ignore past commitments to Dreamers and the diversity visa lottery  program, and would build an unnecessary and ineffective border wall  with Mexico.   To add insult to injury, Republicans, who control every branch of  government, blame Democrats for their failure to legislate and offer  these regressive, dead-on-arrival bills as solutions to problems that  they themselves have created.   So, tonight, I call on this administration to stop playing politics  with immigrant lives and on my Republican colleagues to pass  meaningful, comprehensive immigration reform that not only protects  Dreamers, but protects individuals who are under temporary protected  status, and stop separating families.   Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor and my privilege to yield to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy). Representative Joe Kennedy  represents the Fourth Congressional District of Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Massachusetts for his eloquence and putting what has been a very  disturbing period of time for the American people in perspective.   Indeed, as our children born in the United States witness what is  taking place under the Trump administration, we all have to ask  ourselves a question about who we are as Americans and what it is that  we are leaving as a legacy for our children and our grandchildren to  inherit from us.   I believe the gentleman from Massachusetts has really put it all into  context. Indeed, here in the United States, where we have the access to  the best of everything, we have limited ourselves by the artificial  divisions that would subjugate some of humanity while elevating others.   Having said that, I have been joined by one of the most eloquent  speakers here in the House of Representatives. She is the chairwoman of  our Steering and Policy Committee for the Democratic Caucus and has  been a fierce fighter for children and families.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield to the gentlewoman from the  Third Congressional District of Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Connecticut for her impassioned plea and for enumerating for us the  type of work that we are going to have to engage in to redeem ourselves  by looking at reunification of these families to the best of our  ability. We are going to need the resources. We are going to need the  will. We are going to have to redeem ourselves by getting these  children back to their parents by whatever means we possibly can  muster.   Rosa DeLauro also raised some very important questions about  investigation and oversight about child abuse. It is my hope that we  will continue to be vigilant because, indeed, all of our souls are tied  to what has transpired here. None of us can feel as though we don't  have a role to play in redeeming our country in what has just occurred.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to yield to the gentleman  from the Fifth District of Illinois (Mr. Quigley), someone who has been  a part of this body fighting for justice and human dignity.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Illinois for bringing to the fore the concerns of children in our  country who are looking at what is taking place on our border and not  quite understanding, not grasping, the weight of why and how something  like this could happen in this country, the home of the brave and the  land of the free.   We are really in a space in time right now where every American is  really questioning what we value in terms of one another's humanity.   Someone I know who has been a part of solution-driven policy is Ms.  Carol Shea-Porter, the gentlewoman from the First Congressional  District of New Hampshire.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Shea- Porter) at this time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire for her impassioned plea, for really setting the table with  regards to the type of child abuse that we have all witnessed and with  which we are all trying to grapple at this time, and for appealing to  the administration to correct course.   Right now we are still in need of answers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois, Congresswoman  Jan Schakowsky, to speak at this time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman of the  Ninth Congressional District of Illinois, a very prominent member of  the Congressional Progressive Caucus, for really drilling down on a  number of the issues that we all have to grapple with here in Congress  as Members of the House of Representatives and of the U.S. Senate, that  the administration under Donald Trump has to grapple with, and the  American people.   We really have to search our souls at this time and think about the  children. We are talking about infants, who are breastfeeding, taken  away from their mothers. We are talking about toddlers who are barely  able to walk, who aren't potty-trained, who have to be stacked up with  a whole bunch of other children who they have no relationship with.   We have heard reports of children trying to console one another and  being chastised because they are afraid. They only have one another to  cling to, and no one is there to hug them, to soothe them, and to make  them feel okay. This is unreal in the 21st century that we would sink  to such depths to prove a point. And what is the point again? That you  cannot come to the United States seeking refuge from violence, from  death and destruction, as so many others have done in prior  generations. These people, in particular, have no claim to asylum. That  if you dare come and claim it, we will take your children, and we will  extract from you even more pain than you left in the country that  caused you to flee. I can't believe that this is the United States of  America in the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney), who has something that she would like to share, from the  12th Congressional District of New York, and a member of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York for her sentiments as well. And as she has stated--I didn't state  this in the beginning of my remarks--I happen to be a second generation  American myself. My parents came from the beautiful island nation of  Jamaica in the Caribbean as foreign students in the 1950s. They came to  this Nation where they knew that their talent and their work ethic  would enable them to reach their God-given potential, but could never  have dreamt that they would live this long--they lived more time here  in the United States than they ever did in the Caribbean--as  naturalized Americans to see this type of behavior take place in our  country on the auspices of our government.   I look at my octogenarian parents, and I say to them, this is not who  we are as a nation. And that we stand with all the people of goodwill  in this Nation who see this behavior from the Trump administration as  totally abhorrent. That we will not stand by idly and see this  continue. We will be part of the resistance to make sure that these  families' human dignity are restored, and that these children, where  possible, can be returned to their families, at whatever cost it may  be. It may mean that we will have to do DNA testing, or it may mean  that we will have to hire private investigators. Whatever the cost, it  is up to us to make these families whole.                                time  2030    They only came to this Nation seeking refuge, and what we gave them  was heartache, was pain. What we have given these children is trauma,  is pain, is heartache.   What we are hearing of reports now from some of these privately  hired-out contractors is children being abused, which was inevitable  because, indeed, we are irresponsible in the behavior that this  administration took. These organizations were not vetted. They tried to  do all of this in the dark, and now we all pay a very dear price.   We have all been stripped this much, a little bit more, of our  humanity due to the behavior of the Trump administration, Donald Trump,  and his Cabinet members who saw fit to hide this from the American  people and to treat human beings as though they didn't deserve the  human dignity that all human beings on this planet deserve.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for giving us the time to share  the perspective of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all of my colleagues who came to  the floor this evening. We stand shoulder to shoulder, united with the  American people to make this right, to end this zero-tolerance policy,  and to push back at every turn on the dehumanization of mankind,  womankind, childkind across this globe that still regard this Nation as  a shining city on a hill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time
