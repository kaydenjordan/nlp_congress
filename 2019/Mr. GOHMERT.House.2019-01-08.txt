 Madam Speaker, in 2007 there was a vote in this body  about whether or not we provide a barrier, a wall, a fence, and we had  Democratic leaders who voted for it back then, both here and in the  Senate. Seventy-nine Senators voted for it back then.   The problem is not better on our border, and, in fact, the drugs  coming across are worse. There was enough fentanyl coming across in the  past year to kill every American adult. The problem is worse.   Folks here were for a wall, a barrier. It seems the only difference  is now there is a President that some in here absolutely despise.                            ____________________
