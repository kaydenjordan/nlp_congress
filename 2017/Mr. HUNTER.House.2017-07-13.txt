 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me time.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the minority leader's words. I did three  tours as a U.S. marine.   This is the silliest opposition to this amendment that I have ever  heard. You are joining the U.S. military. Choose what gender you are  before you join. We are not saying that transgender people can't serve,  but if you are going to take the big step of serving in the U.S.  military, figure out whether you are a man or a woman before you join  up.   We are not stopping transgender people from joining. We are saying  taxpayers in this country right now are not going to foot the bill for  it.   This is a silly thing. It is time to put this to bed. I support the  gentlewoman's amendment. Let's Make America Great Again.
