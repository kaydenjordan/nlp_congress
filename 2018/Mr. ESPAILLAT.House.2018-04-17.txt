 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge Speaker Ryan do the  following: before he retires, do the right thing and bring the Dream  Act to the floor.   Already 46 of his Republican colleagues and more than 170 Democrats-- that is 218 bipartisan supporters--have, as of today, cosponsored H.  Res. 774. This will force debate on competing DACA bills in the House  and use a procedure known as Queen of the Hill. This will include four  amendments, including Representative Roybal-Allard's clean Dream Act  and an amendment, H.R. 4796, the USA Act. Mr. Speaker, this will force  a debate on this issue.   The Dreamers have the support of the American people and Members of  Congress. Bring the Dream Act to the floor.  [[Page H3353]]                                ____________________
