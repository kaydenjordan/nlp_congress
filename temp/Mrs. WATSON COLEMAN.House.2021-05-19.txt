 Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that January 6  was a frightening experience. It was an assault upon the fundamentals  of this Government. It was an assault upon the place I thought I was  going to be the safest I could possibly be, and we politicize this.   This is an opportunity to bring this bipartisan commission into  existence so that we can get out of the politics of it and look at the  facts that happened, the evidence that happened, and the  recommendations that will ensue from that effort.   I wholeheartedly support this effort. I am grateful for the  bipartisanship of it, and I pray that all of our colleagues will  support this.
