 Madam Speaker, I rise today to defend the sanctity of  life.   Today, the Supreme Court is hearing the case of Dobbs v. Jackson  Women's Health Organization. I am glad the Supreme Court has decided to  take up this important case in which they will consider whether all  pre-viability bans on abortion are unconstitutional. Scientific  advancements have rendered the viability standard established since Roe  as outdated.   Today, we know the following: By 15 weeks, babies in the womb have a  heartbeat. They have arms, legs, fingers, and toes. And they have fully  developed hearts and can respond to light and touch almost anywhere  else on their bodies.   President Biden and my colleagues on the left have taken an anti-life  stance and pushed policies that would require taxpayers to fund  abortions. They also would require healthcare providers to perform  abortions, despite any moral objections that they may have, and remove  existing protections to allow abortions on demand, no matter what the  age of the fetus.   This is wrong. I value unborn innocent lives and I will always push  back with a clear and strong message.                            ____________________
