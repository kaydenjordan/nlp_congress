 Mr. Speaker, I'm going to do my best not to sound  frustrated and defeated. I actually do believe there is hope. But  somewhere here--and I'm going to show the numbers--we have got to  figure out some way, particularly my brothers and sisters on the left  but even some on my side, to understand what is going on in the math.  The math will always win.   Tonight, I am going to throw a lot of math, a lot of the facts. These  facts functionally decide whether this country survives or not. These  facts decide whether we are going to have prosperity or not. And the  avoidance of the math around here, the avoidance of the actual math.  The level of cruelty, the level of just viciousness that will make to  the poor, the working middle class, to anyone in this country, because  the actual economic data that has flowed through to today is pretty  damn ugly.   Let's start to deal with some reality on the math. And this board is  already out of date.   In the next 30 years, CBO--and this is from a couple months ago-- says, in today's dollars, 30 years from now, we will have $138  trillion--and the reason I had to do this is because the number keeps  changing, and this is already out of date--$138 trillion of borrowed  money.   And this is one of the hard things, because we are terrified to tell  our voters this, but it is the math. It is the truth. Every dime of  this borrowed money, from today's $31 trillion of borrowed to $138  trillion borrowed, is the shortfall on Medicare. It is the shortfall on  Social Security. It is the demographics.   And what is terrifying is this Medicare number, when healthcare right  now has doubled the inflation rate, doubled the inflation rate of the  rest of the country. I represent the highest inflation in the  continental United States; the Scottsdale-Phoenix area. We are sitting  around 13 percent. And in my marketplace, we are being told 20-plus  percent is my medical inflation. This number explodes.   How many times this last week have you had anyone come behind these  microphones and say: I am terrified what I just did to people trying to  head toward retirement. I am terrified what we have done to the next  generation.   This is reality. This is the math. And this doesn't really have all  the spending.   President Biden, unified control of the left, has been here, what,  18-some months. Congratulations, he added $4.8 trillion to the deficit.   Remember the campaign rhetoric? Oh, they're going to be responsible,  they are going to balance things--$4.8 trillion to the deficit.   Here is where the math gets terrifying, and I am just livid that no  one is willing to walk behind these microphones and tell the voters the  truth because we need to hand out cash, so they vote for us; so they  cuddle with us and say, Oh, we like you. Thank you, Mr. Congressman,  for funding this, funding that.   This is going to make sense in a moment.   The end of 2021, we functionally had zero percent interest when you  did the adjustment for--here is our inflation and here is UST bills,  when you do the WAM, the weighted average daily.   September 22. We are at 3.1. We are now calculating. And this is real  interest. So, yes, bonds and T-bills are up here, but when you adjust  for inflation, we believe the futures are going to continue to go up.   For the next few years, as far as we can see on the current futures  market, interest rates are 2, 3, 4 points higher than the Congressional  Budget Office's modeling.   What does that actually mean?   Let's just do the easiest one. If we are 2 points higher than what  the CBO had projected just a few months ago, in just a decade you are  well over 126 percent of debt-to-GDP. But it gets crazier.   Remember, what I am saying here is with inflation, with expectations,  and the speech I did last week where we showed you data after data  after data points.   First, the lie from earlier this year: Inflation is transitory. It  was never transitory. Anyone that said that didn't show up at their  economics class.   Look at the structural inputs we saw last week. Inflation now is  structural, meaning the Federal Reserve is going to either have to bust  the labor markets because this place is incapable of doing what is  necessary, which is incentivizing savings, and incentivizing, in a big- time way, productivity.   Because if you don't make more stuff--and I know it is supply side  and supply side is a rightwing, except it is economics. It works. If we  don't get more productive as a society--it is an economic term--what is  it--oh, yeah, we are screwed.   So do understand, under the current CBO protections, and this is from  months and months ago before they plugged in the inflation data we are  in right now, in 30 years, 50 percent of all tax receipts, we are just  paying interest.   Now, most of this is not Republican or Democrat, it is demographics.  We got old as a society, but this is our future. Now you put in the  crappy fiscal decisions and economic decisions this place has made over  the last 18 months, and you start to see what the future actually looks  like.   This is from the CBO numbers. This is CBO data from a year ago, that  if we had just a single percentage point higher mean on U.S. sovereign  debt interest rates, in 30 years, 70 percent of all tax receipts are  consumed by just paying back the interest. Not paying down the  principal, 70 percent just paying interest.   So what happens if where we are at right now becomes long term?  Because we are right now 2 points plus on that CBO model. If it were to  last 30 years--and I don't believe it will--but if it did--you have got  to understand this is from CBO last year--if we ran 2 percent higher on  U.S. sovereign--so T bills, the 10 years, the 30 years, you know, 2  percent higher, 100 percent of the tax receipts of this country go just  to pay our interest.    Doesn't this scare the crap out of anyone? Does anyone here own a  calculator with a battery in it?   Mr. Speaker, I have a 12-week little boy that just came to us. And,  yes, my wife and I, we are going to be old parents, but he is 12 weeks.  If this is our future where because we have borrowed so much money,  because we have set off inflation, because we have blown up  productivity--and I showed last week that productivity per work hour is  actually crashing. It is falling. The incentives to participate in the  labor markets are not working.   So we say, Well, we have this great unemployment number, except if  you look at the U6 data and those things, why are there so many  millions of young males missing from the workforce? The incentives we  should be engaging in to get older Americans to stay in the workforce,  what can we do to incentivize that, because if we don't, this is our  future. One hundred percent of all tax receipts being consumed just  paying back the interest; not paying down the debt, not paying for  government. It is just the United States have  [[Page H8360]]  basically become functionally an insurance company with an army.   At the rate we are going, we are not going to be able to pay our  insurance benefits: Social Security, Medicare, VA, Indian Health  Service. It just drives me to the edge just in anger; the trite, the  crazy.   We are going to talk about anything that we think will motivate our  voters or get them to get excited or maybe give us money, or this and  that, but to tell them the truth on how much trouble we are in.   I accept that maybe I am a heretic. Maybe the job of a Member of  Congress is not to come behind this microphone and tell the public the  truth. I accept these are big numbers; we are talking trillions.   Think of this: The shortfall in Social Security over the next 65  years--and I know it is a long time, but that is actually how you do  the Social Security. I am the ranking Republican on Social Security.  The shortfall in just Social Security over the next 65 years is $202  trillion.   In, functionally, a decade it is out of money; and at that point, you  take a 25 percent cut. We will double the number of our brothers and  sisters who are seniors who will be in poverty.   How much discussion do you see around here that anyone here cares  about people? But we do brilliant virtue signaling. We virtue signal  the hell out of this place, and then when it comes to anything  requiring a calculator--and all of your phones have a calculator on  it--we do, what?   Mr. Speaker, I am going to show this because hopefully this will make  sense. I am going to try to tie in that there are solutions. There are  actually things we could be doing.   With the amount of money the left has spent in the last 18 months, if  that money had been actually directed to things that actually would  have made a difference, hell, they might be heading toward the majority  again--they are not--but we also would save the country, and there  would be optimism. Instead, we do pandering. We spend our money on  basically buying the next generation of votes.   So, look, this is actually really a societal problem, and we need to  have an honest discussion about it. And this is terrifying, because  Members are terrified to come behind these microphones and say anything  where the Twitter army is going to attack you.   But the 2021 estimate, 37.3 million people, up from 26 million, will  have diabetes. I'm going to show you a slide in a moment that we may  have doubled in certain areas the number of our brothers and sisters  who are obese during the COVID shutdowns.   Why is this board important? Our estimates from a couple years ago  was that diabetes is 33 percent of all healthcare spending. It is 31  percent of all Medicare spending; diabetes and the associated.   Mr. Speaker, I represent the population with the second highest  diabetes in the United States. It is a Tribal community on the side of  Scottsdale. You want to meet the misery? Come visit. I will introduce  you to families who actually are doing okay financially, and grandma's  feet have been cut off. So the solution in this place is: Well, we will  build more diabetic clinics. We will find ways to help people maintain  their misery.   I know I am going to get crap for this: Body mass index approximately  doubled during the shutdowns.   We have been trying to dive into why the excess mortality numbers  from this last year, and we are trying to do it intellectually honest,  intellectually robust, saying: Here is our COVID deaths. Here is our  fentanyl deaths.   Mr. Speaker, come to Phoenix, Arizona, and see the number of people  now living in alleys. Talk to my local police about the number of  bodies they are picking up every week who are dying on fentanyl because  fentanyl has become so incredibly cheap. We are now the distribution  center because the border is wide open.   But, hey, these are loving, caring Democrats who don't give a damn  about the border.                                time  1400    But understand the misery.   But this just hit us saying: Oh, God, what happens in society if we  just doubled obesity in the country?   We know what this means, and we also know that diabetes in the  previous model was 33 percent of all healthcare spending. We know this  health index: lots of folks gaining weight during the time that we were  locked in because that was the brilliance of this government.   How many people have we made sicker and more miserable?   Maybe that is the reason those young people aren't in the workforce.  Maybe that is the reason productivity isn't working. It is a unified  theory: health, immigration, and technology; all these things come  together to make this country healthy.   The reality is we are in trouble. We are in just real trouble. The  debt is exploded, now the interest on that debt is exploded, and the  elements where we say: Well, we are going to cut--look, the Democrat  mantra is: Well, rich people don't pay enough taxes.   I have shown boards after boards after boards. You can take every  dime they have, and you functionally don't cover but a fraction of the  crushing debt that is coming.   Republicans have their sin. We will say: It is waste and fraud.   Well, it turns out that waste and fraud and foreign aid are just a  fraction. They need to be fixed. They are all things that probably  should be fixed. They are part of the formula.   Think of the cash the left spent on some of their legislation on  giving cash to the Big Pharma that make insulin instead of doing  something that would have been much more brilliant. Not too many miles  from D.C., here in Virginia, there is a co-op that is actually about to  make I think it is about eight types of generic insulin, and they are  going to make it less than the subsidized price.   Why wouldn't you pass legislation saying: We are going to bring that  online, and we are going to do the things to incentivize this type of  working together.   By the way, this is how you bring entries into the market because the  additional competition is what lowers price. But, instead, the brain  trust around here says: We hate Big Pharma. Hey, here is a bunch of  cash. Here is billions of dollars.   That was the Democrat solution. It was fascinating how many groups  actually wanted the cash much more than they wanted the competition  because this place is always about the money.   This is something I have been trying to pitch here. Maybe it won't  work. Maybe it is just too utopian for this place to get their heads  around. But I think we now have a half a dozen Americans who have been  cured of type 1 diabetes. I did a whole functionally 40 minutes here on  the floor a couple of months ago walking through the process of the  stem cell being tagged with CRISPR so the body doesn't see it as  foreign; so you can do it in a biofoundry, so you can make lots of  this; and then putting it into the body, the islet cells actually start  to attach, and it produces insulin.   Mr. Speaker, why wouldn't you put a fortune into bringing this and  seeing if it works?   The Operation Warp Speed, the Democrats can call it anything they  want, because this is moral. This is actually loving and kind.   Mr. Speaker, if you look at the previous slides, then you understand  we have a debt avalanche, and now the interest on that debt avalanche  is about to crush us.   We need our brothers and sisters to be healthy and able to  participate in the economy. There are some fascinating things we have  been working on showing that, hey, income inequality, why is this  population poor over here?   We would always get from our brothers and sisters on the left: Well,  it is racism. It is education.   It turns out it is a hell of a lot more complicated. It turns out if  we actually start to dig into the data, we actually start to see  health--health--and the fact that crime and people break your bones and  steal your stuff--but health was an incredibly large component of why  some of these urban populations--my Tribal populations--weren't  participating in the economy. It was diabetes, the commonality of  diabetes in these populations.   So why wouldn't this be everything?   We are going to take on the farm bill and make it so we can help our  brothers and sisters in type 2 get healthy. Yes, it will take time, it  will be controversial, and it will be difficult. But  [[Page H8361]]  if this is the modern plague, when you saw the numbers of the growth of  diabetes, why wouldn't we throw everything we have at it?   Because from a math standpoint, it is singularly the most important  thing you and I could do for U.S. sovereign debt. Think of that, Mr.  Speaker. It is crazy, but if 31 percent of all Medicare spending is  diabetes--and that number is about to grow substantially because of  what we have done the last couple years--and Medicare is 75 percent of  all the future debt, ta-da, the math doesn't take a brain surgeon.   So let's actually start to walk through more of the things that are  actuality optimistic and hopeful, and maybe when Republicans are the  majority here, we will actually have the competence to try to do hard  and complicated things to actually make people's lives better.   I just pulled this up as just a thought experiment except for the  fact that the product actually exists today. It is functionally a home  biopsy. You can get this and have it on your shelf at home. It actually  will be functioning a laboratory where you can put some saliva on it,  some other body fluids, and it calculates, it talks to the phone; it  talks to the algorithm; it gives you a diagnosis; and it would be in  your home. It would help crash parts of the healthcare.   Now, this technology is substantially illegal if you allow the  algorithm to write a script in this country. We also know that  healthcare costs are the things that are about to crush us. You would  think that this place would be contemplating: What can we do in the  technology disruption?    But, instead, the brain trust here somehow thinks: Well, the ACA,  ObamaCare.   No. Mr. Speaker, you have got to understand that was a financing  bill. The Republican alternative was one, and Medicare for All, they  are financing bills: Who gets to pay and who gets subsidized. In  Medicare for All everybody is subsidized. Those are financing bills.  They have nothing to do with what--with what--we pay.   This is one of the ways you disrupt the cost of healthcare.   But I believe this place is terrified because you just took, what,  hospitals are the largest lobbyists here in Washington, D.C. They  should love and embrace these types of technology disruption. We are  just afraid to have that conversation with them.   The other thing is actually one of my pieces of legislation. It is  just a simple idea.   What is inflation?   Let's first go back to our high school economics class. Inflation is  too many dollars chasing too few goods and services. Okay. We can make  more stuff.   Part of my argument is reform the Tax Code and reform the regulatory  codes--things we did in the 2017 tax reform with expensing where we had  that productivity spike--because investments and things that make the  society more productive means you can pay people more.   The other side is also too many dollars.   How do I get my brothers and sisters to say: Don't take that cash  that is sitting in your checking account and go buy another big screen  television?   What if this place would give an incentive and say: Take the cash and  go put it in your retirement account?   Believe it or not, it accomplishes much of the same thing. We have  gotten some nice write-ups on the piece of legislation Congressman  Donalds from Florida and I are doing that says: Let's provide an  incentive for people to take excess cash and instead of spending it in  the marketplace continuing the inflationary cycle, put it in retirement  security.   But, instead, Congress seems absolutely content on letting the  Federal Reserve blow up the economy. You already see what is happening  around the world. When the United States has inflation and we start to  raise our interest rates and money comes screaming in from the world  and the U.S. dollar spikes up and the other currencies in the world  collapse, and yet they need to buy fuel and food in U.S. dollars, then  understand the decisions Democrats here made 2 years ago--a little less  than 2 years ago--to push out almost $2 trillion in excess spending  that set the match on the inflation kindling, you just blew up much of  the world.   This time next year there will be countries around the world that  can't make their debt payments.   Mr. Speaker, do you think we will hear anyone on the left actually  come behind the microphone and say: We screwed up, we didn't show up at  our economics class, and we just blew up the world?   Because they did it in my community. I have 13 percent inflation in  the Phoenix-Scottsdale area.   Mr. Speaker, if you work and you haven't had a pay raise, then you  have lost a month and a half of your wages--a month and a half of your  wages.   That is the biggest modern tax hike.   I tried to explain this last week: Who are the winners and losers in  inflation?   Society and people who save money, that young couple who is trying to  save to get their family going, and that retired couple. They are  crushed.   Who is the biggest debtor in the world?   This place. We have $31 trillion of borrowed money.   And guess what, Mr. Speaker?   We now get to pay back that $31 trillion--or at least the interest on  it--with deflated dollars, with cheaper dollars because we lowered your  economics, and we made it cheaper for us to do.   That is one of the reasons why there is this sort of whisper here in  Washington, particularly the Treasury-type folks, who say that  inflation is horrible. But at least in the short term, Democrats are  almost giddy that, hey, by the end of the year, the debt-to-GDP ratio  in real dollars will actually close.   It is not because they did anything to grow the economy. It is  because the dollar value has crashed because of inflation. The value of  the debt, because you are paying it back with deflated dollars, that  debt to GDP in real dollar terms will close.   Now, the punch line is a year or so from now when we have had to sell  the new bonds at the higher interest rates and the higher interest  rates and the higher interest rates, then it moves against us. That is  like those slides I told you where we had long-term interest rates, 2  percent over CBO model, it is 100 percent. One hundred percent of all  tax receipts go to pay just interest. This is where we are heading.    Shouldn't this be the number one conversation in this place, the  survival of the country and the survival of my new little boy?   But it doesn't give a damn because it is math and our voters--let's  face it--our voters want the shiny object because it is our fault  because we are terrified to have a conversation with our voters saying:  If we don't do these things, then we can't save Medicare and we can't  save Social Security.   That becomes the attack ad. We do it to each other. I believe  Democrats are much more duplicitous in it. But math is scary, and it  doesn't need to be. There is hope.   Mr. Speaker, I just bring this one up because this was in a recent  article talking about some of the productivity effects, the GDP growth  effects when we got the parts of the Tax Code right. We didn't get  everything we should have.   But, Mr. Speaker, I need you, if you want a real living example, to  look at the fourth quarter of 2017. Because remember, the fourth  quarter of 2017 got the benefit of expensing even though the tax reform  didn't finish until the end of 2017. But we did that retrospective.   Then look at 2018. Look at 2019. The shrinkage of income inequality.  The poor got much less poor. The working middle class had a couple of  their most prosperous years in modern history. African-American females  had this amazing growth in wages and job opportunities.   But it is a demonstration. I know it is heresy for the left to  compliment tax reform. It wasn't tax cuts, it was tax reform, because  the actual receipts, the revenues that came in, the number of times our  friends on that side said: You are going to put us into depression.   I am waiting for my apology because we actually took in more money.  Corporate receipts went up. Thank God we had actually that robust of an  economy and that robust of a tax system when the pandemic hit.   Could you imagine if we didn't, Mr. Speaker, how miserable we would  have been?  [[Page H8362]]                                     time  1415    The last thing, this is not meant to be a non sequitur. It is meant  to be a closing on the discussion of the misery.   I am a border State. I know most of the Democrat votes aren't  anywhere near the border States, so you don't give a damn about us, but  I am dead serious.   I am blessed. I have just an amazingly wonderful congressional  district. It is where I grew up. It is my home. It is my obligation to  try to defend them.   Even neighborhoods that don't vote for me, come drive with me, and  come see the misery that is living in the alleys behind these houses.   Fentanyl has crashed in price in the Phoenix area. I have a Phoenix  police sergeant who is my neighbor. He was telling me, a year or 2 ago,  $120 to get high for the day. Today, it is like $12. Now, we are  finding a new form of synthetic opioid crossing our border. It is 10  times more potent than fentanyl.   Maybe you don't give a damn about people in the Southwest or the  misery of the little 14-year-old girl who just died down the way from  me, taking one pill. But when this stuff gets left on a countertop  somewhere at your favorite wine bar, and everyone in the room is dead,  will the left take seriously the misery that their open border policies  have brought to us?   Look, my pitch is really simple. The economics are all screwed up.  The Democrats set off inflation. That piled on the debt, piled on our  demographics, piled on our healthcare. We are in real trouble as a  nation.   If we would embrace the disruptions of technology and the incentives  for productivity, we can at least bend the curve. We are not going to  pay down the debt, but we can bend it so that debt-to-GDP is  survivable, but you have to get other policies right.   This place is having no conversations that are actually serious,  honest, and important, and I don't know how this became Republican  versus Democrat. We are now just talking about the survival of our  Republic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
