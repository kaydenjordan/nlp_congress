 Mr. President. The United States Agency for International  Development's (USAID) New Partnerships Initiative (NPI) was formed to  help small and local nonprofit organizations partner with the agency on  humanitarian work, and was inspired in part by requests from Congress  for USAID to cooperate more closely with these organizations. The  program was founded on the principle that greater diversity and  competition among the USAID partner base would lead to better and more  effective development  [[Page S5144]]  work. Since its creation, NPI has helped USAID expand its collaboration  with local nonprofits to undertake critical work overseas, but this  vital program needs a clearly defined foundation in statute and long- term authorization of funding to sustain its progress well beyond 2021.   Today, I am pleased to introduce the New Partnerships Initiative  Authorization Act with Senator Rubio. This legislation would cement  USAID's commitment to diversifying its nonprofit partner base by  authorizing the program and necessary funding through Fiscal Year 2026.  Additionally, the New Partnerships Initiative Authorization Act would  improve outcomes at the NPI program by outlining in statute core  elements of the program, and requiring the USAID Administrator to  adhere to certain criteria regarding program management and nonprofit  recruitment.   This bipartisan legislation is an opportunity to ensure that the New  Partnerships Initiative continues to be an effective tool for  diversifying USAID's partner base through the inclusion of locally  based and underutilized partners. I look forward to working with USAID  leadership and my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee to  swiftly consider and implement the New Partnerships Initiative  Authorization Act.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Ms. CORTEZ MASTO (for herself and Mr. Boozman):   S. 2513. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  application and review process of the Department of Veterans Affairs  for clothing allowance claims submitted by veterans, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
