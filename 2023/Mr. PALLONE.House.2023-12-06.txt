 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4468. Instead of  working with us on legislation to lower costs for consumers, protect  public health, drive innovation, and grow the economy, the Republican  majority is once again bringing an anti-clean vehicle bill to the floor  as part of their polluters over people agenda.   H.R. 4468 would block the Environmental Protection Agency from  finalizing its proposed light- and medium-duty vehicle rule. It would  also block the Agency from finalizing any future standard to cut  greenhouse gas pollution from vehicles. This bill would simply prevent  the EPA from doing its job.   House Republicans are trying to legislate away years of innovation in  cleaner transportation to put polluters over people.   The Clean Air Act is clear, Mr. Speaker. EPA has the authority and  obligation to protect American communities from air pollution that  would cause harm to public health and welfare. That includes pollution  from the transportation sector, the single-largest contributor of  greenhouse gas emissions and other dangerous air pollution in the  United States.   This pollution affects more than 100 million Americans who live in  counties with unhealthy air, and air pollution is associated with over  100,000 premature deaths each year.    The EPA's proposed emissions standards for manufacturers of cars and  light-duty trucks is intended to tackle this pollution head-on. The  result: The new rule is projected to deliver $1 trillion in net public  health benefits.   Cleaner cars are also a win for consumers who can expect to save an  average of $12,000 in fuel and maintenance costs over the lifetime of a  light-duty vehicle once EPA standards are in effect.   I will stress that EPA's proposal is achievable. It will save  consumers money and bolster jobs and our economy by promoting American  manufacturing. It will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.   With this bill, House Republicans are denying the American people all  of these benefits.   The bill is also a direct assault on our domestic auto industry.  Decades of innovation spurred by ambitious EPA standards have led to a  growing fleet of cleaner, more affordable cars for all Americans.   I have to stress, Mr. Speaker, that the bill's reference to choice is  a misnomer. EPA's proposed standards are key to expanding vehicle  choice for American drivers. More than 100 electric vehicle models are  now available in U.S. markets alongside many hybrid and gas-powered  options, giving Americans unprecedented flexibility in where and how  they choose to fuel. This incredible innovation is the main reason why  the United States is a global leader in the transportation sector.                                time  1230    H.R. 4468 would stifle this innovation and cause detrimental  uncertainty for American automakers. The bill includes vague language  that will prevent the EPA from ever finalizing vehicle standards for  any type of motor vehicle. The bill would lock auto manufacturers in  today's technology in perpetuity, chilling potential advancements in  new hybrids, flex fuel, fuel cell, and even internal combustion  engines.   None of this makes any sense, Mr. Speaker. This extreme bill would  hurt our ability to harness new technologies, which would only weaken  our ability to compete with China.   With this legislation, Republicans are telling the American industry  to stand down to China in a global challenge. That is just wrong.  Rather than ceding that role to China, House Democrats delivered real  solutions with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation  Reduction Act. These laws are investing in America's ability to beat  our economic competitors, including China, ensuring the United States  is the global leader on clean transportation.   H.R. 4468 would seriously hamper the EPA's ability to address the  worsening  [[Page H6159]]  climate crisis and air pollution for vehicles. It would also limit  consumer choice, stifle innovation, create uncertainty for American  automakers, hurt American global leadership, weaken our ability to  compete with China, and deny Americans the immense public health and  environmental benefits of EPA's proposed standards.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Tonko), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the  Environment, Manufacturing, and Critical Materials.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the ranking member of our Commerce and  Consumer Protection Subcommittee.

Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor), the ranking member of our Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz), who is a member of our committee.  [[Page H6162]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), who is a member of our committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. McClellan).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   The amazing thing to me is that today during the debate, I heard very  few statements on the part of the Republicans about clean air.   This is all about the Clean Air Act and the fact that the EPA is  trying to set standards that will eliminate pollution and make it  easier for people to breathe and not be negatively impacted by  pollution that is in the air. What the Republicans want to do is gut  the Clean Air Act so those standards cannot be put in place.   Now, they also mentioned China constantly, over and over again. The  fact of the matter is that with this bill, they would be putting China  in charge. China is the country--Beijing--that imposes the mandates.  What the EPA does is basically say in order to achieve cleaner air, we  are saying to the car manufacturers, they have to do certain things,  but they still have the choice of what kind of vehicles to produce,  whether it be a hybrid, an electric, or a gasoline-combustion vehicle.   All those vehicles are still going to be available, are still going  to be manufactured. It is just that they are going to have fewer or no  emissions, and the air will be cleaner for Americans to breathe.   Now, the ultimate thing is when the Republicans talk about the  workers and the jobs. The fact of the matter is, the United Auto  Workers--which represents most of the car makers, or all of them as far  as I know--are opposed to this bill. The reason for their opposition is  because they want to continue to manufacture cars.   They don't want China to continue to innovate and essentially start  to corner the world market on electric vehicles or even other vehicles.  If that happens, the number of jobs here in the United States will be  diminished. They are saying we oppose this bill because we want to  create more cars and create more jobs, and we want the United States to  continue to be the leader.   For all these reasons--for cleaner air, to keep American leadership  above any competition with China, to make sure there continue to be  choices with the cars that you buy through your manufacturers--I urge  my colleagues to strongly oppose this bill, which I think is going to  take away the American leadership in car manufacturing and innovation  and so many other things.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would revise the look-back  portion of the bill that requires EPA to revise all previous  regulations to conform with the bill's vague metrics on limiting  availability of vehicles.   This amendment would shorten this period to only apply to rules  finalized under the Biden administration, so please understand what  they are doing here is saying that the only thing we are going to  revoke, essentially, are the rules that were finalized under President  Biden. I mean, nothing could be clearer that this amendment is based on  politics and not policy by limiting the revocation to the Biden  administration.   This amendment does not improve the legislation in any way. It fails  to address the fundamental problems with the underlying bill. The  amendment is essentially trying to go back in time to the failed  policies of the Trump EPA. We would literally be moving backwards in  our efforts to address the climate crisis and decarbonize the  transportation sector and trying to eliminate pollution that affects  Americans.   The amendment doesn't address any of the concerns that my Republican  colleagues claim to have about electric vehicles. This amendment simply  doubles down on Republicans' attacks on EPA's authority, public health,  and regulatory certainty.   It does absolutely nothing to support our domestic vehicle  manufacturing industry, like boost American competitiveness, counter  China, or strengthen our economy.   This is just blatantly political, and I urge my colleagues to oppose  the amendment as well as the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
