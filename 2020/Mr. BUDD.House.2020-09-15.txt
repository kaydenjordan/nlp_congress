 Mr. Speaker, during the pandemic, much of our lives has  been forced online. Our children are learning remotely. Our businesses  are conducted through webcams. Even Sunday church services are now  live-streamed on Facebook.   For the estimated 500,000 North Carolinians who lack dependable  internet access, these temporary changes have been debilitating.   Making sure rural families have quality internet access is a top  priority for me, Mr. Speaker. That is why I sponsored the RURAL Act,  which is now the law of the land. It helps ensure that rural telephone  and electric co-ops have more dollars for broadband investment.   No one in our district should have their level of internet access  determined by their ZIP Code, and I am going to keep fighting for  broadband access across all of our rural communities.                            ____________________
