 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two  units from the 87th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion for their  participation in Operation Atlantic Resolve in Poland, Romania, and  Lithuania; and I want to welcome them back home to the First  Congressional District of Georgia.   Stationed at Fort Stewart, these battalions are integral to our  Nation's ability to be successful overseas. Throughout different  periods of its history, 87th Combat Sustainment Support Battalions have  provided maintenance, convoy security, supply transportation, and more  for branches of the U.S. Army fighting to restore democracy abroad.   As a part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, these battalions worked hard  to increase their readiness and build cooperation between our own  forces and our allies in Europe. At any one time there are 6,000  American soldiers participating in Operation Atlantic Resolve  conducting exercises across 17 countries.   To Lieutenant Colonel David Alvarez, Command Sergeant Major Ryan  Stamos, and everyone involved with the 87th Combat Sustainment Support  Battalions, I thank you for your service, and welcome home.                            ____________________
