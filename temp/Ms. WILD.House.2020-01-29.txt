 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize an extraordinary  constituent, a man who, in my community, is known only as Rooster. He  really needs no other name, but his given name is Russell Valentini.   Rooster has worked in the Allentown School District for a very long  time. His title with the Allentown School District is Home and School  Visitor, but it fails to capture the world of difference he has made in  the lives of homeless children and families.   For 35 years, Rooster has served as the lifeline for the 600 to 800  students experiencing homelessness in the Allentown School District at  any given time. The poems he has written over the years about the  children he has encountered reflect the ways that the children have  touched his life and in which he has touched theirs.   Even now, Rooster still grows emotional when telling the story of the  father who doesn't know if he will be able to get his paycheck in time  to make the rent, the family who has lost their home, the child with no  bed to sleep in at night.   Rooster, for these many years, has provided school supplies,  uniforms, and hygiene items, as well as food, to help these students  and their families.   Everywhere in my community there are people whose lives are  immeasurably better today because of Rooster.   Rooster prepares to retire at the end of this school year, and I want  to congratulate him. We will miss him. We should all draw inspiration  from the powerful example he has set.                            ____________________
