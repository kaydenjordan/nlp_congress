 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concerns over  the handling of the Violence Against Women Act, known as VAWA, by the  Democratic leadership.   A few weeks ago, Democratic leadership intentionally let the Violence  Against Women Act expire when negotiating the reopening of the Federal  Government during the shutdown rather than simply reauthorizing VAWA.  That is because, instead, as we see now, they want to tack on  additional partisan provisions, like gun control and many other ideas  that have little to do with violence against women and this act.   We need to extend this program. We need to do a clean version of it  that would be noncontroversial and that is respectful to women and  respectful to girls who are to be protected by this, which we could  have done in the previous spending bill.   They want to use it, instead, to infringe upon our Second Amendment  rights and do other things in a social agenda. That is not what that  bill is or should be about. Piggybacking inappropriate and nongermane  issues onto this bill is harmful to the women and girls we are trying  to protect.    This legislation will make it more difficult for women to protect  themselves with a firearm, for example. How does that make sense to  anybody? We need a clean version of this bill.                            ____________________
