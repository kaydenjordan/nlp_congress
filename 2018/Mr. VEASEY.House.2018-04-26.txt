 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Pastor B.R.  Daniels, Jr.'s 25th pastoral anniversary at the First Greater New Hope  Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas.   A native of Fort Worth, Pastor Daniels attended Oscar Dean Wyatt High  School. After graduating high school, he answered the call of duty and  enlisted in the United States Army, where he faithfully served his  country for 8 years. Pastor Daniels was honorably discharged in 1992 at  the rank of Sergeant E-5.   In early 1993, when the First Greater New Hope Baptist Church was in  search of a new pastor, Reverend Daniels was called to occupy the  pulpit. The congregation knew right away that they had the right man  for the job.   After 25 years, Pastor Daniels has certainly left his mark not only  on the church, but he works closely with so many different groups in  the city of Fort Worth and is on different commissions. He does a great  job. His passion  [[Page H3691]]  and love for the ministry explain why so many follow his vision of  hope.                            ____________________
