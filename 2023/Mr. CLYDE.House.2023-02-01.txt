 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on January 13 of this year, the ATF finalized its  unconstitutional rule pertaining to firearms with stabilizing braces.  Under this new ATF rule, any pistol-braced firearm would be considered  an illegal short-barreled rifle, subjecting these firearms to draconian  regulations under the NFA, the National Firearms Act of 1934, and  turning millions of law-abiding gun owners into criminals literally  overnight.   Unelected antigun bureaucrats informed law-abiding gun owners  possessing pistols with these braces attached that they will have only  120 days to register them once the rule is published in the Federal  Register. This 120-day amnesty window started yesterday, January 31.   As we have seen across the world time and time again, what comes  before gun confiscation? Gun registration. That is right. That is  exactly what ATF is now demanding.  [[Page H621]]    For stabilizer brace owners who do not wish to register their  firearms, the ATF provides four alternatives.   The first: Turn in the entire firearm with the attached stabilizing  brace to the ATF. That means forfeiting your firearm.   The second: Destroy the whole firearm. Again, another forfeiture of  your firearm.   The third: Convert the pistol brace into a long-barreled rifle that  does not require registration but is also much more difficult to use  with a brace.   The fourth: Permanently remove and dispose of, or alter the  stabilizing brace, from the firearm so that it cannot be reattached.   If gun owners who possess braced firearms refuse to register,  destroy, turn in, or alter their firearm after this 120-day window,  they face National Firearms Act violations, felony violations,  including hefty fines of up to $250,000 and up to 10 years in prison  for having an unregistered short-barreled rifle.   In other words, the ATF's rule turns law-abiding gun owners into  criminals, into felons, for simply doing nothing.   That is right. If they do nothing, then after 120 days, they are in  felony violation of ATF's reinterpreted law, all for simply maintaining  their Second Amendment freedoms.   What exactly are these alleged hazardous stabilizing braces? A pistol  brace, also known as a stabilizing brace, is simply an accessory that  is attached to the rear of a large firearm in order to anchor the gun  to the shooter's arm to better stabilize it, allowing them to be more  accurately shot one-handed, just like what you see right here. This is  a stabilizing brace.   These braces were actually designed to help disabled veterans enjoy  the sport of shooting. In fact, as a Federal firearms licensee, my  company has sold many of these pistol brace firearms to assist disabled  veterans so they can improve their shooting capabilities and their  accuracy.   Unfortunately, these beneficial braces have faced uninformed and  unwarranted backlash from unelected bureaucrats for years.   In 2012, the ATF provided a letter determining that pistol braces  were legal to use and to shoulder. This decision was then reversed 3  years later by the ATF. In 2015, stabilizing braces became illegal to  shoulder, turning braced firearms into unregistered short-barreled  rifles. The braces remained legal if held at arm's length but illegal  if brought back to the shoulder. How does that make any sense?   This flip-flopped again in 2017 when stabilizing braces were once  more determined to be legal to shoulder by the ATF, as long as the  original design of the brace remained unmodified.   Here we are in 2023 as braced pistols are vilified yet again,  declared by the ATF to be unregistered short-barreled rifles requiring  registration and their owners classified as felons if they simply do  nothing.   Clearly, as in most cases of unconstitutional gun control, unelected  bureaucrats who have little to no knowledge of firearms or respect for  Second Amendment rights are steamrolling ahead with unlawful  restrictions, which will impact, estimates say, anywhere from 3 million  to up to 40 million firearms across the country.   Why? To advance the less dangerous dream of disarming our Nation and  dismantling our Second Amendment rights. That is what gun control is  all about.   The ultimate goal is an unarmed and subjugated America. I can assure  gun owners across this great Nation that I and Second Amendment-loving  Republican colleagues will do everything in our power to never allow  that to happen.   We are fighting this, and we are not going to give up. Congress  cannot allow the ATF to brazenly disregard both our Constitution and  Congress' role, its sole role in legislation, its legislative  authority.   I don't know if ATF Director Dettelbach needs a copy of the  Constitution to revisit the explicit language of the Second Amendment  or the direct powers granted to the three branches of government, but  the last time I checked, only Congress has the authority to make laws.   Let me say that again. Congress makes laws, not unelected antigun  bureaucrats at the ATF or any other part of the executive branch, for  that matter.   Yet, given the ATF's severely misguided decision to advance its  unconstitutional pistol brace rule, I am actively leading the fight to  stop this grave injustice.   We have three key tools available to us in Congress to fight the  ATF's tyranny.   The first is H.R. 646, the Stop Harassing Owners of Rifles Today Act,  or the SHORT Act, which I reintroduced yesterday with Senators Roger  Marshall and John Kennedy. This legislation repeals elements of the  National Firearms Act, thereby prohibiting the ATF from registering and  banning pistols with stabilizing braces.   The second element is a joint resolution of disapproval under the  Congressional Review Act, which we will introduce in a matter of days  to block the ATF's rule from infringing on Americans' Second Amendment  rights. Congressman Richard Hudson, our NRCC chair, has joined me in  co-leading this in the House, while Senators John Kennedy and Roger  Marshall will introduce the resolution in the Senate.   The third way that we can fight this here in Congress is through the  power of the purse. As we write the ATF's appropriations for fiscal  year 2024, we can prevent taxpayer dollars from funding this backdoor  gun control through what is called a limitation amendment. As a new  member on the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, I look forward to  assisting in this effort.   With these three initiatives, we can work together to stop the ATF's  unconstitutional overreach.   It would be better if the ATF simply decided to rescind the pistol  brace rule so we would not have to take these permanent measures, but  we are fully prepared to do so if they will not rescind it.   I am proud to have several of my colleagues here tonight to expose  the ATF's unconstitutional rule, as well as to highlight how Congress  can stop this latest form of gun control from infringing on law-abiding  gun owners' Second Amendment freedoms.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).    I thank my good friend from New Jersey, from one of those  blue States where you don't necessarily think that there are passionate  gun owners. I appreciate them.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado  (Mrs. Boebert), who is also the co-chair of our Second Amendment Caucus  here in Congress and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Colorado for her  unwavering defense of the Second Amendment of our Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Crenshaw).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for those  inspiring words.   I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), my good friend.    I thank my good friend from Kentucky because he is  absolutely right. We have the power of the purse.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for those  great words. He is absolutely correct. When the government fears the  people, there is liberty.   I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida for that  is, indeed, a great statement: A shot across the bow; a great example  of what the United States Navy would do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett),  my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the great  State of Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my great colleague from the State of  Florida for those encouraging remarks. I thank all of my colleagues who  participated here in this Special Order tonight. It is incredibly  important that we show Americans that we are united and unwavering in  protecting and preserving our Second Amendment freedoms.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
