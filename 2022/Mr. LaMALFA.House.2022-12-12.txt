 In Northern California, thousands of residents have  reported having their credit card information stolen by these sneaky  credit card skimmers. One skimmer alone at a Walmart in Redding,  California, captured the information of over 4,000 cards.   In the first 6 months of 2022, credit card skimming fraud grew by 700  percent in this country. This scheme can deplete bank accounts before  unsuspecting consumers even realized that their card information has  been stolen.   Skimming costs financial institutions and consumers at least $1  billion a year, a figure that will only increase. As rates of skimming  increase, as well as the U.S. moving more and more to digital-type  transactions, the opportunity for fraud will grow exponentially.   We must crack down on all types of this crime and create a society  that doesn't tolerate or defend these individuals who engage in these  behaviors.   We must continue to equip law enforcement with the tools needed to  investigate and prosecute these types of financial crimes.                            ____________________
