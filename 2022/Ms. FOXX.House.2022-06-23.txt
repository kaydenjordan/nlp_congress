 Mr. Speaker, today is the 50th anniversary of the passage  of Title IX, legislation that revolutionized women's sports and women's  access to education.   Since the Education Amendments of 1972 passed, women's participation  in sports has skyrocketed. Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, only 1 out of  every 27 women participated in college-level sports. Today, that number  is one in five.   Title IX granted women equal access to educational opportunities,  including college admissions and teaching positions at postsecondary  institutions. Because of this, more women are going to college today  than ever before.   While this monumental legislation has strengthened our country and  our workforce beyond belief, it is under threat today. Expanding this  legislation to include other designations like sexual orientation and  gender identity goes beyond the intent of Congress.   It also dilutes protections for women, and in some cases, threatens  their safety.   We already knew Democrats were willing to weaponize Title IX when  they used it to deny due process to students accused of sexual assault  on college campuses.   The rights of due process should not end simply because someone is a  student, but, thankfully, the Trump administration set things right on  this front.   Now, new threats are emerging. While the advancements made under  Title IX have been numerous, the Biden administration is attempting to  use this legislation to further a progressive social agenda.   For example, the Biden administration is threatening to hold school  lunches hostage if K-12 schools do not agree to a slew of controversial  gender-neutral policies.   One of these policies will likely be forcing schools to allow  biological males to compete in girls' sports, something already  happening at many schools across the country.   The results are in: It erases women. Let me say that again: It erases  women.   Ignoring the biological differences between the male and female body  is a catastrophe for women, especially in sports. It destroys a level  playing field and makes women second-class citizens in their own  sports.   Even the international stage has begun to take notice as the  International Swimming Federation voted to restrict many transgender  women from competing in international swimming competitions. We have  already seen women's records in swimming and track obliterated by  biological males.   Athletes give their all to be the best they can be. It is cruel to  take the chance of success away from women, especially when it could  mean losing out on a college scholarship or other important  opportunities.   Perhaps even more concerning is the threat these policies pose to  women's safety. It is completely irresponsible to take away a woman's  right to privacy and security by mandating gender-neutral spaces.   Allowing biological males, even if they identify as a woman, into  women's locker rooms, bathrooms, jails, and domestic violence shelters  poses a threat to the safety of women.   I shouldn't have to spell this out for you. It is common sense. Today  should be a day of celebration, one where we marvel at the gains women  have made in sports and in education, but the Biden administration's  actions have certainly put a damper on this momentous anniversary.   It is time for Democrats to regain their senses, and, once again,  commit to protecting--protecting--the integrity of women's sports and  the safety of women. This political agenda is destructive and  unbecoming of a country dedicated to equal opportunity for all.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, we always hear Democrats preach about choice  when it comes to the issue of abortion. However, we never hear them  discuss the other side of the coin, choosing life instead of death.   We do not hear them condemn criminal acts, such as the defacing of  [[Page H5835]]  churches or crisis pregnancy centers being firebombed and vandalized by  radical progressive activists.   If they believe choice is so important, why don't they respect the  people who refuse to choose death and instead choose life?   Democrats use ``choice'' as a subjective term. They agree with choice  as long as you agree with them--choice on their terms.   Madam Speaker, Americans overwhelmingly choose life. We would all do  well to remember that.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time.   Madam Speaker, evidence is clear that students are able to focus more  at  [[Page H5839]]  school if they are receiving adequate nutrition. Too many students are  still suffering from the harmful effects of school closures, and we  cannot afford to let students fall further behind.   The rise in food prices is putting most Americans in a tight spot.  The same is true for schools. The bipartisan Keep Kids Fed Act will  empower schools to meet the crises our country is facing, from supply  chain problems to record-high inflation.   It is, however, extremely important to emphasize that the support  provided in this legislation is both targeted and temporary, as all aid  should be. We also worked hard to ensure that this legislation was  budget-neutral so it does not put additional burden on taxpayers.  Importantly, this legislation will return our Nation's school meal  programs to regular order. This is the primary reason I support this  legislation.   For over 2 years, Democrats used a permanent pandemic narrative to  increase Federal spending across the board, including within school  meal programs. This has fueled inflation. This is not only  irresponsible but ignores the narrow limits Congress purposefully  placed on these programs.   Congress never intended to provide universal free breakfasts and  lunches to all K-12 students regardless of need. By returning these  programs back to normal, we can uphold our responsibility to taxpayers  and the principle that aid should be targeted and temporary.   The Keep Kids Fed Act offers a viable solution to the problems facing  school meal programs while also refocusing these programs on their  purpose: helping students in need.
