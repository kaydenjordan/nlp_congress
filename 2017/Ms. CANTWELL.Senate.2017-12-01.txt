 Mr. President, I come to the floor with my colleague  from Maryland to talk about the State and local tax deduction.   I thank the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee for his  hard work on trying to articulate what is fair tax policy for  Americans. Senator Wyden and I come from parts of the country with  probably some of the most unique tax codes. He doesn't have a sales tax  in Oregon. We don't have an income tax in Washington.   We are not an expensive tax State. We are not an expensive tax State.  There are other States such as Texas, Nevada, and Florida that also  don't have an income tax. Under this bill, those States and the  citizens of those States, like many others, are going to be penalized.  Middle-class Americans are going to have their taxes raised to give a  tax break to corporations.   So while we might want to discuss what is fair tax policy as it  relates to the competitiveness of our economy, the good news for the  people of the State of Washington is that we have very competitive  businesses, whether it is Microsoft or Amazon or Starbucks or Costco or  Boeing. They are all working hard. They are all working in multiple  places, and yes, they are all doing really, really well.   The question is, Do we need to reduce their corporate rate so  significantly, and to do so, take money out of the pockets of middle- class families across the United States of America?   The reason I mention Senator Wyden and the States of Oregon and  Washington, is that, even though we have a unique tax code, our State's  economy has grown faster than the national average every year since  World War II. That is to say, the uniqueness of our tax code has not  hurt us, and yet in the State of Washington we have had the highest  minimum wage for a long time in the United States. Now we are raising  it in various parts of our State. We have had a unique view of where  our revenue should come from.   Why now? Why now? After 100 years of tax deductibility by taxpayers  in this country, why are you taking away their ability to deduct only  to give a tax break to corporations that are making record profits?  After 100 years, why are you doing this?   Well, I think some of my colleagues have said it best. They have  called it double-taxation. You are going ahead after 100 years and  saying it is OK to tax the same amount that we pay to the State that  you also are going to tax at the Federal level. As one article  mentioned, ``Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers said the  Federal Government might try to monopolize taxation to the entire  exclusion and destruction of State governments.''   That is right. Our Founding Fathers said: Do not have double  taxation. So for 100 years--100 years--we protected the citizens of  this country. Yet someone over there is thinking: Do you know what? I  need $1.4 trillion. Where can I get it? Let's do it on the backs of  middle-class families, because they might not notice until 2019 when  their tax bill comes and they have a different equation.   I get that my colleagues think they have solved this problem by  getting rid of the deductions and now all of a sudden giving you a  double standard deduction. I have done the math. I have done the math  for us in Washington State, and over 300,000 people in Washington will  see their taxes go up immediately, probably paying anywhere from $750  to $1,000 more in taxes. Is that fair? They are sitting in the shadow  of these large companies who are making record profits and doing quite  well, asking why are they the funders of this tax break. Why are they?  Why are we getting rid of a policy that has existed in our country for  over 100 years and penalizing them just to give this corporate break?    I can tell you I don't buy the notion that this is going to trickle  down to productivity and wage growth. I know what is driving  productivity and wage growth in my State. It is a great, educated,  skilled workforce. It is staying ahead of innovation whether it is  making software or new ways of doing business, and, yes, it is a  constant challenge. Those businesses tell me all the time we need more  infrastructure, we need more affordable housing, we need a better  transportation system, we need better education. So they are very  concerned about the ideas in this legislation.   So you are going to tax immediately about 300,000 Washingtonians with  a higher tax rate and, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation and  other entities, probably by the time this is done, at the end of this  bill, over a million Washingtonians are going to pay more money. That  is why I am so concerned, along with other States that have been  fighting this battle for so long. Why now? Why now? What is the urgency  that you are taking away the ability of my citizens to deduct their  local sales tax, their property tax, and, in the House case, other  expenses, whether they are medical or education or their mortgage? It  is just beyond me, when the middle class has suffered so much and has  not recovered from the downturn in the economy, that you think the best  economic strategy is to take money out of the middle-class taxpayer.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from  the National Governors Association from Governor Sandoval from Nevada.  I mentioned they don't have an income tax. They are highly sensitive to  this issue.  [[Page S7662]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 National Governors Association,                                                 September 22, 2017.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways & Means, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer,       Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi, Chairman Hatch, Ranking       Member Wyden, Chairman Brady, and Ranking Member Neal: The       nation's governors appreciate congressional efforts to reform       and improve federal tax policy. Federal and state tax systems       are complex and often interconnected. Therefore, as Congress       considers reforms, we urge you to maintain the balance       between state and federal tax systems by preserving the       income exclusion for municipal bond interest and the       deductibility for state and local taxes.        The financing engine that drives U.S. infrastructure is the       $3.8 trillion municipal bond market. Changes to federal laws       and regulations should not increase issuance costs to states       for municipal bonds or diminish investor demand for them. If       federal changes make issuing municipal bonds cost-prohibitive       for states and local governments, then fewer projects could       be funded, taxes could rise, fewer jobs created, and economic       growth will suffer.        Governors also believe that no federal law or regulation       should preempt, limit, or interfere with the sovereign rights       of states. A mark of sovereignty includes the ability to       develop and operate revenue and tax systems. Deductibility of       state and local taxes has contributed to the stability of       state revenues that are essential for providing public       services. We encourage you to avoid changes to the tax code       that would undermine the ability of state and local       governments to meet the needs of the citizens whom we all       serve.        Eliminating state and local tax deductibility, moreover,       exposes a higher share of an itemizing taxpayer's income to       federal taxation because it adds back mandatory payments of       state and local taxes already paid, as taxable income.        Federal tax reform requires an intergovernmental       partnership because decisions at the federal level will       affect state and local governments profoundly. We look       forward to working with Congress on bipartisan tax reform to       maintain balance between our systems and modernize the       federal tax system to meet the needs of our citizens.            Sincerely,      Gov. Brian Sandoval,        NGA Chair.      Gov. Steve Bullock,        NGA Vice Chair.     Mr. President, their letter says that the deductibility  of State and local taxes has been a part of their stability, and they  are about meeting the needs of their citizens.   So the notion that we have the National Governors Association, the  homebuilders, the Realtors, so many people concerned about this is  falling on deaf ears. I guarantee you it will not fall on deaf ears  when the citizens have a chance to respond to this.   The notion that we not only are taking away this ability to deduct,  but we are also in this legislation making a change to the way  inflation is calculated, what is called Chained CPI--I am not going to  bother to explain the details to you, but I will tell you this. It will  change your tax bracket, and you will be in a higher tax bracket. So  besides giving you less deductibility, they are changing a formula and  making you pay more taxes.   This bill needs to slow down. It needs to focus on what will help our  economy grow, and economists don't believe this bill is going to do  much to help the economy grow. It is going to give those corporations  money to pay for dividends. Seventy-five to eighty percent will go to  their shareholders, and those shareholders and the stock market will do  well.   What we also need to focus on is the investment that middle-class  families need to stay in their home, to make education affordable, to  pay for healthcare, and to have communities work. The fact is, the  Fraternal Order of Police is also against this legislation because of  taking away of this local deductibility. It is like Hamilton said: Why  are you doing this at a Federal level? I thought the other side of the  aisle was the States' rights people? I thought they were there to  protect the uniqueness of the Tax Code to say that States have rights,  to say that States ought to be able to decide their own future. Well,  after 100 years, you are taking that away today, and you are going to  hear from the citizens of this country who are upset that they have to  pay higher taxes just to give these very successful companies a  corporate tax break.   I yield to my colleague from Maryland.    Mr. President, my amendment strikes the title requiring  oil development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This refuge is  the largest refuge in our Nation and the last pristine ecosystem for  the Arctic in North America.   Requiring oil development in the heart of the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge should not be in this bill.   Although the bill text has been changed to address Byrd Rule  violations, the Congressional Budget Office continues to estimate that  it will raise less than $1 billion over 10 years.   Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling doesn't  even meet the $1 billion reconciliation instruction.   It certainly doesn't represent a serious offset to huge deficits in  the Republican bill.   To put this in perspective, this represents less than seven one- hundredths of 1 percent of the $1.5-trillion-dollar increase in the  national debt that the Republican tax policies will cause.   Drilling in the Arctic has nothing to do with serious budgetary  policy, but it has everything to do with evading regular order to pass  something that could never be enacted on its own.   In addition to drilling in the Arctic refuge, this bill would sell 7  million barrels of oil from our Nation's strategic petroleum reserve.   A portion of that sale is necessary simply to meet the committee's  reconciliation instructions. The sale of oil from the reserve would  also provide for a $300 million windfall to four States: Texas,  Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.   So this bill is selling off oil from our strategic petroleum reserve  in order to pay for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge.   It doesn't make any sense.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of the crown jewels of the  national wildlife refuge system.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge,  describes it as ``the only conservation system unit that protects, in  an undisturbed condition, a complete spectrum of the arctic ecosystems  in North America.''   It is home to an incredible diversity of wildlife: 47 different  species of mammals, including polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves,  Dall's sheep, moose, musk-ox, and the Porcupine caribou herd.   The refuge provides important habitat for over 40 species of fish and  more than 200 species of migratory birds whose lives depend on the  Arctic refuge.   The refuge was first established by the Eisenhower administration.  Congress later protected this amazing Arctic ecosystem in 1980. It did  so specifically to protect wildlife and wildlife habitat in its natural  diversity.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is known as the Last Great  Wilderness and is truly one of our last great wild places.   But the provisions of this bill turn the purpose of the Arctic refuge  on its head.   It would make oil and gas development on the refuge's coastal plain  one of the statutory purposes of the wildlife refuge.   Under this bill, our Nation's most pristine national wildlife refuge  will become the only refuge where oil and gas development is required  by law.   It opens up the entire 1.5-million-acre coastal plain for oil and gas  exploration and requires leasing of at least 800,000 acres.   It requires leasing of areas with the highest oil and gas potential,  no matter the consequences for wildlife or the environment.   The bill requires that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge be managed  as a petroleum reserve, which is unprecedented and undercuts managing  the refuge for wildlife.   The bill includes no clear requirements to comply with environmental  laws or to protect wildlife. Its sponsors, however, say they are not  preempting environmental laws, and that, in fact, laws like the  National Environmental Policy Act will ``fully apply.''   Given the assurances that environmental and wildlife refuge laws will  continue to apply, I do not understand why their bill adds oil  development as a purpose of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.   Adding oil development as a purpose of the refuge seems contrary to  its primary purpose, which is to protect wildlife.   What a no-brainer: The purpose of a wildlife refuge is to protect  wildlife. Refuges must be managed that way.   At every other national wildlife refuge in the country, development  within the refuge is only permitted to the extent it is compatible with  the primary purpose of the refuge: protecting wildlife.   But because the bill makes oil and gas development a refuge purpose,  oil drilling in the refuge will no longer be subject to a meaningful  ``compatibility determination.''   This bill essentially waives one of the most important management  protections that applies to every other national wildlife refuge.   They have to do this because they know that oil and gas isn't  compatible with protecting wildlife--it is just the opposite.   This bill does not provide energy security. There is no prohibition  in the bill against exporting oil from the Arctic refuge. In all  likelihood, much of this oil will end up being exported.   The Republican majority agreed to include only one amendment during  the Energy Committee's consideration of this issue, and that amendment  required the sale of 5 million barrels of oil from the strategic  petroleum reserve to give $300 million to the States of Texas,  Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.   The bill has now been amended to require the sale of 7 million  barrels from our strategic petroleum reserve.   So at the same time as we are being told we need to ruin a pristine  national wildlife refuge to drill for more oil, the very same bill is  selling off millions of barrels out of our strategic oil reserve, which  was used most recently during this hurricane season to protect  Americans from gas price spikes.   The impact of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge and the danger to its wildlife cannot be overstated. The  importance of the refuge for wildlife such as polar bears and caribou  have been documented in letters I have received from biologists and  other scientists who have worked in the Arctic.   I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                     The Jane Goodall Institute,                                                  November 14, 2017.        Dear United States Senator: It seems that each day brings       ever more dire news about what we humans are doing to harm  [[Page S7708]]       our planet, the animals that share it with us and, by doing       so, harming ourselves also. You have an important opportunity       to make a difference both now, and for future generations, by       voting to oppose oil development in one of the world's most       spectacular wilderness areas--the Arctic National Wildlife       Refuge.        This Refuge is a truly wonderful place--nearly 20 million       acres of pristine and ecologically significant habitat. There       is compelling scientific evidence as to why it is truly       important to protect this place. For one thing, it provides       key breeding habitat for the millions-upon-millions of birds       that migrate there from six of our planet's seven continents.       It is also a calving ground for the 200,000-strong Porcupine       caribou herd. And it is one of the most important denning       habitats on earth for polar bears. Moreover it plays a       significant role in helping to protect us from the onslaught       of climate change.        But the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is more than that.       Its very wildness speaks to our deeply rooted spiritual       connection to nature, a necessary element of the human       psyche. The Gwich'in people understand this and call the area       ``The Sacred Place Where Life Begins''.        If we violate the Arctic Refuge by extracting the oil       beneath the land, this will have devastating impact for the       Gwich'in people for they depend upon the caribou herds to       sustain their traditional way of life. Around the globe so       many indigenous people have been harmed in the name of       `progress'--let us not add one more tragedy to the list. We       have other sources of energy.        And so I beg you: Please use your voice and your vote as a       U.S. Senator to protect the Gwich'in people and the American       treasure that is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.        America has helped lead the world in the conservation of       wildlife and your voice has been so meaningful in this       regard, your example so powerful. Please take this       opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to the natural       world and to future generations and stand with me to protect       the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.        Please vote against oil development in the Arctic National       Wildlife Refuge.            Sincerely,                                       Jane Goodall, DBE, Ph.D.,                                Founder--the Jane Goodall Institute,      & UN Messenger of Peace.                                   ____                                                  November 26, 2017.      Hon. Maria Cantwell,       Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cantwell: Research across North America       including Alaska has revealed much about how we can monitor       and mitigate the effects of industrial activities on       migratory tundra caribou. We have learnt that, although the       Prudhoe Bay oilfield displaced calving and post-calving       caribou of the Central Arctic herd, the effects were offset       by reduced hunting. Consequently the herd increased but       between 2010 and 2016 the herd is declining at the rate of       halving every 4 years. We have also learnt that industrial       activities including roads can displace caribou by larger       distances than previously realized.        Caribou across North America are part of a global decline.       The Porcupine herd is the only herd of migratory tundra       caribou in North America that is not currently declining. It       has the diversity of ranges and habitats that allow the       caribou to respond to the changing climate by choosing the       best habitats for their survival. This is true for calving as       the PCH calves in the 1002 area and the western Canadian       coastal plain depending on weather. The coastal plains are so       narrow that even a small footprint for oil and gas activities       may be too much for the caribou already trying to adapt to a       changing climate.        The Porcupine herd is jointly managed between the Alaska       Department of Fish and Game (ADFG), the US Fish and Wildlife       Service (USFWS), and the Yukon, NWT and Canadian governments.       Collaboration on monitoring and research has been coordinated       by the Porcupine Caribou Technical Committee, a group       recognized in the International Porcupine Caribou Agreement       signed by Canada and the US in 1987.        The question is not just what would development in 1002       lands mean to caribou but it is what it means to the people       in USA and Canada who depend on the caribou. Faced with       uncertainty about the caribou, the cautionary approach is to       do no harm until we have a better understanding. The oil and       gas is secure in the ground; the caribou and the people are       not.

Hon. Maria Cantwell,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cantwell: I've studied polar bears for 37       years--solving many of the mysteries about their life cycle.       I led polar bear research in Alaska for 30 years, and my       research team at the USGS provided the information that led       Interior Secretary Kempthorne to list polar bears as a       threatened species. I am currently the chief scientist at       Polar Bears International.        I am reaching out today because I'm concerned about the       likely impacts on Alaska's polar bears should the Arctic       National Wildlife Refuge be opened to oil and gas       development.        The ANWR coastal plain is vitally important to polar bears.       Pregnant female polar bears head to this area every fall to       create snow dens where they give birth to their young. In       fact, the region has higher concentrations of polar bear       maternal denning habitat than other coastal areas on Alaska's       North Slope. In recent years, the ANWR has become even more       important as a polar bear denning site because the       deterioration of historically stable sea ice in the Beaufort       Sea has forced more polar bears to den onshore, rather than       risk giving birth on unstable ice.        In addition to the ANWR's importance as a critical denning       area for polar bears, the region faces profound impacts from       climate change unless we transition away from fossil fuels.       Warmer temperatures mean less sea ice habitat, which polar       bears rely on to catch their seal prey. In addition,       encouraging more fossil fuel usage, as opening the ANWR would       do, will only add to ongoing global warming.        If we continue to follow a ``business as usual'' reliance       on fossil fuels, average annual temperatures in Alaska's       Arctic are projected to be more than 10 degrees Celsius (18       degrees Fahrenheit) higher, at century's end, than they are       now. Such high temperatures would assure ice-free summers in       the Arctic, with devastating impacts on polar bears and other       Arctic wildlife. And, of course, ramifications reach the rest       of life on Earth--including humans.        With ``on the ground'' drilling activities posing a threat       to polar bear denning sites, and prolonged reliance on fossil       fuels continuing to melt the sea ice polar bears need to       catch their prey, oil and gas development in the ANWR would       serve a double whammy. Opening the ANWR to drilling,       therefore, is a path we should avoid--for the sake of polar       bears, our children, and our grandchildren.            Respectfully,                                              Steven C. Amstrup,                                                    Chief Scientist,      Polar Bears International.                                   ____                                                   November 9, 2017.      Hon. Lisa Murkowski, Chair.      Hon. Maria Cantwell, Ranking Member      Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Murkowski and Cantwell: As scientists who       have either conducted research in Arctic Alaska or traveled       in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we are writing to       highlight for you the fundamental importance of fully       protecting its 1.5-million acre coastal plain. Based on our       experience in the Arctic, we oppose oil exploration,       development and production in the Arctic Refuge. Such       activity would be incompatible with the purposes for which       the refuge was established, including ``to conserve fish and       wildlife populations and habitats in their natural       diversity.''        When the original Arctic National Wildlife Range was       established in 1960 by the Eisenhower Administration, it was       done with the foresight and wisdom to protect an entire       ecosystem, both south and north of the Brooks Range,       including the rich coastal plain. Decades of biological study       and scientific research within the Arctic Refuge have       confirmed that the coastal plain specifically is vital to the       biological diversity of the entire refuge. Within the narrow       (15-40 miles) coastal plain, there is a unique compression of       habitats which concentrates a wide array of wildlife native       to the Arctic, including polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves,       wolverines, caribou, musk oxen, Dolly Varden char, Arctic       grayling, and many species of migratory birds. In fact,       according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Arctic       Refuge coastal plain contains the greatest wildlife diversity       of any protected area above the Arctic Circle.        In 2003, the National Research Council (NRC) published a       report on the ``Cumulative Environmental Effects of Oil and       Gas Activities on Alaska's North Slope.'' Led by Dr. Gordon       Orians, University of Washington, this report was prepared by       a panel of prominent scientists following an extensive review       of the literature and consultations with experts. It remains       the best, most comprehensive synthesis of the effects of oil       development on wildlife and the landscape of Arctic Alaska.       Among the report's ``major findings'' (Chapter 11) are the       following:        Three-dimensional seismic surveys require a high spatial       density of trails. ``Seismic exploration can damage       vegetation and cause erosion, especially along stream       banks.''        The effects of roads, pads, pipelines, and other       infrastructure extend far beyond the physical footprint       itself, and the distances at which impacts occur vary with       the environmental component affected. ``Effects on hydrology,       vegetation, and animal populations occur at distances up to       several kilometers . . .''        ``Roads have had effects as far-reaching and complex as any       physical component of the North Slope oil fields.''  [[Page S7709]]         Denning polar bears are among the animals that ``have been       affected by industrial activities on the North Slope.''        Readily available food supplies in the oil fields attract       higher-than-normal densities of predators, which then prey on       birds and their eggs and young. The reproductive success rate       of some bird species in the developed parts of oil fields       ``has been reduced to the extent that it is insufficient to       balance mortality.''        The spread of industrial activity, especially to the east       where the coastal plain is narrower than elsewhere [i.e., the       Arctic Refuge], ``would likely result in reductions in       reproductive success'' for caribou.        Although oilfield technologies continue to improve, the       NRC's findings are still of concern today. Indeed, proposals       that would limit the ``footprint'' of oil development to       2,000 acres on the coastal plain within the Arctic Refuge are       of little value, since those acres may be spread over much of       the coastal plain. This would be especially true if oil       reserves are scattered in multiple pockets across the refuge,       as is suggested by the U.S. Geological Survey (Fact Sheet       0028-01). Since the effects of industrial activities,       starting with seismic surveys, are not limited to the       footprint of a structure or to its immediate vicinity, it is       highly likely that such activities would result in       significant impacts on a variety of wildlife in the refuge's       narrow coastal plain.        Development of yet another oilfield would further set back       efforts to limit the carbon emissions that are fueling the       dramatic changes in climate now affecting Alaska. Polar       bears--listed as ``threatened'' under the Endangered Species       Act--are already struggling with deteriorating sea ice and       increasingly are forced to den on land on the eastern       Beaufort Sea coast, including the coastal plain of the Arctic       Refuge. In fact, three-fourths of the refuge coastal plain is       designated as critical habitat for polar bears, which are       highly vulnerable to disturbance due to oil and gas       activities.        The NRC report and subsequent work done in Arctic Alaska       strongly indicate that the cumulative impact of many       seemingly small changes is significant. New development on       the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge, one of the nation's       and planet's premier protected areas, will only contribute to       these harmful impacts on wildlife. For all these reasons, we       oppose oil and gas exploration, development and production on       the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.        Thank you for your consideration.

The Arctic Refuge's coastal plain and nearby waters are  designated as critical habitat for polar bears, which were designated  as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 2008.  Female polar bears head to this area every fall to create snow dens  where they give birth to their young.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is also famously known as the  summer calving grounds for the Porcupine caribou herd. The herd's range  extends into Canada. A treaty between our countries protects the herd  and its habitat.   The almost 200,000-member herd has an annual migration of hundreds of  miles--and in some cases thousands of miles--wintering south of the  refuge.   These caribou are an important food source for many Alaska Natives,  but in particular the Gwich'in people, who live south of the refuge.  Wildlife biologists argue that the risk to the caribou herd--and those  who rely on this herd--could be quite significant.   Do you know what Webster's definition of stewardship is? The careful  and responsible management of something entrusted to one's care. Since  1960, under President Eisenhower, this iconic refuge has been  protected. Tonight, unless you help strike this, you will be joining  the ranks of those that believe in polluting a wildlife refuge, and you  will be joining an administration that I guarantee you is going to go  down in history as getting an F in stewardship.   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is too special and important; it  is one of the crown jewels of the National Wildlife Refuge System.   We should not destroy this pristine landscape and allow it to be  turned into an oil field.   I want to remind my colleagues of the words of the great  environmental steward Olaus Murie.   After decades of scientific exploration in Alaska, Olaus testified in  the Senate in 1959 in support of creating the Arctic refuge.   He said, ``We long for something more, something that has a mental, a  spiritual impact on us. This idealism, more than anything else, will  set us apart as a nation striving for something worthwhile in the  universe.''   What is setting us apart today, colleagues, is just the opposite. We  are striving for short-term gains.   In a hundred years, when the economic effects of this tax bill are  long forgotten, we will still bear the blame for letting go of  ``something worthwhile in the universe.''   We didn't create the Arctic coastal plain, and we cannot recreate,  but we can surely destroy it.   I urge my colleagues to oppose sacrificing the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge, and to support removing this provision from the bill.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the  pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
