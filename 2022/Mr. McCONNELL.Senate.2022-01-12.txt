 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 12 months ago, a newly inaugurated  President Biden stood on the west front of the Capitol, and here is  what he had to say:         My whole soul is in this: bringing America together,       uniting our people, uniting our nation.    Yesterday, that very same man delivered a deliberately divisive  speech that was designed to pull our country further apart.   Twelve months ago, this President said we should see each other not  as adversaries but as neighbors. Yesterday, he called millions of  Americans his domestic ``enemies.''   Twelve months ago, the President called on Americans to ``join  forces, stop the shouting, lower the temperature,'' but yesterday, he  shouted that if you disagree with him, you are George Wallace. George  Wallace? If you don't pass the laws he wants, you are Bull Connor. And  if you oppose giving Democrats untrammeled one-party control of the  country, well, you are Jefferson Davis.   Twelve months ago, this President said ``disagreement must not lead  to disunion.'' Ah, but yesterday, he invoked the bloody disunion of the  Civil War--the Civil War--to demonize Americans who disagree with him.  He compared--listen to this--a bipartisan majority of Senators to  literal traitors. How profoundly--profoundly--un-Presidential.   Look, I have known, liked, and personally respected Joe Biden for  many years. I did not recognize the man at the podium yesterday.   American voters did not give President Biden a mandate for very much.  He got a tied Senate and negative coattails in the House--the narrowest  majorities in over a century. The President did not get a mandate to  transform America or reshape society, but he did arguably get a mandate  to do just one central thing that he campaigned on. Here is what that  was: Bridge a divided country; lower the temperature; dial down the  perpetual air of crisis in our politics. That is the one central  promise that Joe Biden made. It is the one job citizens actually hired  him to do. It is the one project that would have actually been  consistent--consistent--with the Congress that voters elected. Ah, but  President Biden has chosen to fail his own test.   The President's rant--rant--yesterday was incoherent, incorrect, and  beneath his office. He used the phrase ``Jim Crow 2.0'' to demagogue a  law that makes the franchise more accessible than in his own State of  Delaware. He blasted Georgia's procedures  [[Page S166]]  regarding local election officials while pushing national legislation  with almost identical language on that issue.   The President implied that things like wildly popular ID laws are-- listen to this--``totalitarian.'' Totalitarian? Ironically, on the same  day, Washington, DC's Democratic mayor told citizens to bring both a  photo ID and a vaccine card anytime they leave the house.    The President repeatedly invoked the January 6 riot, while himself  using irresponsible, delegitimizing rhetoric that undermines our  democracy.   The sitting President of the United States compared American States  to ``totalitarian states.'' He said our country will be an  ``autocracy'' if he does not get his way--if he does not get his way.   So the world saw our Commander in Chief propagandize against his own  country--his own country--to a degree that would have made Pravda  blush. There was no consistent standard behind anything the President  said. He trampled through some of the most sensitive and sacred parts  of our Nation's past. He invoked times when activists bled and when  soldiers died, all to demagogue voting laws that are more expansive  than what Democrats have on the books in his own home State.   Georgia has more days of early voting than Delaware or New York.  Georgia has no-excuse absentee voting, which Delaware and New York do  not have. If Georgia or Texas presents Jim Crow emergencies, then so do  a whole lot of Democratic-run States.   The Senate Democratic leader has gone on cable TV saying Georgia ``is  greatly restricting or eliminating early voting.'' That is a lie,  provably false. Georgia has more early voting than New York. The  Democratic leader has tried to fearmonger about one rural Georgia  county that condensed multiple voting locations into one--one rural  Georgia county. Well, the county is overwhelmingly red. They were  clearly not involved in trying to suppress Democratic votes--70 percent  Republican in that one county in 2020.   So take a step back for a minute. President Biden's story is that  democracy is on death's door, but he spent 9 months chasing a reckless  taxing-and-spending spree before addressing it. It must not be that  much of an emergency. Citizens are meant to believe a return of Jim  Crow is on the table, but this was only President Biden's sixth  priority after he was blocked from spending $5 trillion on windmills  and welfare. Democrats' own behavior refutes their false hysteria.   Twelve months ago, the President said that ``politics need not be a  raging fire destroying everything in its path.'' That was just 12  months ago, but yesterday, he poured a giant can of gasoline on the  fire.   Twelve months ago, the President said every disagreement doesn't have  to be a cause for total war, but yesterday, he said anyone who opposes  smashing the Senate--smashing the Senate--and letting Democrats rewrite  election law is a domestic ``enemy'' and--listen to this--a traitor  like Jefferson Davis.   One week ago, President Biden gave a January 6 lecture about not  stoking political violence--1 week ago. Yesterday, with the world's  largest megaphone, he invoked the literal Civil War and said we are on  the doorstep of ``autocracy.'' He talked about domestic ``enemies''-- rhetoric unbecoming of a President of the United States.   In less than a year, ``restoring the soul of America'' has become  this: Agree with me or you are a bigot. Agree with me or you are a  bigot--from lowering the temperature to invoking totalitarian States  and the Civil War.   This inflammatory rhetoric was not an attempt to persuade skeptical  Democrat or Republican Senators. This whole display--this whole  display--in fact, you could not invent a better advertisement for the  legislative filibuster than a President abandoning rational persuasion  for pure demagoguery. You could not invent a better advertisement for  the legislative filibuster than what we have just seen: a President  abandoning rational persuasion for pure--pure--demagoguery.   A President shouting that 52 Senators and millions of Americans are  racist unless he gets whatever he wants is proving exactly why the  Framers built the Senate to check his power.   This whole display is the best possible argument for preserving-- preserving--the Senate rules that extend deliberation, force bipartisan  compromise, and let cooler heads prevail. Nothing proves it better than  this episode. It offers a perfect case study in why Senator Biden was  right about the filibuster and President Biden is wrong.   One respected scholar explained it this way:         The smallest majority we've ever seen in our politics is       trying to change the rules for how people get elected in       every [single] state. . . . That's just about the best       argument for the filibuster you could possibly imagine.    The citizens of the greatest country in the world deserve for their  elected officials to treat them like grownups. The adults of America  deserve to hear from the adults in Washington, DC.   I will close with some basic truths.   Obviously, our country is more divided than it should be, no doubt.   In recent years, I have vocally criticized people across the  political spectrum who have sought to legitimatize elections when they  win and delegitimize democracy when they are polling badly or when they  lose.   I criticized the top Democrats' hysteria after 2016, when their  rhetoric had 66 percent of Democrats across America falsely convinced  that Russia had hacked our voting machines and changed the tallies.  Sixty-six percent of Democrats thought that after 2016. I criticized  Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats who spent the runup to 2020 hyping  conspiracy theories and suggesting the election would presumptively be  illegitimate if their side lost.   In December 2020 and January of last year, our side of the aisle  defended our constitutional process despite political pressure, and we  had, of course, a literal mob. But now it is President Biden and Leader  Schumer and other Washington Democrats who don't like their poll  numbers. So they are reversing their tune yet again. The people who  spent November 2020 through January 2021 preaching sermons about the  strength and the sanctity of our democracy are now undertaking to  delegitimize the next election in case they lose it.   We have a sitting President--a sitting President--invoking the Civil  War, shouting about totalitarianism and labeling millions of Americans  his domestic enemies.   We have a Senate Democratic leader who now frequently calls American  elections ``a rigged game.''   Look, this will not be repaired with more lies, more outrage, and  more rulebreaking.   Unfortunately, President Biden has rejected the better angels of our  nature. So it is the Senate's responsibility to protect the country.  This institution was constructed as a firewall against exactly-- exactly--the kind of rage and false hysteria we saw on full display  yesterday. It falls to the Senate to put America on a better track. It  falls to us. So this institution cannot give in to dishonorable  tactics. We cannot surrender to this recklessness. We have to stand up,  stand strong, protect the Senate, and defend the country.
