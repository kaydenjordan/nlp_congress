 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  commemorate Veterans Day, a day in which we remember all those who have  served our Nation in uniform.   This day was originally commemorated by President Woodrow Wilson in  1919 as Armistice Day to remember all those who served in World War I.   In 1954, Armistice Day became Veterans Day in a proclamation by  President Dwight Eisenhower to honor those who had served in uniform.  In 1968, Congress officially designated Veterans Day as a Federal  holiday.   We owe a sincere debt of gratitude to all those who have served and  are currently serving in our military. Your sacrifice, dedication, and  courage to our country is the reason we are able to live our lives in  safety and freedom today.   In my home State of Pennsylvania alone, there are almost 800,000  veterans, with 300,000 being wartime veterans, according to the  Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking all of our veterans for their  service to our country. May we always remember those who have made  sacrifices to preserve our freedoms and our way of life.                            ____________________
