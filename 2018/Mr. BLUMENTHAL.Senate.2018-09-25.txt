 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Connecticut Chiropractic Association, Inc., CTChiro, as it celebrates  100 years of extraordinary and exemplary advocacy on behalf of  chiropractic doctors in Connecticut.   Since its formation in 1918, CTChiro has demonstrated tireless  dedication to the advancement of the chiropractic profession. The  association seeks to support these doctors and their practices  throughout Connecticut in order to improve public health policies and  provide their patients with the best treatment possible.   Endeavoring to raise awareness of the profession and make  chiropractic care more accessible to the people of Connecticut, CTChiro  diligently monitors healthcare legislation to ensure chiropractic  services are a viable health option for residents. To meet the need for  such medical care throughout the State, CTChiro strives to improve  patient awareness of chiropractic services, while advocating for  greater insurance coverage.   Continuously seeking to raise the standard for doctors in the field  and the treatment they provide to their patients, CTChiro also offers  opportunities for its member doctors to access resources and continue  with higher education. Thanks to the association's longstanding,  consistent efforts, institutions, representatives, agencies, and  Connecticut residents are able to see the importance and availability  of chiropractic medicine. Additionally, they can feel secure in the  services offered to them as a result of CTChiro's dedication to  developing a more comprehensive and knowledgeable set of doctors.   Since its establishment, CTChiro routinely prioritizes the creation  of thorough, economical, and beneficial chiropractic care, supported by  experienced, well-rounded professional doctors. I applaud their  numerous achievements and hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating the Connecticut Chiropractic Association, Inc., on 100  years of service and commitment to Connecticut chiropractic doctors and  patients.                            ____________________
