 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to speak in support of S.  2899, the Prison Camera Reform Act of 2021.    Our team, along with Congresswoman McBath, introduced the House  companion to this bill, which requires the Bureau of Prisons to  evaluate their security cameras and address deficiencies so that the  Bureau of Prisons can keep correctional officers and inmates safe,  oversee misconduct, and limit contraband.   As the chair of the Congressional Bureau of Prisons Reform Caucus,  our team has facilitated several meetings with officials from the  Bureau of Prisons and the Council of Prison Locals.   During these meetings, we heard from corrections officers about major  deficiencies and needed upgrades within the BOP's security camera  system. These deficiencies have made it harder for corrections officers  to protect themselves and maintain secure facilities.   The Prison Camera Reform Act works to address these concerns,  requiring the BOP to evaluate current conditions of equipment and  formulate a plan on how they will address any deficiencies identified.   The outstanding men and women who work in our Nation's correctional  facilities deal with dangerous situations  [[Page H9828]]  every day. They deserve the tools and support necessary to keep  themselves and the inmates whom they protect safe from harm.   Shane Fausey and Steve Markle, with the Council of Prison Locals,  have been tireless advocates for America's corrections officers and  staff, and their sage counsel was vital in developing the Prison Camera  Reform Act, which has been a top legislative priority for our BOP  Reform Caucus.   While the BOP faces many challenges, passing the Prison Camera Reform  Act would be a major step forward for the agency, corrections officers,  and security of America's Federal prisons.                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 3905, the Preventing  Organizational Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act, for  the simple reason that it is unnecessary legislation.   The Federal Acquisition Regulation already contains provisions  targeting conflicts of interest. The FAR includes specific examples of  what is a conflict of interest. The FAR includes guidance for agencies  to add contract clauses addressing conflicts that might arise.   Therefore, it seems we are telling the Federal Acquisition Regulation  Council, the body responsible for Federal acquisition policy, to do  something it is already doing.   As a result, this legislation will cause the FAR Council to do work  it does not need to be doing, but they will surely feel compelled to  produce something in the way of new regulations. That means it will  become even more difficult for companies to do business with the  Federal Government, and it is complicated enough as it is.   There are concerns that companies, especially small businesses, are  deciding not to do business with the Federal Government because it is  just too complicated.   From a process perspective, Oversight Committee Democrats marked up  this bill without any hearings with relevant agency officials to  determine if this legislation was truly necessary. My Democrat  committee colleagues may point to their report regarding one specific  company of concern and argue that was proof enough that we need to  legislate in this already crowded space, but a simple case study is not  a solid foundation for governmentwide legislation impacting all Federal  contractors.   If there are issues with agencies enforcing existing conflicts of  interest requirements, then Congress needs to conduct oversight over  that Federal Government failure, not rush to pass more duplicative  laws. In fact, that would be the responsibility of the Oversight  Committee, which I could argue has not been doing proper oversight over  the past couple of years.   There may be other anecdotes about conflicts of interest, but let's  be clear: No matter what we do, there will always be accusations of  conflicts of interest.   Republicans oppose conflicts of interest, but we also support  responsible legislating. We also support holding those who are not  following the current law or regulation accountable, rather than  passing new laws.   With this bill, the most likely outcome is unnecessary work and a  more complicated Federal procurement process. It will burden businesses  and shrink the pool of eligible contractors, not reduce conflicts of  interest.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this unnecessary, duplicative  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, despite addressing a valid concern, this legislation is  simply unnecessary. Federal contractors are already supposed to provide  impartial and objective assistance to Federal clients.   The risks of conflicts of interest are addressed by the Federal  Acquisition Regulation. I am confident the American taxpayer and our  national interests are already protected in this area of Federal  procurement policy.   I know the gentleman mentioned opioids and a drug crisis. That is a  concern for all Americans, but so is all the fentanyl that is killing  Americans coming across our southern border.    I would hope my colleagues would force the administration to close  our southern border and make sure these illegal drugs aren't coming  over and killing Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we oppose this bill, which would burden  companies, both large and small, that want to do business with the  Federal Government, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that it should be--and already  is--illegal for people who are providing this guidance and service to  misrepresent things under the False Claims Act. So it is our  understanding that it is already a crime to do that, and they would be  held accountable.   I know the gentlewoman said it should be a crime. It already is, and  I don't know anywhere in the bill that it adds to that. So it should be  a crime. People should not be doing things inappropriately. But as I  mentioned, we already have the FAR that takes care of making sure  people are doing the right things.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this unnecessary  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
