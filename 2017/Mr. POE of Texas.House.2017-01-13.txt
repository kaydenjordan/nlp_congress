 Mr. Chairman, the Affordable Care Act is a  collection of failed policies and many empty promises.   The American people have spoken. They do not want ObamaCare's high- cost, job-killing, conscious-violating healthcare system. Since the  enactment of ObamaCare, almost 5 million Americans have lost their  insurance plans and their own doctors. This is a far cry from the fake  promises that were made on this House floor in the dark of the night  when we were told: ``Pass the bill so that we can figure out what is in  it.''   The American people are the ones paying for these failed promises. In  fact, it is expected that in 2017, ObamaCare premiums will grow by an  average of 22 percent across America. ObamaCare is hurting individual  citizens, and it is also hurting small businesses. Out of 75 issues,  small-business owners ranked the cost of health insurance as the number  one problem they faced in 2016.   ObamaCare is neither affordable, and it is certainly not better care.  We cannot afford ObamaCare. Health care should be a decision made by  individuals in America, not by bureaucrats here in Washington, D.C. The  repeal bill is the first step in finally correcting this huge  legislative blunder. Replace ObamaCare with a free-market alternative  that provides affordable health care to all Americans. Let Americans  choose their health care.   ObamaCare has the efficiency of the post office and the compassion of  the IRS, and it is time to make America healthy. Repeal this government  control of our health.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, Iran is the world's leading state  sponsor of terrorism. It funds and controls terrorists groups like  Hezbollah. Its tentacles stretch all over the world, far beyond the  Middle East.   Many of its activities are done through the Iranian Revolutionary  Guard Corps, which has funded, planned, and executed terrorist attacks  in the United States and elsewhere for decades.   The IRGC is the parent organization of the Quds Force and is directly  responsible for its terrorist activities worldwide. But somehow this  group has managed to escape repercussions, and the United States has  never recognized it as a terrorist organization. I am working to change  that.   This week I introduced the IRGC Terrorist Sanctions Act. This bill  will require the President to designate the IRGC for its terrorist  activity and levy the relevant statutory sanctions against it.   It is time to close loopholes like these that allow terrorist- affiliated groups to continue their reign of terror. Designate and  sanction these terrorist groups that are sponsored by the number one  world state sponsor of terrorism, Iran.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
