 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a  pillar of journalistic integrity in our democracy, the Reading Eagle, a  newspaper in my district in Berks County, Pennsylvania. This month, the  paper celebrates its 150th anniversary.   On January 28, 1868, the Reading Eagle published its first daily  paper and is now one of the oldest family-owned newspapers in our  country. Today, the paper operates its headquarters in downtown Reading  and serves as a valuable resource for news to many of my constituents.   Congratulations to the Reading Eagle and its staff on this exciting  milestone; and thank you for providing community news, great local  content, national news, and providing transparency and accountability  of government at all levels for the betterment of our democracy.   In spite of all of the competing sources of information and evolving  technology of today, the Reading Eagle remains the greater Berks  region's go-to source for reliable local news and information.                            ____________________
