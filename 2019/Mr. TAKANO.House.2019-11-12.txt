The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4625, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4625, as amended, the  Protect the GI Bill Act.   In 2009, before passage of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational  Assistance Improvements Act of 2010--the Post-9/11 GI Bill--the  Department of Veterans Affairs supplied educational benefits to over  14,000 veterans and paid schools over $36 million in educational  benefits.   Now, VA provides educational benefits to over 600,000 veterans and  pays institutions of higher learning over $11 billion to cover the  tuition, fees, and books for veterans on an annual basis.   The increased educational benefits enacted through the Post-9/11 GI  Bill and the Harry W. Colmery Forever GI Bill of 2017 have made  pursuing an education a viable path for many veterans  [[Page H8750]]  across the country. Schools across this country have embraced the  influx of students to their campuses with open arms; and, in return,  veterans have brought their knowledge, expertise, and ideas into the  classroom and, eventually, the workforce.   Since 2010, most institutions of higher learning have provided  student veterans with a means to upward economic mobility through  traditional education and vocational training.   However, a small number of predatory schools have sought to expand  their coffers by targeting veterans for their educational benefits,  providing subpar educations in return. Not only do veterans lose  precious time and benefits from being misled by these malicious actors,  but it also costs taxpayers millions of dollars each year, which is why  we must pass the Protect the GI Bill Act today.   The Protect the GI Bill Act would hold all schools to standards set  forth by the principles of excellence outlined in Executive Order No.  13607. By codifying the principles of excellence, we are ensuring that  schools can no longer misrepresent their student outcomes, job  placement rates, and graduation requirements when marketing to veterans  and members of the military.   The Protect the GI Bill Act also ensures that schools are upfront and  honest regarding the cost of attendance, scholarships available for  veterans before they take loans, and whether additional training is  needed after graduation to pass State-based licensure or certification  tests. This will allow veterans to make informed choices about the  schools they want to attend to start their new careers and ensure that  institutions are more accountable to veterans.   This legislation also includes Congressman Bilirakis' Student Veteran  Empowerment Act, Congresswoman Susie Lee's Forever GI Bill Class  Evaluation Act, Congresswoman Susan Davis' Reserve and Guard GI Bill  Housing Fairness Act, and Congressman Foster's GI Bill Education  Fairness Act.   This bipartisan legislation empowers State approving agencies to  conduct targeted, risk-based surveys; eliminates waste in the Post-9/11  GI Bill program; ensures that spouses of servicemembers in the Reserves  and Guard are not penalized when servicemembers are called to duty; and  clarifies that servicemembers can transfer their education benefits to  stepchildren, foster and adopted children, and other minor dependents.   As amended, the Protect the GI Bill Act also protects veterans by  stopping them from incurring debt from Post-9/11 GI Bill overpayments.  According to a GAO report, in fiscal year 2014, the VA paid  approximately $10.8 billion in education assistance through the Post-9/ 11 GI Bill and made approximately $416 million in overpayments to  veterans in about 6,000 schools. Approximately one in four veterans  received an overpayment in fiscal year 2014.   Now, saddling veterans with unexpected debt is an injustice that we  cannot perpetuate. This bill delays payments to schools, mandates that  veterans confirm their enrollment each month, and prohibits late  payment charges to students who are receiving GI Bill benefits.   The Protect the GI Bill Act would also allow more veterans to restore  their educational benefits in cases where schools they attend close,  are disapproved by a State approving agency, or are discontinued for  other reasons outside of their control.   Current law only allows veterans to restore their education benefits  if they attend schools that close or are disapproved by State approving  agencies and if these veterans do not transfer any credits to another  school or institution.    This requires these veterans to restart their education to restore  the benefits, which could erode their motivation and cost taxpayers  more money. There is no reason that veterans should be forced to repeat  basic classes or core credits in order to regain their educational  benefits.   This bill allows veterans to restore their education benefits while  transferring up to 12 credits to another school.   The expansion of eligibility in this bill is retroactive and will  allow thousands of veterans to recover their educational benefits upon  the enactment of this much needed bill.   Madam Speaker, if our goal as a legislative body is to improve  veterans' economic opportunities and end veteran homelessness, we must  empower veterans to develop new and marketable skill sets in community  colleges, universities, and trade schools.   We must also be good fiduciaries of taxpayer funds by enacting  rigorous standards and providing adequate oversight of institutions who  seek to collect funds from veterans' educational benefits, which is why  I support this bill.   This bill also has the support of the Student Veterans of America and  Veterans Education Success.   I want to thank Representative Levin for his hard work on this  excellent bill. I would also like to thank Representative Bilirakis,  Representative Lee, Representative Davis, and Representative Foster for  their contributions to this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say that this bill, the Protect the GI Bill Act, contains  so many elements offered by both sides of the aisle. I have to point  out, for the Record, the coincidence of having the interests of foster  children being protected by a man named Bill Foster. There are not  enough people in here to get that joke, but I thought that was worth  pointing out.   The language in this bill also contains enhancements to the  authorities of State approving agencies. One of the broken parts of how  our schools, our for-profit schools or all schools, get approved, get  their programs approved, is because our State approving agencies lack  sufficient authority to intervene when they know that a certain for- profit operation that has had a shady history is about to open in their  State. This legislation would allow a State approving agency to act  before a bad-acting for-profit school is actually charged, formally  charged.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 4625, as  amended. Indeed, both sides of the aisle worked carefully together, and  I am pleased to recommend that we pass this bill on suspension. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4477) to direct the Secretary  [[Page H8752]]  of Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a plan to address certain  high risk areas identified by the Comptroller General of the United  States regarding the Department of Veterans Affairs in the 2019 High- Risk List of the Government Accountability Office, and for other  purposes, as amended.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4477, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4477, as amended, the  Reducing High Risk to Veterans and Veterans Services Act.   The Government Accountability Office provides important oversight  across the Federal Government. As Congress' investigative arm, GAO  audits and examines Department of Veterans Affairs programs and  spending. The Comptroller General and his staff provide hundreds of  recommendations on how to improve services and benefits. However, too  often, GAO recommendations are ignored by the Department.   H.R. 4477, as amended, is bipartisan legislation offered by the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations' Chairman Pappas and  Ranking Member Bergman that seeks to address, in a systematic manner,  GAO's most notable and important findings and recommendations.   The act requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a plan  to address the two areas within VA identified as high risk by the  Government Accountability Office. These are the Veterans Health  Administration and acquisition management.   Every 2 years, the Government Accountability Office releases its  High-Risk List of Federal Government programs most vulnerable to fraud,  waste, abuse, or mismanagement.   Included in 2015, the Veterans Health Administration, the largest  healthcare system in the country, remains on GAO's 2019 list.   This was the first year that VA acquisition management was placed on  the High-Risk List as a result of inefficient use of acquisition  funding and staffing resources, as well as numerous contracting  challenges. VA's acquisition management is vital to VA's functioning  because of its role in medical supplies procurement and construction,  both of which relate directly to VA's ability to serve veterans and  provide quality medical care.   The Reducing High Risk to Veterans and Veterans Services Act requires  the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop a plan to address the two  areas within VA identified as high risk by the Government  Accountability Office.                                time  1630    This plan will address the root causes of why these programs are at  high risk and include specific timelines to correct the problems. VA  will report to Congress on progress and ongoing challenges. The  Department will also provide their views on whether Congress needs to  take legislative action or provide additional resources.   This bill has the support of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign  Wars, and the DAV. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4477, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4771) to amend title 38, United States Code, to permit  appellants to appear in disability compensation cases before the Board  of Veterans' Appeals by picture and voice transmission from locations  other than facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4771         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Tele-Hearing       Modernization Act''.       SECTION 2. HEARINGS BEFORE THE BOARD OF VETERANS' APPEALS BY                     MEANS OF TELECONFERENCE FROM LOCATIONS OTHER                     THAN FACILITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.

(2) One-time reporting requirements.--The first report       required to be submitted under section 7101(d) of title 38,       United States Code, shall include the following information       with respect to hearings scheduled under subparagraph (C) of       paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of section 7101 of such       title, as added by subsection (a):        (A) An outline of the outreach the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs plans to conduct to inform veterans, families of       veterans, survivors of veterans, veterans service       organizations, military service organizations, congressional       caseworkers, advocates for veterans, and such other       stakeholders as the Secretary considers appropriate about       hearings scheduled under such subparagraph, including--        (i) a description of the resources required to conduct such       outreach;        (ii) a timeline for conducting such outreach; and        (iii) information related to the advantages and potential       technological challenges of conducting hearings under such       subparagraph.

(C) A detailed description of the intra-agency partnership       between the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the telehealth       program of the Veterans Health Administration as the Board       conducts hearings under such subparagraph, including best       practices, a risk assessment overview, risk mitigation       efforts, and a plan for ongoing collaboration and information       sharing.  [[Page H8754]]         (d) Collaboration.--In developing the capacity and       procedures to conduct hearings under subparagraph (C) of       paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of section 7101 of title 38,       United States Code, as added by subsection (a), the Secretary       of Veterans Affairs shall collaborate with, partner with, and       give weight to the advice of veterans service organizations       and such other stakeholders as the Secretary considers       appropriate.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4771, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4771, as amended, introduced  by Mr. Cunningham. I support this legislation that creates an easy  technological fix so veterans can quickly and conveniently attend their  hearings before the Board of Veterans' Appeals.   Applying for disability compensation and benefits through VA can be a  long and confusing ordeal, which is further complicated in the appeals  process. Currently, veterans often face difficulties traveling to VA  regional offices for their Board hearings, difficulties including long  wait times, scheduling challenges, or simply the distance an elderly or  disabled veteran may have to travel.   Madam Speaker, the VA Tele-Hearing Modernization Act permits veterans  to provide testimony before a veterans law judge via video conference  from a location outside of a VA facility. This means a veteran could  testify in support of his or her claim from the comfort of their own  home.   Now, VA told us this piece of legislation could have an especially  positive impact on hearing access for homebound or rural veterans. This  bill ensures veterans have the flexibility to appeal VA's decisions in  a comfortable, accessible location without affecting the security of  their personal information.   The tele-hearing program is modeled after the existing telehealth  program at the Veterans Health Administration and will likely improve  hearing attendance and help veterans receive their benefits. A tele- hearing pilot program conducted by the Board showed increased  participation in hearings as well as increased efficiency and  timeliness of requested hearings.   Under this bill, VA is required to provide annual reports to Congress  with information about how often the tele-hearing option is used by  veterans and whether those claimants are as likely to have their claims  granted as veterans using the traditional hearing methods. This report  allows Congress to ensure this program is working the way it should.   I thank Representative Cunningham for introducing this bill, and I  support this legislation for the step it takes to simplify the appeals  process for our veterans.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham), my good friend, member of the Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee, and author of H.R. 4771.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Cunningham) for his hard work.   I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  passing this important piece of legislation, H.R. 4771, as amended, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4360) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  due process accorded veterans with respect to recovery of overpayments  made by the Department and other amounts owed by veterans to the United  States, to improve the processing of veterans benefits by the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4360         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Overpayment       Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. REPAIR OF CREDIT.         (a) In General.--Chapter 53 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       section:       ``Sec. 5320. Correction of erroneous information submitted to         consumer reporting agencies         ``(a) Correcting Errors by the Department.--In any case in       which the Secretary finds that the Department has submitted       erroneous information to a consumer reporting agency about       the indebtedness of any person who has been determined by the       Secretary to be indebted to the United States by virtue of       the participation of that person in a benefits program       administered by the Secretary, the Secretary shall--        ``(1) instruct the consumer reporting agency to remove such       erroneous information from the consumer report of such person       or take such other action as may be required to ensure that       such erroneous information is not included in the report of       such person; and        ``(2) transmit to the consumer reporting agency such       information as the consumer reporting agency may require to       take such appropriate actions.        ``(b) Correcting Errors by Debt Collectors.--In any case in       which the Secretary finds that a debt collector acting on       behalf of the Department has submitted erroneous information       to a consumer reporting agency about the indebtedness of any       person who has been determined by the Secretary to be       indebted to the United States by virtue of the participation       of that person in a benefits program administered by the       Secretary, the Secretary shall instruct the debt collector to       request the consumer reporting agency remove such erroneous       information from the consumer report of such person or take       such other action as may be required to ensure such erroneous       information is not included in the report of such person.        ``(c) Notice.--Not later than 60 days after the date on       which the Secretary issues an instruction under subsection       (a)(1) or (b) with respect to a person, the Secretary shall       notify the person that the Secretary issued such instruction.        ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) The terms `consumer report' and `consumer reporting       agency' have the meanings given such terms in section 603 of       the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a).        ``(2) The term `debt collector' has the meaning given such       term in section 803 of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act       (15 U.S.C. 1692a).''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 53 of such title is amended by adding at       the end the following new item:  ``5320. Correction of erroneous information submitted to consumer                reporting agencies.''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act       and shall apply with respect to deductions made under section       5314 of such title, administrative costs under section 5315       of such title, and suits filed under section 5316 of such       title on or after such date.       SEC. 3. IMPROVED PROCESSING OF BENEFITS BY DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall improve the       information technology of the Department of Veterans Affairs       (including the eBenefits system or successor system) as may       be necessary to achieve the following:        (1) Notification of debts incurred.--The Secretary shall       provide a notification to a person who--        (A) is entitled to a payment from the Secretary under a       benefits program administered by the Secretary;        (B) incurs a debt to the United States under that benefits       program; and        (C) elects to receive such notifications.        (2) Review of information regarding dependents.--A person       entitled to a payment from the Secretary under a benefits       program administered by the Secretary may review information       relating to dependents of that person.        (3) Tracking metrics.--The Secretary shall be able to       track--        (A) the number and amount of payments made by the Secretary       to a person entitled to a payment from the Secretary under a       benefits program administered by the Secretary who incurs a       debt to the United States under such program;        (B) the average debt to the United States incurred by a       person described in subparagraph (A);        (C) how frequently the Secretary approves and denies       applications for relief under section 5302(a) of title 38,       United States Code; and        (D) such other metrics the Secretary determines       appropriate.       SEC. 4. AUDIT OF ERRONEOUS PAYMENTS BY VETERANS BENEFITS                     ADMINISTRATION; PLAN OF CORRECTION.         (a) Audit.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall complete an audit to determine the following:        (1) The frequency by which the Department of Veterans       Affairs makes an error that results in a payment to a person       by virtue of such person's participation in a benefits       program administered by the Secretary that such person is not       entitled to or in an amount that exceeds the amount to which       the person is entitled.        (2) Whether and to what degree vacant positions in the       Veterans Benefits Administration affect such frequency.        (b) Plan.--Not later than 30 days after the completion of       the audit under subsection (a), the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs       of the Senate and House of Representatives a plan and       description of resources necessary to align information       technology systems to ensure that errors described in       subsection (a)(1) are not the result of communication or       absence of communication between information technology       systems.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4360.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4360, the VA Overpayment  Accountability Act, introduced by Representative Kim.   This bill protects veterans by ensuring that the Department of  Veterans Affairs reviews and updates its systems and policies to  minimize overpayments in the future and mitigate negative effects on  veterans.   Now, under certain circumstances, if the Department of Veterans  Affairs makes accounting errors that result in overpayment of benefits,  veterans are left saddled with debt. Then, within a short period of  time, these veterans are required to pay these overpayments back to VA,  placing an extraordinary financial burden on them.   The VA can, and sometimes does, withhold part of veterans' monthly  benefit checks to recover overpayments, exacerbating these financial  hardships.   In some cases, VA may send these debts to a debt collection agency,  compounding veterans' financial stress.   If the information submitted by VA to a consumer reporting agency is  incorrect either because VA later determines its payment was not in  error or  [[Page H8756]]  because VA decides to waive the debt, veterans may still suffer harm to  their credit. This bill makes sure VA rights this wrong.   Under this legislation, VA would be required to instruct the consumer  reporting agency to remove any erroneous information from veterans'  consumer reports. And if VA employs a debt collection agency and that  agency then reports erroneous information to a consumer reporting  agency, VA must instruct the debt agency to fix the error.   Importantly, this bill also requires VA to maintain future tracking  metrics. This information tracks the number of VA overpayments, average  amount of overpayment, and how often VA grants and denies veterans'  requests for relief from this debt.   As we know, VA's information technology system hinders its ability to  manage erroneous or duplicate payments. That is why this legislation  requires an audit of overpayments, so whether it is its staffing  shortages or IT failures, data can guide VA and Congress on where  resources should be directed.   I wholeheartedly support this legislation to financially protect  veterans, because it is an essential step that we need to take to  ensure that veterans are not forced to face severe consequences due to  VA's mistakes.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Kim), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to extend, again, my gratitude for the insightful  and hard work that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim) has done  with this legislation to correct an injustice  [[Page H8757]]  which has been occurring. I thank Congressman Kim for this very  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to extend my gratitude to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), whose district I have visited and whose medical  center I have also visited. And I have to say that he runs a crack  operation. That came out wrong.   He runs, not a crack operation, but amazing constituent services for  his veterans.   You know, this unfortunate situation where the VA overpays veterans  and then claws back those payments will be corrected by this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to say I have no further speakers and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4360, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4356) to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to allow  certain individuals to terminate contracts for telephone, multichannel  video programming, or internet access service, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Section 305A(a) of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (50       U.S.C. 3956(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following       new paragraph:        ``(4) Additional individuals covered.--For purposes of this       section, the following individuals shall be treated as a       servicemember covered by paragraph (1):        ``(A) A spouse or dependent of a servicemember who dies       while in military service or a spouse or dependent of a       member of the reserve components who dies while performing       duty described in subparagraph (C).        ``(B) A spouse or dependent of a servicemember who incurs a       catastrophic injury or illness (as that term is defined in       section 439(g) of title 37, United States Code), if the       servicemember incurs the catastrophic injury or illness while       in military service or performing duty described in       subparagraph (C).        ``(C) A member of the reserve components performing       military service or performing full-time National Guard duty,       active Guard and Reserve duty, or inactive-duty training (as       such terms are defined in section 101(d) of title 10, United       States Code).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4356, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4356, as amended, the  Protecting Families of Fallen Servicemembers Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bill was introduced by Representative Josh Harder  from California, and I thank him for his work with the committee on the  bill. It expands on the work the committee did last Congress in  partnership with Representative Bustos to improve the Servicemembers  Civil Relief Act.   This bill ensures that spouses and dependents of both Active and  Reserve component servicemembers who are catastrophically injured or  pass away while in service to this Nation have protections under the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, otherwise known as SCRA. Specifically,  the bill allows impacted servicemembers or their families to terminate  cable, internet, and phone service.   Servicemembers and families undergo difficult life transitions  because of a catastrophic injury or death of loved ones. Families  should have the flexibility to be at the servicemember's side during  recovery. Surviving spouses and family members of fallen servicemembers  should easily be able to move closer to family and friends or other  support networks. Families dealing with the difficult loss or injury of  their loved ones should not have to worry about contracts or  cancellation fees.   I would like to note that this legislation unanimously passed the  House last Congress and has been updated to reflect improvements  recommended by veterans service organizations.   I also thank Dr. Wenstrup, who served with us on the committee for  several Congresses, for his focus on the issue and for working with Mr.  Harder on this bill.   Finally, I thank the Paralyzed Veterans of America for highlighting  the need to include catastrophically disabled veterans and families in  our work to improve the SCRA.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the bipartisan work of Congressman Levin and  Congressman Bilirakis on moving this bill through committee.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting to  pass H.R. 4356, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with my friend and colleague from Tennessee,  Ranking Member Roe. This is commonsense legislation. We should not  compound the suffering of a family, whether they are caretakers or  grieving, with the complications that they may not be aware of, which  are these continuing contractual agreements for cable, internet, or  other types of contractual agreements of the sort. This bill addresses  a way for families to easily terminate these contracts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  4356, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4162) to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend the  period under which an election must be made for entitlement to  educational assistance under the All-Volunteer Educational Assistance  Program of Department of Veterans Affairs, to phase out the use of such  program, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4162         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``GI Bill Planning Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. PERIOD FOR ELECTION TO RECEIVE BENEFITS UNDER ALL-                    VOLUNTEER EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OF                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Section 3011 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (c)(1), by striking ``Any such election       shall be made at the time the individual initially enters on       active duty as a member of the Armed Forces'' and inserting       ``Any such election shall be made during the 90-day period       beginning on the day that is 180 days after the date on which       the individual initially enters initial training''; and        (2) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``that such       individual is entitled to such pay'' and inserting ``that       begin after the date that is 270 days after the date on which       the individual initially enters initial training''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of       this Act.       SEC. 3. PHASE OUT OF ALL-VOLUNTEER EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE                     PROGRAM.         Subsection (a)(1)(A) of section 3011 of title 38, United       States Code, as amended by section 1, is further amended by       striking ``after June 30, 1985'' and inserting ``during the       period beginning July 1, 1985, and ending September 30,       2029''.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4162, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4162, as amended, the GI Bill  Planning Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, this bill was introduced by Representative Jack Bergman  and Representative Kathleen Rice. Both of them are great members of our  committee and tireless fighters for veterans. I thank Representative  Bergman for his work on this legislation and his commitment to working  with me on several issues related to veterans education and healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, with the enactment of the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the  Montgomery GI Bill has become a less attractive option for many  servicemembers. In most cases, the benefits are worse for  servicemembers when choosing the Montgomery GI Bill instead of the  Forever GI Bill. The issue is that many servicemembers sign up without  knowing what they are signing up for.   For a servicemember to receive benefits through the Montgomery GI  Bill, they must elect to pay into it when they first enter the  military. Often, this is a chaotic period in a servicemember's life, to  say the least. They are unable to give the decision much thought or do  not fully understand the full impact of the decision at the time.   Also, there have been ongoing reports that some servicemembers are  pressured to sign up by instructors at initial entry training or lose  the benefit. This bill addresses this concern by moving the date when a  servicemember elects to join the program so they can better understand  and make a better informed decision.   Many end up signing up for the Montgomery GI Bill benefits only to  never use them and never see them refunded. This is wrong and a waste  of our servicemembers' money.   The committee will work to ensure that the Post-9/11 GI Bill is  updated to ensure that future generations who may have benefited more  from the Montgomery GI Bill than the Post-9/11 GI Bill do not see one  bit of a drop-off in potential benefits. With the work we are doing to  empower State approving agencies to improve the quality of education,  now is the time for us also to improve the quality of benefits for our  servicemembers.   I thank Representative Bergman and Representative Rice for their  leadership, and I urge all of my colleagues to support the passage of  H.R. 4162.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and I am prepared  to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say, I wish to extend a belated happy Veterans Day to  both of my colleagues, Dr. Roe and General Bergman. We certainly  appreciate their service. I extend this congratulations and gratitude  to all of our servicemembers, and I underscore all of  our servicemembers, whether they be the Marines, the Army, the Air  Force, the Navy, or the Coast Guard. And I understand the friendly  rivalry, but I want to make sure that everyone knows whatever service  they engaged, that America appreciates them.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the ranking member  regarding the transformative power of the GI Bill right after World War  II, what it did for a generation.   I want to also take note that the Forever GI Bill was shepherded by  Ranking Member Roe when he was the chairman and it still is an amazing,  remarkable accomplishment that we  [[Page H8760]]  have made the GI Bill a lifetime benefit that can be used at any point  in a veteran's lifetime. And, also, if they don't use it, they can  transfer it to a spouse or their children. This is a remarkable piece  of legislation.   It took cooperation of a minority working in good faith during the  last session of Congress, and I think it is a remarkable  accomplishment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  4162, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3996) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  certain requirements relating to the use of the design-build  construction method for Department of Veterans Affairs construction  projects, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3996         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Design-Build Construction       Enhancement Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE DESIGN-                    BUILD CONSTRUCTION METHOD FOR DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Inspector General of the Department of Veterans       Affairs found that, in the Aurora, Colorado, replacement       medical center project, the Department decided to change its       acquisition strategy from traditional design-bid-build to       integrated-design and construct in the fourth year of the       project, which was too late for the integrated design-      construction firm to provide effective input into the design.        (2) In response to deficiencies in the Department's       management of the Aurora, Colorado, replacement medical       center project and in order to prevent reoccurrence of such       deficiencies in the future, Congress enacted section 8103 of       title 38, United States Code, which mandates that an       appropriate non-Department Federal entity take over       management of future super construction projects of the       Department, including project design, acquisition,       construction, and contract changes.        (3) It has been the policy of the Federal Government since       the enactment of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law       104-106) that design-build shall be used when appropriate       circumstances are present.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the unsuccessful use of the integrated-design and       construct acquisition method in the Aurora, Colorado,       replacement medical center project should not be interpreted       to mean that design-build, as described in section 3309 of       title 41, United States Code, is unsuitable for construction       projects of the Department of Veterans Affairs; and        (2) when used properly by adequately trained acquisition       and construction management personnel and in the appropriate       circumstances, design-build is an effective construction       acquisition method for the Department of Veterans Affairs,       which has been demonstrated to reduce change orders, decrease       the duration between design completion and beneficial       occupancy, and increase warranty protections.       SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS USE OF DESIGN-BUILD                     CONSTRUCTION METHOD.         (a) Use of Design-Build Selection Procedures.--Section 8106       of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding at the       end the following new subsection:        ``(d)(1) If the Secretary seeks to enter into a contract       for the design and construction of a building or facility,       the Secretary shall use the procedures established in section       3309 of title 41.        ``(2) In the case of a super construction project for which       a non-Department Federal entity provides project management       services under section 8103(e) of this title, the Secretary       shall not discourage the entity from using the procedures       established in section 3309 of title 41.''.        (b) Covered Certification Program.--Section 8103(g)(6)(A)       of such title is amended by inserting ``, including design-      build construction'' before the period at the end.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3996.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3996, the VA Design-Build  Construction Enhancement Act of 2019. This bipartisan bill encourages  VA to use a method of managing construction projects termed design- build in appropriate circumstances.   In addition, this bill incorporates design-build training into the VA  construction management curriculum. There have been multiple internal  VA and Government Accountability Office reports that have been very  critical, documenting serious delays in cost overruns in VA facility  construction and other projects.   At present, both veterans and taxpayers are suffering from the  cumbersome VA construction process. I am confident this piece of  legislation will help deliver state-of-the-art facilities to our  veterans in a more effective and expeditious manner.   Design-build is a proven way to deliver construction projects in a  more efficient and timely manner. This method is widely used in the  private sector, and it has been used in parts of the Federal Government  for over 20 years.   For those of you who are unfamiliar with this technique, design-build  is a delivery method for construction projects that combines the  architectural, engineering, and construction services into a single  contract. It is an innovation from traditional design-bid-build  construction, where design and construction are sequential and  performed by different contractors, thus creating costly and lengthy  timelines for delivering much-needed sites of care for our veterans.   Over the years, the Department of Veterans Affairs has faced numerous  challenges when it comes to managing construction projects. I am aware  that some of these challenges are caused by Congress due to the time it  takes to authorize and secure funds for new builds. However, a good  portion of these construction challenges are self-inflicted.   This committee is intimately aware of the Rocky Mountain Regional VA  Medical Center in Aurora, Colorado. Not only was the opening of the new  state-of-the-art medical center several years delayed, it was $1  billion over budget. This is a tragic disservice to our Nation's  veterans and taxpayers.   Unfortunately, Aurora, Colorado, is only one of several examples of  challenged VA construction projects. The VA is currently facing a  multimillion-dollar backlog of construction projects. I am confident  that a shift to design-build in appropriate circumstances could  tremendously decrease the cost and shorten the length of time for VA  construction projects.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 3996, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say that, as a former community  college trustee that had responsibility for overseeing many projects  that were undertaken to build out the community college district,  design-build was employed in those instances. And where appropriately  used, I agree with the comments by my friends from the other side of  the aisle that this can make future VA construction projects more  efficient and more cost-effective for our taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  3996, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1424) to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs permits the display of Fallen Soldier  Displays in national cemeteries.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1424         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fallen Warrior Battlefield       Cross Memorial Act''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR FALLEN SOLDIER DISPLAYS IN NATIONAL                     CEMETERIES.         Section 2403 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(d)(1) Subject to standards established by the Secretary,       the Secretary shall permit the display of a Fallen Soldier       Display in any national cemetery.        ``(2) In this subsection, the term `Fallen Soldier Display'       means a memorial monument in honor of fallen members of the       Armed Forces that may include a replica of an inverted rifle,       boots, helmets, and identification tag.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1424.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1424, the Fallen Warrior  Battlefield Cross Memorial Act, introduced by Representative Anthony  Gonzalez of Ohio.   This act permits the Secretary of the VA to allow the Fallen Soldier  Display, also known as the Battlefield Cross Memorial, in national  cemeteries.   Battlefield crosses honor fallen soldiers using symbols of their  service. These symbols have evolved since their  [[Page H8762]]  initial use in the American Revolutionary War when they were used as a  crude marker as the position of a fallen soldier. The cultural position  remains today, as units in theater traditionally hold a remembrance  ceremony in country to allow the unit to pay last respects to those  killed in action.   These displays are meant to honor those who lost their lives in  service by featuring replicas of inverted rifles, boots, helmets, and  identification tags. A U.S. Army field manual states: ``The helmet and  identification tags signify the dead soldier. The inverted rifle with  bayonet signals a time for prayer, a break in the action to pay tribute  to our comrade. The combat boots represent the final march of the last  battle.''   VA's National Cemetery Administration currently allows for display of  a cross, but it has not specifically addressed the Battlefield Cross  Memorial. In fact, in 2017, a Battlefield Cross Memorial was removed  from the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery.   Though the cemetery ultimately decided to restore the memorial, this  legislation would ensure the Battlefield Cross Memorial would also be  permitted at national cemeteries and prevent future misinterpretations.   Mr. Speaker, we recognize the sacrifices of the women and men who  gave their lives in service to our Nation and the right of a community  to honor its fallen heroes. I urge all Members to support H.R. 1424,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the remarks  of the ranking member regarding the beautiful work that our Cemetery  Administration does for our veteran cemeteries and the National Battle  Monuments Commission for the work they do with our cemeteries abroad.  They are truly the pride of our country and fitting ways to show our  gratitude and respect for those who have fallen in the service of our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Gonzalez for his work on this  bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 1424, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3224) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  increased access to Department of Veterans Affairs medical care for  women veterans, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3224         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(f) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``Native American veteran'' has the meaning       given that term in section 3765 of title 38, United States       Code.        (2) The term ``State'' has the meaning given that term in       section 101 of title 38, United States Code.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 3224, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3224, the Deborah Sampson Act,  introduced by Representative Julia Brownley, the chairwoman of the  Veterans Affairs' Health Subcommittee.   This bill comprises 15 bipartisan bills that transform and improve  comprehensive access to healthcare, benefits, and other resources for  America's 2 million women veterans.   This bill is named after Deborah Sampson, a Revolutionary War veteran  from Massachusetts who served in the Continental Army for 17 months and  was wounded in battle more than once.   Deborah Sampson was neither the first nor the only woman to serve in  the Continental Army, nor was she the first woman to be granted a  pension by Congress, but she was the most persistent.   Over 38 years, Congress granted her a pension, backpay, and  ultimately her husband was granted a survivor's pension after her  death.   Mr. Speaker, it is because of the similar persistence of women  warriors who followed in Deborah Sampson's footsteps that we are now  considering this bill today.   The Deborah Sampson Act creates an Office of Women's Health that  reports directly to the Undersecretary of Health. This office will be  responsible for internal oversight and resource allocation, including  inputs to the annual budgeting process.   Currently, 10 percent of VA facilities do not have gender-specific  care for women. H.R. 3224, as amended, also increases staffing and  training for women's health primary care providers so that every single  woman veteran has access to gender-specific care at her nearest VA  facility.   Mr. Speaker, 75 percent of women veterans do not use VA care, often  because they don't realize that they are eligible. This legislation  seeks to expand communication outreach capabilities of the department  to connect more women to VA benefits and healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, the Deborah Sampson Act also authorizes counseling in  retreat settings, expands counseling at vet centers for members of the  Reserve and National Guard who are survivors of military sexual trauma,  and improves resources for veterans experiencing intimate-partner  violence and women veterans facing homelessness.   Throughout this Congress we have addressed the issue of widespread  sexual harassment and assault at VA facilities. At least one in four  women veterans experience sexual and gender harassment at VA  facilities, and that must end.   No veteran, caregiver, employee, contractor, or other public visitor  should experience sexual harassment or assault at VA.   H.R. 3224, as amended, requires that VA develop a comprehensive  policy that includes bystander intervention, mandatory reporting  mechanisms for employees, confidential reporting mechanisms for  veterans, and holds leadership accountable for addressing sexual  harassment and assault at VA facilities.   Today, nearly one in four new recruits joining the military is a  woman. Women veterans are the fastest growing demographic in the  veterans' community, and VA must be prepared to welcome them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 3224, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the final comments that the ranking member made, I  believe in good faith and sincerity, and they were words of generosity.  But I have to rebut some of the claims that he has made.   While I spent 6 years of my time in Congress in the minority, and in  the minority on this committee, I can tell you that the minority staff  and I, and other members of the minority, did offer amendments in good  faith, but we never did so in order to derail or to obstruct passage of  important and meaningful legislation. Therefore, the ranking member,  while he was chairman, can point to many great pieces of legislation,  including the Forever GI Bill and numerous other bills. It was a very  productive Congress in the last Congress because the minority worked  with him.   Look, bipartisan spirit means that the minority also works in good  faith. Ms. Brownley, in order to bring the Deborah Sampson Act to the  floor under suspension, made some significant concessions, for which  there was nothing offered in return.   Mr. Barr's amendment on crimes against children has been offered on  the floor as a motion to recommit, interesting enough, to Ms.  Brownley's bill on childcare on the floor. That bill was voted down. It  was voted down on the House floor, and I can only believe that this  very same legislative language was offered as an amendment to the  Deborah Sampson bill in defiance of the House already expressing its  will on that bill.   I refute the contention that it was offered in good faith before we  brought Ms. Brownley's legislation on the Deborah Sampson Act in  committee.   The ranking member fails to mention that three of the amendments  related to antilabor legislation, which was hostile to labor. To say  that this was offered in good faith when he knows that the legislation  we were bringing forward was intended to be suspension legislation,  normally, the majority and the minority come to an agreement for a very  expeditious legislative hearing when it comes to suspension bills.   Finally, I will mention that I watched the ranking member try to  subvert the landmark H.R. 8, the universal background checks bill, by  raising this issue of the NICS list and trying to whip up opposition by  our veterans service organizations, so I have seen him act in a  different context against H.R. 8.   Why he sought in committee to attach legislation related to guns to a  women's health bill and to expanding opportunities for women veterans  to utilize fully the benefits they have earned, I cannot fully  comprehend that attempt.   I can say, in many instances, I responded to the ranking member's  requests to actually go outside of regular order for the minority's  benefit.   Let me say that I want to use this time now to yield 3 minutes the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley), the author of this truly  historic legislation, chairwoman of our Subcommittee on Health, and  also the author of the legislation.     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is the essence of bad faith to stand on  this floor and imply that Democrats do not want or care about the  safety of our children.   Let's be clear that the gentleman from Tennessee offered this as a  motion to recommit, this language, to Ms. Brownley's bill and then,  after fervently arguing why it was so necessary to be included in Ms.  Brownley's bill, turned around and voted with every other Member of  this Chamber for Ms. Brownley's bill. I cite that as evidence that  there are some crocodile tears being cried here.   I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Underwood), my good friend and a member of the House Veterans Affairs'  Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to hear that the ranking member  recommends to his colleagues and all Members of the House that they  support this excellent legislation by Representative Brownley.   The minority knew in committee that this was excellent legislation. I  am sorry to see that they chose procedural games to play politics with  an excellent piece of legislation that they now say they are  supporting, and I am very pleased that they are going to support this  legislation.   I urge my colleagues to pass this excellent bill. We worked hard to  put this legislation in the form that would be acceptable to all  Members of the House, and that is why we are moving this legislation  under suspension of the rules.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
