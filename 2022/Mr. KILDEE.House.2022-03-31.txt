 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Neal for his leadership on  the Ways and Means Committee in helping to bring this important  legislation to the floor.   Right now, families and seniors that I represent in Michigan, and all  across the country, are paying too much for prescription drugs, in  particular, for insulin. That is why Congresswoman Craig and  Congresswoman McBath and I have introduced the Affordable Insulin Now  Act to make insulin more accessible and more affordable.   This legislation would lower out-of-pocket costs for Americans with  diabetes by ensuring that insurers and Medicare can't charge more than  $35 a month out-of-pocket for this medication.   Insulin was discovered over 100 years ago. Since then, little about  this lifesaving medication has changed, but the price of insulin in the  United States has absolutely skyrocketed. As a result, Americans pay 10  times more for insulin than patients in other developed countries, and  one in four Americans who rely on insulin have cut back or skipped  their doses due to costs.   No one should have to choose between taking their medication as  prescribed and putting food on the table or a roof over their head.  People must make that choice because of Big Pharma's unfair pricing  practices. This is something I know a little bit about.   As a father of a type 1 diabetic, I have seen firsthand how the high  price of prescription drugs like insulin can harm patients and harm  families. When my daughter turned 26 and got her own health insurance,  there are months where she spends a third of her take-home pay, because  she is diabetic, on staying alive. She has her mom and I to back her,  but not everybody has that advantage. Either way, it doesn't make it  okay.   In Michigan, it is estimated that 1 in 10 people have some form of  diabetes. The average sticker price for a month's supply of insulin is  $375, but for some it can be as high as $1,000 a month, just because  they need to take more insulin. That is just not right.   Jill Verdier, a type 1 diabetic from my district, was my virtual  guest at the State of the Union this year. She told me that insulin is  like air to people with diabetes, they need it to survive.                                time  1500    At a time when Big Pharma is making record profits, Congress has to  do more to lower costs, out-of-pocket costs. And that is why I fought  to bring this bill to the floor with my colleagues, Representative  Craig and Representative McBath. I urge my colleagues to vote to pass  our legislation to lower costs. This is important legislation. I know  we need to invest in cures. Obviously we would like to see the total  price of insulin come down. But it is difficult to hear my colleagues  on the other side who oppose the legislation to bring down the cost  will also oppose this legislation to keep Americans from having to  spend more out of their pocket. I think this is legislation that makes  sense. It would help people. It would save lives.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), who is my colleague on the Ways and  Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), who is also a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Speaker, to my friend from Arizona, I appreciate  his passion. I wish it were true that he had somehow cured diabetes. It  would be great news for my daughter and so many other Americans who say  that they are looking for that cure. In the meantime, while we are  working to get there--and I appreciate the effort, I do, because I am  on board, I am completely on board with the notion that we ought to  cure this terrible disease--however, until that day comes, let's make  sure that the people who depend on insulin in order to stay alive can  live to see that day that I know he and I both are looking forward to.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell), who is my colleague from the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues' support of this  legislation. This is important legislation.   I will say this: I understand the points that have been made on the  other side. As a father of a type 1 diabetic, I am one of those many  millions of families that pay very close attention to the important  research that we think ultimately may lead to a cure for diabetes, so I  embrace the suggestion made on the other side that we have hope for a  cure. I have hope for a cure. Ever since my daughter was diagnosed, I  have been waiting for that moment, as she has, for that cure to appear.  If it is just outside our grasp, let's do everything we can to get  there.   But that is not what this legislation is intended to attack. It  doesn't mean we ignore that. It means we continue to push.   I have worked with my colleague on this side of the aisle,  Congresswoman DeGette, to try to do everything we can to find these  cures. But in the meantime, let's make sure that there is not a  diabetic who is standing at the pharmacy counter with lifesaving  medication just beyond their reach, not because it is unavailable but  because it is unaffordable to them.   I take the point that while this legislation doesn't do what we all  would like to do--and that is to reduce the overall cost of medication  through the way markets actually work, negotiation between a buyer and  a seller. I mean, that is the way the free market works. Let's let the  free market work and not have law that allows the seller to dictate to  us the price of a drug that can save lives and make huge profits while  there are people in a pharmacy reaching for a drug that they can't get  because the price is too high. This legislation will help save lives in  the immediate term.   I hope there is a day when Democrats and Republicans can come  together to establish policy that would allow negotiation on the  overall price of these lifesaving medications. That would be a  solution. We support it; you oppose it. In the meantime, let's do this  and save some lives.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
