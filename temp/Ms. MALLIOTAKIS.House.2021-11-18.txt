 Madam Speaker, I never thought in the United States  Congress--the home of the free, of the brave, of those taxpayers who  work hard every day and entrust us to spend their money wisely--that we  would see a spending bill of this magnitude that would saddle our  future children with debt.   The intrusion in this bill, the government control, the debt, the  taxes, the mandates and the disincentivizing of work and production  will continue to lead to more labor shortages, more supply chain  issues, and make things worse.    And what is even worse than all of that is the name of the bill, that  the people in this Congress are trying to fool the American people by  calling it a Build Back Better bill. It is a disaster.   When we talk about putting Americans first, what does this bill do at  a time when we have the worst crisis at the border? There is $100  billion going to amnesty and benefits for those who are entering the  country illegally, and this at a time when we are seeing a rise in  fentanyl deaths due to what's crossing over our border, child  trafficking, sex trafficking.   And then look at Big Brother, the government intrusion part of this  bill: doubling the number of IRS agents to go after Americans to spy on  their bank accounts.   This bill has crushing energy implications at a time when we are  seeing record increases on gas prices, on electricity, on heat, and we  are about to face the most expensive holiday season as a result.    Madam Speaker, in addition to that, there are the  taxes and the mandates.   Where are my moderate friends on the other side of the aisle who  committed to vote against this bill unless there was a CBO score?   They have been untruthful, and the American people will not forget  what is occurring here today.   Do not destroy the very country that my parents came to in order to  pursue the American Dream.
