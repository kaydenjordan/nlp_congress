 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment.   The registered apprenticeship system is one of America's most  successful Federal workforce programs and has created a pathway for  millions of Americans to achieve the American Dream.   With more than 600,000 apprenticeships nationwide, including more  than 6,000 in Colorado, apprenticeships provide workers with paid, on- the-job training, and more than 94 percent of apprentices have a job  after completing their program.   The National Apprenticeship Act would bring this successful program  into the 21st century by investing more than $3.5 billion annually and  creating 1 million new apprenticeships over the next 5 years.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment will ensure that we include educators in  this program. Across the country, there is a growing demand for  qualified teachers. Schools, particularly low-income schools, are  struggling to hire and retain qualified teachers.   In Colorado, we have a critical shortage of thousands of teachers.  Simply put, today, we can't even fully staff our classrooms. By  including teachers in the expansion of this program, we will help solve  this problem.   I grew up going to neighborhood public schools. I know the lasting  impact teachers can have on students. Without them, I wouldn't be  standing here today.   Investing in teachers and in our children should always be a top  priority, and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment in the  underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter of support from the  United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and  Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada.  [[Page H423]]           United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the             Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States             and Canada,                             Annapolis, Maryland, February 4, 2021.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 359,000       members of the United Association of Union Plumbers and       Pipefitters (UA), I write in support of H.R. 447, the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2021. As you know, the       Registered Apprenticeship programs of the UA and North       America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) are the gold       standard in the industry. This bill would protect that status       while also ensuring Registered Apprenticeships are more       accessible for all industries seeking a highly skilled       workforce.        The United Association is extremely proud of our Registered       Apprenticeship and training programs. We invest more than       $275 million of private money each year to ensure our members       are the best trained and most highly skilled workers in the       industry. Simply put, these programs produce the most highly       skilled workforce in the world at no cost to the American       taxpayer while also providing a fair wage, quality       healthcare, and retirement. We can all be proud of the       continued success of our training programs, resulting in       generations of the safest workplaces and highest standards in       the industry. This speaks not only to our high standards, but       also to the dedication of the men and women of our union.        The National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 will continue to       protect our high standards and ensure the safety of       apprentices across industries. In addition, it provides       apprentices with a debt-free ladder of opportunity to not       only build the skills needed for a job--but for a career. The       entire United Association is incredibly proud of our       Registered Apprenticeship program and we look forward to       seeing H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021,       signed into law.        Thank you for all you have done to protect the livelihoods       of the men and women in the construction industry. Our       training and apprenticeship programs are second to none, and       this bill will ensure the success and longevity of the       Registered Apprenticeship system. I urge swift consideration       and passage of this bill and look forward to working together       to strengthen protections for our members and the entire       labor community.      Respectfully yours,                                                      Mark McManus,                                                 General President.
