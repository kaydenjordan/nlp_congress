 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for his  tremendous leadership.   Mr. Speaker, the January 6 bipartisan commission will explore what  happened on that fateful day, why it happened, and how do we prevent  another violent insurrection and attack on the Capitol from ever  happening again.   In the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, America had a  bipartisan commission. In the aftermath of the September 11 attack,  America had a bipartisan commission. In the aftermath of the attack on  this Capitol on January 6, America should have a bipartisan commission.   The violent insurrection was an attack on the Congress, the  Constitution, and the Capitol. Lives were lost. More than 140 officers  were seriously injured. A violent mob stormed this building to  assassinate the Speaker, hang Mike Pence, and hunt down Members of  Congress. They urinated, defecated, and desecrated the citadel of our  democracy.   It was a violent attack designed to bring about one objective; halt  Congress from undertaking our constitutional responsibilities. And yet,  a few of my colleagues seem to want to convince America that it was all  puppies and rainbows. We will not be hoodwinked. We will not be  bamboozled. We will not be led astray.   The January 6 bipartisan commission will find the truth, the whole  truth, and nothing but the truth. And that is the American way.
