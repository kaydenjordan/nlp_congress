 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, 17 Christian  missionaries were taken hostage in Haiti.   I have spoken with their family members. To hear their story is  heartbreaking. These men and women went to Haiti because they felt  called to serve. They said: ``Here I am, Lord, send me.''   We cannot allow for Americans to be kidnapped abroad. When these  missionaries went to serve, they were met with violence. Attacks like  this prove that we must remain committed to the safety and the security  of Americans abroad. We must never capitulate to those who wish us  harm. Whether it is  [[Page H5644]]  in Haiti, in Afghanistan, or even on our southern border, Americans  must always be protected.   Now is the time to bring these American missionaries safely home. I  urge all of my colleagues to join with me in prayer for the safe return  of our missionaries.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma for hosting this Special Order this evening.   The reconciliation package that my colleagues are pushing for may  play well to focus groups in liberal cities, but in Pennsylvania, the  energy policies being introduced in this legislation would be a death  sentence for thousands of family-sustaining jobs.   It is clear that this administration is openly hostile to the energy  industries that are critical in our State and that provide the baseload  power that our Nation relies on.   At a time when gas prices just reached a 7-year high, this  legislation would create new taxes on the oil and natural gas  industries.   These regressive taxes would directly harm our middle-class citizens.  They would harm the rural Americans who have to drive further distances  and take longer commutes in order to get to work.   This administration claims these taxes would pay to support working  families. That is false.   In reality, these taxes would pay to enact radical policies like  creating green workforce tax credits that cost over $10 billion.   These taxes would pay to give kickbacks to liberal companies that  promote the false solutions offered by the Green New Deal energy  agenda.   Let's be clear: These taxes do not benefit the American people. This  administration is willing to raise taxes on working Americans for the  sake of their socialist energy policies.   This is not responsible government. It is not a government that is  working to improve the quality of life for all citizens.   It is disappointing to see the administration lying about what this  legislation does.   This bill would bankrupt our energy producers and send prices soaring  even higher.   This legislation would not help to build our economy, it would not  help to build our workforce, and it would not protect the American  energy consumers.   The truth is simple: We cannot afford this legislation. We must vote  against it.   I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for organizing this Special  Order.
