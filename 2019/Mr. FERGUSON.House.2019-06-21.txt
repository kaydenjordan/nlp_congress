 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent cannot be  entertained at this time, I encourage the Speaker and the majority  leader to schedule immediate time for consideration of the Born-Alive  bill so that we can stand up and protect the sanctity of life.
