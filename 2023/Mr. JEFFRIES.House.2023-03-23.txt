 Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished gentleman from the  great Commonwealth of Virginia for yielding and for his leadership.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 5, legislation  brought to us by the extreme MAGA Republicans that will put politics  over parents.   This legislation has nothing to do with parental involvement,  parental engagement, or parental empowerment. It has everything to do  with jamming the extreme MAGA Republican ideology down the throats of  the children and the parents of the United States of America.   Now, House Democrats believe that every single child should have  access to a high-quality, first-rate education.   House Democrats believe that every single child throughout America  should learn reading, writing, and arithmetic at the highest level  possible.   House Democrats believe that every single child should be exposed to  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics so that they have the  skills to succeed in the 21st century economy.   House Democrats believe that every single child in this great Nation  should have the opportunity to robustly pursue the American Dream.   House Democrats believe that the parents of this great country should  have the opportunity to be involved intimately and engaged intimately  in the education of their children.   We take a back seat to no one on this issue. In fact, we put  resources into making sure that parents have the opportunity to be  fully involved and engaged in the education of their children.    The other side of the aisle--the extreme MAGA Republicans--have, in  fact, voted against legislative efforts to empower parents in our  schools.   It is a deeply personal issue for all of us. I am the father of two  sons who were in public school every step of the way--kindergarten,  elementary school, middle school, high school--and parental involvement  and parental engagement is critically important. It was for their  journey, for their success, and we want that for every single parent in  America.   What we don't want is the extreme MAGA Republicans trying to tell the  parents of America how to educate their children, how to raise their  children, what books their children can or cannot be exposed to on  their educational journey. That is what the politics over parents bill  is all about.   Their educational agenda is pretty simple. They want to ban books.  They want to bully the LGBTQ+ community. They want to bring guns into  classrooms, kindergarten and above. That is their educational agenda.  They want to ban books about history, ban books about the American  journey, ban books about the Holocaust, ban books about slavery, ban  books about the civil rights movement, ban books about the LGBTQ+  experience, ban books about the Native American experience, ban books  about the Latino experience, ban books about the Asian-American  experience, ban books about our collective journey as a great country,  a gorgeous mosaic of people from all over the world who come here to  pursue the American Dream. That is what makes American exceptionalism  so phenomenally important to our collective success as a country, and  they want to take that away from the parents of America.   Because of what has happened in several States, they have already  banned more than 2,500 books in America, the highest number in recorded  history.   What kind of books have they banned? Are these books dangerous to the  education of our children? They are too numerous for any of us to go  through during the time that we have allotted for this debate, but  let's go through a few of them.                                time  1515    They want to ban a book called ``Maus.'' It is about the horrors of  the Holocaust, an egregious crime against humanity that we should never  ever forget--6 million Jews exterminated.   They want to ban ``Maus,'' a book about the Holocaust. What is so  offensive in that book? Let me read a passage. ``They took from us our  papers, our clothes, and our hair. We were cold, and we were afraid.''   Extreme MAGA Republicans don't want the children of America to learn  about the Holocaust.   What else do they want to ban? They want to ban the book called ``I  am Martin Luther King, Jr.'' There is a Federal holiday in honor of  Martin Luther King, Jr., what he meant to the country, the civil rights  movement, the march toward a more perfect Union, liberty and justice  for all, equal protection under the law, and free and fair elections.   They want to ban the book ``I am Martin Luther King, Jr.'' What is so  offensive about this book? Let me read a passage. ``In my life, people  tried to tell me I wasn't as good as they were, just because of the  color of my skin. When someone hurts you like that, it can be tempting  to hurt them back. You must refuse. When someone shows you hate, show  them love. When someone shows you violence, show them kindness.''   That is the book that they want to ban, ``I am Martin Luther King,  Jr.''   What else do they want to ban? They want to ban a book called  ``Melissa,'' a book describing, in very personal terms, the experience  of a trans girl beginning to understand her identity.  [[Page H1358]]    What is so dangerous about that? I was taught in my religion, growing  up in the Cornerstone Baptist Church, that we are all God's children.  Shouldn't we learn about all of God's children? That is what my  religion teaches me. What is so offensive about ``Melissa''? What is so  offensive about this book?   Let me read a passage. ``Her heart sank. She had genuinely started to  believe that if people could see her onstage as Charlotte, maybe they  would see that she was a girl offstage, too.''   Extreme MAGA Republicans don't want your child to learn about the  LGBTQ+ experience in America. That is not a decision that extreme MAGA  Republicans here in Congress should make. The parents of America should  be able to make that determination.   What else do the extreme MAGA Republicans want to ban? Now, I grew up  in America, where we were taught that whenever you were trying to  identify something with this great country, well, there is nothing more  American than baseball and apple pie. I am sure if we searched hard  enough, they want to ban something about apple pie, but today, we know  they definitively have tried to ban a book about baseball, about  Roberto Clemente, the first Latino baseball player to make it into the  Hall of Fame.   Why do they want to ban a book about Roberto Clemente? What are they  trying to hide from you? Let me read a passage from this book. ``He had  no money for a baseball bat, so he made one from a guava tree branch.  His first glove he also made, from the cloth of a coffee bean sack. His  first baseball field was muddy and crowded with palm trees.''   Isn't that part of what makes America such a great country, that you  can aspire to be part of what you see in front of you? In this case, it  was baseball for a young kid growing up in Puerto Rico--by the way,  part of America--who decides that he wants to be part of this great  American pastime.   The extreme MAGA Republicans want to stop your children from learning  about the Latino experience in America, even when it relates to  baseball and Roberto Clemente.   One last example--I could be up here all day. What else do they want  to ban? They want to ban a book called ``The Absolutely True Diary of a  Part-Time Indian,'' which is about a Native teenager's high school  experience.   What is more American than Native Americans? They don't want your  children to learn about Native American history and experience in this  country.   What is so dangerous about this particular book? Let's see. It says:  ``We Indians have lost everything. We lost our Native land; we lost our  languages; we lost our songs and dances. We lost each other. We only  know how to lose and be lost.''   That is part of the Native American experience in this country. That  is part of reality. That is part of our journey.   Extreme MAGA Republicans don't want the parents of this country to  have the opportunity to decide for themselves whether the children of  America should have an opportunity to learn about the Native American  experience. They want to jam their extreme MAGA Republican ideology  down the throats of the children and parents in America.   That is unacceptable; that is unconscionable; and that is un- American. That is one of the reasons why we strongly oppose this  legislation.   We will fight against this legislation. We will fight against the  banning of books and fight against the bullying of children from any  community and certainly from the LGBTQ+ community.   We are going to fight against your extreme MAGA Republican agenda  that has no interest in dealing with the education of our children,  empowering them, and offers up solutions like bringing guns into the  classroom.   We will fight against their efforts at banning books, bullying  children, and taking away the freedom of parents to make decisions on  their own today. We will fight against it tomorrow. We will fight  against it forever and always stand with the parents and children of  our great country.   Vote ``no'' against H.R. 5.
