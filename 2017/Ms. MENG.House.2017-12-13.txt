 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 6, line 3, strike ``and'' at the end.        Page 6, after line 3, insert the following new paragraph       (and redesignate the subsequent paragraph accordingly):        (7) an assessment of the impact and effectiveness of U.S.       economic sanctions programs against Iran; and    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 658, the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that I think  every Member of this body can support, no matter how they intend to  vote on final passage of H.R. 1638.   This amendment simply seeks to insert a single new requirement into  the report required by H.R. 1638, and that new requirement is as  follows: ``an assessment of the impact and effectiveness of U.S.  economic sanctions programs against Iran.''                                time  1615    Whether you voted for the Iran deal or against it, or whether you  think economic sanctions are an effective diplomatic tool or something  that sounds better than it is, I hope Members will support this  amendment.   We should make evidence-based policy decisions in this body, whenever  [[Page H9878]]  possible, and, toward that end, we should know whether or not the  sanctions that we pass here work.   If we are going to require a new report from the Treasury in this  bill, and that report must include ``a description of how Treasury  assesses the impact and effectiveness of U.S. economic sanctions  programs against Iran,'' I think it is only appropriate to ask for the  assessment itself; and that is what this amendment does.   Let me put it another way. Understanding how we count votes in  America is important, but at the end of an election, I want to know the  final tally. Who won? Who lost? What did we learn?   Similarly, I think it is important that if the Treasury is going to  have to produce a new report on sanctions against Iran pursuant to H.R.  1638, that we understand exactly how the Treasury intends to assess the  impact and effectiveness of those sanctions.   Even more importantly, though, I think this report should include the  results of that assessment, particularly when it comes to sanctions we  have authorized. That is all this amendment seeks to require, and I  hope everyone in this body will support it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Meng).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe  of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois,  Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the  Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the  bill (H.R. 1638) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a  report to the appropriate congressional committees on the estimated  total assets under direct or indirect control by certain senior Iranian  leaders and other figures, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to  House Resolution 658, he reported the bill back to the House with an  amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment  reported from the Committee of the Whole?   If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
