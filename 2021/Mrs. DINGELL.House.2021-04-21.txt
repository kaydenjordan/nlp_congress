 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  1333, the NO BAN Act.   This legislation prohibits discrimination based on religion and  limits the executive branch's ability to issue future travel bans.   I stand here today during Arab American Heritage Month, a time to  celebrate the diversity of our country and remind ourselves that our  country is stronger for it.   My district is home to the largest Arab-American population in the  United States. Arab Americans are an integral part of Michigan's  identity and have made enormous contributions to our society. Many of  my constituents fled war and violence to seek a safer life;--have done  it legally--and many of their families still experience this suffering  every day.   The former President's Muslim ban kept these families separated. It  inspired fear. It perpetuated hate. And as the Speaker so eloquently  stated, national security experts have made it clear that it has made  us less safe, not more safe.   I believe that every one of us in this Chamber loves our country, and  that it is a priority for all of us to keep this Nation safe.                                time  1345    I would argue that the actions by the previous administration did  not. The President called for a total ban on all Muslims entering this  country. We must work together against terrorism, both foreign and  domestic. We need to worry about what we witnessed in our own Chamber  on January 6.   This bill will not allow people to be targeted because of their  religion again. We must work together to restore the faith and trust of  the international communities targeted by the previous administration.   Madam Speaker, I urge people to support this legislation.
