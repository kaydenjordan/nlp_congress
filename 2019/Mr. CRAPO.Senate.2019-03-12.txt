 Madam President, I congratulate Steve Cannon, who  is retiring after a 42-year career in Idaho television.   Steve Cannon translated his deep interest in weather as a youth into  a longtime career. He retired this month from his position as  weatherman for KIDK Eyewitness News 3, which has coverage in my  hometown of Idaho Falls and the Pocatello area. He got his start in  front of the camera in 1977, when he went to work for the former KID TV  3, but he began his broadcasting career in radio, working for a radio  station in Rexburg. Leading up to his career in weather reporting,  Steve graduated from Idaho Falls High School, studied journalism at  Brigham Young University, served a mission in Great Britain, and  finished his degree at Idaho State University.   Steve's love for his profession and deep understanding and  appreciation for the people of eastern Idaho show in his thoughtful  reporting. He is known for his humor, relatability, dependability, and  strong work ethic. Steve has reported with agility and skill, as he has  navigated significant advancements in weather reporting over the past  four decades. Steve's weather reporting has shaped how countless  Idahoans have planned their days, and his attentive reporting has been  instrumental as he has reported on the major weather events that have  had considerable impacts on lives.   In addition to his career, Steve has given his time and talent in  support of service projects in the community. This includes his  assistance with the creation of the Idaho Falls Citizen's Watch Patrol  for the Idaho Falls Police Department.   I understand that Steve has looked forward to being able to dedicate  all his time to his family and loved ones during retirement that begins  as his wife also retires from teaching. I wish you both well, and thank  you for your outstanding work in our community.                            ____________________
