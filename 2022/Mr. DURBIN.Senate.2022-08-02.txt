 Mr. President, today, the Senate will consider another  highly qualified judicial nominee to the Federal bench. We will vote to  confirm Judge Elizabeth Hanes to the Eastern District of Virginia.   Judge Hanes currently serves as a U.S. magistrate judge in the  Eastern District of Virginia, a position to which she was appointed by  the current judges of the district court in 2020. She has already  issued 100 opinions during her time on the bench.   A lifelong Virginian, Judge Hanes has deep ties to the Eastern  District. She was born in Roanoke, VA, and attended the University of  Richmond and the University of Richmond School of Law. After  graduating, she clerked for Judge Joseph R. Goodwin on the U.S.  District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia and for Judge  Robert B. King on the Fourth Circuit.   Judge Hanes began her career in public service as an assistant  federal public defender in the Office of the Federal Public Defender  for the Eastern District of Virginia, a role she held for 7 years. She  then joined Consumer Litigation Associates in Richmond. Judge Hanes  gained significant trial experience during this time. And throughout  her time in legal practice, she represented indigent defendants in  criminal matters and low-income clients--including veterans--in civil  claims related to predatory lending practices.   Judge Hanes received a ``qualified'' rating from the American Bar  Association and has the strong support of Virginia's Senators, Mr.  Warner and Mr.  [[Page S3840]]  Kaine. With her depth of experience and proven commitment to equal  justice, Judge Hanes will continue to serve the Eastern District of  Virginia with distinction. And importantly, as a former public  defender, she will bring vital professional diversity to the Federal  bench.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this outstanding  nominee.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.    Madam President, this is my first day back in the Senate  since I contracted COVID last week. It is good to be back, particularly  for a historic week. I am grateful to the healthcare professionals and  brilliant scientists who developed the COVID vaccines and therapies so  quickly and am thankful for the Federal funding that made their work  possible. Luckily, I am double-vaxxed and double-boosted, and I  encourage everyone: Get your shots.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.
