 Mr. President, thank you for the recognition. It is good  to see you today.   I am going to be joined by a number of my Senate colleagues to talk  about reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. We have many  who are very concerned that we need to move this reauthorization, so  they will be joining me here today.   The first chart we are putting up here is of Hanna Harris, who is a  member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. Here she is with her son just  months before she was brutally murdered on the Northern Cheyenne  Reservation. Hanna was all of 21 years old, and her son was only 10  months old. We now honor Hanna and all murdered and indigenous women  and girls each year on Hanna's birthday, May 5, as a national day of  awareness.   It is fitting to remember and honor these women and girls, and it is  critical that we understand the magnitude of violence that Native women  face. Eighty-four percent of Native women have experienced violence in  their lifetime. That is four out of five. In some Tribal communities,  Native women are murdered at rates more than 10 times the national  average--10 times. One out of three Native women has been raped.   Behind these statistics are thousands of faces, thousands of lives  disrupted, shattered, and cut short--faces like that of Ashley Loring  Heavy Runner. This is a photo of Ashley. Ashley was an outgoing 20- year-old Native college student during the summer of 2017 when she went  missing on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana. Last December, I heard  firsthand about the devastating impact of Ashley's disappearance when  her sister, Kimberly Loring Heavy Runner, came before the Indian  Affairs Committee to ask Congress to take action. Kimberly told us:         We are going missing, we are being murdered. I am here to       stress to you . . . we are loved and we are missed. We will       no longer be . . . invisible people . . . we have worth.   [[Page S2672]]     That is Kimberly talking.   By the end of 2017, the FBI had identified 5,600 additional cases of  missing Native women and girls. This number is likely a very, very  severe undercount. This crisis is devastating Native families across  the country. It is unacceptable.   Just last week, the Senate passed a resolution remembering murdered  and missing indigenous women and girls, and I thank Senator Daines and  other Republicans for sponsoring this bipartisan resolution. Now we  must make good on those words. We must walk the walk. We must take  bipartisan action to end the cycle of violence, and we should start by  reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and strengthening  provisions to protect Native women.   I have been a strong proponent of VAWA from the beginning, and I  pushed hard for the law's passage in 1994 when I was New Mexico's  attorney general. But it became clear early on that VAWA's provisions  weren't reaching Tribal communities because of the Tribal  jurisdictional maze put in place by a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision.   In Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, the Court held that Indian  Tribes cannot exercise criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who  commit crimes on reservations. This ruling undermined the sovereign  right of Tribes to enforce the law on Tribal lands. It undercut public  safety in Indian Country, and it let violent offenders escape  prosecution.   An astounding number of violent crimes against Native women on  reservations are committed by non-Indians. According to the National  Institute of Justice, 97 percent of Native women who experience  violence in their lifetime have been victimized by non-Indian  perpetrators.   While Tribal authorities' hands were tied, Federal law enforcement  authorities weren't addressing these cases either. Investigations were  not pursued because the crimes took place in remote locations. Federal  prosecutors declined to prosecute cases. Crimes against Native women  and children were pushed to the back burner. The inability of Tribes to  protect their own members was an inexcusable hole in the law.   By the time the Senate took up VAWA reauthorization in 2012 and 2013,  we could no longer ignore Oliphant. We could no longer ignore that  Oliphant left Native women at risk. In the Senate, I fought to restore  Tribes' authority to provide for the safety of their members, and we  ultimately reinstated their authority to prosecute anyone who commits  domestic violence on a reservation through VAWA 2013. Since then, 18  Tribes have begun exercising jurisdiction over domestic violence  crimes. There have been 143 arrests of 128 violent offenders with 74  convictions to date. This is a real step in the right direction.   With time and experience, Tribes have seen there are still gaps that  must be closed to stop violence against Native women. Tribes have  identified four changes Congress must make to hold violent offenders  accountable.   First, Tribal jurisdiction under VAWA doesn't extend to domestic  violence against children. If a Native child is caught up in the  violence, as is too often the case, Tribal law enforcement can't  prosecute the offender. We have to change that.   Second, VAWA applies only to domestic violence. It doesn't apply to  general cases of sexual assault, sex trafficking, or stalking. Like  other types of violence, Native women face higher levels of sexual  violence than other women in the United States. In fact, of the Native  women who have experienced violence, 56 percent have experienced sexual  violence. Yet VAWA 2013 didn't cover the entire range of sexual  violence directed toward Native women. Congress must fix this.   Third, VAWA 2013 wasn't clear whether Tribes have jurisdiction over  attempted domestic violence. If a perpetrator swings at his spouse and  misses, there is no crime until the next time, when he lands a punch.  We must fix this loophole or Native women will continue to be at risk.   Finally, VAWA doesn't cover crimes committed against Tribal law  enforcement officers charged with responding to domestic violence. If  an officer is responding to a domestic violence case and he or she is  assaulted, they aren't covered under the law, so that needs to be  fixed.   Domestic violence calls, as all of us know, are some of the most  dangerous law enforcement responds to. Police officers, including  Tribal officers, are assaulted when responding to disturbance calls  more than in any other circumstance. Yet Tribes can't protect their own  officers. These gaps in VAWA undermine the very purpose of the law and  put children, women, and police officers at great risk. We must remedy  this.   Senators Murkowski, Smith, and I have introduced the Native Youth and  Tribal Officer Protection Act to ensure Tribes can exercise  jurisdiction to prosecute crimes against children and Tribal officers  and attempted domestic violence. The bipartisan bill is supported by 16  former U.S. attorneys appointed under Republican and Democratic  administrations and the Indian Law and Order Commission, a body of  Tribal public safety experts established under the bipartisan Tribal  Law and Order Act. We have also introduced the Justice for Native  Survivors of Sexual Violence Act, which makes sure that Tribes have  authority to prosecute sexual assault, sex trafficking, and stalking  crimes.   The House of Representatives already passed these measures last month  on a bipartisan basis as part of the Violence Against Women Act  Reauthorization of 2019. It is now our turn to take action. We cannot  allow this bill to be buried in the majority leader's so-called  legislative graveyard, not when women's lives are literally at stake.   Friends, we must all agree it is long past time to address violence  against women in Indian Country. I urge this body to reauthorize VAWA  and pass the Native Youth and Tribal Officer Protection Act and Justice  for Native Survivors Act. Let the families of Hanna and Ashley and  thousands of other missing and murdered Native women know that they are  not invisible, that they have worth, and that they deserve justice.   I mentioned earlier that 16 U.S. attorneys, both Republican and  Democratic, wrote to us about the Native Youth and Tribal Officer  Protection Act. They wrote very eloquently about what the situation is  that we face today. These are U.S. attorneys who prosecuted in States  that have Tribes. They were trying to do everything they could to bring  justice to these situations. Their letter of support for S. 2233, the  Native Youth and Tribal Officer Protection Act, reads of some of the  things here that I am going to quote, which, I think, make very, very  poignant points about why we should take up this legislation and pass  it immediately.   The Supreme Court's 1978 decision in Oliphant v. Suquamish severely  limits Tribal nations' ability to prosecute crimes committed against  Indians by non-Indians. Congress removed Federal limits on the inherent  authority of Tribal governments to prosecute the non-Indian domestic  violence offenders in the 2013 followup reauthorization.   Under current law, the Tribal justice system has arresting and  prosecuting authority over a non-Indian domestic violence offender, but  it has no recourse if that same offender commits a crime against the  responding Tribal public safety officer.   U.S. attorneys' offices with jurisdiction often decline to prosecute  a non-Indian who commits a violent crime on Tribal lands. The absence  of Tribal criminal jurisdiction over some non-Indian perpetrated crimes  and low Federal prosecution rates for those crimes contribute to the  high rates of violence against Native people, particularly women and  children who live on Tribal lands.   Due to the experiences of the letter's signatories--the 16 former  U.S. attorneys, Democratic and Republican--they say public interest,  safety, health, and welfare all support the concept that, if possible,  crimes committed on Tribal lands should be prosecuted by the presiding  Tribal government. These former U.S. attorneys support the goal of this  legislation--to restore Tribal jurisdiction over crimes that have been  committed against Tribal police officers and children citizens of the  Tribal nations.   The need for Tribal jurisdiction over crimes against Tribal law  enforcement is absolutely clear here. Under VAWA 2013 Tribal  jurisdiction, Tribes cannot  [[Page S2673]]  hold defendants accountable for violence against officers who are  enforcing the law. This leaves arresting officers, court bailiffs, and  corrections officers vulnerable. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians  is an example of the injustice here. It had one non-Indian defendant  who had hit and strangled his girlfriend and, while in jail, had  stricken the correctional officer who had been holding him after his  arrest. He had threatened to come back and--this is his language--shoot  up the reservation. The Tribe referred the assault and threat to  Federal prosecutors, who ultimately dismissed the charges.   If we pass this legislation that has come over to us from the House,  the Tribes in this circumstance would have the ability to step in and  do something about this. They don't have any option today. If they get  a declination, if there will be no action taken on the Federal side,  they will not have the ability to deal with crime and violence on their  reservation.   Let me talk a little bit about the need for Tribal jurisdiction over  crimes against children. Fifty-eight percent of incidents reported by  the implementing Tribes involve children. According to the Department  of Justice, Native children suffer exposure to violence at rates that  are higher than any other peer group in the United States. The Pascua  Yaqui Tribe, which was one of the first five Tribes to implement the  VAWA 2013 authority, identified at least 38 children involved as  witnesses and victims with its VAWA 2013 cases.   Clearly, when there is a domestic violence incident, one of the  things that needs to be done by law enforcement is with regard to a  woman's being assaulted in the presence of a child. You should allow  the prosecuting authorities to take that into consideration and make it  a part of the charge. With the law we have today, that is not allowed.  So children are not protected.   In another example, of the defendants and perpetrators who are known  violent and criminal offenders, many defendants had run-ins with Tribal  police for violence or criminal activity prior to getting arrested. For  example, the Tulalip Tribe in Washington reported that the 70  defendants it prosecuted by using its VAWA 2013 authority had had a  total of 171 contacts with Tribal police prior to their arrests. A  Tulalip Tribal member was assaulted and raped by the father of her  children--a non-Indian who had had 19 prior contacts with the Tribal  police. VAWA 2013 allowed the Tribe to arrest and successfully  prosecute the man.   This is a good example of how VAWA 2013 has worked, but in all of  these circumstances I have talked about, we need to demand it--whether  it is with a law enforcement officer who is assaulted in the course of  enforcing the law or whether it is with a child who is a part of the  circumstances that involve the prosecution.   I see that my good friend Senator Catherine Cortez Masto is here on  the floor. She is a very active member of the Indian Affairs Committee.  I know she cares passionately about these missing and murdered  indigenous women and children. I would ask to have a colloquy with  Senators who show up, but I will be here on the floor. So don't worry.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Cortez Masto for her talk  today. I can tell that she is very passionate about this issue. Both of  us were State attorneys general from Western States. We have  significant Native American populations, and we are very familiar with  the jurisdiction issue.   I have seen Senator Cortez Masto question many times in the committee  on the issue of jurisdiction. And what I am talking about there--you  have Tribal jurisdiction, and then you have Federal jurisdiction, and  many times there is some State jurisdiction. So when the Supreme Court  in 1978 came out with a ruling in the Oliphant case, they created a big  hole, and for almost 30 years, there was a zone that really wasn't  being prosecuted. Senator Cortez Masto is very familiar with this.  Because of that, we had kind of a situation in Indian Country where,  without enforcement, I think some of this violence grew.   I am sure that ever since Senator Cortez Masto has been in law  enforcement, she has seen this problem and advocated for changes to it,  and we have seen dramatic changes with VAWA 2013, which allowed  prosecution to take place. I don't know whether any of Senator Cortez  Masto's Tribes within Nevada took cases and initiated things, but I  think that across Indian Country, it is fair to say that there was  very, very extensive effort. I think there have been a number of  arrests--143, I think; 74 convictions--and things have really been  moving along.   Has that been your experience in terms of watching what has happened  both at the State level and the Federal level since 2013? Have we been  making some progress here?    Mr. President, thank you for the recognition. I just want  to say to my colleague from Minnesota that we very much appreciate her  efforts on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. She has been a great  member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. On all of these issues  that are so pressing, whether it is violence or the lack of education  or budgets that aren't adequate to support so many activities out in  Indian Country, she has just been a terrific advocate. I know that she  has followed this issue very closely in the years she has worked in  government.   One of the things that is really clear is we have given the Tribes an  opportunity--and I know Senator Smith knows this very well--to  undertake law enforcement in their communities as a result of VAWA  2013. Now is our chance to improve upon that, to lower the level of  violence in Native American communities.   I yield to the Senator to talk about what she has seen as a State- elected official--again, just as a citizen in Minnesota--to make sure  that laws that have been passed are working well and working better,  and there is a lot more we need to do.   I yield to Senator Smith from Minnesota.    Mr. President, one of the issues that has been highlighted  by the two very capable Senators who are here on the floor, Senator  Cortez Masto and Senator Smith, is that all of us--and I know that the  Presiding Officer from the State of Utah also has many Tribes. All of  us need to work in a very conscientious and deliberative way to try to  make sure that we are able to do everything we can to bring forward the  effort of the Federal Government to lower the violence level in Native  American communities. The thing I saw over and over again in the State  of New Mexico as I dealt with Tribes and then at the national level--I  worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office for several years as an assistant  U.S. attorney. I saw over and over again that we were unable to  prosecute some cases, but we were well aware that the Tribes, if they  were given the authority, would be able to move forward because they  were closer to the circumstances and would be able to do the job. That  is why it is so important that 16 former U.S. attorneys who have  jurisdiction across the United States--full jurisdictions of an area-- have stepped forward and said that they really feel that these pieces  of legislation that Senator Cortez Masto, Senator Smith, Senator  Klobuchar, and many others are sponsoring and that the House has  actually sent over to us are ready to go.   I see my good friend Senator Tester is here. The vote is going to  take place in a few minutes, so I am going to yield the floor so that  Senator Tester can speak on these very important issues. He is a great  member of the Committee, and I always enjoy hearing from him because he  is always right on point.   I yield the floor.    Take your time.
