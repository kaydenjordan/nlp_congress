 Madam President, later today, due to the threat of an  unprecedented partisan filibuster, I will file cloture on the  nomination of Judge Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme  Court. It should be unsettling to everyone that our colleagues across  the aisle have brought the Senate to this new low, and on such an  impressive nominee with such broad bipartisan support.   Judge Gorsuch is independent, he is fair, he has one of the most  impressive resumes we will ever see, and he has earned the highest  possible rating from the group the Democratic leader called the ``gold  standard'' for evaluating judicial nominations. No one seriously  disputes his sterling credentials to serve on the Court. Yet, in the  Judiciary Committee, Democrats withheld support from him. On the floor,  Democrats said they will launch a partisan filibuster against him-- something Republicans have never done. No one in the Senate Republican  conference has ever voted to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee. Not  one Republican has ever done that.   Later today, colleagues will continue to debate the nomination of  Judge Gorsuch. They will discuss how completely unprecedented it would  be for Democrats to actually follow through on this filibuster threat  to actually block an up-or-down vote for this nominee even though a  bipartisan majority of the Senate supports his nomination and what the  negative consequences would be for the Senate if they succeed. I will  be listening with interest. I hope Senators in both parties will listen  as well.   ``There has never been,'' as the New York Times and others reported  last week, ``a successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court  nominee.'' Never in the history of our country. Not once in the nearly  230-year history of the Senate.   The last time a Republican President nominated someone to the Supreme  Court, Democrats tried to filibuster him too. That was Samuel Alito in  2006. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed. Even former President Obama,  who as a Senator participated in that effort, now admits that he  regrets joining that filibuster effort.   Democrats are now being pushed by far-left interest groups into doing  something truly detrimental to this body and to our country. They seem  to be hurtling toward the abyss this time and trying to take the Senate  with them. They need to reconsider.   Perhaps they will recall their own words from the last time they  flirted with a partisan Supreme Court filibuster. Back then, the  current top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said she opposed  attempts to filibuster Supreme Court nominees. ``[Just because the  nominee] is a man I might disagree with,'' she said, ``that doesn't  mean he shouldn't be on the court.'' She said the filibuster should be  reserved for something truly outrageous.   Yesterday, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee announced her  intention to filibuster the Supreme Court nominee before us because she  disagreed with him. It is totally the opposite of what she said before.  It is just the kind of thing she said the filibuster should not be used  for.   This is emblematic of what we are seeing in Democrats' strained  rationale for their unprecedented filibuster threat. It seems they are  opposed to Judge Gorsuch's nomination because far-left interest groups  are upset about other things--the way the election turned out, mostly-- and threatening the careers of any Democrat who opposes blind  resistance to everything this President does.   Democrats have come up with all manner of excuses to justify opposing  this outstanding nominee. They asked for his personal opinions on  issues that could come before him and posed hypotheticals that they  know he is ethically precluded from answering. They cherry-picked a few  cases out of thousands in which he has participated. They invent fake  60-vote standards that fact checkers call bogus. They are, to  paraphrase the Judiciary  [[Page S2180]]  chairman, a ``no'' vote in search of a reason to vote that way. What  they can't lay a glove on is the nominee's record and independence--the  kinds of things that should actually be swaying our vote--and that is  really quite telling.   If Democrats follow through on their threat to subject this widely  respected judge to the first partisan filibuster in the history of the  Senate, then I doubt there is a single nominee from this President they  could ever support--ever. After all, the Democratic leader basically  said as much before the nomination was even made. But it is not too  late for our friends to do the right thing.   You know, we on this side of the aisle are no strangers to political  pressure. We can emphathize with what our Democratic colleagues might  be going through right now. But part of the job you sign up for here is  to do what you know is right in the end.   When President Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer, I voted to confirm  him. When President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader Ginsburg, I voted to  confirm her. I thought it was the right thing to do. After all, he won  the election. He was the President. The President gets to appoint  Supreme Court Justices. When President Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor  and Elena Kagan, I led my party in working to ensure they received an  up-or-down vote, not a filibuster.   We were in exactly the same position in which our Democratic friends  are today. No filibuster. No filibuster. We thought it was the right  thing to do. It is not because we harbored illusions that we would  usually agree with these nominees of Democratic Presidents--certainly  not. We even protested when then-Majority Leader Reid tried to file  cloture on the Kagan nomination. We talked him out of it and said it  wasn't necessary. Jeff Sessions, the current Attorney General, was the  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee at the time. Jeff Sessions  talked Harry Reid out of filing cloture because it wasn't necessary. We  didn't even want the pretext of the possibility of a filibuster on the  table.   Well, that is quite a different story from what we are seeing today,  but this is where our Democratic colleagues have taken us. Will a  partisan minority of the Senate really prevent the Senate's pro-Gorsuch  bipartisan majority from confirming him? Will they really subject this  eminently qualified nominee to the first successful partisan filibuster  in American history? Americans will be watching, history will be  watching, and the future of the Senate will hang on their choice.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Executive Calendar No. 33, the nomination of Neil Gorsuch  to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and  I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is pretty obvious, based on the  announcement Senators have made, that we are experiencing the first  partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in the history of the  country.   We have had plenty of time to discuss Judge Gorsuch and his  credentials both in committee and on the floor, and I think it is now  important to move forward.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have 9 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         committee on armed services    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, April 4, 2017, at 9:30 a.m., in open  session, to receive testimony on United States Strategic Command  Programs.               committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs    The Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is authorized to  meet during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, April 4, 2017 at 10  a.m. to vote on the nomination of Mr. Jay Clayton.                  committee on energy and natural resources    The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is authorized to  meet during the session of the Senate in order to hold a hearing on  Tuesday, April 4, 2017, at 10 a.m. in Room 366 of the Dirksen Senate  Office Building in Washington, DC.                        committee on foreign relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, April 4, 2017 at 10:15 a.m., to hold  a hearing entitled ``The European Union as a Partner Against Russian  Aggression: Sanctions, Security, Democratic Institutions, and the Way  Forward.''             committee on health, education, labor, and pensions    The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions is authorized  to meet, during the session of the Senate, to conduct a hearing  entitled ``FDA User Fee Agreements: Improving Medical Product  Regulation and Innovation for Patients, Part II'' on Tuesday, April 4,  2017, at 10 a.m., in room 430 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.           Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs    The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is  authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, April  4, 2017, at 9:30 a.m. in order to conduct a hearing titled ``Fencing  Along the Southwest Border.''                       Select Committee on Intelligence    The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is authorized to meet  during the session of the 115th Congress of the U.S. Senate on Tuesday,  April 4, 2017 from 2:15 p.m. in room SH-219 of the Senate Hart Office  Building.

The Committee will hold Subcommittee Hearing on ``Keeping Goods a  Moving: Continuing to Enhance Multimodal Freight Policy and  Infrastructure.''                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of and the  Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 94.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following resolutions,  which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 111, S. Res. 112, and S.  Res. 113.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the debate  time on the nomination of Judge Gorsuch during Wednesday's session of  the Senate be divided as follows: that following leader remarks the  time until 11 a.m. be equally divided; that the time from 11 a.m. until  12 noon be under the control of the majority; that the time from 12  noon until 1 p.m. be  [[Page S2221]]  under the control of the minority; further, that the debate time until  9 p.m. on Wednesday be divided in 1-hour alternating blocks.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, April 5; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume executive session to consider the nomination  of Neil Gorsuch as under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senators Rubio and  Merkley.    Mr. President, Neil Gorsuch is eminently qualified to  serve on the Supreme Court. He was confirmed by the Senate to his  Federal judgeship with no Democratic opposition at all--none. He  participated there in more than 2,700 cases, writing in the majority 99  percent of the time and enjoying unanimous support 97 percent of the  time.   He received the highest possible rating from a group the Democratic  leader called the ``gold standard'' for evaluating judicial  nominations--the American Bar Association. He has earned high praise  from across the political spectrum, with Democrats and Republicans  alike attesting to his qualifications, his fairness, and his  impartiality. He also enjoys the support of a bipartisan majority of  the Senate. Yet the Democratic leadership is now determined to block  his confirmation with the first successful partisan filibuster of a  Supreme Court nominee in American history. They proved that in  yesterday's procedural vote.   Judge Neil Gorsuch is one of the most impressive nominees we have  ever seen. If a widely appraised nominee like this can't get past a  Democratic filibuster, then no nominee of a Republican President can.  Democrats would filibuster Ruth Bader Ginsburg if President Trump  nominated her. We all know why. The Democrats are bowing to hard-left  special interests who can't get over the results of the election and  thus are demanding complete Democratic opposition to everything-- everything this President touches. As the Washington Post just  reported, the Democratic leader ``seemed ready to endorse every  argument activists made.''   It seems some Democrats made up their minds long ago to oppose  whomever this President nominated. The Democratic leader himself  indicated as much before Judge Gorsuch was even selected. He even mused  on a liberal talk show about holding the seat open indefinitely. So it  doesn't really matter whom this President nominates; a Democratic  minority is determined to successfully launch an unprecedented partisan  filibuster regardless. Perhaps that is why Democrats still have yet to  put forward a cogent rationale to oppose him--not that that would be  easy, you understand.   As a longtime Democratic board member of the left-leaning American  Constitution Society put it, ``The Senate should confirm [Judge  Gorsuch] because there is no principled reason to vote no.''   Well, if there is no principled reason to vote no on this nomination,  then there is certainly no principled reason to prevent the Senate from  taking a vote on it at all. But that is just what a partisan Democratic  minority of the Senate is threatening to do--for the first time in the  nearly 230-year history of the Senate.   Let me remind colleagues of something I said yesterday. When  President Clinton nominated Justice Ginsburg, I voted to confirm her.  When President Clinton nominated Justice Breyer, I voted to confirm  him. When President Obama nominated Justice Sotomayor and Justice  Kagan, I led my party in  [[Page S2304]]  working to ensure that they received an up-or-down vote--in other  words, not a filibuster. I knew I would often disagree with their  opinions on the Court, and I certainly wasn't wrong about that, but I  thought it was the right thing to do.   I understand that our Democratic colleagues are currently under a  great deal of pressure from special interests on the far left. I think  everyone in elected office can empathize with this situation they are  experiencing. Listening to these hard-left special interests may seem  like the politically expedient thing for Democrats to do for their  party today, but I would ask them to make their decision based on what  they know is right for the country tomorrow.   There is still time for them to make the right choice. There is still  time for them to support a nominee who even longtime Democrats have  praised--or, at the very least, to not block him with the first  successful partisan filibuster in American history.   So I hope Democrats reevaluate their position before the important  vote we will take tomorrow. I hope they will consider what their  actions would mean for future Supreme Court confirmations. I hope they  will consider what their actions could mean for the future of this body  more broadly, too, because, as we all know, the American people will be  watching. History will record the decision Democrats make, and there is  simply no principled reason to oppose this exceptional Supreme Court  nominee.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Monday, April 24, the Senate proceed to executive  session for consideration of Calendar No. 31, the nomination of Sonny  Perdue to be Secretary of Agriculture. I further ask that the time  until 5:30 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form and that at 5:30  p.m., the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening action or  debate, and that if confirmed, the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I wish to recognize that, 228 years ago  this week, Congress achieved its first quorum. The House of  Representatives attained its quorum on April 1, 1789, and the Senate  reached that goal on April 6, 1789. The Association of Centers for the  Study of Congress celebrates this anniversary by observing Congress  Week, an annual weeklong event that highlights the resources available  for the study of Congress and features commemorative events at member  institutions across the country.   The Association of Centers for the Study of Congress is composed of  more than 40 universities and historical societies, including the  McConnell Center at the University of Louisville, that work to preserve  the historical collections of Members of Congress and encourage their  use for educational purposes. The organization's goal is to promote  public understanding of the legislative process by focusing on the  history of the Senate and the House representatives and Congress's role  in our constitutional system of government.   Congress Week is designed to spark a closer examination of the first  branch of government, to encourage schools to develop programs to  highlight the work of Congress, and to stimulate more scholarly  research into Congress and its history.   Emphasizing the historical importance of Members' records, H. Con.  Res. 307 was passed unanimously in 2008. This resolution recommends  that Members' records be properly maintained, that each Member take all  necessary measures to manage and preserve them, that they arrange for  the deposit or donation of their records with a research institution  that is properly equipped to care for them, and that they make them  available for educational purposes at an appropriate time. Members of  Congress are responsible for preserving their own records of public  service.   Members' collections are essential for public understanding of the  vital role that Congress plays in our democracy. As primary source  materials, they contain the most authentic record of cause and effect  of what happened and why. Their study leads to greater understanding of  the issues we have faced and how they were resolved.   As Senate majority leader, I encourage my colleagues to follow the  advice of H. Con. Res. 307, to preserve the records of your service,  both paper and digital, so that the full history of the Senate may be  appreciated and understood. Last year, when we observed Congress Week  2016, our President pro tempore, Senator Hatch, stated ``Serving as a  member of the world's greatest deliberative body is no small honor; it  is a tremendous privilege that none of us should take for granted. The  American people have placed their confidence in our ability to effect  meaningful change for the good of the country. May we honor this sacred  trust by keeping detailed archives of the work we do here.''   I join my esteemed colleague in that sentiment and also ask my  colleagues to preserve their archival legacy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate has considered the  nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for many weeks now. We have seen his  impressive credentials. We have reviewed his incredible record. We have  heard glowing praise on a nearly daily basis from colleagues and  students, from judges and newspaper editorials, from Democrats and from  Republicans.   Judge Gorsuch is independent, and he is fair. He is beyond qualified,  and he will make a stellar addition to the Supreme Court.   Hardly anyone in the legal community seems to argue otherwise, and  yet, our Democratic colleagues appear poised to block this incredible  nominee with the first successful partisan filibuster in American  history. It would be a radical move, something completely unprecedented  in the history of our Senate and out of all proportion to the eminently  qualified judge who is actually before us. But then again, this isn't  really about the nominee anyway. The opposition to this particular  nominee is more about the man who nominated him and the party he  represents than the nominee himself. It is part of a much larger story,  another extreme escalation in the left's never-ending drive to  politicize the courts and the confirmation process.   It is a fight they have waged for decades with a singular aim:  securing raw power, no matter the cost to country or institution. It  underlies why this threatening filibuster cannot be allowed to succeed  or continue--for the sake of the Senate, for the sake of the Court, and  for the sake of our country.   I think a look back through history will help every colleague  understand why. I always had a particular interest in the history of  judicial nominations. It is an interest that predates my service here  as a Senator. I remember serving on the staff of a Senator on the  Judiciary Committee during a time when two different judicial nominees  were being considered. One, Harrold Carswell, was voted down on the  Senate floor--correctly, in my view. Another, Clement Haynesworth, also  failed to receive the necessary support for confirmation--but in error,  I thought.   It piqued my interest on what advice and consent should mean in the  Senate, and what it actually meant in practice. I would learn later  that I was witnessing the nascent stirrings of what would soon become  the so-called judicial wars--the left's efforts to transform  confirmations from constructive debates over qualifications into raw  ideological struggles with no rules or limits.   It is a struggle that escalated in earnest when Democrats and  leftwing special interests decided to wage war on President Reagan's  nominee in 1987, Robert Bork. Polite comity went out the window as  Democrats launched one vicious personal attack after another--not  because Bork lacked qualifications or suffered some ethical failing,  but because his views were not theirs. The Washington Post described it  at the  [[Page S2384]]  time: ``It's not just that there has been an intellectual vulgarization  and personal savagery to elements of the attack, profoundly distorting  the record and the nature of the man.''    As NPR would later observe, the left's ``all-out campaign to defeat  the nomination . . . legitimized scorched-earth ideological wars over  nominations at the Supreme Court.''   I was there. I saw it all. I remember the viciousness of it. I also  remember feeling that the Senate was reaching a turning point where a  judicial nominee would no longer be evaluated on their credentials but  on their ideology. That observation, unfortunately, has proven correct,  with Democrats raising the stakes and moving the goalposts each step of  the way.   They certainly did so under the next Republican President, George  H.W. Bush. We all know what happened to Clarence Thomas. If the gloves  were off for Bork, the brass knuckles came out for Thomas. Here is how  left-leaning columnist Juan Williams described the situation: ``To  listen or read some news reports on Thomas over the past month is to  discover a monster of a man, totally unlike the human being full of  sincerity, confusion, and struggles whom I saw as a reporter who  watched him for some 10 years.''   That is Juan Williams speaking on Clarence Thomas. Williams said:         He has been conveniently transformed into a monster about       whom it is fair to say anything, to whom it is fair to do       anything.    By the time Bill Clinton won the Presidency, ``Bork'' had become a  verb and ``high-tech lynching'' was on the lips of the Nation. Wounds  were fresh and deep when this Democratic President had the chance to  name two Justices of his own to the Court.   Republicans could have responded in kind to these nominees, but that  is not what happened. When President Clinton nominated Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, the Senate confirmed her 96 to 3. When President Clinton  nominated Stephen Breyer, the Senate confirmed him 87 to 9. I, like the  vast majority of Republicans, voted for both of them. We did so in full  knowledge of the considerable ideological differences between these  nominees and ourselves. Ginsburg, in particular, had expressed notably  extreme views--even advocating for the abolition of Mother's Day. A  nominee for the Supreme Court who advocated the abolition of Mother's  Day was confirmed 96 to 3.   Could we have Borked these nominees? Could we have tried to  filibuster them? Sure, but we didn't.   We resisted the calls for retribution and did our level best to halt  the Senate's slide after the Bork and Thomas episodes. We respected the  Senate's tradition against filibustering Supreme Court nominees.   Now, the tradition not to filibuster extended beyond just the Supreme  Court. When President Clinton named two highly controversial nominees  from California to the Ninth Circuit, some on my side wanted to defeat  their nominations with a filibuster. The Republican leadership said:  Let's not do that. To their great credit, Majority Leader Lott and  Judiciary Chairman Hatch implored our confidence not to do that.  Senator Lott filed cloture on these nominees to advance the nomination.  He, Senator Hatch, and I and a vast majority of the Republican  Conference voted for cloture to give them an up-or-down vote. We didn't  do this because we supported the nominees. In fact, most of us voted  against their actual confirmation, but we thought they deserved an up- or-down vote. That, after all, was the tradition of the Senate.   Given that we were in the majority and these nominations were highly  controversial, our determination not to filibuster but instead advance  them to an up-or-down vote was not, as you might imagine, popular with  our base. But we resisted the political pressure. Again, we respected  the Senate's tradition against filibustering judicial nominees.   But it would matter little to our Democratic friends.   Less than a year later, President Bush 43 comes to office. Before he  had submitted a single judicial nominee, our Democratic colleagues held  a retreat in Farmington, PA. There, according to participants, they  determined to change the ground rules for how they would handle  judicial nominees.   As the New York Times reported, Democrats apparently decided ``there  was no obligation to confirm someone just because they are scholarly.''  Our friend the Democratic leader said at the time that what he and his  colleagues were ``trying to do was set the stage'' for yet another  escalation in the left's judicial wars.   Senate Democrats soon became the majority in the Senate due to then- Senator Jeffords' party switch. To help implement the imperative from  their retreat ``to change the ground rules,'' the current Democratic  leader used his position on the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing  on whether ideology should matter in the confirmation process.   Now, it won't surprise you that the conclusion he and his colleagues  reached was that it should. So they killed in committee, either through  inaction or via committee vote, qualified judicial nominees who did not  fit their preferred ideology. I know, because I was on the committee  then. Eighteen months later, our Democratic colleagues lost control of  the Senate, and, therefore, control of the Judiciary Committee. Our  colleague, the current Democrat leader, again took center stage.   The New York Times noted that ``over the last two years, Mr. Schumer  has used almost every maneuver available to a Senate Judiciary  Committee member to block the appointment'' of the Bush administration  judicial nominees. Then, in 2003, according to the New York Times, he  ``recommended using an extreme tactic, the filibuster,'' to block them.   ``Mr. Schumer,'' it said, ``urged Democratic colleagues in the Senate  to use a tactic that some were initially reluctant to pursue, and that  has roiled the Senate: a filibuster on the floor of the chamber to  block votes on nominees that he and other Democrats had decided to  oppose.''   It is hard to express how radical a move that was at that time  because it completely changed the way the Senate had handled these  nominations for our entire history. Even filing cloture on a judicial  nominee had been rare before then, and actually defeating any judicial  nominee by filibuster, other than the bipartisan opposition to the  nomination of Abe Fortas back in 1968, in a Presidential election year  was simply unheard of.   No longer.   Democrats blocked cloture 21 times on 10 different circuit court  nominees, including on outstanding lawyers like Miguel Estrada, whose  nomination was filibustered an incredible 7 times.   These are not inflated statistics like the supposed 78 filibusters  our Democratic colleagues are now alleging occurred during the Obama  administration, which include numerous instances in which the prior  Democratic leader unnecessarily filed cloture petitions. No, what I am  talking about are real and repeated filibusters used by Democrats to  defeat nominations.   In the face of this wholly unprecedented change in the norms and  traditions of the Senate, we Republicans contemplated using the nuclear  option. We decided against it. Fourteen colleagues--three of whom still  serve in this body--reached an accord whereby filibusters would be  overcome for 5 of the 10 nominees in question. Regretfully, Miguel  Estrada was not one of them. He had withdrawn his nomination after  being put through an unprecedented ordeal.   Yet, the ink was barely dry on the accord I mentioned when Senate  Democrats, led, in part, by our friend the Democratic leader, again did  something exceedingly rare in the nominations process: They tried to  filibuster Samuel Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. No member of  the Republican Conference, by the way, has ever voted to filibuster a  Supreme Court nominee--ever. Nobody on this side of the aisle has ever  done that.   Again, it would have been easy for Republicans to have retaliated  when President Obama took office, but just like under Clinton, that is  not what happened. How did we treat Obama's lower court nominees?   At the time, our Democratic colleagues decided to ``fill up the DC  Circuit one way or the other,'' as the Democratic leader put it. Senate  Republicans had defeated a grand total of two of President Obama's  judicial nominees. At the time that they decided to employ the nuclear  option and  [[Page S2385]]  fill up the DC Circuit, Senate Republicans had confirmed 215 Obama  judges and had defeated just 2.   So our Democratic colleagues' decision to employ the nuclear option  in 2013 was not in response to rampant obstruction but was, in the  words of the Washington Post, a ``power play.'' By the way, at the  time, I don't recall the Democratic leader or any other of our  Democratic colleagues repeating the refrain: If there are not 60 votes  for a nominee, you don't change the rules; you change the nominee.   They were not saying that then.   What did they do? They changed the rules. It was a power play, but it  was also something else. It was a tacit admission by our Democratic  colleagues that the Senate tradition of up-or-down votes of judicial  nominees that they had first upset back in 2003 by starting the  practice of filibustering judicial nominees was a tradition they should  have respected. Unfortunately, it took them 10 years to realize this  and only after they captured the White House and only after Republicans  also used, on a smaller scale, the tool that they, themselves,  inaugurated a decade earlier.   And how did we treat President Obama's Supreme Court nominees? Did we  try to filibuster them like our Democratic colleagues tried with  Justice Alito? Of course not.   When President Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, we  treated both nominees fairly, as they would later say themselves, and  we secured an up-or-down vote for both. Most Republicans had  significant misgivings about these nominees. Many of us voted no on the  confirmations, but we did not think it would be right to deny them up- or-down votes.   I and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee at the time, Jeff  Sessions, even protested when then-Democratic Leader Reid tried to file  cloture on the Kagan nomination because we were determined to prevent  even the hint of a filibuster. Again, we respected the Senate's  tradition against filibustering Supreme Court nominees.   I know our friends on the Democratic side will be quick to interject  with a predictable protest about last year, though they seem to forget  their own position on the issue. When Justice Scalia passed away, the  Senate chose to follow a standard that was first set forth by then- Senator Biden, when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and  then was expanded upon by the current Democratic leader, himself. The  Senate exercised its constitutional advice and consent role by  withholding its consent until after the election so that the next  President, regardless of party, could select a nominee. It is a  standard I held to even when it seemed inevitable that our next  President was going to be Hillary Clinton. It is also a standard that  President Obama's own legal counsel admitted that Democrats would have  followed themselves had the shoe been on the other foot.   The majority of the Senate expressed itself then by withholding  consent.   The majority of the Senate wishes now to express itself by providing  consent to Judge Gorsuch.   The bipartisan majority that supports him cannot do so if a partisan  minority filibusters. They are prepared to do so for the first time in  American history, and the Democratic leader has mused openly about  holding this seat vacant for an entire Presidential term.   We will not allow their latest unprecedented act on judicial  nominations to take hold. This will be the first and last partisan  filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination.   All of this history matters. I know the Democratic leader would  rather not revisit the circumstances that brought us to this moment. I  know the Democratic leader would rather not talk about it. Of course,  he doesn't want to talk about it. He and his party decided to change  the ground rules for handling judicial nominations.   He and his party pioneered the practice of filibustering lower court  judicial nominees. He and his party launched the first partisan  filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. He and his party deployed the  nuclear option in 2013. Now they are threatening to do something else  that has never been done in the history of the Senate: successfully  filibuster a Supreme Court nominee on a purely partisan basis.   For what reason--because he is not qualified or because he is not fit  for the job? No, it is because he was nominated by a Republican  President.   This is the latest escalation in the left's never-ending judicial  war--the most audacious yet. It cannot and it will not stand.   There cannot be two sets of standards--one for the nominees of  Democratic Presidents and another for the nominee of a Republican  President. The Democratic leader, essentially, claimed yesterday that  Democratic Presidents nominate Justices who are near the mainstream but  that Republican Presidents nominate Justices who are far outside the  mainstream.   In what universe are we talking about here?   I would say to my friend from New York that few outside of Manhattan  or San Francisco believe that Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in the mainstream  but that Neil Gorsuch is not.   To quote a long-time Democrat and member of the left-leaning American  Constitution Society, there is simply no principled reason--none--to  vote no on Judge Gorsuch's nomination, even less of one to block that  vote from occurring at all.   Let me say this to my Democratic colleagues: If you truly cannot  support the nomination of this eminently qualified nominee, then at  least allow the bipartisan majority of the Senate who supports Gorsuch  to take an up-or-down vote. You already deployed the nuclear option in  2013. Do not trigger it again in 2017.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I  ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, our Democratic colleagues have done  something today that is unprecedented in the history of the Senate.  Unfortunately, it has brought us to this point. We need to restore the  norms and traditions of the Senate and get past this unprecedented  partisan filibuster.   Therefore, I raise a point of order that the vote on cloture, under  the precedent set on November 21, 2013, is a majority vote for all  nominations.    Madam President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.   The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 52, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 109 Ex.]                                  YEAS--48       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Donnelly      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Franken      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Heitkamp      Hirono      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      McCaskill      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Nelson      Peters      Reed      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                                  NAYS--52       Alexander      Barrasso      Blunt      Boozman      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cochran      Collins      Corker      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Flake      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hatch      Heller      Hoeven      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      McCain      McConnell      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott      Shelby      Strange      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The decision of the Chair does not stand  as the judgment of the Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today it is my privilege to celebrate  the retirement of Frey Todd, the ``Mayor for Life'' of Eubank, KY.   In the last census, Eubank was home to fewer than 400 Kentuckians,  but despite their small number, the Eubank community is proud of their  town and their mayor.   Since the 1960s, Todd has served his community on the town board. He  spent 10 years as the chair of the board, and when Kentucky reorganized  municipal governments in 1982 and the position of mayor became  available, he proudly was elected its first mayor. And every 4 years  since, Todd has been elected by his constituents to be their mayor.   Over his 35-year tenure as mayor, Todd has overseen major projects  like the construction of the senior citizens center and the Eubank  Water System.   In a small town like Eubank, the people and their government are  almost as close as family. Throughout his entire career, Mayor Todd has  shown his passion for his constituents, and they have returned the  affection.   At the age of 82, Todd announced his retirement from public service.  I would like to join with all the people of Eubank to thank him for his  years of dedication and congratulate him on an impressive career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  leader remarks on Friday, April 7, and notwithstanding rule XXII, there  be 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form; further, that  upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the Gorsuch  nomination with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Friday, April 7; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume executive session to consider the  nomination of Neil Gorsuch, as under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:05 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, April 7, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.                            ____________________
