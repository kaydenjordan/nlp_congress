 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship.   Our relationship with Israel is a mutually beneficial partnership  that not only reinforces America's moral values and strategic  interests, but also promotes peace and stability.   The U.S.-Israel relationship is truly the embodiment of peace through  strength. Having served 10 years in the U.S. military, I know how  volatile this region is and understand that a key element of our own  national security is the strength and security of Israel, the only  democracy in the Middle East.   Our two nations face many of the same terrorist threats, the only  difference being that Israel is surrounded by hostile regional actors.  As malicious regimes like Iran continue their quest for nuclear  capabilities, it is imperative that America does not waver in our  commitment to strengthen Israel's ability to defend itself.   In a world that grows more dangerous by the day, weakening our allies  would have disastrous consequences for the security of our country and  threaten the possibility of world peace.   I remain steadfast in my support for Israel and look forward to  helping advance U.S.-Israel defense cooperation here in Congress.                            ____________________
