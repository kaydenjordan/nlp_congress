 Mr. Chair, I thank Madam Chair for yielding.  Indeed, I am a strong supporter of the Bank and I am also a strong  supporter of the chairwoman.   I support this legislation because the Export Bank is not a  traditional bank. Traditional banks take deposits. The Ex-Im Bank makes  deposits.   Over the last 10 years, it has deposited 1.5 million jobs, American  jobs; over the last 10 years, $3.4 billion in the U.S. Treasury; over  the last 10 years, $255 billion to those who are exporting by way of  financing these exports.   In the way of jobs, if we look at the State of Texas, we can see that  from 2014 to 2019, it has assisted 91 minority-owned businesses, 14  percent of which are in my district; 467 small business exporters; 55  women-owned exporters. A total of 810 businesses have benefited from  the Ex-Im Bank.   If you like diversity, you will love the Ex-Im Bank. It has within it  an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion. It will have an Office of  Territorial Exporting to help Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.  territories.   I support the Ex-Im Bank because it not only makes good sense, it  makes good dollars and cents.   This is a bill that we should support. If we didn't have the Ex-Im  Bank, we  [[Page H8849]]  would invent it. Why reinvent the wheel when we have something that can  roll out right now?   Mr. Chair, I support this bill.
