 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 529 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 529         Resolved, That House Resolution 503 is hereby re-referred       to the Committee on Homeland Security, and in addition to the       Committee on the Judiciary.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee reported a rule  to refer H. Res. 503 to the Committees on Homeland Security and the  Judiciary. H. Res. 503 lays out articles of impeachment against  President Joe Biden for his failure to secure the southern border of  the United States.   We do a lot of things in this body, and we say a lot of things--I  certainly do--about our beliefs and about what we think is happening to  our country. What we are talking about here is, indeed, solemn. We are,  in fact, talking about the mechanism provided by the Founders in the  Constitution of the United States to check and hold the executive  branch responsible.   The border crisis that we are experiencing today is extremely  significant for the people in my home State of Texas. It is significant  not just for Texas, of course, but for the entire country--but, in  particular, for the people in my home State of Texas.   Since President Biden took office, there have been well over 5  million illegal migrant encounters along the southwest border. More  than 204,000 illegal immigrants were encountered at the border in May  alone. Those numbers are changing post-relaxing enforcement of title  42.   Mr. Speaker, 2 million aliens have been released into the interior of  the United States, and 1.5 million, probably 1.7 million, maybe 2  million now, got-aways have successfully evaded border agents, by  relatively conservative accounting.  [[Page H3078]]    Most concerning right now is the data we have shows that 125  individuals from the terrorist watch list have been encountered this  fiscal year alone, and that compares to about 98 in all of last fiscal  year and about 10 in the last year of the Trump administration.   The fact is, the people I represent are sick and tired of a Federal  Government that is abdicating its fundamental duty to defend the border  of the United States. That is what is happening.   The Federal Government exists primarily, borderline entirely, but  certainly primarily, to defend the United States. That is why it  exists. It is failing to do so not through maladministration, not  through incompetence, but through dereliction of duty and a refusal to  actually follow the laws of the United States.   The laws of the United States are there, expressly and specifically  laid out, to ensure that our border will be protected, that our Nation  will be secure. That is the fundamental question before us. When the  executive branch fails to follow the law, when the executive branch  fails to adhere to its duty to defend the Constitution and the laws of  the United States, then what is it that the Congress, the people's  House, is supposed to do in response?   The Founders gave us a mechanism. Here today, we are talking about  putting forward and referring these articles to the Homeland Security  Committee for determination of the extent to which the homeland is, in  fact, not secure as a direct consequence of the refusal of the  administration, well beyond maladministration but very specifically the  refusal to follow the laws of the United States that is resulting in  the direct consequence of the death and damage to the American people.   That is the truth. That is what we are experiencing. That is what we  are experiencing in real time in Texas. My colleagues in Arizona, my  colleagues throughout this entire country, are experiencing that in  real time.   Just a few weeks ago, a Federal judge in the Northern District of  Texas, Judge Reed O'Connor, issued an opinion, an order, and in it, he  lays out: ``Defendants, illegal aliens, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to  transport and harbor illegal aliens. The sentencing information shows  that on behalf of the Juarez cartel, defendants participated in an  alien smuggling conspiracy. . . . The smuggling organization charged  $10,000 to smuggle an adult illegal alien into the United States and  between $12,000 to $14,000 to smuggle a child illegal alien.''   It goes on to lay out how they discovered that there was an illegal  alien in Baltimore who was being held for ransom so that his family  wouldn't be abused by the Juarez cartel in a stash house in Fort Worth.   The members told the husband that they would do things to his  daughter he would not like if he did not make this payment of $23,000,  which he had not bargained for.   This is the state of affairs in our country. This is the consequence  to those migrants who are seeking to come here, when my colleagues in  the false name of compassion state that open borders are somehow good  for them. This is causing crime to extend into our communities. This is  causing us to experience the dangerous hand of cartels.   Just this morning, we had more news about cartels and their reach  into Texas, into the United States. It is an everyday occurrence:  bailouts, damage to ranches, harm to Texans, death to Texans, fentanyl.  How many more fentanyl moms, how many more angel moms, how many more  Americans need suffer because this President refuses to follow the laws  of the United States that he raised his hand and swore an oath to  defend?   That is why we are here, and that is why I support the resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just note that this morning Texas DPS  troopers arrested a Gulf cartel operative in the Rio Grande Valley  smuggling people across the river. After having been paid thousands of  dollars, they were moving five illegal immigrants into the United  States.   This is somebody that had been affiliated with a dangerous cartel. It  is happening every day in the State of Texas because this  administration refuses to do its job.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs.  Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, I am moved by the references to solemnity after  the chanting on the floor of the House yesterday for 5 minutes  disrupting the Speaker of the House from carrying out his duties. I  find it extremely moving.   I am also moved by the references to how we have not passed  legislation, despite the fact that we passed H.R. 2, the most impactful  border security legislation that has been moved off the floor of the  House, without a single Democrat vote because they are ignoring what  the administration is doing to the State of Texas, to migrants, and to  the security of our country.   I am moved by the concerns for climate change which I am sure will  assuage the angel moms and the fentanyl moms who have lost loved ones  and the 72,000 Americans dead from fentanyl because my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle and the President of the United States  refuse to secure the border.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Crane).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Biggs), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Ogles), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Mills), my friend and an Army veteran.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We are here today not actually talking about the botched exit from  Afghanistan that my friend from Florida rightly raises as a massive  criticism of this administration, nor the Biden crime family syndicate  that we are now dealing with with the son of the President of the  United States. Nor are we dealing with the weaponization of government  against the American people, including Scott Smith in Loudoun County  for daring to stand up in defense of his daughter. Nor are we talking  about energy production getting killed, leaving people stranded with  high inflation and the inability to afford energy and unable to carry  out their lives and prosper.    We are here talking about the border.   We are here talking about a dereliction of duty.   We are here talking about the violation of the fundamental first  principle of the executive branch of the Federal Government of the  United States led by the President to actually secure and defend the  United States of America.   ``All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and  associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design  to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and  action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this  fundamental principle and of fatal tendency.''--Washington's Farewell  Address.   ``Energy in the executive is . . . essential to the protection of the  community against foreign attacks; it is not less essential to the  steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property  against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes  interrupt the ordinary course of justice.''--Hamilton, Federalist No.  70.   ``Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to  his posterity, swear by the blood of the Revolution, never to violate  in the least particular, the laws of the country; and never to tolerate  their violation by others.''--Lincoln, Lyceum Address, 1838.   We are here precisely because the Constitution contemplated  separation of powers, which is being violated every single day by an  executive branch undeterred.   Our job in the House of Representatives is, in fact, to deter the  overreach and abuse of authority by the President of the United States  refusing to carry out the laws of the United States in detriment to the  well-being, security, and lives of the people of this country.   That is our job in the House of Representatives. That is why we are  here. That is why I support this rule. That is why I support this  resolution. That is why I support this inquiry. We are just beginning.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 529 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:I21Sec. 2.       Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall       proceed to the consideration in the House of the resolution       (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of Representatives'       commitment to protect and strengthen Social Security and       Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move  the previous question on the resolution.
