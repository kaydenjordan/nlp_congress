 Mr. President.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to  say a few words about the Biden administration's policies on the very  subject which Dr. Laura Taylor-Kale is going to be in charge.   Now, I have been working with this administration probably more than  most Republican Senators, particularly on Department of Defense  issues--on Department of Defense personnel, on helping them actually  get confirmed--so I don't come down here and do this lightly. Heck, I  introduced the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Austin, at his  confirmation hearing and then whipped votes to make sure he got  confirmed. So this is not my regular course of business even as it  relates to the Biden administration but particularly as it relates to  the Department of Defense. I have been someone who has been trying to  help.   But I am objecting because the Biden administration's policies are  completely at odds with the President's public statements and my friend  from Wisconsin's statements about the need for an industrial policy in  critical minerals that will help our military and help our economy.   Dr. Taylor-Kale will be in charge of this at the Pentagon--industrial  policy, critical minerals, rare earths. What we are seeing, Mr.  President, is they talk about this, but then they take actions against  these very policies that hurt us. The No. 1 area where they take  actions is my State, the great State of Alaska, which has more energy  for America, more critical resources, more critical minerals, more rare  earths for our Nation--for our Nation.   My State has had 40 Executive orders or Executive actions in 2 years  from this administration, issued singularly and solely against Alaska.  Of course, that is crushing the economy of my State, workers in my  State. But here is the broader point for this topic today: It is really  undermining America's national security. Critical minerals, natural  resources--we all know we need them, yet one big part of America--it is  the target of this administration to shut it down. It is ridiculous.   As I said to my colleague, if a Republican administration went to  Wisconsin  [[Page S7219]]  or issued 40 Executive orders and Executive actions solely against  Wisconsin or Maine and you guys came to me and said, ``Hey, Dan, help  us. Geez Louise, the war on Alaska. Help,'' I would help.   My State is getting crushed.   Here is the specific issue that relates to this nominee. The  President held a summit on critical minerals--a good example of what we  need to do--on February 22, 2022, and he said: We need these critical  minerals. The demand for them is going to increase 400 to 600 percent  over the next several decades.         We can't build a future that's made in America if we       ourselves are dependent on China for the materials that power       the products of today and tomorrow.    And our national security.   That is the President of the United States on his big critical  minerals summit hosted at the White House to talk about supply chains  and industrial capacity and military issues.    The same day the President of the United States held that critical  minerals summit, the Department of the Interior said that they were  going to reverse a 7-year EIS record of decision, $10 million by  professional staff in the Federal Government, on what is called the  Ambler Mining District in Alaska, one of the biggest, most extensive  sources of critical minerals in the country, maybe even in the world--a  project, by the way, that has been in permitting since the Obama  administration.   That same day, they reversed it and said: Alaska, start over.   Nuts. Crazy.   So what I have done is I have put a hold on a couple of Department of  Defense nominees who are in charge of this area, and Dr. Taylor-Kale is  one. But I have been reasonable. I went to the Deputy Secretary of the  Interior, the Deputy Secretary of Defense. We held a conference with  White House officials. I simply said: I am not asking to reverse your  crazy decision--which it was crazy. It hurts my State for sure, but it  hurts the national security of our country.   I simply said: I want three simple asks--so I have been trying to  work to get the nominee cleared--three simple asks from this  administration: Identify a definitive, workable schedule with a clear,  legitimate timeline for completing the review of this project that has  already been in almost 10 years of permitting--to do it in a timely  manner. That was No. 1. Clearly state the Federal Government's intent  to allow the Alaska entities that are trying to move this forward to  continue to complete baseline scientific data gathering and design  work, such as wetland delineations and engineering reconnaissance for  this road. That was No. 2. Allow these Alaska entities that are moving  this road and project forward to complete its planned geological  drilling and core sampling program, which is critical to advancing the  project and engineering design, as this case is now being remanded.   That was it. That was it. Three simple requests. None of these are  hard. None of them are hard.   I have raised this with the Secretary of Defense, the national  security team, of course, Interior, and they keep telling me no. This  is easy. If the Secretary of the Interior came and said, ``Senator  Sullivan, I saw your remarks on the floor. I agree with all three of  those things. You are right; they are simple,'' I would lift my hold  today.   So the ball is in the administration's court. If they really want Dr.  Taylor-Kale to be confirmed, they could do it tonight. Meet my  requests, which are quite reasonable. I did not ask them to review or  reverse the crazy decision that they made in February of 2022. These  are very simple requests. I have been very reasonable on this. No one  on their side is being reasonable, so I will continue to hold her and  some of the other DOD nominees who are in charge of critical minerals  and industrial capacity in the Department of Defense until the simple  demands that I am asking for that not only will help my State but will  help the national security of America.   They won't do it, so I object.    Mr. President, I just want to say that I certainly  would be willing to work with my colleague from Wisconsin on this  issue. I have been working on it in good faith with other Members on  the other side of the aisle. Maybe, perhaps, she can help me with the  three simple asks we have put forward to the Department of Interior,  and if they agree to those simple asks--and they are simple--then I  will lift my hold. So maybe the Senator from Wisconsin and I can work  together on this.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I move to concur with a further  amendment, No. 6522, to the message to accompany H.R. 7776, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I am really working hard with my  colleagues here--I see Senator Durbin has come to the floor--to make a  law that we all know is the right thing to do.   In fact, in my 8 years in the U.S. Senate, I don't think I have ever  been involved with a matter that more desperately cries out for a just  resolution to a simple issue. And it is this: Do we, as the U.S.  Senate, want to help sick U.S. Marines and their families, or do we  want to allow a legislative bill that continues to further enrich trial  lawyers in America? That is the question. That is the law I am working  hard with many of my colleagues to make happen.   And I think everyone knows the answer. Everyone in this body knows  what the right thing to do is. Every American watching knows what the  right thing to do is, and that is to help the brave Marine Corps heroes  and their families who have sacrificed for decades to serve our Nation.   I have spoken to many of my colleagues, many of my Democratic  colleagues in particular, and I know in their hearts that they also  recognize we need to fix this problem.   So what I am asking my colleagues to do, particularly my Democratic  friends, is this: Help me fix it.   Now, I want to say something. You are going to need a little courage,  like the marines that we are helping. You have a constituency that  really does not like my legislation: the trial bar of America. We know  they are very powerful. We know that most of my colleagues don't ever  want to cross them, and they certainly don't want my bill to pass.   But, again, I ask my Democratic colleagues: Have courage. Do the  right thing. Work with me on fixing this problem.   So what is the problem?   Well, I have spoken on the floor about this problem, usually in angry  tones because it burns me up. And any American watching who understands  this, almost immediately, it burns them up. And the marines and their  families, it burns them up as well.   But to be honest, this afternoon I am really down here more in terms  of sadness and disappointment rather than anger. But I am going to  explain it once again, and if you are watching on TV or watching back  at home, give a call to your Senator and say ``Hey. Fix this  injustice.'' This is a real easy, easy issue to fix. Here is the  problem.   We, a couple months ago, passed here the PACT Act, which was  legislation to help military members who have been sickened by burn  pits. This is an issue that I have been focused on my whole Senate  career, starting with bipartisan legislation several years ago with  Senator Manchin, Senator Klobuchar. So that was good. Important.  Expensive, but important.   We have got to take care of our veterans and our military. To me,  that is the No. 1 priority we should be doing here in the Senate, which  is why a provision of the PACT Act--to provide compensation for marines  who were sickened by contaminated water at Camp Lejeune--was also  considered in the PACT Act. That was important. We should do that for  these marines and their families--marines serving in the 1970s, 1980s  at Camp Lejeune.   So far, so good. That is what has happened.   But as the legislation of the PACT Act and the Camp Lejeune marines  compensation act--it started to become clear something reared its ugly  head, and what reared its ugly head  [[Page S7228]]  was the legislation was more of a gift to America's trial lawyers than  it was to sick marines.   Now, we have all seen these ads. As a matter of fact, this morning,  on the radio, I heard a couple of them already. You can't go anywhere,  turning on the TV, without a lawyer asking marines to call to get them  to help under this Camp Lejeune compensation act. Here we are. We have  seen it. Everybody has seen it.   We had a VA hearing about a month ago. I asked the VA, How much do  you think trial lawyers have been spending? This is a month ago. They  estimated well over a billion dollars a month ago. A billion dollars. A  billion dollars.   Do you think that $1 billion is going to go to sick marines and their  families? It is not. It is not. Now look, I don't blame the marines who  are dialing these 1-800 numbers. They are getting bombarded. If they  are sick, they think this is the way they are going to get cured and  get their money.   That is not the case. A lot of these are scams, and we know it. A lot  of these are scams. The problem right now is if a marine calls one of  these numbers, there is no limitation on what the trial lawyer  representing the marine can take out of the marine's award. No  limitation, no cap on contingency fees, no cap on anything.   And here is the real problem. Everybody saw this problem coming; that  is, as opposed to the marines getting compensation for being sick, the  trial lawyers of America would be enriched. Everybody saw it coming.  And to their credit, the Biden administration saw it coming. So the  Justice Department of the Biden administration had recommended in their  technical assistance to us here in the Senate that there should be caps  on these awards for trial lawyers. Makes sense. This is the Biden  administration Justice Department--friends of many of these law firms,  but they knew it was the right thing to do. They said 10 percent caps  on contingency awards and 2 percent for filing fees. That was the Biden  administration's recommendation.   Now, that didn't happen. I won't go into all the bloody, gory  details, but as we tried to amend the PACT Act, we wanted an amendment  to do that. The Biden administration did, the veterans service  organizations did because it was pretty simple. If there is a cap on  fees for the lawyers, the marines are going to get more; if there  isn't, the trial lawyers are going to get more. We worked it hard.   Unfortunately and sadly--really sadly--my Democratic colleagues  blocked all those amendments when we tried to pass the PACT Act.   So what has happened? What the Biden Justice Department predicted,  what we all predicted, it is happening. Billions of dollars of ads--see  them every day, hear them every day and every night, and marines  getting crumbs and trial attorneys getting rich. That is just not  right.   There is not one Senator who knows that that is the right thing to  do. This is an injustice right now in America, and already some marines  have lost money because of these scams. Some of these firms are  promising big paydays. Of course, they are asking for money upfront. A  recent media story highlighted a marine in Kentucky whose face was  actually used in an ad claiming he had received a $35,000 settlement.  In fact, he told a reporter he got 35 cents, OK? That is not justice.   So, of course, right now the VA, local governments, veterans groups  are frantically trying to warn marines and their families: Hey, don't  listen to that, and, Congress, please help us. There are reports that  some law firms are charging 50 or 60 percent contingency fees. Are you  kidding me?   The veterans groups, the VA itself, the Biden administration VA, are  crying out for help--help--no more scams.   Here is what the American Legion said at a recent meeting in a  resolution they had passed:         WHEREAS, Predatory law firms charging exorbitant fees have       engaged in aggressive marketing campaigns [hurting veterans].       . . . The American Legion urges Congress to provide the       necessary oversight [for] the implementation of the Camp       Lejeune Justice Act to ensure veterans receive fair       compensation.    That is the American Legion.   I am a member. The VFW has also come out in support of what we are  trying to do. So this should be simple. This should be simple.   So what does my bill do? What does my amendment do? I am going to  explain it briefly here. The full name of my amendment, my bill, is the  Protect Camp Lejeune Victims Ensnared by Trial Lawyers Scams Act, the  VETS Act for short. And it is pretty simple. First of all, it just goes  back to what the Biden administration had recommended in terms of a  cap. Everybody here agrees there needs to be a cap on contingency fees.    They had mentioned 10 percent, as I mentioned, on contingency fees  and a 2-percent cap for filing the necessary paperwork.   Now my good friend, the Senator from Illinois, the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee, Senator Durbin, respectfully, I think he is going  to speak and say: Well, wait a minute. The normal fee is 33\1/2\  percent, one-third contingency fees. That is actually correct.   But this isn't a normal fee. The reason the Biden administration has  a low contingency fee at 10 percent is that the lawyers who are going  to receive and help marines get these benefits aren't going to go  through big trials. They are not going to go through discovery. It is  almost an administrative procedure process to check some boxes. The  government doesn't even have a defense in this. So that is why 33\1/3\  percent, the standard fare for contingency fees, has no place in this  legislation--no place in this legislation. This is a government  administrative process that is going to be made easy, supposedly, in  the bill for marines--sick marines to recover compensation and their  families.   So when you hear talk about: No, no, it has got to be one-third. That  is just not true.   The Biden administration recommended 10 percent. So don't be fooled  by that. Americans watching, don't be fooled by that.   So here is another thing.   That is the key to my legislation. The other thing we are saying is  because the compensation will come out of other benefits that the  veterans receive from the VA, we make sure that the contingency fee is  based on the net award, not the total award. Again, that is to serve  the marines and their families, not the trial lawyers.   Let me give you one final thing my legislation does, and I don't  think there is any Senator who disagrees with this. And I am pretty  sure the chairman of the Judiciary Committee does not disagree with  this. Somehow, in the VA-implemented regulations on the implementation  of this legislation, they issued a reg that makes sure that trial  lawyers get paid before the sick marines and their families.   They what? Yes, right now. Now that is crazy. Everybody, including  lawyers, knows that the client gets paid and then the client pays the  lawyer. It shouldn't be the lawyer gets paid and then the client gets  paid. That is crazy, especially if the client is a sick U.S. marine.  And I even think my colleague Senator Durbin agrees with that. So that  is the other piece of this legislation.   We could fix that overnight by having the Secretary of the VA take a  relook at that reg and say: Hey, that is wrong. Let's rescind that. I  would welcome if Secretary McDonough would do that.   Well, I am going to keep fighting for this issue. This is an urgent  issue. Payments under the Camp Lejeune Act will start early next year.  The ads that we saw that I showed you here are likely to intensify over  the holidays to try to ensnare even more marines into these schemes.   But here is what I am going to do: I am going to withdraw my  amendment. I am not going to force a vote on this amendment this  afternoon because I want to get to a law, and I had a feeling that  unfortunately my amendment was not going to get passed in this Senate  on this vote this afternoon.   So I want to work with Senator Durbin, Senator Blumenthal, other  Members on the other side of the aisle to do what we all know is the  right thing--to pass a law that emphasizes what we all thought the bill  was doing in the first place in the PACT Act, to take care of sick  marines and their families and not enrich trial lawyers.   Again, I urge my colleagues to work with me. Like the U.S. marines,  have courage to stand up to powerful interest groups who are trying to  take more money from individuals who deserve it.  [[Page S7229]]    Work with me on this. It is the holiday season. Let's give the  marines and their families the gift that they deserve and have earned  through courage and sacrifice, not the lump of coal and breadcrumbs,  which is the result of this bill that dramatically focuses on enriching  trial lawyers at the expense of the U.S. marines. I am committed to  work all weekend, all next week, but we need to get this done before we  finish this Congress at the end of the year.   Every American knows it. Every U.S. Senator knows it. It is the right  thing to do, and I certainly hope my colleagues are going to work with  me to make it happen.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from  Illinois.   He has my full commitment to try to get this done before we leave,  and I am willing to compromise on some of these issues. He makes a good  point in that, with the Senate's schedule, we are not going to be back  here until almost the end of January, and by then, some of these  payments will have started to be awarded.   We do not want--and I think the Senator from Illinois agrees with  me--situations wherein payments are going by 50, 60 percent to  contingency fees. Nobody wants that. We shouldn't want that. That is  just unfair. This regulation at the VA is also ridiculously unfair in  favoring trial lawyers over sick marines.   So the Senator from Illinois has my commitment. I will work day and  night on this issue to try and get it done before we leave--before we  leave. Otherwise, you are going to have a lot of marines--sick  marines--and their families who are going to get ripped off. We know  that that is going to happen, and we shouldn't allow it.   I will work with the Senator from Illinois, as he has got a lot of  power as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, on this important  issue that, I think, we should all care about. So I appreciate his  comments, and I will redouble my efforts on this topic.   I yield the floor.
