 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule  providing for consideration of the America COMPETES Act. As the lead  House Democrat on two important provisions, I am glad that we are  advancing a bill that would create jobs and support innovation for  years to come.   Almost 2 years ago, I joined a bipartisan group in the House and  Senate to introduce the CHIPS for America Act. This bill established a  road map for reasserting American leadership in the strategically  important semiconductor industry. Since then, two things have occurred:  The CHIPS Act was signed into law as part of last year's defense bill,  and the need to fund it has only grown more severe as the global  semiconductor shortage has dragged on.   Thankfully, the America COMPETES Act includes the full $52 billion we  need to comprehensively implement the CHIPS Act. This funding is about  more than any one specific technology or industry. It is about securing  a fundamental building block of the 21st century economy.   Unfortunately, we have all seen the devastating consequences of this  global semiconductor shortage: Factories have closed. Workers have been  laid off. And prices have gone up.   We cannot afford to wait any longer to get this funding into the  economy, supporting new American manufacturing capacity. This funding  is bipartisan; it is supported by the Biden administration; it will  help workers; and it will increase our national security. It should be  passed immediately.   I am also glad to see the $1.5 billion included to support next- generation telecommunications networks by encouraging deployment of  Open RAN technology. As an original cosponsor of the USA  Telecommunications Act, I know this funding will support more durable  supply chains and create opportunities for American companies to grow.   I thank Chairman McGovern and Secretary Raimondo for their tireless  work on this bill and look forward to supporting it on the floor later  this week.
