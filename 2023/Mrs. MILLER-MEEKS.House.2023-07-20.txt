 Mr. Speaker, my good friend Senator Chuck Grassley  said it best when he said: There is deeply rooted political infection  in the FBI. We can see this rot play out every single day when the FBI  decides who they will and will not pursue. They targeted parents who  showed up to school board meetings to hold their elected officials  accountable and to speak up for their children. They targeted pro-life  Americans who exercised their First Amendment right to peacefully  protest and arrested them in front of their children. They rushed to  investigate claims of Russian collusion--despite lapses and a bogus  FISA warrant--even when those claims were not backed up the evidence.   Yet, when dealing with Hunter Biden, the DOJ and the FBI chose to go  easy on him and gave him a sweetheart plea deal, leaving him unlikely  to go to jail.   It must be nice.   We have simply lost confidence in The Bureau and serious changes must  be made by Director Chris Wray to root out favoritism and double  standards so the American people can have faith in their institutions  again.    Mr. Speaker, I also wish my young friends Kurt and Cathy Haller a  milestone 40th wedding anniversary.   Happy 40th anniversary, Kurt and Cathy.                            ____________________
