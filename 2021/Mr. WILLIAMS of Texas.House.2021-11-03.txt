 Madam Speaker, President Biden looks to call  his phony tax-and-spend plan Build Back Better when it actually should  be called build back broke. It broke last night, and it is breaking  this week.   This plan is a disaster for Americans and the future of our small  businesses. The National Federation of Independent Business recently  reported that over two-thirds of small businesses faced significant  impacts from the supply chain disruptions. Fifty-one percent of owners  reported they are still unable to fill job openings. And uncertainty  about the future among small business owners increased by 5 points,  according to the NFIB Uncertainty Index.   American small businesses are facing unprecedented challenges, and  unfortunately, Washington bureaucrats are turning their backs on their  concerns and pushing ahead to increase taxes, fuel rising inflation,  and expand government control.   I came to Washington to fight for Main Street America. That is what I  am. And every American should know these closed-door negotiations and  socialist policies are fiscal insanity and will crush our economy.   Cut taxes and save our economy, a new concept.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
