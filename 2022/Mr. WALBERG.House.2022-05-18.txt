 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding the time.  [[Page H5155]]    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7791, the Access to  Baby Formula Act, to prevent a future crisis like the one taking a toll  on families today. I am a grandfather and a father, so it is important  to me.   Across the country, new mothers are going store to store in desperate  search of baby formula. It is stressful; it is gut-wrenching; and it is  unacceptable. Even when parents can find baby formula, the price has  soared 18 percent in the past year.   How did we get to this dire situation? Last November, the Food and  Drug Administration shut down the Nation's top baby formula  manufacturer, a plant just outside of my district in Michigan. Since  then, the Biden administration has slow-walked the response and failed  to understand the consequences of their actions. The FDA should have  reopened the Abbott plant in Sturgis sooner.   This plant is consequential, in large part due to a contract they  have with WIC. H.R. 7791 takes critical steps to safeguard WIC  participants, even in the event of something like a plant closure.   This legislation requires preparation and planning for supply chain  disruptions, ensures appropriate guide rails, and will prevent  disasters caused in part by government contracts altering the market.   As a parent, ensuring the health and well-being of your child is  paramount. They should not have to scramble from one empty shelf to  another and worry about feeding their babies. This formula shortage is  an urgent crisis and one that cannot happen again.   I urge my colleagues to support the Access to Baby Formula Act.
