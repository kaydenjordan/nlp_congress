 Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize three talented high  school basketball players in my district, Khadija Faye, Tiera White,  and Brianna Ellis.   Khadija and Tiera play basketball at Father Lopez High School in  Daytona Beach, and Brianna plays basketball at Flagler Palm Coast High  School in Palm Coast, Florida. All three of these young women have just  been nominated to play in the 2020 All-American Games, a national  basketball competition benefiting the Ronald McDonald charities. They  were among 46 seniors from Florida to be selected for this honor.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize their hard work and talent  on the House floor today. The final roster will be announced next week,  and we are all hoping all three will be on it.   I know I speak on behalf of all of us when I say we are so proud and  so excited to see Daytona and Palm Coast represented so well in women's  basketball.                            ____________________
