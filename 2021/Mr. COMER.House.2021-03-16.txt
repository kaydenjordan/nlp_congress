 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my very good  friend, Judge Jeff Burdette, from Mt. Vernon, Kentucky, in Rockcastle  County, upon his retirement as circuit court judge after 30 years of  distinguished service to the good people of the Commonwealth of  Kentucky.   Judge Burdette's circuit court district comprised Rockcastle,  Lincoln, and Pulaski Counties.   Judge Burdette was considered a constitutional scholar who was  respected by everyone, not just on the bench and in the legal  community, but everyone in the community in southern Kentucky.   He was instrumental in launching the 28th Circuit Adult Drug Court  and the rocket docket.   Judge Burdette has been someone I have always looked up to, and I  wish him the very best in his retirement. I thank him on behalf of the  United States House of Representatives for his service to the good  people of Kentucky.                            ____________________
