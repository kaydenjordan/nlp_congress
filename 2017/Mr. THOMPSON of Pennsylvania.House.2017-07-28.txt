 Mr. Speaker, I rise to call upon the  House leadership to not adjourn until we have a healthcare bill.   Respective committees need to meet and walk a new product through  regular order. We know what will and will not work, given the voting  prerogatives of the Members of this body and the Senate.   We understand the needs of our constituents, regardless of their  voter registration.   We understand it is our job to navigate the complexities of this  issue on behalf of the American people and come up with a product that  makes good on promises that have been made to improve our healthcare  system. This will take Republicans and Democrats.   Later this morning, I will be proud to once again gather with my  colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, who are members of the  Problem Solvers Caucus, part of no labels, to continue our work seeking  a bipartisan solution to what has become, unfortunately, a partisan  issue.   I stand ready to make good on these promises and suggest that we  remain in Washington until that work is complete.                            ____________________
