 Mr. Speaker, out in the country, the voice of the  people is diminished by voter suppression, partisan gerrymandering, and  election subversion.   Here in Washington, the voice of the people is diminished by big  money, the insiders, and the lobbyists, who use their influence to  block progress on so many of the things that Americans care about.   But we can do something about this. The Freedom to Vote: John R.  Lewis Act will ensure free and fair access to the ballot box, with  expanded registration opportunities and the broad availability of early  voting and vote by mail, something that voters of both political  parties took advantage of in the last election.   It will ban partisan gerrymandering so that congressional districts  are drawn fairly and with respect for the people.   It will prevent the arbitrary removal of local election officials  from their positions, and it will protect election officials from  harassment and intimidation.    It will pull dark money out of the shadows in order to combat the  corrupting influence on our democracy.   It will make meaningful investments in efforts led by the States to  strengthen and fortify their electoral infrastructure.   Too many Americans have become cynical about our politics, and they  are angry. But there is hope in that anger because it means they still  care; they still believe in American democracy; they cherish it.   In November 2020, 150 million Americans overcame tremendous obstacles  to get to the ballot box, to pull our democracy back from the brink.   The question now is, will we do our part? As their elected  Representatives, will we show that our love for this great Republic is  equal to theirs? Will we exercise the right to vote that we have in  this Chamber in order to protect the right of every American to vote in  their local library or their firehouse or senior center?   The answer must be yes. And after we pass this bill in the House, we  look to our Senate colleagues to do whatever they can to secure the  passage in that Chamber.   The stakes are too high. Failure is not an option.                                time  0945     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letters of support for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746.                                                     Declaration for                                              American Democracy,                                                   January 13, 2022.        Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the Declaration       for American Democracy, a coalition of over 240       organizations, to express our strong support of the House       Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom       to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which will ensure that voters can       safely and freely cast their ballots, protect against       election sabotage, stop partisan gerrymandering, and limit       the influence of dark money in politics so that billionaires       can't buy elections.        Nineteen states enacted 34 new laws that restrict access to       the ballot box in 2021 alone and more are under consideration       today. Candidates are running for top election offices       peddling the Big Lie. States are passing racially-      gerrymandered maps that dilute the power of Black and Brown       voters. This legislation would fight back against all these       attacks and ensure the ability of every American to       participate in safe, accessible, and transparent elections.        Our organization fully endorses this bill and urges you to       support this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                    Jana Morgan,                                           Director, Declaration for      American Democracy.                                   ____                                                     Common Cause,                                   Washington, DC, January 13, 2022.      Re Common Cause Urges ``Yes'' Vote on the Freedom to Vote:           John R. Lewis Act; Will ``Score'' Vote in our Next           Democracy Scorecard         Dear Representative: On behalf of Common Cause's more than       1.5 million members, we write in strong support of the House       Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom       to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, which will ensure that voters can       safely and freely cast their ballots, repair and strengthen       the Voting Rights Act, protect against election sabotage,       stop partisan and racial gerrymandering, and limit the       influence of dark money in politics so that billionaires       can't buy elections. We will score this vote in our next       Democracy Scorecard, which we send to our 1.5 million members       and to the press.  [[Page H174]]         Last year, nineteen states enacted 34 new laws that       restrict access to the ballot box, and as state legislatures       begin new sessions this year, many more anti-voter bills are       under consideration. States are passing gerrymandered maps       that dilute the power of Black and Brown voters. And       billionaires, special interests and dark-money groups       continue to try to buy elections and drown out the voices of       everyday Americans. This legislation would fight back against       all these attacks and ensure the ability for all Americans to       have their voices heard and to participate in safe,       accessible, and transparent elections.        It is essential that this legislation pass as expeditiously       as possible.        We strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the Freedom to Vote:       John R. Lewis Act.            Sincerely,                                                Karen Hobert Flynn,      President, Common Cause.                                   ____                                      People for the American Way,                                   Washington, DC, January 13, 2022.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Member of Congress: Throughout our nation's history,       we have worked to build a more inclusive and representative       democracy. This is our generation's moment. On behalf of our       1.5 million supporters nationwide, People For the American       Way writes in strong support of the House amendment to the       Senate amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R.       Lewis Act, which would help return power to the American       people.        When the ``Conscience of Congress'' John Lewis passed away       in 2020, he was still fighting to restore what the Voting       Rights Act lost in Shelby County in 2013. Congressman Lewis       supported the restorative Voting Right Advancement Act that       now bears his name, and he wrote the Voter Empowerment Act to       advance pro-voter measures and accountability supports. Those       measures, and more, now comprise much of H.R. 5746. The bill       also addresses the devastating 2010 Supreme Court decision in       Citizens United that unleashed a massive uptick in outside,       often secret, political spending. It is designed to advance       campaign finance reform--restoring balance and transparency       and guarding against foreign interference. Finally, the new       H.R. 5746 language recognizes the dangers of political power       grabs over election administration and the importance of       ethical public service.        Our broken democracy has rendered us unable to fully       address important substantive priorities for the American       people. Right these wrongs by supporting the House amendment       to the Senate amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote:       John R. Lewis Act.            Sincerely,                                                       Marge Baker,      Executive Vice President.                                   ____                                                     Our Maryland,                                                   January 13, 2022.        Dear Representative: Our Maryland represents more than       54,000 online followers and 14,000 subscribers promoting a       just and sustainable future for all Marylanders,        We write in strong support of the House Amendment to the       Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R.       Lewis Act, which will ensure that voters can safely and       freely cast their ballots, protect against election sabotage,       stop partisan gerrymandering, and limit the influence of dark       money in politics so that billionaires can't buy elections.        Nineteen states enacted 34 new laws that restrict access to       the ballot box in 2021 alone and more are under consideration       today.

Sincerely,                                                    Larry Ottinger,      President.                                   ____                                                   January 13, 2022.        Dear Representative: We write in strong support of H.R.       5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. Our democracy       is at an inflection point. The right to vote, and by       extension to a free and fair election, is under the gravest       threat in a generation. This reality makes it all the more       critical that the House pass the Freedom to Vote: John R.       Lewis Act as expeditiously as possible. The Act will ensure       that voters can safely and freely cast their ballots, protect       against election sabotage, stop partisan gerrymandering, and       limit the influence of dark money in politics so that       billionaires can't buy elections.        The situation is dire. Nineteen states enacted 34 new laws       that restrict access to the ballot box in 2021 alone and more       are under consideration today. Candidates are running for top       election offices peddling the Big Lie that the 2020 election       was stolen. States are passing racially-gerrymandered maps       that dilute the power of Black and Brown voters. This       legislation would fight back against all these attacks and       ensure the ability for every American to participate in safe,       accessible, and transparent elections. It would also take       crucial steps to combat the corrosive influence of money in       politics.        CREW fully endorses and urges you to support this       legislation.            Sincerely,                                        Citizens for Responsibility                                          and Ethics in Washington.
