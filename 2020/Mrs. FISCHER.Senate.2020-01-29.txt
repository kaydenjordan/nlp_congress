 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself, Senator Crapo, and Senator Risch.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators ask counsel for the President:         The President's counsel has underscored the       Administration's ongoing anticorruption focus with our       allies. At what point did the United States Government       develop concerns about Burisma in relation to corruption and       concerns with Russia?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank the Senators for that  question. I think it bears on the answer that I was last giving to the  last question.   This is something that became--of course, President Trump, in his  conversation with President Zelensky in the July 25 call, as the  transcript shows us, brought up a couple of things. He brought up  burden-sharing specifically, and he raised the issue of corruption in  two specifics: the specific case of potential Ukraine interference in  the 2016 election, which he had heard about and asked about, and the  incident involving the firing of a prosecutor who, according to public  reports, had been looking into Burisma, the company that the Vice  President's son was on the board of. That was the President's way of  pinpointing specific issues related to corruption.   So when did it become a part of the President's concern, those issues  related to corruption in Ukraine? Of course, we have the evidence that  everyone in the government--and Fiona Hill testified to this--thought  that anti-corruption was a major issue for U.S. policy with respect to  Ukraine. When there was a new President elected in April, President  Zelensky, that brought the possibility of reform to the forefront.   Then we know that the President was receiving information from his  private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and he spoke in the Oval Office of,  Rudy knows about the Ukraine. You guys go talk to him.   He was explaining to the delegation that had just returned from the  inauguration for the President, for President Zelensky, that he had  concerns about Ukraine because they are all corrupt. He kept saying: It  is a corrupt country. I don't know. They tried to get me in the  election.   So it draws again on, there is his specific experience with Ukrainian  corruption because he knew from the public reports, as in the POLITICO  article that has been referenced many times. The POLITICO article in  January of 2017 explained a laundry list of Ukrainian Government  officials who had been out there attempting to assist the Hillary  Clinton campaign and spread misinformation or bad information or assist  in digging up dirt on members of the Trump campaign.   Mr. Giuliani had been investigating things related to Ukraine in 2016  and was led to the information about the Burisma situation and Vice  President Biden having the prosecutor fired. So that was in January  that he had these interviews he turned over to the State Department in  March.   Then there were a series, also, of public articles published. John  Solomon, in The Hill, published an article in March. Rudy Giuliani  tweeted about it in March. There was an ABC story in June. There was a  two-part New Yorker story about the Bidens and Burisma in July. Then,  on July 22, the Washington Post had an article and explained  specifically on just July 22--this is 3 days before the July 25 call-- the Washington Post reported that Mr. Shokin, the prosecutor, believed  ``his ouster was because of his interest in the company,'' referring to  Burisma, and he said that ``had he remained in his post, he would have  questioned Hunter Biden.''   So I think it is a reasonable inference that, as there were these  articles being published in close proximity to the time, this was  information that was available to the President, and it became  available to him as something that was a specific example of  potentially serious corruption. And remember, everyone who testified,  who was asked about it--does it seem like there is an appearance of a  conflict of interest? Does it seem like that is fishy? Everyone  testified: Well, yes, there is at least an appearance of a conflict of  interest there.   I think it was after the information had come to Mr. Giuliani--long  before Vice President Biden had announced his candidacy--that it came  to the attention of the President and became something worth raising.  Again, President Poroshenko is the one who fired the prosecutor. While  he is still the President, there is not really as much of an  opportunity or a possibility of raising that. So I think it was in that  timeframe, along that arc of the timing, that it came to the  President's attention, and that is why it was raised in that timing.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Connecticut.
