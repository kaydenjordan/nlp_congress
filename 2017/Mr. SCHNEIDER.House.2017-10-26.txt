 Mr. Speaker, just a month after the U.S. national debt  surpassed $20 trillion for the very first time, today this House passed  an irresponsible budget that will add a shocking additional $1.5  trillion to that sum.   This additional debt threatens our future prosperity and constricts  our ability to respond to the challenges we face today.   The cynical purpose of today's budget is to pave the way so partisan  tax reform can be fast tracked through the Senate, but financing tax  cuts that overwhelmingly benefit those at the very top by ballooning  our Nation's budget deficits is exactly the wrong approach.   We all agree our Tax Code is broken and needs reform, but true tax  reform needs to be fiscally responsible.   Rather than crafting plans behind closed doors, I urge my colleagues  to reach across the aisle. Together, we can pursue reform of our Tax  Code that focuses on the middle class, promotes entrepreneurship, job  creation, and private investment, and supports public investment in our  infrastructure.   Let's bring this tax reform debate into the open and get this done  for the American people.                            ____________________
