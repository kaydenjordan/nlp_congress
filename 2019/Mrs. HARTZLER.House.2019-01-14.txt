 Madam Speaker, it is a sobering time to be here  because we are in the 24th day of a government shutdown, something that  none of us wanted, and something that could be fixed very, very  quickly. I am hopeful that it will.   We have heard some speeches tonight from individuals calling on the  President to open up the government. But the reality is that the House,  in December, voted to fully fund the government, and all of the  Democrats voted no, and the Senate voted no.  [[Page H538]]    So here we are. We voted to keep the government open, and we provided  border security at the same time. We need to do that.   Tonight, I think it is important that we have a discussion with the  American people about why we think it is important to secure our  border. Can we do both? Can we find $5 billion in an almost $4 trillion  budget to secure our border? Can we open our government and make sure  our government employees have the funds that they need to pay their  bills? Absolutely, we can do that.   I am ready to work with those on the other side of the aisle. I find  it so interesting how they have changed their position. I just want to  review with everyone listening tonight about the position of some of  those who are now, all of a sudden, voting no.   During the previous administration, all 54 Democrats in the Senate  voted to double the length of a new border fence with Mexico, double  the number of border agents to 40,000, and spend $40 billion on border  security. All the Democrats in the Senate, in the last administration,  voted for $40 billion for border security just a few years ago.   Before that, in 2006, 64 Democrats in the House joined Republicans to  pass the Secure Fence Act to build 700 miles of fencing along the  border. In the Senate, when we had 64 Democrats join the House to pass  it, to build 700 miles of fencing, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and  Chuck Schumer all voted for it.   Then Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer voted in favor of the  2007 DHS appropriations bill, which included $1 billion for fencing  along the southwest border. The same Speaker who said it is immoral now  voted for money for fencing just a few years ago. I find that  interesting.   And Chuck Schumer voted for it, and he said: ``Illegal immigration is  wrong, plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced that  we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no  progress on dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants who are  here now and on rationalizing our system of legal immigration.''   Then he said: ``Any immigration solution must recognize that we must  do as much as we can to gain control of our borders as soon as  possible.''   This is the same Chuck Schumer who now thinks that we shouldn't have  it, but just a few years ago he did support it.   So why are we fighting to secure our border? It is because we care  about people.   There is a drug crisis in this country, and the drugs are coming  across our southern border into our States. I know they are in  Missouri. We have to stop it.   I had the chance, in October, to go to a port of entry down in  Arizona, the Nogales-Mariposa port of entry just south of Tucson. What  I saw there was eye-opening.   What I saw is that we are at war there. It is a war between the drug  cartels and our dedicated Border Patrol and Customs officials down  there on the ground. Just last year, they confiscated 1\1/2\ million  pounds of drugs, and they talked about how they had no idea how many  more millions of pounds they didn't stop, but we know.    All of us here tonight who talk to our law enforcement at home, who  talk to our families who have lost their children due to a heroin  overdose, who talk about how much cocaine and meth is in our  communities, those are the drugs that they didn't catch.   Last year, 72,000 Americans died from a drug overdose. Now think  about that. That is more who died of a drug overdose than died during  the entire Vietnam war. It is more people than last year died, in  total, of car accidents and homicides. If you put all of the traffic  fatalities and all of the homicides together, it doesn't equal the  number of people who have died from drug overdoses. We have to stop  this.   Part of the drugs coming across is fentanyl. They caught 1.2 tons of  this deadly drug. That is enough, they tell me, to kill every person in  the United States. It takes only 2 milligrams of fentanyl to overdose,  so that could kill that many people.   In 2018, Customs and Border Patrol seized enough cocaine to fill more  than 141 1-ton pickups. I wanted to make this poster because we all  know what a pickup looks like, and you think of a 1-ton pickup. If you  can picture, here are 141 of these 1-ton pickup trucks full of cocaine.  That is how much that our Border Patrol caught. We don't know how much  more they didn't catch.   Also, they caught enough methamphetamine to fill 124 pickups, 124  tons, and over 3 tons of heroin. In fact, 90 percent of the heroin in  the United States comes across the southern border.   Now, we have an opioid crisis in this country, and I am doing  everything I can in my district, and I know many of us are, doing what  we can to address the opioid crisis. Heroin is a type of opioid;  fentanyl is a type of opioid; and 90 percent of that is coming across  our southern border.   What that ends up being is it ends up impacting people. Here is a  poster of some people who have been impacted by the drug crisis we have  in our country.   This mother and son, on the far right-hand side, she was addicted to  meth, gave birth to her little boy, and he was drug addicted at birth  and went through withdrawal.   The young man in the middle, Eamon, he passed away, sadly, due to a  heroin overdose.   And Kristin and her daughter, Reese, she lost custody of Reese  because of her drug addiction. She is trying desperately to get off  drugs, but she has lost custody.   We have a crisis in our foster care system now because of the drug  problem. We are having trouble finding enough individuals to become  foster parents. There are so many children who have been taken away  from their parents because of their drug addiction, and it is not safe  for them to be home.   We have a drug crisis, and we have tons, literally tons, of drugs  pouring across our southern border. That is why we have to find $5.7  billion in order to secure our border.   But it is more than just the drugs. It is also our safety. It is our  security.   Just last year, our Customs and Border Patrol interdicted 17,000  individuals who had a criminal record. That is how many they caught  with a criminal record. But, sadly, there are a lot of people who make  it across, who are here in our country because we don't have a border,  and they end up hurting our families.   Just last month, our hearts broke for Officer Singh and his family, a  police officer from California who did it right, who came here legally  from Fiji, and whose dream was to become a police officer. He went  through the training. He learned English, his third language. He went  to the police academy, driving 4 hours every day for months in order to  complete his police academy.   He was so proud to become a police officer, and he was a good one. He  was respected; he was amazing; and he was brave. He was a legal  immigrant we are so proud of.   Then, sadly, right around Christmas, he was shot and killed by an  illegal immigrant, someone who had come across the southern border.   And you wonder why we think it is important to secure the border. It  is because of heartbreaking stories like this. It is because of  families who are losing their children to drugs. That is why we have to  find the money, and we can do it.   My colleagues and I tonight want to share why this is so important,  and why it is important that we get this done now.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs.  Miller). She is new, but we are so thrilled that she is here. I would  like her to come and share a little bit on this very important issue  from West Virginia's perspective.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments  tonight. It is a serious matter before us right now as a nation. That  is why we are having this conversation tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), and I thank him for being here this evening. I think he is  the first person, certainly tonight and the other night we had a  discussion, from California to be here, so I appreciate him coming. I  would like to hear about what he thinks about where we are at and what  we need to do.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman; he makes a great  point about the safety of the individuals who are coming here. Because  we have this open border, it is incentivizing people to make this very  dangerous trek.   Doctors Without Borders has reported that 30 percent of the women who  make this trek, who have given their money to coyotes to bring them  here, are sexually assaulted. Now, that should be upsetting for anyone.  That is another reason I believe we need to close the border and then  enable and help and work with individuals to come here legally.   I think the gentleman makes a great point, too, that there is a lot  of negotiation that could take place right now if the Democrats would  be willing to sit down. We do have the DACA situation. We do need more  workers. We do need to work on our visas. We need to reform our  immigration our laws so that individuals like Police Officer Singh and  others who want to come and contribute can come here easier.   We all have an immigration story, and I support legal immigration. So  let's sit down. Let's talk about the changes that need to be made to  our immigration system, but let's also secure our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Allen) to  share his thoughts on this matter, on why he thinks it is important  that we secure our border.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman makes some excellent  remarks. The 300 deaths a day due to overdoses, the opioid crisis with  90 percent of the opioids coming across the southern border, that is  why we have got to secure the border.   I agree; we have a humanitarian crisis. There are 60,000 illegals  caught a month trying to cross our border. In Missouri's Fourth  District, we don't have very many towns that even have 60,000  individuals. That is a lot of people per month coming across.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg),  my colleague. I thank the gentleman for coming tonight, and I look  forward to hearing what he has to share about this important topic.    Madam Speaker, that is so powerful. I thank the  gentleman for sharing Christopher's story. I can't imagine how helpless  that made him feel to stand at his casket, at his funeral, and to  realize that we here in Congress have passed a lot of bills dealing  with opioids to address this, but it is still flowing across our  borders. We need to do more.   So I thank the gentleman for sharing that story. We do need to work  in a bipartisan fashion. These bills that Representative Walberg talked  about were passed in a bipartisan fashion, over 70 bills. Democrats and  Republicans came together last year and said: This is a crisis. Let's  send this.   Now we need to complete that. We need to complete and stop them from  coming in to begin with, in addition to continuing to provide money for  people in treatment and our law enforcement and mental health issues  and those other things, to go after the opioid crisis. But we need to  stop them flowing here to begin with. So I thank the gentleman for  sharing that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).  He is right there at the border in the State of Texas, along the edge.  I thank the gentleman for being here tonight and would like to hear  what he has to say about this topic.                                time  2000     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for  sharing those heartfelt words and those statistics. They really matter.  I totally agree with the gentleman that our number one job is to keep  America safe. The number one job is to keep America safe. That is why  we want to find $5.7 billion to build the wall and reopen government.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) to  share his thoughts on where we are at today.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   To the gentleman's point, a reminder that in 2006, 64 Democrats in  the House joined the Republicans to pass the Secure Fence Act to build  700 miles of fencing along the border, including Barack Obama, Hillary  Clinton, and Chuck Schumer. Then the next year there was some money in  an appropriations bill for the wall, and both Speaker Pelosi and  Majority Leader Hoyer voted for it. So I think the gentleman is right.  It is time to work together to get this done.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green),  who is a new member of Congress.   I am glad to see Dr. Mark Green. I am glad that he is here. We are  excited to have the gentleman serving with us here in the body and  being a former service member from the Army who is part of the elite  unit that helped capture Saddam Hussein.   The gentleman knows a little bit about security, so I appreciate the  gentleman's sharing his thoughts on where we are at tonight.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for his  perspective, both as a doctor and as a military officer. His speaking  of security means a lot. I think it is a good question.   What number is it going to take?   Are we really going to say: let's work together and let's do this?  [[Page H542]]    I think we need to sit down right now. I am hopeful maybe this week  we will do that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman) to come share what he thinks maybe we could do this week to get  this government opened and at the same time secure our border.    Madam Speaker, I love the analogy that the gentleman  just shared about the Clemson game and going into a football game and  how you have a ticket and there is a fence and you go through a point  of entry and how the system works that way. It is common sense for us.  So I thank the gentleman for sharing that.   I would like to visit with someone else who has a lot of common  sense. We serve on the Committee on Agriculture together. We are from  rural America, and we just have some common sense about these things.   The gentleman is from Washington State, and I would love to hear his  thoughts about the importance of securing our border as well as  reopening government.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse).    Well said. This is so important. And we have a moment  in time right now in the history of our country where we have had the  government--part of it--shut down for 24 days, yet we have, like the  gentleman said, all of these individuals coming into our country, some  of them terrorists or gang members hurting our citizens.   So here is an opportunity to come together and work in a bipartisan  fashion to fix our broken immigration laws. I agree that the DACA  situation needs to be taken care of, and we need more agricultural  workers. We need to expand our visas. We need to expand in several  areas. We need to streamline the process.   Right now there are 600,000 individuals in the process of trying to  come here legally into our country. I don't know if the gentleman has  worked with some of the individuals. I know, in my own district, my  office and I are helping some individuals who are trying to get their  family members here legally.    It has been very interesting to see the paperwork that they have to  go through and the amount of work. The paperwork that I have seen has  been even this high, the documentation that they have to submit. Then  they have money that they pay along the way, and then there is such a  large time frame. Some have waited over a year, 2 years, or more to go  through this process legally.   But it is worth it because they want to live the American Dream, and  I applaud them. But we need to streamline it and help those individuals  who are going through the process to get here and make it easier, the  ones who want to be upright citizens and contribute.   But the problem is that it is not fair, for those 600,000 individuals  who are trying to come here, who are waiting in line, to just have  somebody go  [[Page H543]]  across the border and not follow our laws, disregard our laws. It is  just not right.   So it is important that we build this wall, that we come together in  a bipartisan fashion to find a solution to this, that we find $5.7  billion, which is hardly anything.   You saw the chart earlier from Representative Norman about what a  small sliver of our entire budget that would be. Surely all these lives  of individuals and our families' security and safety are worth finding  that sliver amount of money.   We pay over $50 billion every year in foreign aid, and we want $5.7  billion for a wall. Madam Speaker, $50 billion we send to other  countries, many times for them to secure their border, yet we can't  find $5.7 billion or we can't get support for that from the other side  of the aisle so that we can secure our own border. That just doesn't  make sense.   We can do better.   I appreciate all of my colleagues who have come down tonight to have  this conversation on this topic and to talk about how it can come about  for us to come together to find this solution, reopen government, and  to make sure that we have a secure border for our Nation, to stop the  flow of drugs, and to keep our country safe.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 23 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, January 15, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
