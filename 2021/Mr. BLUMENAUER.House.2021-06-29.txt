 Mr. Speaker, in a moment, we are going to hear the  rule coming forward to support the INVEST in America Act.   I applaud my friend and colleague, Peter DeFazio, for his tireless  efforts to bring Federal transportation policy into the 21st century.   Unlike past reauthorization bills, this legislation is centered  around climate and equity. It makes historic investments in public  transit and returns parity to the Federal share for transit and  highways, while integrating bike-share and share micro-mobility into  transit projects. It invests in Amtrak and high-speed rail, as well as  biking and walking.   Mr. Speaker, I am especially encouraged by the newly created  Reconnecting Neighborhoods Program, which will provide Federal funding  for projects like Albina Vision in my community to rebuild underserved  communities that have been negatively impacted by past transportation  decisions.   Mr. Speaker, by passing this legislation, my community and  communities across the country will be made safer with the  incorporation of my Vision Zero legislation.   This is an unprecedented opportunity to deliver for our country, and  we are ready to get this job done.                            ____________________
