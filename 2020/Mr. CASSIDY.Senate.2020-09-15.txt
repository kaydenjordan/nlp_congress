 Mr. President, at the forbearance of my colleagues, if I  can interpolate, if you will, and I will yield back. Thank you very  much.   As I speak, Hurricane Sally threatens the gulf coast, including parts  of Louisiana. Our prayers are with those in the path of Sally. I just  spoke with the Coast Guard admiral in charge, and the Coast Guard is  ready should there be a need.   But in the concern over Sally and other issues, we must remember the  aftermath of Hurricane Laura, which made landfall August 27 in Cameron,  LA, as a category 4-5 hurricane. In terms of wind speed, this is 150  miles an hour. A more powerful storm in that regard is Katrina, Rita,  Gustav, Ike, and others.   As you might imagine, a storm of such magnitude left death,  destruction, and pain from Southwest Louisiana into Texas to North  Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi.   There were 25 people who died directly or indirectly because of  Hurricane Laura, and hundreds of thousands of lives have been upended.  As one example--one measure--as of yesterday, 145,000 people in  Louisiana have filed for assistance with FEMA. That is expected to grow  to roughly 2,800 people a day applying for assistance.   Now, the sentiment at home is if you are without electricity, as 97  percent of Cameron Parish goes without electricity, and you are without  internet, as most people are, the fear is that  [[Page S5593]]  folks have forgotten about Hurricane Laura, that recovery efforts will  be stalled, and things will be ignored as attention turns to other  issues--COVID-19, Presidential race, et cetera. And, anecdotally, there  is, of course, evidence that public opinion has slipped.   Last week, I spoke with Gail McGovern, the president of the American  Red Cross, who told me that donations are lagging well below that which  the Red Cross had hoped to receive to cover the cost of their response.  She assured me, though, that the Red Cross would still do everything  needed. I saw testimony of that, by the way. I flew from Louisiana to  Washington, DC, yesterday, and the jet was full of Red Cross  volunteers. We are so appreciative.   I assure folks back home, just to say, that I did get a call from  President Trump just as the hurricane hit. He assured me that whatever  resources were needed, he would make sure they were there. As I told  folks in Louisiana, there was an audience of one paying attention, a  very important audience, and that is the President.   In this speech, I hope to continue to bring this hurricane and its  aftermath to the attention of other fellow Americans because fellow  Americans take care of ourselves and take care of each other. So I am  here to be a voice for the people of Louisiana and share a story so  that you may know what we are facing at home.   Again, I am appreciative of the United Way, American Red Cross,  President Trump, and others for swiftly doing all they can do to help  us through this recovery, but let's tell the story.   Here is a wonderful story from Lake Arthur, LA. She probably doesn't  like the fact that I am showing this. She didn't like how she looked. I  think she looks fantastic. This is Bethel Boudreaux, a great American  patriot and a great Louisiana name. If you look at this picture, there  is a tree that has fallen over the guy's house. There is a fellow in  the tree cutting down limbs that is on top of his house. Here she is  with a tree behind her and all the debris associated with it holding up  an American flag. Now, her concern was that if we showed this picture,  we recognize that her husband, a veteran, is familiar with how damaged  flags should be destroyed, but this had been fluttering during the  hurricane, and she just wanted to show it.   She has got a smile. This is 1 or 2 days after this devastating  hurricane. With all this, in the spirit of Americans, she is holding  that flag, and she is smiling. She is a great American patriot, but it  also shows the attitude of Americans and the attitudes of people in  Louisiana. We are resilient in the face of adversity.   There is more than enough adversity to go around. Let me just give  you a couple of stories that are on our Facebook page. Mike Williams  from Lake Charles gave our office a tour of his home. His metal roof  was completely ripped off. Water came all through his house. The  ceiling is falling in, and every single room has extensive water  damage.   There is 20-year-old Hannah Vinson, who shared that her childhood  home was gone. The roof collapsed, flooded, and a tree fell in her  mother's bedroom and all across their yard. She has this semester off  from school because of lack of access and expenses she cannot cover,  even though she works.   She told us:         It's overwhelming. People say why even go back when your       school is destroyed? I start a new career, and that has to       come to an end because where I work is gone now.    There are thousands more stories like theirs. But amid the  devastation, there is hope. I am inspired by those who rushed to help  however they could.   The Cajun Navy is an organization of volunteers who respond to  disasters. They deployed immediately and continue to help today,  delivering thousands of meals, clearing debris, helping people meet  energy needs, and assisting where they can.   I recently went to Central Louisiana to hand out supplies and meet  with storm victims and volunteers. I met a woman named Mandy in  Hineston. Mandy has been loading up trailers of donated groceries. She  takes them to the rural parts of the State, where folks can't access  critical supplies in Central and Western Louisiana. This is a critical  service because folks on the back roads couldn't get out, and there was  a gas shortage in some storm-affected areas.   While I do believe Hurricane Laura recovery needs more attention  nationally, I am so thankful for the thousands of workers who came to  rebuild the electrical grid, as well as individuals and churches and  nonprofits who came to help. There is a Facebook video from YAIPaks--a  nonprofit organization in Clarksville, TN--who came down to Lake  Charles with portable showers and trailers of supplies. The lady in the  video said they handed out so many meals that they lost count.   I cannot say thank you enough to our fellow Americans and those from  Louisiana who saw a need and answered the call to serve. Now I ask my  colleagues to do the same.   Local governments' resources have been stretched to the limit because  of COVID-19--tax base destroyed. Damage assessments are still underway,  but we will likely need a disaster supplemental from Congress to  continue the recovery. I ask my fellow Senators to consider the plight  of Hurricane Laura victims and support such a bill, which should  include California due to the terrible wildfires and perhaps those  affected by Sally. Our prayers are with all of those as well.   Local government resources have been stretched to the limit because  of COVID-19 in Louisiana, but I suspect in California and Alabama and  Mississippi as well.   In June, I introduced legislation to do away with the FEMA cost share  for local governments for 2020--for this year--given the strain on  their budgets caused by COVID. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.   Lastly, let's just reassure my constituents in Louisiana that they  are not forgotten. The largest storm in our State's history made news  for about 2 days with hardly a mention after. Don't forget about  Hannah, who lost her childhood home and her job, or about Mike, who  lost his house to the rain and wind, and about the nearly 150,000  people asking for help.   Americans are at our best when we help those in need. The time is now  to extend that support once more.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
