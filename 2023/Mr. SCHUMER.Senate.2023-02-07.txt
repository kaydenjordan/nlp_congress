 Mr. President, first a little housekeeping business, and  then we will get to the statement.   First, I understand that there is a bill at the desk that is due for  a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar, under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding.    Mr. President, I want to begin by offering my prayers to  everyone affected by the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria.  Over 6,000 have been reported dead. It is just awful--awful. You see  the pictures, and you ache. We stand ready to help however we can.                            ____________________     Tonight, President Biden will come before a joint  session of Congress and deliver his State of the Union to the American  people. It is a chance for all of us to hear directly from the  Commander in Chief about the tremendous progress we have made as a  nation, the challenges we have overcome in recent years, and how  Democrats are keeping our promises to make the lives of the American  people better.   I expect the President will make the case clearly and convincingly  that today the United States is far better off than it was a year ago.  Inflation is coming down; wages are going up; gas prices have eased at  last; unemployment is near record lows; and the pandemic, after causing  so much suffering, so much destruction, no longer dominates our lives.  Our work is not finished, but today we can confidently say America is  headed in the right direction thanks to President Biden's leadership  and thanks to the work of a strong, unified Democratic Party in  Congress.   As Americans listen to President Biden, I am confident they will see  the glaring contrast between Democratic unity on the one hand and  Republican chaos on the other. Democrats remain laser-focused on  delivering our people-first agenda. Every bill Democrats passed last  Congress was written with average Americans in mind, from the American  Rescue Plan to the infrastructure bill, to the Inflation Reduction Act,  to gun safety, marriage equality, and so, so much more.   Let's just take one example out of many. It is an important example  but just one. Senate Democrats worked very hard to deliver a $35  insulin cap for every American on Medicare, but, of course, we want to  go further. We tried to get it for everybody before reconciliation, but  the reconciliation bill only allowed us to pass, in the IRA, an insulin  cap for some Americans. When  [[Page S246]]  an amendment was offered to add everybody in, unfortunately we did not  get enough Republicans to vote for it. But this idea deserves new life  and bipartisan cooperation in this Congress, and I look forward to  hearing more from the President tonight.   Very soon, Americans are going to feel the benefits of our agenda in  their daily lives. Implementation is going to be a top priority for  Senate Democrats in the months to come. Not everyone has the time to  follow what happens in Congress day by day, but when we actually start  doing things, implementing the bills, oh, it gets out.   Just look at my home State of New York. After we passed  infrastructure, many people didn't hear about it. To others, it was a  line in the newspaper--oh, they have a bipartisan infrastructure bill.  But last week, when the President came to New York to celebrate  Gateway, you could feel the exaltation and excitement in the city. That  is going to start happening again and again everywhere, in every State,  in every community, as these large bills that helped American families  are implemented and people see the actual results in their communities.   So let me say it again. Democrats are proud we stuck together and  delivered on an agenda that lowered costs, lifted America out of  crisis, and helped lay a foundation for future prosperity. Our MAGA  Republicans cannot claim the same. On the very first day in the new  majority, House Republicans passed a bill not to help average Americans  but, rather, that helps the ultrarich so they can avoid paying their  fair share in taxes. The bottom line is, these people who are going to  be added to the IRS are going to focus on all of those who are much  richer than the average American but pay at a much lower rate. But the  Republicans couldn't go for that. Those are the people they want to  represent. Then they hardly stopped there. In just 1 month, the MAGA  House majority has doubled down on their war on women, tripled down on  their asinine national sales tax proposal, and Republicans continue to  hold the full faith and credit of the United States hostage to their  radical agenda.    In the coming months, nothing will require more cooperation and  serious-mindedness than lifting the debt ceiling. I was glad to work  with both Presidents Biden and Trump to lift the debt ceiling over the  past couple of years. We did it without political blackmail, without  brinkmanship. But Speaker McCarthy and many of his House MAGA  Republicans are taking the debt ceiling hostage and basically saying:  Our way or the highway. Agree to cuts or we won't lift the debt  ceiling.   That is not going to work, plain and simple. History shows that those  who try to threaten their way to an agreement end up losing.   If Speaker McCarthy is insistent on spending cuts, which we Democrats  will strongly oppose, he has an obligation to take the next step and  actually say what those cuts are for. We will oppose tying the debt  ceiling to these types of cuts. The debt ceiling is debts we have  already incurred and should be paid without brinkmanship, without  adding things to the agenda, which risks a great deal for the American  people.   So what are the Republicans asking for? They say they want cuts. What  are they? Are Republicans going to ax Social Security or Medicare? We  think it is not enough for the Speaker to just say he doesn't want to  make those cuts, because Members of his own party, including some of  the very MAGA Republicans he followed in the first week of his session,  are saying otherwise, and they have shown--some of them--that they can  get their way in the new majority. Speaker McCarthy needs to prove he  won't cut Social Security and Medicare by showing us the plan, his  plan.   What about funding for national defense? Our military just shot down  the Chinese spy balloon. Are Republicans seriously thinking about  cutting defense on some bogus claims of fighting a ``woke agenda''?  What the heck does that mean?   Republicans, show us the specific cuts. Show us the plan.   What about families and children who rely on nutrition aid? The  chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee recently said they are  still looking at cuts to SNAP benefits at a time when children are  hungry and groceries are far too expensive. This is from the party that  cut taxes for billionaires and mega corporations back in 2017. If  making sure hungry children have enough to eat is part of the ``woke  agenda,'' then we sure don't have the same definition.   Look, I know it is not easy for this new majority. The 20 or so  extremists who dictated the House rules package can now thwart whatever  proposal the Speaker wants to come up with if they feel the cuts don't  go far enough. So I am gravely concerned that things will be very, very  hard for the Speaker to manage, if he can come up with a plan at all.   All this brings us back to what Democrats have been insisting on from  the very beginning: No brinkmanship. No hostage-taking. Let's lift the  debt ceiling together. Let's pay the debts that Democrats and  Republicans, including Donald Trump, already incurred without  ultimatums.   Tonight, I expect the President will make this very clear to the  American people, and it will be the responsibility of House Republicans  to show that they take the debt ceiling seriously before they create an  unprecedented crisis that will wreak havoc on every single American.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on the Chinese surveillance balloon,  I strongly--very strongly--condemn President Xi's brazen incursion into  American airspace with the Chinese surveillance balloon, and I commend  President Biden for being calm, calculated, and effective in taking  down the balloon over water to ensure the safety of Americans on the  ground and to ensure we maximize our intelligence gains as we examine  this balloon, which is far less likely to burn and crash into a million  pieces in water than over land.   Instead of criticizing China, I was shocked to hear MAGA  Republicans--before they even knew what was happening, before they even  knew the whole story--direct their criticism toward the President,  saying that we should have shot down the balloon the moment we saw it.  So it is clear that the MAGA Republican criticism was at best premature  and at worst political.   This is one area where we don't need politics. We need Democrats and  Republicans to come together to condemn China and be a unified front  against the CCP.   President Biden and his team did the right thing. They waited and  took down the balloon carefully, precisely, and with what both the  military and intelligence experts urged them to do. Had the President  not gone along with what the military said, I can imagine that some of  these same Republicans, so highly political in their criticism, would  have then criticized the President for not listening to the military  leaders. But now we can recover most of the equipment and begin to  analyze the technology in the way it was done.   Again, I applaud President Biden for his leadership. And on Thursday,  all Senators--all Senators--we have upgraded this. Because so many  Senators wanted a briefing, I asked the administration to do it as an  all-Senators briefing instead of the Gang of 8, and that is what is  going to happen. So all Senators will receive a classified briefing  from administration officials on the surveillance balloon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, finally, on the Fourth Circuit,  before Senators join with our House colleagues for the State of the  Union, the Senate will take its first judicial nomination vote of the  Congress by advancing DeAndrea Benjamin to serve as a circuit court  judge--a circuit court judge--for the Fourth Circuit. If confirmed,  Judge Benjamin would make history as only the second woman of color to  sit on that court, a long overdue step in making sure the bench  reflects the vibrancy of the Fourth Circuit. Judge Benjamin's  credentials are unassailable, and I thank my Republican colleagues in  the Judiciary Committee who supported her.   The Senate is going to continue prioritizing judicial confirmations  on the floor of this Congress. We have a  [[Page S247]]  lot of outstanding men and women coming out of the Judiciary very soon,  and we will work quickly to move them out of this Chamber and onto the  bench.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 5.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 9.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, February 7, be  waived.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
