 Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague  from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, in introducing the Lifespan Respite  Care Reauthorization Act of 2017.   Every day, an estimated 43 million family caregivers attend to loved  ones who are experiencing chronic, disabling health conditions. While  many of these individuals care for an older adult, almost one-third of  caregivers attend to persons under the age of 50. Caregivers help  individuals remain at home, often delaying the need for nursing home or  foster care placements. The value of their efforts are tremendous,  amounting to more than $470 billion in uncompensated care. This task,  however, can take a toll. Caregivers experience higher mortality rates  and are more likely to acquire acute and chronic health conditions.  That is why respite care is so important. It provides temporary relief  to caregivers from their ongoing responsibilities, reducing the toll  they experience. Respite care helps keep caregivers healthy, keeps  families intact, and provides a substantial public value.   Recently, the Senate Aging Committee, which I chair, held a hearing  on age-friendly communities. Meg Callaway, the project director of the  Piscataquis Thriving in Place Coalition in Dover-Foxcroft, ME,  testified that ``the one most critical service is respite.'' We have  heard this time and time again.   In 2006, when the Lifespan Respite Care Act was originally enacted,  the goal was to improve the delivery and quality of respite care  available to all caregivers. Since that time, 35 States and the  District of Columbia have received grants to increase the availability  and quality or respite services.   Still, with an increasing number of Americans with chronic conditions  who require some amount of caregiver support on a daily basis, the need  for respite care continues to increase and outpace available resources.   The legislation that we are introducing would authorize $15 million  per year for 5 years, through 2022, to extend the program. Such funding  would provide competitive grants to States to establish or enhance  statewide Lifespan Respite systems that maximize existing resources and  help ensure that quality respite care is available and accessible to  all family caregivers. This reauthorization also would require grantees  to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and activities  funded under such grants.   Thirty-six aging and disability organizations have endorsed the  Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act, including the ARCH National  Respite Network, the Alzheimer's Association, the Michael J. Fox  Foundation, and the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 1973, when Senator Margaret Chase  Smith returned to private life and her hometown of Skowhegan, ME, she  brought with her hundreds of thousands of documents, photographs,  recordings, and memorabilia accumulated during her remarkable 33 years  of public service. Nine years later, in 1982, with the support and  encouragement of her many friends and admirers, her dream of  establishing a library was realized. Today I wish to commemorate the  35th anniversary of the Margaret Chase Smith Library.   The Margaret Chase Smith Library is one of our Nation's premier  freestanding congressional libraries, a priceless archive and museum,  and an invaluable educational center. From the very start, it was  Senator Smith's wish for the library to be more than a storehouse of  papers and a collection of mementos. She wanted it to be a place of  aspirations, an institution where students would be inspired to public  service. She wanted it to be a source of insight and information for  historical scholarship from the perspective of a historic leader. Just  as important, she wanted it to be a place where citizens would come  together to discuss important policy issues in an atmosphere of  civility and respect.   Senator Smith did more than wish for those things; she worked to  bring them about. From opening day in August of 1982 until shortly  before her passing in 1995, she presided over the facility, meeting  with schoolchildren, researchers, policymakers, and engaged citizens.  The library as it exists today stands on the foundation of a great  leader's commitment to service.   This great accomplishment is the work of many hands. Outstanding  directors, dedicated staff, an exceptional board of directors,  Northwood University, the Margaret Chase Smith Policy  [[Page S3093]]  Center at the University of Maine, the Margaret Chase Smith Foundation,  and Senator Smith's close friend and adviser, Merton Henry, have worked  together in a collaborative spirit that pays the highest tribute to  Senator Smith and her legacy.   That legacy is, above all, a reminder of the obligation we all share  to uphold the values and ideals of our Nation. Thanks to the Margaret  Chase Smith Library, that message remains strong. I congratulate its  staff and many supporters on this 35th anniversary and know that this  library will continue to inspire us for generations to come.                            ____________________
