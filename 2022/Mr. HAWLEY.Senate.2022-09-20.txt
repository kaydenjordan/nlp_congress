 Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 1137,  Travis LeBlanc, of Maryland, to be a Member of the Privacy and Civil  Liberties Oversight Board for a term expiring January 29, 2028.  (Reappointment).                            ____________________
