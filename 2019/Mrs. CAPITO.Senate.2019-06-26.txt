 Mr. President, I rise to address two very important  bills that are before the Senate this week--the National Defense  Authorization Act and the border supplemental appropriations bill.   First, on the NDAA, I am pleased that this bill meets the needs of  our all-volunteer force by providing the brave men and women with one  of the largest raises in a decade, that of 3.1 percent. With the rising  threat of countries such as China, Russia, and Iran, this NDAA  authorizes funding for crucial defense efforts to make certain that our  military is well prepared and equipped to defend this Nation from the  threats and challenges we face.   The NDAA substitute actually includes an amendment I offered, joined  by my Senate Environment and Public Works chairman, John Barrasso, of  Wyoming, by Ranking Member Carper, and by several other bipartisan  cosponsors. This amendment will formally address the PFAS contamination  about which I have spoken on the floor. It directly mirrors my  legislation, the PFAS Release Disclosure and Protection Act, which the  committee approved last week.   PFAS pollution is a nationwide problem, but its effects are  concentrated locally, often in rural and disadvantaged communities,  especially those near military installations where large volumes of  certain firefighting foams have been deployed. Significant exposure to  the legacy compounds of PFOA and PFOS have been linked to rare cancers  and developmental issues.   I got involved with this issue because it is important but also  because two communities in West Virginia were all too familiar with the  PFAS contamination and its effects--Parkersburg, WV, which has endured  a history of industrial PFAS contamination, and Martinsburg, which has  been impacted by the use of firefighting foams.   My amendment will provide certainty to our citizens that the water  coming out of their taps is safe--in my opinion, that is really not  much to ask--by requiring that the EPA set a safe drinking water  standard for PFOS and PFOA within 2 years and that it look at  regulating other types of PFAS chemicals as the science would merit.   It also provides funding and technical assistance to ensure that  small and rural water systems can monitor and address this  contamination. That is a big issue for our rural State. We have a lot  of small water systems, and we want them to have the same access to the  science but also to the remediation that large systems have.   My legislation will also improve transparency by requiring emitters  to report to the EPA the release of any of one of hundreds of PFAS  compounds into the environment. Sure, we want to know that. Sure, we  do. This information is essential for citizens, their local  governments, and Federal agencies to be able to quickly and adequately  respond to this pollution before it pervades the water or the soil. I  think this increased accountability will contribute to there being  fewer PFAS emissions in the first place.   Several other bipartisan provisions will accelerate research into  PFAS and their effects on human health and the environment. It will  ensure collaboration between Federal agencies and municipalities in  addressing the challenges posed by contamination, and it will support  the research and development into cleaning up these persistent  compounds.   Crucially, this approach is rooted in science and a formal rulemaking  process. We have put the Federal Government on a shot clock to act to  end agencies' endless delays in addressing these challenges without  short-circuiting the regulatory procedures.   Make no mistake--PFAS are essential to commerce, but some have been  shown to carry substantial risks. This balanced regulatory strategy  should provide the confidence to Americans that we are serious about  protecting them from this pollution while also not upending the  economy.   Another important environmental provision that is included in the  NDAA substitute is the USE IT Act, which I introduced with Senator  Whitehouse, Ranking Member Carper, and its lead  [[Page S4532]]  sponsor, Chairman Barrasso. The USE IT Act follows up on the bipartisan  expansion of the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, utilization, and  storage, which was passed last Congress.   CCUS is key to eliminating CO2 emissions while protecting  West Virginia's coal and natural gas jobs. Trying to weave that balance  is difficult sometimes, but the USE IT Act would provide CCUS project  sponsors with a regulatory playbook so that they would know what  Federal agencies' expectations are at the start of the process. This is  essential for capital-intensive projects in their drawing private  investment without having the fear of getting trapped in a regulatory  purgatory.   Our decades-old environmental statutes never predicted a situation in  which emissions would be captured and then actually used for an  economic benefit. Carbon provides that opportunity, but regulatory  standards that do not reflect this new reality, like New Source Review,  sometimes get in the way. The USE IT Act addresses these issues, and it  will also fund studies into the pollution reduction benefits of these  technologies.   This is the sort of bipartisan and consensus-driven approach that  will have a meaningful impact on emissions while it will protect jobs  and drive innovation in the American economy, and I am glad that we are  taking a significant step toward enacting this bill.   I thank Chairman Inhofe and the Armed Services Committee for their  excellent work on the NDAA. It is important that we pass this bill this  week.                                  H.R. 3401    Mr. President, I am also pleased that the Senate will soon vote to  pass bipartisan legislation to provide resources that will address the  humanitarian crisis at our southern border. I am the chairman of the  Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations, and I have spoken  many times about the need to pass a supplemental funding bill.   Last night, the House of Representatives passed its version of the  emergency border supplemental.   Actually, to be more accurate, I would say the Democrats in the House  passed their partisan version of a Homeland Security bill. I think the  top-line numbers in the House bill may be similar, but the policy  implications of that bill are vast.   Time is of the essence here. I spoke about this last week on the  floor. Time is moving quickly to meet this crisis that everyone agrees  is occurring at our southern border.   The partisan House bill would be vetoed by President Trump. What is  needed is not more partisanship; what is needed is a bill that will  become law so that we can get those resources to the southern border.  That is why I am encouraged and proud that a bipartisan compromise was  reached in the Senate Appropriations Committee. We passed it out of  that committee 30 to 1 last week.   We may not agree on how we got here or how best to move forward, but  we agree that there is a crisis--a major crisis--and that these  resources are needed now. The metrics, the images, and the stories we  all see and hear point to the urgency of this dire situation, so our  committee worked in a serious and bipartisan way, under the leadership  of Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy, to address the pressing  issues as they are right now.   We can and we must work toward a long-term solution to address the  immigration system, but right now, today, we all agree that a problem  exists, and our committee has provided a bipartisan solution, which the  leader just said we will be voting on later this afternoon. Let us move  forward in that spirit on behalf of the families and the men and women  in law enforcement who need our support. It is tough down there. I  visited; it is tough.   It is crucial that the Senate pass the bipartisan border supplemental  funding bill that we passed in the Appropriations Committee last week,  and I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting it today. We  have waited long enough. We can't afford to wait any longer.
