 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Martin A. Treptow  who bravely served as a private in the U.S. Army during the First World  War.   Martin enlisted in the Iowa National Guard in 1917 while working as a  barber in Cherokee, IA, and was soon stationed in France as part of the  168th Infantry of the 42nd Division, the famed Rainbow Division. During  the assault on Hill 212 on La Croix Rouge Farm, Martin courageously  volunteered to deliver an important message to another platoon, despite  heavy enemy fire. Martin successfully completed his mission but paid  the ultimate sacrifice in doing so.   As his belongings were being prepared to send home to his family and  friends, Martin's diary was found. His diary included an entry entitled  ``My Pledge,'' and Martin had written: ``America must win this war.  Therefore, I will work, I will save, I will ensure, I will fight  cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle  depended on me alone.''   I ask my colleagues to join me as I proudly recognize Martin A.  Treptow, whose heroic actions and inspiring words epitomize the duty  and sacrifice of all the brave men and women who serve and have served  the United States in defense of our freedom.                            ____________________
