 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and recognize the  wonderful career of Amy Button Renz.   Like many, Amy began her career in Washington, DC, where she interned  for both Senator Bob Dole and Representative Garner Shriver during the  summer of 1974. After graduating from Kansas State University in the  spring of 1976, Amy came back to DC, where she worked for Senator Roman  Hruska until his retirement that December. Her time in public service  was not over, as she moved back to Kansas to work for State Senator Ron  Hein during the 1977 legislative session.   After her time in the Kansas Statehouse, Amy began her career with  the Kansas State University Alumni Association in 1977. She would be  named president and CEO of the alumni association in 1994, becoming the  first female alumni director in the history of the Big Eight and later  the Big 12 conference. Throughout her career, she has been crucial in  the development of programming efforts, most notably as the lead  fundraiser for the alumni center building campaign as well as serving  as the chair of several search committees that have brought key  administrator to Kansas State University. She has raised millions of  dollars for student scholarships, and has always put the students of  Kansas State University first.   Amy has been recognized for her servant leadership ceaselessly. In  2009 she received the Staley School of Leadership Mike Holen  Outstanding Leadership Award, and in 2012 she was selected for the  Directors Award by the K-State Marching Band. That same year, she was  the recipient of the inaugural Amethyst Award, the University's highest  award honoring those for their extraordinary contributions to K-State.  Her influence extends past the university, as she was recognized with  the Lyle Butler Distinguished Leadership Award from the Manhattan  Chamber of Commerce in 2020.   Amy is a third generation K-Stater, and has earned two degrees from  the University, a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's  degree in public administration. Her husband, Allen, is a K-Stater, as  are her three children. Her last day at the Kansas State University  Alumni Association will be on June 30th, 2023. Her leadership and  devotion will certainly be missed, but always remembered.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Amy's outstanding  career, as well as thank her for 45+ years of service to Kansas State  University. Amy is a true inspiration to those around her, fighting  ever fighting for a wildcat victory.                            ____________________
