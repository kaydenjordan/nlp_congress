 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Intelligence Committee be authorized to meet today with the Director of  National Counterintelligence, and he is also leading the election  security efforts on behalf of the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence--that that meeting occur during today's session of the  Senate.    Mr. President, if I may, just for a moment, just for the  information of the Members, then, who are on the committee, we will not  be having the hearing today on the issue of election security with the  person leading that effort. It is a priority of many here.   We are scheduled to have the Director of National Intelligence  tomorrow to discuss that and many more topics of great importance that  I know a lot of people here have been saying we need to be having  briefings over. I hope that if, in fact, the Democratic leader intends  to object to that, that we should know that today as well, I hope, so  that the Members will know that and make arrangements accordingly.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a family-owned  small business with an outstanding record of innovation and industry  leadership. This week, it is my pleasure to honor Beckwith Electric  Company, Inc., of Largo, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 1967, Robert W. Beckwith established Beckwith Electric in Illinois  to provide equipment and services for electric utility providers.  Robert, an electric engineer, was a prolific inventor who held more  than 30 patents during his lifetime. Under his leadership, Beckwith  Electric developed several products integral to electric utilities,  including the first solid state tapchanger control in 1968 and  microprocessor protective relay in 1981. As the company grew, Robert  relocated Beckwith Electric to Largo, FL, in 1974. Like many Floridian  small businesses, Beckwith Electric's facilities were completely  destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Through careful planning,  innovation, and an emphasis on customer service, Beckwith Electric  rebuilt its facilities and continued to grow.   Today, Beckwith Electric Company is one of the largest manufacturing  companies in the Tampa area. Richard's son, Thomas Beckwith, serves as  chief executive officer and led the company to a 33-percent increase in  growth last year. Beckwith Electric designs and manufactures all of its  products, including components for electrical power grids, generators,  and protective relays for transformers at its Largo, FL, facility.  These items protect, strengthen, and increase the efficiency of  electric utility networks. As part of the U.S. critical industrial  base, Beckwith Electric's products are found in military installations,  hospitals, and schools. They work with electric utilities,  manufacturers, and producers of alternative sources of energy  worldwide. They also contributed to rebuilding Iraq's power grid during  Operation Iraqi Freedom.   Over the years, Beckwith Electric has been recognized for excellence  in their industrial field and for their educational programs.  Partnering with St. Petersburg College and Pinellas County Schools,  Beckwith Electric regularly hosts educational workshops and technical  training programs. In 2012, they earned the Florida Sterling Council  Challenger Award. Beckwith has also earned several local and national  awards from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers-- IEEE--the industry's professional society. They partner with IEEE in  hosting continuing education workshops for industry professionals.   Like many other Floridian small businesses, Beckwith Electric Company  was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. An essential business, they  managed to stay open, keep their employees safe, and play a key role in  keeping our nation's electrical utilities running smoothly. In April  2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck  Protection Program, a small business relief program that I was proud to  author. The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses  and nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Thanks to their PPP loan, Beckwith Electric saved 20 jobs, while paying  all of their 185 employees.   Beckwith Electric Company demonstrates the key role that small  businesses play in our Nation's critical infrastructure and industrial  manufacturing base. I commend their innovation, resilience, and high- quality work. Congratulations to Thomas and the entire team at Beckwith  Electric Company. I look forward to watching your continued innovation  and growth in Florida and beyond.                            ____________________
