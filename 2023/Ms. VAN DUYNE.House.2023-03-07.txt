 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and welcome to  Washington, D.C., a group of dedicated nursing and respiratory therapy  students and professionals from West Coast University and American  Career College.   West Coast University first opened its Dallas, Texas, campus in 2012  and has since established a state-of-the-art facility in Richardson,  providing important education to thousands of students.   These colleges play a vital role in expanding access to nursing  education and addressing workforce shortages among healthcare  professionals across the United States. They are committed to preparing  the next generation of healthcare professionals to meet our country's  rising demand for care.   As the daughter of a nurse, I know firsthand that our healthcare  workers are our heroes. My mom worked the graveyard shift so she could  be there to tuck my brother and I into bed and be home for us when we  woke up.   Please join me in welcoming these fine students to our Nation's  Capital as they share with Congress their experience, passion, and  perspective on providing quality nursing and healthcare.                            ____________________
