 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made       available by this Act may be used with respect to Yemen in       contravention of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et       seq.), including for the introduction of United States armed       or military forces into hostilities in Yemen, into situations       in Yemen where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly       indicated by the circumstances, or into Yemeni territory,       airspace, or waters while equipped for combat, in       contravention of the congressional consultation and reporting       requirements of sections 3 and 4 of such Resolution.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Davidson) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to encourage my colleagues to  support this amendment which simply says that none of these funds may  be used in contravention of the War Powers Act in Yemen.   We are involved in a critical effort to defeat enemies of our country  who took action on 9/11. Al-Qaida and their affiliates have been  declared enemies, an authorized force, for nearly 16 years now. And in  Yemen, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has found sanctuary.   Unfortunately, we also find ourselves in conflict with other enemies  there. It is clear that the Houthis, who are Shia, are not affiliates  of al-Qaida. In fact, they are engaged in a civil war there.   Over the years, we have sold arms and munitions, built a great  alliance with a good ally in Saudi Arabia, and they are involved there.  An enemy of the United States, Iran, is also involved as supporters of  the Houthis, and so it is important to maintain our relationship with  our ally Saudi Arabia.   It is important to recognize the strategic, operational, and tactical  threats posed by Iran and their proxies like the Houthis, but it is  also important that  [[Page H6505]]  we restore the emphasis of Article I of our Constitution and our clear  duty in Congress to authorize our Nation's wars. So this amendment  simply says nothing outside of the War Powers Act may be engaged in  without further future authorization.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I respect the arguments of my colleagues  in support of our national command authority. I wholeheartedly support  that. In fact, I wore our Nation's uniform for nearly 12 years, served  in Ranger Regiment, though I was not involved as a combat veteran.   I would not want to do anything to limit our ability to fight and win  the war on terror. Indeed, the sole intent of this is to keep us laser- focused where we can. Resources are scarce, and the need to focus on  defeating our enemies who have already been authorized by combat to  engage in combat is critical.   In fact, it does alarm me to see that there is some concern that this  is overly broad and limiting, as it is the law of the land. The War  Powers Act is recognized as something that does give our Commanders  flexibility. It gives them 90 days to engage in combat anywhere where  there is a clear and present danger to the national security of the  United States.   That could very well happen in that region of the country. The waters  are tight. The threats are real. As I said, there are strategic,  operational, and tactical concerns at play.   But this is nothing different than what President Eisenhower foresaw.  In an enduring conflict, he said: ``We face a hostile ideology global  in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in  method.   ``Unhappily, the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite  duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the  emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which  enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the  burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle--with liberty at stake.  Only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted  course toward permanent peace and human betterment.''    I couldn't say it better, so I borrowed President Eisenhower's words.   I hope we can respect our Constitution, as our duty under it, the  oath we have sworn to support and defend it, to limit the scope of our  war to things that are Congress-authorized and not passive-aggressively  through funding and cutting the checks, but through full authorization.  We do not have such authorizations with respect to the Houthis, whether  they are in Yemen or other Iranian proxies outside the scope of the War  Powers Act.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Lamborn). The question is on the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson).   The amendment was rejected.                   Amendment No. 47 Offered by Mr. DeSantis    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 47  printed in part B of House Report 115-261.   Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. _.  None of the finds made available by this Act may       be used to purchase heavy water from Iran.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. DeSantis) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.   Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a very simple  limitation amendment: No funds made available by this act may be used  to purchase heavy water from the Islamic Republic of Iran.   Why are we doing this?   If you remember, the JCPOA provided Iran with $150 billion in  sanctions relief, even had the appalling spectacle of planes hauling in  $1.7 billion in cold, hard cash, dropped off in Tehran. So this regime  has been flush with money as a result of the nuclear deal done during  the Obama administration.   One of the frustrating things about that was that, even after that  deal is enacted, even after all this money is flowing as a result of  the deal, the Obama administration--this was not even required by the  deal--sent millions of dollars to Iran in order to get heavy water. And  that was not required by the deal. That was a gratuitous transaction,  but it certainly provided more economic--an even greater economic  lifeline to Iran.   This is still, to this day, the world's leading state sponsor of  terrorism. They are fomenting discord all around the Middle East, in  Lebanon, in Syria. They fund Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They are  supporting the Houthis in Yemen. They have major control over portions  of Iraq, and the Shiite militias that they back are running rampant.   Remember, they were probably the leading source of U.S. servicemember  deaths in Iraq during the Iraq campaign. They funded Shiite militias.  They had their Quds Force from Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps on the  ground in Iraq; and certainly, hundreds of our servicemembers, some  estimates say as many as 1,500 servicemembers, were killed from some of  these Iranian proxies. They have never been held accountable for that.  [[Page H6506]]                                     time  1600    Now this administration came in saying the Iran deal was a bad deal.  They haven't left the deal. They haven't really done anything to fight  back against the deal, and I hope that will happen. But in the  meantime, I want to make sure that this administration is not repeating  the mistakes of the Obama administration. No more taxpayer dollars to  the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
