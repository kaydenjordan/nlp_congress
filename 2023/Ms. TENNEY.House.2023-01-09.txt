 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Family and  Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act.   I am a small manufacturing businessowner, and I have also worked as a  tax attorney, so I know firsthand the kind of power that the IRS has  over our small businessowners and lower- and middle-income taxpayers.   Last year, to fund their leftwing agenda, the Democrats in Congress  decided to spend your hard-earned tax dollars on 87,000 new IRS agents,  making the IRS nearly the size of the U.S. Marine Corps.   The Biden administration claims these agents will not set their  sights on hardworking Americans. The facts reveal the opposite. The  Democrats claim these new audits will only affect Americans making over  $400,000. The facts prove otherwise.   However, the investment of $80 billion with over $40 billion being  spent for enforcement will exact just a fraction of the revenue they  hope to get to fund their spending sprees. The American taxpayers  deserve better.   The truth is their plan will target middle- and lower-income  taxpayers. The CBO agrees, and it released a finding that said  additional agents will lead to as many as 700,000 more audits on  Americans making less than $75,000 a year.   The core principle of our system of government is innocent until  proven guilty, not guilty until proven innocent as the IRS attempts to  do.   I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 23.
