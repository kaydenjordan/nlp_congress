 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of my city of  Minneapolis, who are angry, who are sick, who are tired of being  murdered at the hands of police.   I rise on behalf of Jamar Clark, who was shot in the back and killed  by Minneapolis police in 2015.   I rise on behalf of Philando Castile, who was brutally murdered by  police.   I rise on behalf of Black mothers, like myself, who stay up worried  every single night so that their sons can come home safe.   I rise on behalf of Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Frederick Gray.   I rise on behalf of George Floyd, who was brutally murdered, and his  brutal murder touched our Nation.   I rise because so many can no longer rise. When we build a system  that provides equal justice for everyone here in America, we might  finally all rise.                                time  1545
