 Mr. President, it is the 13th of December and, of course,  with the holidays coming up, my thoughts today are with the families  who will have an empty seat at their dinner table this year. The pain  of losing a loved one never goes away. But for many families, the  feelings of grief are only magnified by a lack of closure.   More than 22 years have passed since the attacks on September 11, and  the families of victims of that terrorist act are still fighting for  justice.   To support that fight, Senator Schumer--the majority leader--and I  introduced the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act--otherwise  known as JASTA--which became law in 2016. This made it possible for the  people affected by 9/11 to bring a civil suit against foreign sponsors  of terrorism. It didn't say who they were or make a judgment as to the  outcome, but it made it possible for them to go to court and attempt to  make their case.   Like any other victim of a horrific attack, the 9/11 families deserve  justice; and that is exactly what JASTA has sought to provide.   Over the last several years, it has become clear that JASTA needs  technical fixes, primarily because of the mixed interpretation about  exactly what Congress intended. Some parties, including countries  accused of financing and sponsoring terrorism, have exploited these  perceived loopholes in the law and claimed total immunity from  lawsuits. It is certainly not our intention.   This flies in the face of the text, the structure, and the intent of  Congress. And we need to enact these technical fixes so this law can  carry out its original promise, which is to provide victims with a path  toward justice.  [[Page S5934]]    So earlier this year, I introduced legislation to make these  important technical corrections. And I appreciate, in particular,  Senator Blumenthal--the Senator from Connecticut--Congressman Van Drew,  and Congressman Nadler in the House for working with us.   I am disappointed that the Senate has not yet taken up and passed  JASTA, but I remain as committed as ever to continuing to support the  9/11 families and hold sponsors of international terrorism accountable.   This measure has strong bipartisan support. It passed twice. The  original JASTA passed twice by unanimous vote in the Senate. We  actually overrode a Presidential veto. But these additional technical  fixes need to be done. And I will continue to fight to pass the bill  when we return next month.                          Senate Legislative Agenda    Mr. President, on another matter, we all know from our school  experience that students across America come home from school with a  report card in hand to show their parents the grades they earned-- whether it is math, science, English, or other subjects. Of course,  report cards aren't the be-all and end-all, but they do provide parents  with a good snapshot of how their children are doing and where they  might be struggling.   Here in the Senate, we are nearly halfway through the 118th Congress.  And this seems like a good opportunity for our majority party who are  in charge of the agenda here to receive the same sort of evaluation.  After all, their ability to run this Chamber impacts every State, city,  and community across the country. And, unfortunately, they haven't  earned high marks.   So here is the report card for the Democratic majority in 2023. Let's  look at government funding first. Thanks to the chair and vice chair of  the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Senate was on track to return  to regular order this year.   It, actually, was really good work by Senator Murray and Senator  Collins to get the Appropriations Committee back to work again. The  committee actually passed all 12 appropriations bills before the Senate  adjourned for the August recess, giving the majority leader plenty of  time to move these bills across the Senate floor.   Despite that long runway, the majority leader didn't even attempt to  put an appropriations bill on the Senate floor until mid-September,  nearly 3 months after the first funding bill passed the committee.   Well, it is no surprise, given the late date that the majority leader  finally sought to determine to act, that we didn't have enough time to  complete the job. So at the end of the fiscal year, which is the end of  September, we had to pass a short-term continuing resolution to fund  the government until November. And then that November deadline came and  went once again. And we had to kick the can down the road once more, to  January 19.   So when the Senate returns in January, we will have to hit the ground  running because we are up against not just one but two funding  deadlines. One is January 19 and the other is February 2.   So we will see whether the majority leader allows the Senate to  actually make some progress toward considering those appropriations  bills before we run up against one or both of those deadlines.   Well, the next major piece of legislation we have is the National  Defense Authorization Act--otherwise known around here as the NDAA--one  of the most important bills that the Senate considers every year.   The NDAA should have been signed into law by the end of September,  but the majority leader decided to delay it until now. We will finally  complete that work either later today or tomorrow. The Senate will  finally pass this bill--which should have been passed by the end of the  fiscal year in September--this week, more than 2 months behind  schedule.   Once again, the delay was completely avoidable. Our colleagues on the  Senate Armed Services Committee, on a bipartisan basis, completed their  work in June, and this legislation passed the full Senate in July. We  had plenty of time to resolve the differences between the Senate and  the House version; but, unfortunately, we squandered that time. So here  we are.   The majority leader waited until November 16--nearly 4 months after  the Senate bill passed--to begin the formal conference process. So  there is just simply no reason why we have had these delays, especially  when something as critical as national security is on the line.   But, unfortunately, that is only one of our priorities--national  priorities--that has been neglected. The other has to do with the  request made from our friends in Israel and our friends in Ukraine for  additional assistance--a national security supplemental.   The President, in October, asked Congress to vote on this emergency  supplemental. Well, we have been abundantly clear from the get-go that  since the President included money for the border, that that was  certainly germane to our consideration of this supplemental bill. We  will not, though, merely fund the current open-border policies of the  Biden administration, which has been an absolute disaster--millions of  people coming across the border being released into the United States,  drugs that took the lives of 108,000 Americans last year alone, and  then, of course, the 300,000 unaccompanied children placed with  sponsors in the United States that the administration has simply lost  track of.   You may recall that the New York Times did an investigative piece  which pointed out that in 85,000 cases, when a call was made to the  sponsor 30 days after the child was placed with that sponsor, there was  no answer. And the administration did not follow up at all. So they  can't tell you whether they are going to school, whether they are  getting the healthcare that they need, whether they are being  trafficked for sex or forced into involuntary labor.   The New York Times did document that too many children are being put  in dangerous jobs at an underage in violation of State and Federal law.   So my point is that when the President asks for border security  money, talking about border security and how to fix the broken border  is certainly relevant and germane to that topic, since the President  initiated it in the first place.   So people wonder: Why is the money for Israel and Ukraine being held  up? I think the majority leader actually said it was being held  hostage, which is an unfortunate use of that term. But I point out that  the House passed a $14.3 billion supplemental appropriations to benefit  Israel on November 2. Again, here we are, 6 weeks later, and there has  been no action on this bill that has already passed the House.   Now, I understand the majority leader may not like all of what is in  that bill but certainly could put it on the floor and let the Senate  work its will and pass that and send it to the President's desk.  Certainly, that would be helpful to our allies in Israel.   So we know that the border crisis has become so severe that major  American cities--like New York and Chicago--are now crying uncle  because they have had to deal with a few thousand migrants who have,  ultimately, ended up in their city.   And you have had people like Mayor Adams in New York say that these  migrants were going to destroy New York City. Well, what about the 7  million migrants who have crossed the border in my State and in other  border States who are now dispersed throughout the United States? This  is also a blinking green light saying to anybody and everybody who has  the money to pay the smugglers to bring them to the border: Keep  coming.   Well, it is a disaster. And we are going to do everything in our  power to address the broken border as part of the supplemental.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to complete that work before the end  of this month because, No. 1, the majority leader decided to wait until  the holidays to put it on the floor in the first place.   And then there is the Federal Aviation Administration  Reauthorization, which was set to expire again at the end of September,  last September. Over the last few years, travelers have dealt with  widespread flight cancelations, paralyzing staffing shortages and  rising prices. They have also witnessed--we have witnessed--some  jarring safety issues, including near collisions on airport runways,  including cities like the one I live in, in Austin, TX.   The Senate passed a short-term extension that provides for 3 more  [[Page S5935]]  months to advance a longer-term reauthorization that addresses these  and other issues. But, unfortunately, that work hasn't been done  either, which has earned another incomplete.   So the Senate is expected to pass another short-term extension this  week so the Agency can keep up and running through at least March 8.   Now, that is another item which we should have finished this year  which we did not finish, and so it has been kicked over into next year.   We have also failed to complete the work on the farm bill, which  affects agriculture and food programs throughout the country. This  legislation is critical to America's food supply as well as to the  hard-working men and women who grow and produce it.   The previous farm bill expired on September 30. Does that sound  familiar? Well, it is a familiar theme where the majority fails to tee  up these issues until the deadline, and then we can't get it done, and  another extension has to be passed. Now we know that the farm bill has  been extended for a year because the Senate Agriculture Committee has  been unable--and the majority--to get that bill on the floor.   Finally, we have a law that most people have not heard of until  recently, perhaps--section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act. The Presiding Officer, of course, is very familiar with this. The  intelligence community calls this the crown jewels of American  intelligence gathering because it is absolutely vital to our national  security. It allows the intelligence community to obtain information  with which to combat everything from terrorism to cyber attacks and to  prevent our adversaries from developing weapons of mass destruction.   This authorization for this critical national security tool is set to  expire at the end of this month, and our Nation's most senior  intelligence officials have been pleading with Congress for months to  take action. They have issued warnings in the starkest possible  language about the consequences of failing to reauthorize section 702.   Unfortunately, ultimately, the House was forced to kick the can down  the road once again because we simply have not done our work on time.  So that is what is in the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act.  It includes a temporary extension of section 702 until April 19, adding  to the growing list of tasks we should have done this year which we  will have to do next year.   As we know, legislating only gets harder as the election approaches,  and the 2024 election is less than 11 months away--hardly a conducive  environment to getting this work done and certainly not any easier than  it would have been to do it on time.   So we have a lot of work to do when we return in January. We have two  government funding deadlines--January 19 and February 2. The FAA will  need to be reauthorized or extended by March 8. Section 702 of the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act will need to be reauthorized or  extended by April 19.   The first 4 months of next year will be spent working through the  backlog of items that should have been completed this year. Given this  lackluster performance, this is one report card that our Democratic  colleagues should be embarrassed to take home to their constituents.   I yield the floor.
