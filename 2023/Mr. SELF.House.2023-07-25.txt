 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a pillar of the Hunt  County community. In a world filled with media pundits and talking  heads, Brad Kellar was a journalist in every sense of the word. There  is a void left by Brad's passing, and I honor his memory today while  borrowing excerpts from Brad's colleague, Travis Hairgrove.   In the hearts and minds of people across Hunt County, the Herald- Banner newspaper and Brad Kellar were one and the same, and the two  names were used interchangeably for the 30 years that he served his  community as a tireless reporter of news stories, both big and small.   Even more important than his work ethic were the relationships Brad  built and the trust he earned through the care he put into his  reporting and through his kind, affable nature. Many Hunt County  residents came to know him as a friend, and his readers enjoyed the  collective giggles and groans brought on by Brad's predictably corny  puns and self-deprecating jokes.   Brad's beloved wife, Vida, said: ``He was loved and he touched a lot  of people. He loved his job, he loved writing, he loved the art of  making a story, he loved the people of Greenville, and could find the  good in just about anybody.''   With Brad being such a household name in Hunt County, many forget  that he was originally from Illinois. This, however, didn't affect his  devotion to his adopted community that was evidenced by his sacrifice  and commitment to service.   Some of the award-winning things he wrote were picked up by the  Associated Press, and it was around one of those times that he received  an offer from The New York Times to join their staff. He actually  considered moving to New York, but ultimately turned down the job  because he and Vida wanted their children to grow up in a town where  they knew everyone, and therefore, everyone would know what their kids  were up to. Also, Brad loved what he did, and he genuinely cared for  the community he lived in and wrote about.   Brad's dedication to service also made an impression on his eldest  son, Nick, who went on to study journalism at Texas A&M University- Commerce and later worked in mass media for several years. Nick  recently said: For me, he was a role model, and he showed me what it  was to be a man.   Brad's love for his community wasn't limited to the way he did his  job. It was accentuated by the way he poured himself into the lives of  others, particularly with the kids at his wife's daycare, Stepping  Stones Learning Academy.   Brad often visited the daycare center where he encouraged the  children to be inquisitive, and he rarely missed the opportunity to let  them know that they were special and that they were loved.   The extent to which Brad cherished people, especially children, was  probably intensified by the complications his daughter, Jaylynn, went  through when she was born prematurely 24 years ago. At one point they  thought that they might lose her, but as soon as they knew she was  going to be okay, Brad held Jaylynn in his arms, and Vida heard him  say, ``Love is going to hold you because God has put His hand on you.''   While the example of love and devotion that Brad showed his family  will continue to inspire them for the rest of their lives, the extent  to which he touched the lives of so many has been reflected by the  flood of condolences and memories that have been shared since his  passing.   I conclude my remarks with a remembrance from our mutual friend,  Greenville Mayor Jerry Ransom, who commented at a city council meeting  that, ``Brad was a staple in our community with his steadfast reporting  of Greenville and Hunt County news. More than anything, I think he was  also a very proud father, husband, and friend.''                            ____________________
