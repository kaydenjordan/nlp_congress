 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Coach Brad Dalton and the St. Teresa volleyball team on  their first IHSA volleyball championship.   Last month, the Bulldogs played the Breese Mater Dei Knights for the  Class 2A title and won the championship in two sets.   Although it was St. Teresa's fourth time competing in the State  tournament, this was their best finish ever. The Bulldogs earned the  school's first ever State championship title in volleyball--and first  in Macon County history.   Offensively, the Bulldogs pulled off 21 kills and 3 aces in the first  set, with an equally intimidating defense that racked up 32 digs,  total.   In the second set, the teams tied 11 times, but an ace by senior Abby  Robinson followed by a remarkable dig finished the match 26-24.   Coach Dalton said: ``We fought and we fought. This is a big win for  everybody in our program.''   A historic win to cap off a whirlwind of a season. Congratulations to  Coach Dalton and the entire Bulldog team.                            ____________________
