 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank and commend Secretary Sonny  Perdue of the USDA for a recent decision to help northern California  with its water situation. They are offering a $449 million loan to help  the Sites area project, an intertie that will help the Tehama-Colusa  Canal and the Glenn-Colusa Canal intertie to each other, and,  therefore, be part of the infrastructure that will help the Sites  Reservoir be successful when it is finally built.   It is much needed for northern California's water interconnectivity,  flexibility, and overall goals of more water storage in our State,  especially upon the heels of the California State Water Resources  Control Board's shift of what could be up to 700,000 more acre feet  away from human use towards dubious environmental use.   Mr. Speaker, we need help with water storage, water capacity. I thank  Secretary Perdue and Secretary Zinke for their attention to northern  California for these water needs, and thank the Trump administration  for it as well.                            ____________________
