 Madam Speaker, I support the Promoting  Research and Observations of Space Weather to Improve the Forecasting  of Tomorrow Act, called the PROSWIFT Act.   I thank Congressman Perlmutter for his leadership on this important  issue and for working with me in the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology to advance the Senate bill, which is identical to the House  version we have worked so long and hard on.   The PROSWIFT Act advances America's understanding of potentially  severe weather events and damaging consequences.   Space weather is a collection of physical processes beginning at the  Sun with solar winds and ultimately affecting human activities on Earth  and in space. Humanity needs a better understanding of these solar  winds and their interaction with Earth's atmosphere. The PROSWIFT Act  is a step towards that better understanding.   In Alabama's Marshall Space Flight Center, scientists and engineers  are at the forefront of space weather research. Under the PROSWIFT Act,  their enhanced research will advance our understanding of and ability  to forecast space weather.   The PROSWIFT Act recognizes that space weather not only impacts us on  Earth, it can and will impact us in deep space exploration.   For example, before we launch NASA's Artemis man-to-Moon-missions  that pave the way to Mars missions, it is best that we should better  understand how space weather phenomena impacts life in space,  satellites, and other space instrumentation.   Madam Speaker, it is critical that we properly forecast space weather  and prepare for and protect astronauts from the dangers of solar  radiation.   Madam Speaker, I, again, thank my colleague, Mr. Perlmutter, for his  leadership on space weather and his partnership on the PROSWIFT Act.   I encourage my colleagues to vote for Senate Bill 881 and send it to  President Trump to sign.
