 Mr. President, I rise today to remember a friend  and a great North Carolinian, Ada Markita Fisher, who unexpectedly died  on October 7, 2022. Ada was 74 years old and only a few weeks away from  her 75th birthday.   As a young African-American woman, she was a trailblazer. After  completing a degree in biology at the University of North Carolina at  Greensboro--UNCG--she went on to become the first Black female to earn  a medical degree at the University of Wisconsin's School of Medicine  and Public Health. She was also the first Black UNCG alumna to complete  a medical degree. Additionally, she completed her masters in public  health at Johns Hopkins University's School of Hygiene and Public  Health in 1981.   After completing her medical degree, Ada chose to return to North  Carolina to provide medical care to an underserved community and lead  programs for victims of substance abuse. She spent some of her career  in the private sector, but most of her life was dedicated to helping  people who were struggling and ultimately making a positive difference  in her community.  [[Page S6666]]    I met Ada 15 years ago when I began my political service in the North  Carolina General Assembly. From the first time I met her, I was  inspired by her courage, focus, and plain talk. She was a lifelong  Republican. She was dedicated to the party of Abraham Lincoln, and she  did not hesitate to challenge anyone from across the political spectrum  who threatened the principles of personal liberty, individual  responsibility, and social justice.   Although I met Ada after she retired, she never seemed to slow down.  She traveled across the State advocating for common sense  ``prescriptions'' to the challenges we faced. She became the first  African-American to be elected Republican National Committee--RNC-- committeewoman for North Carolina. Ada was known for her letters. Some  were focused on policies she was promoting, and others were focused on  challenging policies she did not think were helpful. Whether or not you  agreed with her opinion, you had to respect the thoughtfulness and the  work she put into them.   When Ada wasn't working on public policy, she was focused on her  family. Ada never married, but she adopted two sons who blessed her  with two grandchildren. She also had three siblings and a host of  nieces, nephews, and cousins. She adored her family, and they adored  her.   I attended Ada's funeral last month, and I was honored to speak at  her memorial service. While I was considering what I should say, it  occurred to me that I had never written a letter to Ada, so I decided  to write a letter to her and deliver it at the memorial. I wished that  I had sent it long before her passing, but I hope she enjoys it  nonetheless as she reads it in heaven.    Dear Ada, I'm sorry I am just now sending you this letter, but I hope  it finds you well in the Kingdom of Heaven. I regret that I haven't had  the opportunity to see you recently, but I am glad that my last memory  of you was giving you a hug when we were together. Had I known it was  to be the last time I would see you, I would have hugged you a little  longer.   After I received the sad news of your passing, I reflected on the  times we spent together, and it gave me some comfort as I grieved your  loss. I knew you as a staunch advocate for people who are struggling,  for diversity, for personal responsibility, and for individual freedom.  I remember so many times when you challenged a crowd to think  differently. You didn't look for applause lines, you looked for  opportunities to make a point and to make a difference. You didn't  hesitate to get people out of their comfort zone by saying what needed  to be said, and you gained many followers and admirers along the way.   I am embarrassed to admit that I only knew a small part of your work  since the time we met 15 years ago, and I did not fully comprehend your  life's work with helping others. I've studied you more since your  passing Ada, and you are truly even more remarkable than I imagined.   As a young African American woman, you excelled in academics--a  medical degree and a master's degree in public health. You could have  taken a life-long path to personal enrichment, but you chose to return  home to North Carolina to set up a rural health clinic and programs to  help people struggling with substance abuse. You helped veterans.   You studied education and became a certified teacher in math and  science. You served in what I believe is the most difficult political  position on earth--a local school board. Man, I wish they were  televised in those days. I'm sure it would have been a sight to see!  You understood that education is the surest path to freedom, and you  worked hard to ensure that every child (including your two sons) had an  opportunity to pursue that path.   The truth is, Ada, you have done so much for so many, and you've set  a high bar for the rest of us. I am saddened that you left this earthy  world far too soon because I know you had so many more things you would  do to make it a better place. But thank you for everything you did Ada,  and thank you for the blessing of your friendship.   Now that you've had a few weeks in the Kingdom of Heaven, I hope  you've found time to rest. You deserve it, Ada. Know that we are  praying for you and that we love you, and we will continue to be  inspired by your life's work.   With Love and Admiration, Thom T.                            ____________________
