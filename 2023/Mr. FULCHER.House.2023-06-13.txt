 Mr. Chairman, here we are on the House floor talking  about gas stoves. No, it wasn't the Republicans who are bringing this  issue up. It is our friends in the administration who are making moves  to try to eliminate a very reliable, efficient source of cooking  energy.   I rise in opposition to the Biden administration's efforts to limit  consumer choice. Gas stoves are the preferred cooktop appliance of  nearly 40 percent of American households. They are affordable,  reliable, and easy to use.   If the administration succeeds in banning gas stoves, it will force  millions of Americans to switch to more expensive and less efficient  electric stoves. This will impact jobs and the economy. More than 4.1  million jobs are connected to the gas industry.   House Republicans have taken a stance against this policy by  introducing the Save Our Gas Stoves Act and the Gas Stove Protection  and Freedom Act. This was not our initiative. This was brought on us  because of a very unrealistic, very ill-advised attempt by the  administration.   At a time when our Nation faces a confluence of crises, my friends on  the other side of the aisle believe that banning appliances is somehow  a matter of national concern. I reject that.   This week, we will vote to protect Americans' choices, their wallets,  their time, and their jobs.                                time  1900
