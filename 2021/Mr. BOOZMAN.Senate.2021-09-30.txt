 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Mark  J. Cochran, who after almost 40 years of service with the University of  Arkansas System, is retiring today.   In Dr. Cochran's last role with the university he led the division of  agriculture's research and extension work as its vice president. The  University of Arkansas System division of agriculture's mission is to  strengthen agriculture, communities, and families by connecting trusted  research to the adoption of best practices.   Dr. Cochran embodies that mission. So much so, that when it was  announced that he would be stepping down, University of Arkansas System  president Dr. Donald Bobbitt called Dr. Cochran ``an unabashed  cheerleader for Arkansas agriculture.''   I would echo that descriptor and add that he has been an incredible  partner in our efforts at the Federal level to ensure Arkansas  producers remain on the leading edge; our rural communities remain  strong; and the families that comprise them have opportunities to  prosper.   Agriculture is Arkansas' largest industry, adding around $21 billion  to our economy every year and accounting for approximately one in every  six jobs. In order to reach and build upon that level of economic  production, our producers need to maintain a competitive advantage.  Research provides that building block, and Dr. Cochran ensured the  university is on the cutting-edge of it. Under Dr. Cochran's  leadership, the University of Arkansas System division of agriculture  helped guide this vital industry by providing science-based best  practices and new technologies that led to advancements that benefit  both producers and the environment.   While remaining dedicated to our current agriculture community's  needs, Dr. Cochran also focused with equal intensity on cultivating and  preparing the next generation of Arkansas farmers and ranchers. In  announcing his retirement, Dr. Cochran noted he is particularly proud  of the impact the university has made on youth through its 4-H program  and how that impact will carry into the future.   During his tenure, Dr. Cochran developed a reputation as a well- respected advocate for Arkansas agriculture, our rural communities, and  the families that call the Natural State home. His leadership at  University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture will be missed,  but he left a legacy that will benefit Arkansas agriculture for years  to come. It has been an honor to work with him during his tenure, and I  wish him all the best in retirement.                            ____________________
