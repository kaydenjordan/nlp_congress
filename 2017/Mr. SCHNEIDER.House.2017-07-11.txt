 Mr. Speaker, last week, as I traveled throughout my  district, I heard time and time and time again from people worried  about one issue: healthcare. I heard stories like Diane's in Mundelein,  who was able to get affordable coverage through ACA after losing her  job of 30 years to outsourcing, and Claire's, from Vernon Hills, who  was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis just a month before her 26th  birthday. Yet, because of ACA, she has insurance today, despite her  preexisting condition.   I was thrilled to learn that Claire recently got married, and is  looking forward to pursuing her dreams: raising a family and living a  long and productive life.   Mr. Speaker, across the country, there are millions of stories just  like these. The ACA is far from perfect and it needs work. I heard that  from my constituents as well.   I urge my colleagues here in Congress to listen to the people who  share their stories with me and others and end this ill-considered  repeal effort. Instead, let's get to work together to deliver quality,  affordable healthcare for all Americans.                            ____________________
