 Mr. Speaker, as mentioned, the James K. Polk  Presidential Home Study Act would require the Department of the  Interior to study adding our 11th President's only surviving residence  to the National Park Service. The aim of my bill is to help the charity  that currently maintains the property in Columbia, Tennessee, to  preserve it for future generations.   Two hundred years ago, Columbia was a frontier town in a new State.  Nobody knew the United States would eventually stretch from sea to  shining sea, but James Polk had confidence and vision.   He was a country lawyer who rose from the Tennessee State house to  the Governor's office, then to the House of Representatives here in  Congress. James Polk was the only Speaker of the House to ever be  elected President.   Polk oversaw the establishment of the U.S. Naval Academy, the  Smithsonian Institution, and the Department of the Interior.   Most importantly, he fulfilled his promise to Western settlers to  expand the country's boundaries to the Pacific. Without James Polk's  contributions, the United States might not look like it does today, a  strong, prosperous Nation spanning a continent.   The outcome was not always certain; however, today, we enjoy the  fruits of President Polk's often overlooked legacy. Many historians  consider him to be the most successful pre-Civil War President. People  in Columbia consider him a local hero. He is a national hero and  deserves a place of honor in our National Park System.   I appreciate Representative Marsha Blackburn's support for my  legislation to accomplish this goal. I also thank Senator Lamar  Alexander, who has offered companion legislation in the Senate, and we  all anticipate progress.   I want to thank the Columbia city leaders and the many volunteers who  have tirelessly worked on this project and helped bring this issue to  my attention. We all look forward to its continued prosperity and  recognition.
