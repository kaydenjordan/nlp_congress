 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Coronavirus Aid,  Relief, and Economic Security Act. This is a necessary step in  providing relief to families and small businesses throughout coastal  Virginia and across America. This bill provides critical funding in  helping our communities thrive again when this crisis passes.   As we prepare to provide relief for the American people amid this  national emergency, I am reminded of the words that President Kennedy  would have spoken were it not for his untimely loss on November 22,  1963.   `` . . . this a time for courage and a time for challenge. Neither  conformity nor complacency will do. Neither the fanatics nor the faint- hearted are needed . . . So let us not be petty when our cause is so  great. Let us not quarrel amongst ourselves when our Nation's future is  at stake. Let us stand together with renewed confidence in our cause-- united in our heritage of the past and our hopes for the future--and  determined that this land we love shall lead all mankind into new  frontiers of peace and abundance.''
