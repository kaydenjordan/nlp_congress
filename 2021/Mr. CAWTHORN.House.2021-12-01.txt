 Madam Speaker, I thank the great warrior from Florida  for her leadership on this matter.   Madam Speaker, imagine you have just walked out of this Chamber and  outside is a gorgeous sunset. You have a Polaroid camera, so you snap a  beautiful picture, and the gray photo prints out the front. You hold it  and shake it, waiting for the picture to appear. Suddenly, someone  walks by and snatches your photo, ripping it to shreds.   You are stunned. You cry: Why did you destroy my picture? The person  replies: Oh, it wasn't a picture. It wasn't fully developed yet. All of  us in this room realize how asinine that reasoning is. That photo was  transforming into a beautiful image.   This illustration by Seth Gruber is simple. But it is what our Nation  has done to the most precious image of all, the image of God.   Madam Speaker, a silent genocide has slipped beneath the conscience  of America. Precious works of our Creator, formed and set apart, meet  death before they have breathed life. Eternal souls, woven into earthen  vessels, sanctified by Almighty God and endowed with the miracle of  life, are denied their birth by a Nation that was born in freedom.   God's breath of life blown away by the breath of man.   This cruel and fallen world may seem too filthy for their very  presence. But these precious temples are crafted in the image of God  himself. One day, perhaps when science darkens the soul of the left,  our Nation will repent. But until then, the carnage of this  unconscionable deed will stain the fabric of our Nation.   I hope that the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. I hope that we  stop the genocide of abortion in this country.
