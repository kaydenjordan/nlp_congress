 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and legacy of a beloved community member, a man of faith, a brave  veteran, and valued friend, Donny Fleming.   Characterized by his grace and gratitude, Donny was a lifelong  resident of St. Marys, Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, Donny  peacefully passed away, surrounded by family. He was a staple of his  community and dedicated to uplifting those around him, whether it be  family, friends, or those in need, Donny ingrained himself in his  community as a civil servant and business leader.   He was a powerful force among local organizations such as the Boys  and Girls Club, United Way, the Cleveland Clinic, and Christ the King  Manor. Donny exemplified what it means to devote oneself not only to  his community but to his country. He was a recipient of both the Purple  Heart and the Silver Star medals. I thank him for his committed service  and sacrifice, not only to his community but to our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I offer my condolences to Donny's wife, Elaine, and  family, and hope that his profound impact instills the importance of  kindness and generosity for us all.                            ____________________
