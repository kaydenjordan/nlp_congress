 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Taiwan  International Solidarity Act, which I co-lead with my good friend from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).   This legislation amends the TAIPEI Act, my bill that was signed into  law in March of 2020, which countered China's poaching of Taiwan's  allies and China's efforts to exclude Taiwan from international  organizations.   I am proud that my bill has greatly strengthened our relationship  with Taiwan. However, since the bill's signing in 2020, China has  mounted pressure on international organizations to claim that Taiwan is  part of China.   The Taiwan International Solidarity Act expands on the TAIPEI Act to  further counter China's attempt to use international organizations to  claim that Taiwan is part of China by distorting the language,  policies, and procedures of international organizations.   We all witnessed this in an infamous interview at the height of COVID  where a reporter asked a representative of the World Health  Organization a question about Taiwan. The WHO officer initially refused  to answer and then said: ``Well, we've already talked about China,''  implying that Taiwan is part of China.   It is unacceptable for international institutions, funded largely by  U.S. taxpayer dollars, to be repeating the CCP narrative.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the NTIA  Policy and Cybersecurity Coordination Act. This bill would streamline  the development of cybersecurity policy at the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, through the  establishment of an office of policy development and cybersecurity.   This office would work with industry and stakeholders to recommend  the cybersecurity practices and policies of the internet and  communications technology sectors. The office of policy development and  cybersecurity would also carry out the communications supply chain risk  information partnership to facilitate information sharing on  cybersecurity risks to small and rural communities.   State and nonstate actors are working overtime to find  vulnerabilities in our networks and infrastructure. We must work even  harder to ensure Americans are protected from cyberattacks.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Wild for joining me on this bill  in the House and Senator Hickenlooper for leading in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
