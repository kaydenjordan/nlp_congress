 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen  and Congressman Albio Sires for their incredible work on this issue and  all of their passion. I also thank the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee  chairman, Congressman Duncan. I know how much he has worked on the  issue of Venezuela, and Latin America also.   The people of Venezuela are in dire need of humanitarian assistance  to endure critical food and medicine shortages. The desperation,  oppression, and violence in Venezuela really are reaching a breaking  point.   Three out of four Venezuelans have lost significant weight during the  last year due to food shortages.   In 2016, the nation suffered a homicide rate of 91.8 per 100,000  people, making Venezuela the second most violent country in the world  outside of a war zone.   We have reason to believe more than half of Venezuelans want to leave  their home country.   Last year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said  Colombia should expect an ``avalanche'' of Venezuelan refugees, an  influx that  [[Page H4500]]  could complicate this critical time for Colombia's own peace agreement.  Meanwhile, President Maduro's government is taking increasingly  antidemocratic actions in violation of Venezuela's own constitution.   Since Venezuela's supreme court attempted to dissolve the country's  legislature in March, the Venezuelan people have sustained massive  protests, leading to a brutal crackdown from government security  forces. The best outcome for this political crisis is a Venezuelan  solution: a peaceful return to free and fair elections.   At the same time, the United States has a responsibility to work  alongside our allies at the Organization of American States and the  United Nations to hold Maduro's government accountable and to provide  humanitarian assistance to the people of Venezuela.   Last week, President Trump authorized sanctions against the members  of Venezuela's supreme court who attempted to shut down the  legislature. While U.S. sanctions against individuals in the Maduro  regime are justified, sanctions work best when implemented  multilaterally. More importantly, unilateral actions are no substitute  for collective, coordinated pressure.   The OAS has scheduled a meeting of foreign ministers on the situation  in Venezuela to take place on May 31 here in Washington, D.C. This  meeting presents an opportunity to work with our partners and  Venezuela's neighbors to support a return to democracy and respect for  human rights. I hope Secretary Tillerson will represent the United  States at this meeting and demonstrate our Nation's support for the  Venezuelan people.   One of the reasons that I chose to join the Western Hemisphere  Subcommittee when I was already part of the Foreign Affairs Committee  is because I believe that there are many things that happen in Latin  America that don't get the attention that they deserve here in the  United States.                                time  1945    It is amazing to think that there is a human rights crisis going on  right now in our own Western Hemisphere. Of course, there are many  challenges around the world. We know that because of the war in Syria  and the unrest in the region, Europe, over the last few years, has  faced its largest migration crisis since World War II.   There are challenges with human rights and freedom in every continent  just about. But we have to make sure that we attend to the things that  are happening in our own backyard, so to speak.   So I thank each of you for being here tonight to speak up on this  issue of human rights in Venezuela and the crisis that they are going  through.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, we are so pleased that Mr. Castro has,  once again, joined us in this battle for human rights, for democracy,  for justice, for the rule of law, in our hemisphere. His voice is a  valiant one that needs to be heard and is always present whenever the  struggle for human rights is mentioned.   So thank you, Mr. Castro, for this stance today and for the stance  that you have taken on behalf of beleaguered people in our hemisphere  every day.   Now, Mr. Sires and I are so thankful that our subcommittee chairman  of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan), has joined us.   As I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sires is the ranking member of that  subcommittee, and Mr. Duncan is the chairman of that subcommittee, a  valiant voice for freedom that must be heard.   I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).   Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  chairwoman, former chairwoman of the full committee when I first came  to Congress, and a real leader on foreign affairs issues, focused on  Cuba and Venezuela. She has been a real mentor to me, and I want to  thank her for her work on this, giving us the opportunity to speak  tonight.   Again, Ranking Member Sires has been a champion on our subcommittee.  I want to echo the words about Mr. Castro as well. We have got a great  Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere focusing on freedom and  democracy in the Western Hemisphere.   What we see in Venezuela is alarming, as well as it is saddening,  when we hear about Venezuelans who are scrounging for food in the  dumpsters, eating domesticated animals, even flamingos; people who are  hungry because the socialistic policies of the Maduro and the previous  Chavez regime has not worked in Venezuela. A country that has bountiful  natural resources, more oil than Saudi Arabia, should be leading this  hemisphere in economics.   Yet because of the policies of the Chavez and Maduro governments, the  people of Venezuela are continuing to be oppressed. This weekend, more  than 2,000 Venezuelans took to the streets, marking, I think, the 50th  day of protests against this regime. I can't think of any other way to  describe this faux democracy in Venezuela, other than a regime.   The Venezuelan people are standing up and calling for a new  government. They are calling for more democracy, true democracy,  representation in their own government, freedoms that we take for  granted here in this country, freedoms of speech, and the right to  peacefully assemble, the right to participate in their government and  have accountability, the right to petition their government for  grievances. And they have got some grievances against the Maduro  regime.   Yet Maduro continues to oppress the Venezuelan people. It is not  unlike what we have seen in Cuba. Folks, socialism doesn't work, and it  is not working in Venezuela, and they are a prime example. But Maduro  doesn't want to listen to his own people in Venezuela and call for new  democratic elections, where the people elect their representatives to  congress and to the Presidency.   But he has called for elections, and he said just recently: `` `Votes  or bullets. What do the people want?' Maduro asked a crowd of red- shirted supporters waving Venezuela flags at the Miraflores  presidential palace.''   Votes or bullets? Is that how we talk about the democratic process in  a true democracy? I say no, and I tell the Venezuelan people, America  stands with you as you approach democracy.   It is time for more people in this hemisphere and the Organization of  American States, all the member countries, to stand with the Venezuelan  people, and let's change the government in Venezuela through peaceful  means, democratic means, that their Constitution calls for.   But yet, Maduro is ignoring the Constitution. In fact, he got the  Supreme Court to go along with him to discount the National Assembly  there, and, luckily, they reversed course on that because they realized  the world was watching and the world was saying that is not how  democracies operate.   The Venezuelan people need the support of the world, and I call on  the world today to come to the backs, standing with, watching the backs  of the Venezuelan people, because Maduro has told his snipers to get  ready; told his snipers to get ready to attack the protesters that are  protesting a supposed democrat government. Wow.   So I want to thank the chairwoman. I want to thank Ambassador Nikki  Haley, former Governor of South Carolina, who has stood strong in the  U.N. as Ambassador to the U.N. for the Trump administration. I want to  thank her for standing with the Venezuelan people for democratic  principles.   I want to thank all those in this Chamber, including my ranking  member, for having stern and direct conversations with the OAS about  Venezuela.   I want to thank Argentina for what they have done, stepping up to the  plate. These are countries that understand the democratic process.   I want to thank Brazil for actually allowing the democratic process  to work in the country of Brazil through an impeachment of their  President, and allowing the democratic forces to work to return that to  a representative government.   It is time for America to stand with our friends about democratic  principles here. Snipers? That is not how we operate.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4501]]                                ____________________
