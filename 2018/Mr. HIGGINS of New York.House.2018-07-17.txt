 Mr. Speaker, at the foot of Main Street in  Buffalo lies the DL&W Terminal, a century-old, vacant historic landmark  along the Buffalo River that once served as a bustling stop for  passengers traveling by both ship and rail.   A plan by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority will  transform this piece of western New York history into a destination  that serves a Buffalo of today and tomorrow, creating a multimodal  center for people traveling by rail, automobile, bikes, and boats.   The DL&W Terminal is a project under consideration for a Federal  grant through the United States Department of Transportation's Better  Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development, otherwise known as the  BUILD program.   I stand today in support of the NFTA's grant application for the DL&W  Terminal, which serves as a national model for financing of  infrastructure investments delivering significant economic impact.   Surrounded by Canalside, the Cobblestone District, downtown Buffalo,  and the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, development of the DL&W  represents a transformative project building on the economic  renaissance of the new Buffalo.                            ____________________
