 Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to this bill. It is  nothing more than a disingenuous attempt to undermine the Federal  unemployment insurance program, which provided a critical lifeline to  millions of Americans during the pandemic.   My Republican colleagues say they are concerned about unemployment  fraud. I am, too.   However, this bill does nothing to claw back stolen UI funds. In  fact, it would go a long way toward stopping the ongoing successful  work by the Federal Government to fight fraud and hold criminals  responsible.   It would rescind $2 billion in funding provided to the Department of  Labor to strengthen the UI system and improve fraud detection and  prevention and replace it with a bizarre set of incentives for States  to go after ordinary workers who were overpaid, through no fault of  their own, years after the fact.   The Department of Labor assistance facilitated by the American Rescue  Plan made a huge difference in my State of Virginia. Following the  guidance, we were able to make a significant dent in the unemployment  insurance appeals backlog that has plagued our State system for years.   There is no question our unemployment system needs improvement, but  this bill would make the system more vulnerable to fraud.
