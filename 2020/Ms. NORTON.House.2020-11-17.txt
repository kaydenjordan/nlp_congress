 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4611) to modify permitting requirements with respect to the  discharge of any pollutant from the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment  Plant in certain circumstances, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4611         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean Pollution Reduction       Act II''.  [[Page H5850]]            SEC. 2. SAN DIEGO POINT LOMA PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of the       Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.),       the Administrator may issue a permit under section 402 of the       Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342) for a       discharge from the Point Loma Plant into marine waters that       requires compliance with the requirements described in       subsection (b).        (b) Conditions.--A permit issued under this section shall       require--        (1) maintenance of the currently designed deep ocean       outfall from the Point Loma Plant with a discharge depth of       not less than 300 feet and distance from the shore of not       less than 4 miles;        (2) as applicable to the term of the permit, discharge of       not more than 12,000 metric tons of total suspended solids       per year commencing on the date of enactment of this section,       not more than 11,500 metric tons of total suspended solids       per year commencing on December 31, 2025, and not more than       9,942 metric tons of total suspended solids per year       commencing on December 31, 2027;        (3) discharge of not more than 60 milligrams per liter of       total suspended solids, calculated as a 30-day average;        (4) removal of not less than 80 percent of total suspended       solids on a monthly average and not less than 58 percent of       biochemical oxygen demand on an annual average, taking into       account removal occurring at all treatment processes for       wastewater upstream from and at the Point Loma Plant;        (5) attainment of all other effluent limitations of       secondary treatment as determined by the Administrator       pursuant to section 304(d)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution       Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(d)(1)), other than any       requirements otherwise applicable to the discharge of       biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids;        (6) compliance with the requirements applicable to Federal       issuance of a permit under section 402 of the Federal Water       Pollution Control Act, including State concurrence consistent       with section 401 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act       (33 U.S.C. 1341) and ocean discharge criteria evaluation       pursuant to section 403 of the Federal Water Pollution       Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1343);        (7) implementation of the pretreatment program requirements       of paragraphs (5) and (6) of section 301(h) of the Federal       Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1311(h)) in addition       to the requirements of section 402(b)(8) of such Act (33       U.S.C. 1342(b)(8));        (8) that the applicant provide 10 consecutive years of       ocean monitoring data and analysis for the period immediately       preceding the date of each application for a permit under       this section sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of       the Administrator that the discharge of pollutants pursuant       to a permit issued under this section will meet the       requirements of section 301(h)(2) of the Federal Water       Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1311(h)(2)) and that the       applicant has established and will maintain throughout the       permit term an ocean monitoring program that meets or exceeds       the requirements of section 301(h)(3) of such Act (33 U.S.C.       1311(h)(3)); and        (9) to the extent potable reuse is permitted by Federal and       State regulatory agencies, that the applicant demonstrate       that at least 83,000,000 gallons per day on an annual average       of water suitable for potable reuse will be produced by       December 31, 2035, taking into account production of water       suitable for potable reuse occurring at all treatment       processes for wastewater upstream from and at the Point Loma       Plant.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4611, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4611. The legislation  introduced by Representative Scott Peters clarifies that the city of  San Diego, California, can utilize the standard Clean Water and  National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit process to  continue operation of the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant with  alternative standards.   The legislation provides regulatory accountability and consistency to  the city and has the support of surrounding localities, local public  work departments, and water districts, as well as nongovernmental and  environmental organizations.   I am unaware of any opposition to this legislation currently. The  Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant applies for and receives a waiver  under the Clean Water Act to discharge wastewater with less than full  secondary treatment--the baseline requirement of the Clean Water Act.  The facility qualifies for the waiver by meeting certain criteria and  renews its application every 5 years.   As part of a long-term effort, the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment  Plant is working to reduce its discharge into coastal waters. This  effort involves water recycling and will direct a portion of the  facility's discharge. However, the facility's discharges into coastal  waters will never be eliminated.   To be clear, this legislation is not a waiver of all the requirements  of the Clean Water Act, and the facility will need to comply with the  other requirements of the act.   I thank Representative Peters and the city of San Diego for  continuing to work with us on this legislation. I support this  legislation and ask my colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance  of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                  Washington, DC, November 12, 2020.      Hon. Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Defazio: In recognition of the goal of       expediting consideration of H.R. 4611 the ``Ocean Pollution       Reduction Act II,'' the Committee on Natural Resources agrees       to waive formal consideration of the bill as to provisions       that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Natural Resources.        The Committee on Natural Resources takes this action with       the mutual understanding that, in doing so, we do not waive       any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. Our Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation.        Thank you for agreeing to include our exchange of letters       in the Congressional Record. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to       work with you as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,      Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                 Washington, DC, November 12, 2020.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chair, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Grijalva: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 4611, the Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II. I appreciate       your decision to waive formal consideration of the bill.        I agree that the Committee on Natural Resources has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Natural Resources       is not waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant subject       matter. Additionally, I will support the appointment of       conferees from the Committee on Natural Resources should a       House-Senate conference be convened on this legislation.       Finally, this exchange of letters will be included in the       Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the       floor.        Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the  [[Page H5851]]       Committee on Natural Resources on this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                   Peter A. DeFazio                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters). This is his legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8326) to amend the Public Works and Economic Development Act  of 1965 to require eligible recipients of certain grants to develop a  comprehensive economic development strategy that directly or indirectly  increases the accessibility of affordable, quality child care, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8326         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care is Economic       Development Act of 2020'' or the ``CED Act''.       SEC. 2. COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES.         (a) In General.--Section 302(a)(3)(A) of the Public Works       and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C.       3162(a)(3)(A)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``and'' before ``balances resources''; and        (2) by inserting ``, and directly or indirectly increases       the accessibility of affordable, quality child care'' after       ``sound management of development''.        (b) Guidance.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce, in       consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services,       shall issue guidance on implementing the amendments made by       subsection (a) to include the accessibility of affordable,       quality child care in a comprehensive economic development       strategy developed under section 302 of the Public Works and       Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3162).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include any extraneous material on H.R. 8326.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8326, the Child Care is  Economic Development Act, or the CED Act.   Access to childcare is essential to economic development but it is  often ignored in planning. This legislation changes that by making sure  that local Economic Development Districts consider the availability and  accessibility of affordable, quality childcare when creating their  Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy.   Job creation is an important part of economic development. But doing  so without considering childcare leaves an enormous blind spot. For  many communities large and small, access to affordable childcare  remains one of the  [[Page H5852]]  largest barriers to job recruitment. If people cannot find quality and  affordable childcare, they may not relocate to a region for a new job  no matter how good the job may be.   A report from the Center for American Progress found that more than  half of American households live in a childcare desert. This is  especially problematic in smaller and rural communities where the rate  of families with childcare deserts grows to three in five households  without adequate childcare.   If our economic development plans don't consider childcare, we are  limiting the type of workforce that is available to compete for jobs  and limiting our economic development and competitiveness. Jobs that  don't work for working families don't work for our communities.   The childcare crisis in our country has been further exacerbated by  COVID-19. As many as 4.5 million childcare slots may be permanently  lost due to COVID-19, further reducing the limited supply of affordable  childcare nationwide. With declining childcare options, many families  are forced to reduce working hours or leave the workforce altogether,  oftentimes leaving women with the greatest share household duties.   Limited childcare availability has for years reduced women's  participation in the workforce, and the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed  that even further. In September alone, four times as many women as men  left the labor force--over 865,000 women in one month alone. And women  and children who have remained in the workforce report reducing their  working hours by 20 to 50 percent to provide childcare services to  their families.   Left unchecked, the childcare crisis, coupled with the COVID-19  pandemic, will reverse decades of progress for women's equity and  opportunity in the workforce, including reducing pay equity and  opportunity gaps.   While there is a lot we need to do to address the childcare crisis in  our country, the CED Act provides us a first step forward by  recognizing the intrinsic connection between economic development and  access to childcare. It allows communities to identify their needs and  strategies and forces an integration of early childhood needs into  broader economic plans.   I am proud to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                  Washington, DC, November 13, 2020.      Hon. Peter A Defazio,      Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and           Infrastructure, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R.8326, the       ``Child Care is Economic Development Act of 2020.'' In order       to permit H.R. 8326 to proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 8326 with our mutual       understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration of H.R.       8326, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our       Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this or similar legislation moves forward with regard to any       matters in the Committee's jurisdiction. I appreciate your       commitment to work with the Committee to address any       outstanding issues as the bill is considered in the Senate.       The Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of       an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation that       involves the Committee's jurisdiction and request your       support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 8326.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____           House of Representatives,                  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,                                  Washington, DC, November 13, 2020.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters, Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R 8326, the Childcare is Economic Development Act of 2020.       I appreciate your decision to waive formal consideration of       the bill.        I agree that the Committee on Financial Services has valid       jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this important       legislation, and I further agree that by forgoing formal       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Financial       Services is not waiving any jurisdiction over any relevant       subject matter. Additionally, I will support the appointment       of conferees from the Committee on Financial Services should       a House-Senate conference be convened on this legislation.       Finally, this exchange of letters will be included in the       Congressional Record when the bill is considered on the       floor.        Thank you again, and I look forward to continuing to work       collaboratively with the Committee on Financial Services on       this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5919) to amend title 40, United States Code, to require the  Administrator of General Services to enter into a cooperative agreement  with the National Children's Museum to provide the National Children's  Museum rental space without charge in the Ronald Reagan Building and  International Trade Center, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5919         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Children's Museum       Act''.       SEC. 2. NATIONAL CHILDREN'S MUSEUM.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) the Museum and Library Services Act of 2003 (Public Law       108-81) designated the Capital Children's Museum, the       predecessor to the National Children's Museum, as the       ``National Children's Museum'';        (2) the National Children's Museum operates under section       501(C)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is       organized under the laws of the District of Columbia;        (3) the mission of the National Children's Museum is to       inspire children to care about and change the world; and        (4) the National Children's Museum is located in the       federally-owned Ronald Reagan Building and International       Trade Center.        (b) National Children's Museum.--Chapter 67 of title 40,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``Sec. 6735. National Children's Museum         ``(a) In General.-- Not later than 30 days after the date       of enactment of this section, the Administrator of General       Services shall enter into a cooperative agreement with the       National Children's Museum for the operation of the National       Children's Museum in the approximately 32,369 square feet of       space commonly known as suite C-001 (hereinafter referred to       as the `Space') of the Ronald Reagan Building and       International Trade Center for the duration of the retail       space license agreement between Trade Center Management       Associates, LLC, or a successor entity, and the Museum, dated       December 4, 2017, including any exercised renewal options.        ``(b) Contents.--The cooperative agreement under subsection       (a) shall include provisions that--        ``(1) require, for the period in which the General Services       Administration owns or controls the Space, the General       Services Administration to provide rent for the Space; and        ``(2) terminate such agreement if--        ``(A) the Museum does not continue to qualify as a       nonprofit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and        ``(B) the Museum no longer uses the Space as a children's       museum; and        ``(3) prohibits the Museum from transferring the interest       in such agreement.        ``(c) Source of Funds.--To carry out this section, the       Administrator shall use funds derived from--        ``(1) the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation fund;       or        ``(2) the International Trade Center fund.        ``(d) Report.--The cooperative agreement under subsection       (a) shall require the National Children's Museum to submit to       the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Environment and       Public Works of the Senate an annual report on the operations       and finances of the Museum.''.        (c) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for chapter 67 of       title 40, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end       the following:  ``6735. National Children's Museum.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 5919, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5919, the National  Children's Museum Act. This is a bill that I wrote and am grateful that  the House is considering it today. I thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking  Member Graves for their support of this bill.   This bipartisan bill would require the General Services  Administration to enter into a cooperative agreement with the National  Children's Museum, a congressionally designated museum, to allow the  museum to remain in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade  Center, as it is called, a federally owned building in the Nation's  Capital, without charge for the duration of its existing lease. There  is precedent for Congress' requiring the General Services  Administration to enter into a cooperative agreement for the use of a  Federal building in the District of Columbia by a private museum  without charge. The National Building Museum operates under such an  agreement.   This bill would allow the National Children's Museum--the Nation's  first combination children's museum and science center--to remain  centrally located in the Nation's Capital for the benefit of the  millions who visit and live in the city and the national capital  region. Originally named the Capital Children's Museum, the National  Children's Museum was a staple in the District for decades. The  institution opened in 1974 in a former convent on H Street Northeast.  In 2003, Congress recognized the immense value of having a children's  museum in D.C. and officially designated the museum as the National  Children's Museum. Now the museum is bringing new and innovative  science, technology, engineering, arts, and math--or STEAM--exhibits to  the Nation's Capital, building on more than 30 years of educating D.C.  children and families.   Importantly, this bill would relieve concerns about the ability of  the museum to survive the coronavirus pandemic. When the museum  reopened in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center  this year, it immediately attracted many visitors from throughout the  national capital region and the Nation but was forced by the pandemic  to close 18 days later.   At this time, the museum remains temporarily closed until further  notice. Still, the museum has continued to offer valuable STEAM  resources to our children as they navigate these new challenging  learning circumstances, including over 75 at-home experiment and  project video programs, monthly  [[Page H5854]]  podcasts, virtual field trips, and a Climate Action Heroes Digital  Exhibit, among other resources.   When the museum does open, capacity will be restricted by at least 70  percent under social distancing guidelines. Due to the anticipated  reduction in capacity, the museum is estimating operating revenues will  amount to only 30 percent of the original goal for next year. Once  returned to full capacity, the museum expects to serve half a million  visitors a year, filling the STEAM content void in our Nation's Capital  and throughout the country.   Despite the many benefits it brings to the Nation's Capital, the  museum is an outlier. It is the only congressionally designated museum  expected to pay rent in a Federal building. This bill will allow the  museum to remain in its current Federal location and allow staff to  focus on bringing 21st century STEAM learning techniques to the  Nation's Capital.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), who is my good friend from our  region.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1869) to require the disclosure of ownership of high-security  space leased to accommodate a Federal agency, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1869         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

Except where otherwise provided, this Act shall apply with       respect to any lease or novation agreement entered into on or       after the date that is 6 months after the date of enactment       of this Act.   [[Page H5856]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 1869, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1869, the Secure Federal Leases  from Espionage and Suspicious Entanglement Act, or the Secure Federal  LEASEs Act, introduced by Senator Peters from Michigan.   In 2017, the Government Accountability Office published a report that  found that several Federal agencies were unknowingly leasing office  space in foreign-owned properties, some of which were used for high- security purposes. While the General Services Administration  subsequently implemented some policies to improve this lack of  awareness, more needs to be done.   S. 1869, the Secure Federal LEASEs Act, requires agencies to verify  the identity of a property's immediate or highest level owners if the  space will be used for high-security purposes. It does this by  requiring a property's owner to identify and disclose whether they are  a foreign person or entity, or if they are financed by foreign persons  or entities, before the Federal agency enters into a new or amended  lease agreement.   The bill also requires GSA and other agencies to include provisions  in future leases for high-security spaces that will require owners to  agree to having limited access, except where allowed by the tenant  agency.   To tackle the issue of foreign beneficial owners, this bill also  directs GSA to develop a governmentwide system that will enable Federal  property managers to collect individual information about each  beneficial owner of a property--including name, address, and some  government-issued identification--within 2 years of passage. This would  allow for the identification and disclosure of foreign ownership that  might otherwise elude detection under GSA's current system.   GSA has made some positive changes in response to the 2017 GAO report  on this issue, but this legislation ensures that their best-practice  policies are followed uniformly by all agencies, particularly those  with independent leasing authority, and improved going forward.   While a lessor may be approved by the Federal Government, it may not  be appropriate for an agency to lease a high-security space from the  lessor. This legislation will require agencies to evaluate the risks of  doing so. By developing a new, more rigorous beneficial owner  identification system, the Federal Government can be more vigilant in  ensuring that foreign governments do not have access to our most  sensitive leased properties.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5953) to amend the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 to  require the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to  waive certain debts owed to the United States related to covered  assistance provided to an individual or household, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5953         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Disaster       Revictimization Act''.       SEC. 2. FLEXIBILITY.         Section 1216(a) of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018       (42 U.S.C. 5174a(a)) is amended--        (1) by amending paragraph (2)(A) to read as follows:        ``(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), shall--        ``(i) waive a debt owed to the United States related to       covered assistance provided to an individual or household if       the covered assistance was distributed based on an error by       the Agency and such debt shall be construed as a hardship;       and        ``(ii) waive a debt owed to the United States related to       covered assistance provided to an individual or household if       such assistance is subject to a claim or legal action,       including in accordance with section 317 of the Robert T.       Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42       U.S.C. 5160); and''; and        (2) in paragraph (3)(B)--        (A) by striking ``Removal of'' and inserting ``Report on'';       and        (B) in clause (ii) by striking ``the authority of the       Administrator to waive debt under paragraph (2) shall no       longer be effective'' and inserting ``the Administrator shall       report to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate actions that       the Administrator will take to reduce the error rate''.       SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.         The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management       Agency shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate a report containing a description of the internal       processes used to make decisions regarding the distribution       of covered assistance under section 1216 of the Disaster       Recovery and Reform Act of 2018 (42 U.S.C. 5174a) and any       changes made to such processes.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H5857]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5953, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5953, the Preventing Disaster  Revictimization Act, introduced by Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure Ranking Member Graves from Missouri, Representative  Huffman, Representative Thompson, Representative LaMalfa from  California, and Congresswoman Plaskett from the U.S. Virgin Islands.   This legislation is designed to ensure disaster survivors are not  revictimized by recoupment--or clawbacks--of Federal disaster  assistance they have received from the Federal Emergency Management  Agency.   Unfortunately, FEMA has repeatedly instructed disaster survivors to  register for individual assistance for which they were ultimately not  eligible or granted qualified survivors more assistance than they  qualified for. However, once FEMA identifies its error, it forces these  survivors into a bureaucratic nightmare to appeal the debt that they  now owe as a result of FEMA's error.   I am not surprised this still goes on, but I am disappointed that,  given the technology and data we have at our fingertips, we have not  been able to improve this system for survivors, more so given how small  a piece of the Federal disaster recovery apparatus this is.   H.R. 5953 would waive survivors' debt owed to the Federal Government  in instances where FEMA erroneously distributed assistance.   This bill would also provide a similar waiver to disaster survivors  who may be involved in legal action against a party deemed responsible  for a disaster event. While this scenario is less common, it is  currently playing out in California and jeopardizing disaster relief  for tens of thousands of families displaced by unprecedented wildfires  of the last few years.   Survivors have already been traumatized by a disaster. The Federal  Government should not force them to endure a convoluted process to  correct FEMA's mistake or decision to pursue legal action years after  the event against a liable party.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and ask my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4358) to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency to submit to Congress a report on preliminary damage  assessment and to establish damage assessment teams in the Federal  Emergency Management Agency, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4358         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preliminary Damage       Assessment Improvement Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Preliminary damage assessments play a critical role in       assessing and validating the impact and magnitude of a       disaster.        (2) Through the preliminary damage assessment process,       representatives from the Federal Emergency Management Agency       validate information gathered by State and local officials       that serves as the basis for disaster assistance requests.        (3) Various factors can impact the duration of a       preliminary damage assessment and the corresponding       submission of a major disaster request, however, the average       time between when a disaster occurs, and the submission of a       corresponding disaster request has been found to be       approximately twenty days longer for flooding disasters.        (4) With communities across the country facing increased       instances of catastrophic flooding and other extreme weather       events, accurate and efficient preliminary damage assessments       have become critically important to the relief process for       impacted states and municipalities.       SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency shall submit to Congress a report       describing the preliminary damage assessment process, as       supported by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the 5       years before the date of enactment of this Act.        (b) Contents.--The report described in subsection (a) shall       contain the following:        (1) The process of the Federal Emergency Management Agency       for deploying personnel to support preliminary damage       assessments.        (2) The number of Agency staff participating on disaster       assessment teams.        (3) The training and experience of such staff described in       paragraph (2).        (4) A calculation of the average amount of time disaster       assessment teams described in paragraph (1) are deployed to a       disaster area.        (5) The efforts of the Agency to maintain a consistent       liaison between the Agency and State, local, Tribal, and       territorial officials within a disaster area.       SEC. 4. PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency shall establish a training regime       under section 206.33(b) of title 44, Code of Federal       Regulations, within the Federal Emergency Management Agency       to ensure preliminary damage assessments are conducted and       reviewed under consistent guidelines.        (b) Annual Report.--The Administrator shall annually submit       to Congress a report on the number and type of instances       under which Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel       have overturned decisions made by personnel in the field.        (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 2 years after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit       to Congress a report--        (1) describing the establishment of disaster guidelines       from Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel described       under subsection (a);        (2) assessing whether the duration of the deployment of       Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel to conduct a       preliminary damage assessment is longer based on specific       disaster conditions; and        (3) containing legislative recommendations to improve the       operation, deployment, and staffing of disaster personnel.        (d) Definition of State and Local Government.--For purposes       of this Act, the terms ``State'' and ``local government''       have the meanings given such terms in section 102 of the       Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance       Act (42 U.S.C. 5122).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4358, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4358, as amended, the  Preliminary Damage Assessment Improvement Act of 2020, introduced by  Mr. Katko from New York.   H.R. 4358, as amended, would direct the Federal Emergency Management  Agency to produce a report examining the preliminary damage assessment,  or PDA, process and establish a more consistent training regime for  FEMA personnel to effectively support these assessments at State,  local, Tribal, and territorial units of government.   FEMA uses PDA findings in the wake of a disaster to determine the  extent of damage and the subsequent unmet needs of individuals,  businesses, and the public sector in the affected community.   This bill would ensure greater consistency for PDAs across FEMA's 10  regions by creating a training program with a goal of ensuring that  data collected and reviewed is done in a more consistent manner.   As communities across the country experience more extreme weather  events, timely and consistent PDAs have never been more important to  the recovery process of disaster-declared areas.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and ask my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2914) to make available necessary disaster assistance for  families affected by major disasters, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2914         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2914, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2914, the Housing Survivors of  Major Disasters Act, introduced by Mr. Espaillat of New York and Miss  Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico.   This bipartisan legislation is aimed at reducing the bureaucratic  burden placed on the disaster survivors when applying for Federal  assistance. In the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and several other  disasters in the continental United States, including wildfires near  California or near Oregon, many disaster survivors have struggled to  produce documents necessary to prove their residency. This is  particularly difficult when those disasters have decimated all of their  possessions and records.   Additionally, qualified survivors have had trouble registering for  assistance because they resided in homes passed down from generation to  generation, in areas where title record-keeping hasn't been adequately  maintained to track these transfers. We have seen this issue time and  again over the last decade and a half since Hurricane Katrina.   FEMA has worked to address these challenges, but all efforts to this  point have been ad hoc. H.R. 2914 formalizes the home certification  process that FEMA has developed over the years, allowing survivors to  self-certify their residency with an expanded list of acceptable  supported documentation.   Survivors should not be expected to wade through bureaucratic red  tape after their lives have been upended by a disaster.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2914, and I would ask my colleagues to do  the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
