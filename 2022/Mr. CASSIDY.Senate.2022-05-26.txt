 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a group  of committed Louisiana fathers making a difference in their community  and the lives of their children.   Violence within the halls of Southwood High School in Shreveport  reached a concerning peak in the fall of 2021, when 23 students were  arrested in just 3 days.   Mr. Michael LaFitte gathered 40 fellow concerned fathers, including  David Telsee, III, Michael Morgan, Zachery Johnson, and Kenneth Henry,  Jr., and established a wholesome presence in the halls of Southwood  High. They were able to quell conflict and violence. They are promoting  peace, order, and dropping dad jokes with a profound impact. They have  prevented fights and arrests since forming their group, Dads on Duty.  By fostering a safer environment in Southwood High, Dads on Duty has  allowed the youth to focus on learning and growing.   Dads on Duty is demonstrating a strategy they believe can benefit  students in other schools. They have plans to introduce this program of  engaged parents in each Caddo Parish school campus moving forward.   Dads on Duty has garnered attention at the city, parish, State, and  national levels--and rightfully so. I applaud their efforts and look  forward to seeing how they can continue to better our  communities.                            ____________________
