 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Melinda  Graczyk, a lifelong volunteer in service to the people of Redford  Township in Michigan's 12th District Strong.   Melinda embraced her passion to serve the unrepresented, chairing  Redford's newly formed commission for diversity, equity, and inclusion  in order to create a more welcoming community for all.   Through her work with the Jaycees, Melinda volunteered to build local  community gardens which provided thousands of pounds of fresh  vegetables to families in need. They also founded the Redford farmer's  market, providing a local source of fresh, locally grown food at an  affordable price.   As a volunteer and eventually president of Redford's festival  committee, they helped plan and execute all of Redford's local  festivals throughout the year, creating opportunities for residents to  gather and foster a sense of community.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Melinda Graczyk's  unwavering service to our district and the Redford Township community  as we honor her memory.                            ____________________
