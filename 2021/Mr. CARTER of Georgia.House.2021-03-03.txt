 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Mrs. Eleanor ``Sandy'' Torrey West, who passed  away on January 17 at the age of 108.   Mrs. West was known as a woman who embodied the spirit of Ossabaw  Island, which is the third largest of Georgia's barrier islands, just  south of Savannah.   She established the Ossabaw Island Project in the 1960s and the  Genesis Project in the 1970s as ways to allow students, artists,  writers, scientists, ecologists, philosophers, and other intellectuals  and creative thinkers to reconnect with the natural world and with each  other.   In the late 1970s, Mrs. West spearheaded her family's effort to  ensure that Ossabaw Island would remain preserved and protected.   She was the champion of Ossabaw, and her enthusiastic, joyful spirit  shined in everything she did.  [[Page H1020]]    Throughout Mrs. West's long, prosperous life, she inspired countless  individuals.   I am so thankful for her many contributions to Georgia's First  District, and I know her legacy will continue for years to come.   My thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends, and all who  knew her during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  this bill, and that is a shame, because this is an area that is ripe  for bipartisan compromise.   But the House continues to spend its time forcing through another  Democratic package that had zero Republican input. We considered this  very same bill last Congress, but it only passed the House with three  Republican votes in support.   Meanwhile, my colleagues, Representative Pete Stauber and Senator Tim  Scott, have proposed the JUSTICE Act to positively reform police to  serve all Americans equally.   However, their sincere efforts have not even been considered by those  across the aisle. That bill would improve law enforcement transparency,  require more detailed records on the use of force, provide funds for  body cameras, ban choke holds, and improve training to intervene in  situations and deescalate. These are all things we agree upon.   Yet, instead of equipping our law enforcement for success, we are  considering this bill that would make it harder for our police officers  to keep our communities safe.   Every community is different and dictating policy from Washington  will only constrain our law enforcement heroes who put their lives on  the line.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
