 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of Richard Roy  Kelley, M.D., a true ``keiki o ka aina,'' ``a child of the land,'' son  of Hawaii, just lost to us at age 88.   Doc Kelly was born to Hawaii's original hoteliers, Roy and Estelle  Kelley, founders of Outrigger Hotels and Resorts. He grew up in their  Waikiki hotels, graduated from Stanford and Harvard, and practiced in  Honolulu before helming Outrigger through its second generation.   On Doc's watch, Outrigger expanded throughout Hawaii and the Pacific  into a world-famous iconic beach resort brand; success for any life.   But Doc Kelley did far more. He pioneered true cultural tourism in  ``Ke Ano Wa'a,'' or ``the Outrigger Way,'' through which the entire  lifeblood of each property embraces and embodies its special values and  place. He led the World Travel and Tourism Council and advised our own  Travel and Tourism Council. And he endlessly loved Hawaii and his ``  'ohana,'' ``family,'' and never stopped giving back.   Richard ``Doc'' Kelley, an amazing and unforgettable life. From all  of us to you and yours, mahalo, and aloha.                            ____________________
