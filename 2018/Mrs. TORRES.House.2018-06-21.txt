 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes.  [[Page H5373]]    This rule makes in order H.R. 4760, the so-called Securing America's  Future Act, and two amendments in the legislation.   Before I speak on the legislation, let us consider why we are here  today. President Trump has created immigration crisis after immigration  crisis. President Trump is the reason Dreamers are at risk of  deportation. President Trump is the reason families are being separated  at our Nation's borders. This is a Trump-manufactured crisis, plain and  simple.   President Trump's executive order, signed yesterday, does nothing to  fix this. His order does nothing to reunite the thousands of children  separated from their parents. In fact, his order directs his  deportation force to now jail families at the border, which is in  direct violation of current court orders. It will lead to more family  separation, and the only difference now is that families will wait 20  days before being separated.   I want every Member of this body and everyone watching at home to  imagine what it must be like. Imagine traveling thousands of miles to  flee some of the most dangerous countries in the world, countries with  the highest murder rates, and then, when you finally think you are  safe, having your child ripped away from you.   In 1946 to 1948, during the Truman administration, human experiments  were conducted in Guatemala. American doctors infected mostly  uneducated and indigenous people with syphilis. Today, in the Trump  administration, we are forcing drugs in pill form and injection on the  indigenous children seeking asylum.   So this brings us to why we are here today. Mr. Speaker, everyone  watching this debate should be crystal clear on what this bill does.  This bill fails to solve the separation of families on our Nation's  border. It reduces legal immigration. It fails to offer DACA recipients  a path to citizenship. It adds $25 billion to our growing wall of debt  on top of the $2 trillion that we already added when Republicans voted  for their tax scam.   This bill makes it harder for those seeking asylum to receive  protection, and it fails to protect the 2,000 children who have already  been separated from their parents.   Many will call this legislation the more conservative option that the  House will consider today. But let us be clear, this bill is not  conservative at all.   After adding trillions to our Nation's debt through the tax scam,  Republicans now are putting us in another $25 billion debt. Where are  we going to borrow this money from?   Remember, colleagues, President Trump has declared a trade war with  China. What will happen if China decides to cash in on that debt?   In addition, President Trump's family jails will cost the American  taxpayer 10 times more than the alternative policy he ended for family  migration.   Conservative? Absolutely not. Cruel? Inhumane? Absolutely, yes.    Mr. Speaker, last night, during consideration of this bill in the  Rules Committee, my colleagues and I offered many fixes, which were all  blocked by this rule. My amendment to replace the bill with the Keep  Families Together Act, which would have reunited families, was blocked.   Representative Roybal-Allard and Representative Polis joined me in  offering the Dream Act as an alternative, but that was blocked also.   Another Rules Committee Member, Representative Hastings, and his  amendment to fix TPS, blocked.   But not all amendments were blocked. Just like President Trump's  executive order contained misspellings, this bill contained a giant  typo to give President Trump an additional $100 billion for his wall.   So which is it? $25 billion? $100 billion? Are Mexicans going to pay  for it? What is it?   The committee has said that they are making this correction, and they  did so in the middle of the night. But I doubt President Trump would be  happy to hear that, so we will wait and see.   If this truly is a mistake, these kinds of corrections could have  been caught if Democrats had been allowed to participate in this  process, if we would have had a committee hearing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and this cruel  legislation now, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Rules.                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Hastings), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, Chairman Goodlatte just clarified that his  bill has been in print for 6 months. I thank the gentleman for  clarifying. The American people should know that your real intention  was to allocate $100 million for the Trump wall, and it wasn't until we  shined the light on that, that in the middle of the night the  Republican caucus scrambled to reduce that amount to $25 million.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  offer an amendment to strike the text of this rule and insert House  Resolution 774, Representative Denham's bipartisan queen-of-the-hill  resolution. This rule would bring up four separate immigration bills to  be debated and voted on the House floor.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), who is the distinguished ranking  member of the Committee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in 1970, a Guatemalan couple decided to send their  daughter to the U.S. That young girl was I. I was welcomed here in a  loving home. I was not put in a freezing cell. My parents felt they had  no choice. My mother died a couple of years later.   These parents are making a choice that, frankly, I could not make  today for my children. A few months ago, I was away from home for so  long--4 weeks--that my grandson, a 3-year-old, felt he had to  reintroduce himself to me because he had not seen me for 4 weeks. He  didn't think that I would remember him. Imagine an infant when that  infant is returned to their parent; they will be introduced to a total  stranger.   Pope Francis just tweeted: Pray together, walk together, work  together. This is the way that leads to Christian unity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and this cruel  legislation. Let's help those who can't help themselves in these very  corrupt countries of the Northern Triangle. They are not s---holes as  the President has referred to them. Let's give them an opportunity to  live another day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
