 Mr. Speaker, I have not had the privilege to serve on the  Agriculture Committee, but, given the comments of the gentleman there,  I would suggest as an amendment that, since this bill is about work, we  have work for 12-year-olds. Maybe boys could be shoeshine boys and the  girls could be shampoo girls at the beauty salon so that they can help  subsidize families.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying that is appropriate for  this discussion: ``If you aren't at the table, you are on the menu.''  And children are definitely on the menu and at the tender mercies of  the job market.   This bill will cut access not only for SNAP but kids who go to school  every day. This means in my State there will be 23,000 kids who will  not get school lunch and breakfast because of this bill.   I am going to turn in, Mr. Speaker, some of the stories of people in  my district who need SNAP, real people, single people like Jana, who  has worked on a job for 11 years, lost her job, and has been looking  for work for 3 months and couldn't find it.   I would ask that we reject this bill for people who need SNAP to  survive. This bill is not about work. It is about taking food out of  the mouths of babes.
