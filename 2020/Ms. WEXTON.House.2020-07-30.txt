 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  No. 340 in En Bloc 4 to provide $9 million to the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) to continue its work developing the remote tower  pilot program.   The remote tower pilot program is a simple and cost-effective way to  provide air traffic control services to an airport from any location.  Remote towers use a network of high-definition cameras and sensors to  feed real-time information to air traffic controllers, who can be  located at the airport or at a separate remote tower center. Remote  tower infrastructure is cheaper, more flexible, and requires less  extensive maintenance and upkeep than manned air traffic control  towers, allowing the FAA and airports to address their air traffic  control needs more cheaply. Remote towers also provide controllers with  additional capabilities, including night vision with infrared cameras,  enhanced visibility in poor weather or low light conditions, views of  high-traffic areas or blind spots, moving object tracking, and real- time data overlays.   I am very pleased that the first remote tower in the U.S. is  currently being tested at Leesburg Executive Airport in Virginia's 10th  Congressional District. Launched in 2014, remote tower technology has  provided Leesburg with air traffic control capabilities without having  to construct a manned air traffic control tower. These capabilities  support Leesburg's more than 100,000 annual operations in highly  complex airspace due to the airport's proximity to Dulles International  Airport.   The remote tower pilot program at Leesburg has been a great success,  and my amendment will ensure that the FAA can continue this work at  Leesburg and at new pilot sites around the country to further develop  these important technologies. I thank the Committee for the inclusion  of this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
