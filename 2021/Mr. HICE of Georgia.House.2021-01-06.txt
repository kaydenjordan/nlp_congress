 Mr. President, myself, members of the Georgia  delegation, and some 74 of my Republican colleagues and I object to the  electoral vote from the State of Georgia on the grounds that the  election conducted on November 3 was faulty and fraudulent due to  unilateral actions by the secretary of state to unlawfully change the  State's election process without approval from the General Assembly and  thereby setting the stage for an unprecedented amount of fraud and  irregularities. I have signed the objection myself.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Sections 15 and 17 of title 3, United States  Code, require that any objection be presented in writing and signed by  a Member of the House of Representatives and a Senator.   Is the objection in writing and signed by a Member and a Senator?    Mr. President, prior to the actions and events  of today, we did, but following the events of today, it appears that  some Senators have withdrawn their objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. In that case, the objection cannot be  entertained.   This certificate from Hawaii, the Parliamentarians have advised me,  is the only certificate of vote from that State that purports to be a  return from the State and that has annexed to it a certificate from an  authority of the State purporting to appoint and ascertain electors.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H95, first column and 10th paragraph,  the following appeared: The VICE PRESIDENT. In that case, the  objection cannot be entertained. This certificate from Hawaii, the  Parliamentarian has advised me, is the only certificate of vote  from that State that purports to be a return from the State and  that has annexed to it a certificate from an authority of the  State purporting to appoint and ascertain electors.      The online version has been corrected to read: The VICE  PRESIDENT. In that case, the objection cannot be entertained. This  certificate from Hawaii, the Parliamentarians have advised me, is  the only certificate of vote from that State that purports to be a  return from the State and that has annexed to it a certificate  from an authority of the State purporting to appoint and ascertain  electors.    ========================= END NOTE =========================
