 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the HBCU 9, the nine  Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are celebrating 150  years of academic excellence.   These schools hail from six States and count great African-American  leaders such as Eva Clayton, John Lewis, and Martin Luther King, Jr.,  as members of their illustrious alumni.   The nine include: Alabama State University, Barber-Scotia College,  Fayetteville State University, Howard University, Johnson C. Smith  University, Morehouse College, Morgan State University, St. Augustine  University, and Talladega College.   Their achievements for the past 150 years are remarkable. They have  cultivated a long history as incubators of innovation and continue to  produce the next generation of leaders.   Twenty-five percent of African-American STEM graduates, 40 percent of  African-American lawyers, 50 percent of African-American teachers, and  21 current members of the Congressional Black Caucus are proud HBCU  grads.   These schools were born out of necessity and have endured the test of  time to spark a movement and create the African-American middle class,  fundamentally changing this country for the better.   Please stand with me in recognizing the HBCU 9 for their years of  leadership in African-American communities and their dedication to  helping students realize their dreams.                            ____________________
