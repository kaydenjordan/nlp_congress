 Mr. Speaker, the disastrous decisions  by Biden hurts the pocketbooks of Americans and destroys jobs, made  even more obvious as we enter the holiday season of Christmas and  Hanukkah.   Bidenomics inflation has overcome hourly raises, reducing the  spending power of Americans by $11,434 annually in the two Biden years.   Under Biden, prices for the same Thanksgiving dinner were 25 percent  higher in 2023 than in 2019. As Christmas approaches, Americans are  challenged. In a WalletHub survey, more than one in three Americans are  foregoing gifts this year due to Bidenflation.   Republicans, led by Speaker   Mike Johnson, will continue to fight to  reduce inflation and create jobs. Speaker Johnson is correct that we  must support the borders of Ukraine and America.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues  moving from the safe haven of Afghanistan to America with Biden open  borders for terrorists.   It is sadly clear there will be more 9/11 attacks across America imminent, as finally admitted by the FBI.                            ____________________
