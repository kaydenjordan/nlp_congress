 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a great American on  his birthday: my dad, Dick Cheney.   I can imagine no better role model than this good and great man. He  loved his time serving in this Chamber as the gentleman from Wyoming.  Throughout a career spanning decades, including during some of the most  challenging times our Nation has faced, he was a steady and wise hand  who always led with the courage of his convictions.   No matter the burden he carried, he has always been there for us as a  listener and teacher. He taught my sister and me to love our country,  to read history and learn from it, to listen more than you talk, that a  man's word should be his bond, and that we owe all we have as Americans  to the brave men and women in uniform who fought and died to keep us  free.   Madam Speaker, the gratitude I have for my dad as an American is  surpassed only by my love for him as his daughter.   Happy birthday, Dad.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Republican Conference,  I offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 719         Resolved, That the following named Member be, and is       hereby, elected to the following standing committee of the       House of Representatives:        Committee on Natural Resources: Mr. Curtis.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 714 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 714         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 695)       to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to       establish a national criminal history background check system       and criminal history review program for certain individuals       who, related to their employment, have access to children,       the elderly, or individuals with disabilities, and for other       purposes, with the Senate amendments thereto, and to consider       in the House, without intervention of any point of order, a       single motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       Appropriations or his designee that the House: (1) concur in       the Senate amendment to the title; and (2) concur in the       Senate amendment to the text with an amendment consisting of       the text of Rules Committee Print 115-56. The Senate       amendments and the motion shall be considered as read. The       motion shall be debatable for one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the motion to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 714,  which provides for consideration of a single motion to concur in the  Senate amendments to H.R. 695, the Department of Defense Appropriations  Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   Madam Speaker, we meet here today, 122 days into the current fiscal  year. FY 2018 is one-third over, and yet the United States Congress has  been unable to appropriate funds for the defense of our Nation.   I ask my colleagues, Madam Speaker, to pause and let that sink in.  The fiscal  [[Page H691]]  year is over 30 percent done, and we have been unable to appropriate  the funds our military needs to defend the Nation.   Madam Speaker, this is nothing new. The United States Congress has  forced the U.S. military to operate like this under continuing  resolutions for 9 of the last 10 years. The rule and the underlying  bill that we are debating and voting on today, Madam Speaker, is a  crucial step towards reversing this dangerous trend.   This Defense Appropriations bill is a clean bill. It clears away all  the politics. It clears away all the posturing. It clears away all the  jargon and the process arguments.   Madam Speaker, this is an up-or-down vote on the one issue that  matters more than any other: providing for the common defense of our  Republic.   The question before this House today is whether we will do our  constitutional duty and provide the funds for those who are putting  their lives on the line for all of us. There is no other question,  Madam Speaker. And for those who vote ``no,'' there will be no place to  hide when history comes to ask why they failed to do their duty.   Our military has been strangled for the last decade, Madam Speaker.  Obama-era budget cuts are certainly to blame. The Obama  administration's defense budgets were based on a set of dangerous  policies and false assumptions:   They assumed we could withdraw from the Middle East and the  terrorists would stop fighting.   They assumed we could talk North Korea out of their nuclear program  with a policy of ``strategic patience.''   They assumed Russian and Chinese efforts to upend the global world  order the United States built and sustained with our allies over 70  years were no threat to our national security.   Perhaps worst of all, Madam Speaker, they assumed that paying  billions of dollars to the regime in Tehran in exchange for  unverifiable promises from the mullahs about their nuclear program  would serve America's interests. Never before, Madam Speaker, has an  American President been so wrong about so much at the expense of so  many.   But we in Congress must also accept some of the blame. While the  previous administration was pursuing policies that aided our  adversaries and harmed our national interests, the United States  Congress adopted the Budget Control Act, a law that has proven  devastating to the security of our Nation.   Beginning with the Budget Control Act in 2011, the United States  Congress imposed arbitrary spending caps on domestic and defense  discretionary spending. We handcuffed the military, Madam Speaker. No  longer could they ask: What are the threats, and what do we need to  defend ourselves? Instead, our men and women in uniform were faced with  arbitrary caps and, in 2013, sequestration.   When the supercommittee that was established by the Budget Control  Act failed to come to any agreement on cuts in mandatory spending-- mandatory spending being the real driver, Madam Speaker, of our  national debt--sequestration kicked in. This was like taking a meat  cleaver to every account in the defense budget at a time of war when  our adversaries are gaining in strength, readiness, and capability  every day.   By every measure, Madam Speaker, the Budget Control Act has failed.  Since its passage in 2011, the national debt has grown by nearly $4  trillion.                                time  1230    Five years ago, the CBO estimated that the U.S. debt would reach 80  percent of GDP by 2029. Today, Madam Speaker, the CBO projects that  will happen by 2022. The Budget Control Act has failed to do what it  intended to do.   Madam Speaker, we have got to acknowledge something else. The Budget  Control Act created the concept on which our current budget  negotiations are stalled. The idea, espoused especially by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that we must have  ``parity''--for every dollar we increase defense spending, they demand  a dollar increase in domestic spending--is lunacy, Madam Speaker.   We are the people's elected Representatives with the responsibility  for stewardship over taxpayer dollars. We are responsible for  appropriating funds for the Nation. Those funds should be appropriated  based upon our determination of the needs and priorities, not based  upon some arbitrary concept of parity.   The dysfunction in this budget process is now so great, Madam  Speaker, that, because of the BCA, we are in the process of actually  spending more on programs we don't need. It is time to fully repeal the  BCA.   Madam Speaker, my colleague on the Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern,  will no doubt shortly point out that Republicans control the House and  the Senate and the White House. He is right, of course. But Mr.  McGovern also knows that it takes 60 votes to pass anything in the  Senate, which gives the Democrats and their leader, Chuck Schumer,  power far beyond what they would otherwise enjoy to block action.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, we have passed all 12 appropriations bills  through this body, including this Defense Appropriations bill, only to  have these bills languish in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, the defense of this Nation must no longer be held  hostage to the rules of the United States Senate. If 60 United States  Senators cannot be found to do what is right and fund our military,  then, Mr. Speaker, that body has a constitutional obligation to change  its rules and stop allowing a small minority to hold our military  hostage for political reasons.   The threat is real and the situation is dire, Mr. Speaker. Today, we  have the smallest Army since before World War II, the smallest Navy  since before World War I, and the smallest and oldest Air Force we have  ever had.   Only 5 of 58 brigade combat teams in the Army are ``ready to fight  tonight.'' Funding for future readiness against competitors like Russia  and China has been cut by over 70 percent in the last 10 years. As  North Korea's missile program advances, the U.S. inventory of missile  defense interceptors is dangerously low. Less than half of the Navy's  aircraft can fly, due to maintenance and spare parts issues. Only 50  percent of the Air Force's combat forces are sufficiently ready for a  highly contested fight against a peer adversary.   Mr. Speaker, we are running out of bombs. Our supply of precision  munitions has been depleted by budget cuts and increased operations.  Fatal accidents are increasing. This is all happening, Mr. Speaker, as  the global threat environment is more complex, more imminent, and more  grave than at any time since World War II. Every day we fail to do our  duty in this body, the risk to our troops increases, and it becomes  easier for our adversaries to close the capabilities gap.   Surely, Mr. Speaker, on this issue we can set politics aside and do  what is right for our Republic, for our freedom, and for every man and  woman standing watch on the front lines for all of us. Therefore, Mr.  Speaker, I urge support of this rule and the underlying bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate, as always, the candor of my colleague, Mr.  McGovern. But, I have to say, I am having a hard time understanding why  it is, when he is so clearly knowledgeable about the damage that CRs do  to the military, we are, today, presenting an opportunity for this  entire House to stop that process for this entire House to provide the  kind of reliable, secure, sufficient funding that our troops need; yet,  I would imagine, many colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  going to vote ``no'' on that.   I think it is important, though, to recognize some facts, Mr.  Speaker:   The first of those is, for all the talk about a budget agreement, it  was the leadership on the other side of the aisle that refused to go to  a meeting at the White House a couple of months ago and pulled out  completely of the talks last year.   It was also, with all due respect, Mr. Speaker, the leadership on the  other side of the aisle, the Democrat leadership, that shut the  government down 2 weeks ago. So it is awfully hard, I am sure, to be  able to convince constituents back home that they really want to get  this job done and get things moving when they continue to stop the  process, to gum up the works, and even to shut down the government.   Mr. Speaker, I know that every Member of this body cares deeply about  the U.S. troops. And I know that every Member of this body wants what  is right for this Nation. But there is a big difference between having  the luxury of talking about support for the troops and actually voting  for the funds they need to do their job. Talk does not buy equipment;  talk does not get our planes back in the air; talk does not provide pay  raises for our troops; talk does not provide the kind of protection our  servicemen and -women need, the equipment that they need, to do their  job; talk does not roll back Russia, or China, or Iran, or North Korea.   For that, the Pentagon needs money. The only way that our military  will get money is if we appropriate: if we break the cycle of  continuing resolutions and pass this appropriations bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Byrne), my dear friend and colleague from the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen now on display in this debate exactly the  problem and, frankly, it is despicable, Mr. Speaker.   We are in a situation where our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are holding hostage funding for our troops over the issue of  illegal immigration. There is no other way to describe it. There is no  other way to--I can't put it into words. The people who are watching, I  am sure, have seen it on the floor right now.   If my colleagues feel so strongly about support for the troops, there  is a very easy answer. And that answer is to vote for this bill, to  vote to support this appropriation, not to try to divert attention, not  to try to talk about other issues, not to try to talk about the extent  to which we haven't reached a deal.   We have got a bill and we are putting it on the floor. It funds the  troops. It ends the damage that has been done by the continuing  resolutions. They ought to vote for it, we ought to pass it, and then  our colleagues in the Senate should do the same.   They cannot, at the same time, say that they support our troops, that  they support resources for the troops, and then go through all of these  contortions trying to explain why it is they are going to vote ``no''  on this issue.   I would also just say, Mr. Speaker, the fact that the United States  Senate right now is either incapable or unable of doing its  constitutional duty does not absolve us in this House of the obligation  to do ours, and that is to provide funding and resources for the U.S.  military.   It is absolutely a broken system. We are in a situation where I would  ask my colleagues to think, as they are arguing on this floor, debating  on this floor today, about the parents of men and women who are  deployed, to think about what this debate must sound like to them, to  think about trying to explain to them why it is when we have a bill  that provides the funding the military needs, our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle are going to vote ``no'' because of some budget  process, some budget procedure, because of negotiations over DACA,  because of any other reason under the sun they can imagine.   Vote ``yes'' on this bill, vote ``yes'' for this rule, and then we  can go on and deal with these other issues. But, Mr. Speaker, none of  those other issues will matter. If we fail to do what is right for the  military, none of those other issues will matter.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think that if my colleague on the other side of the  aisle spent more time focused on doing his job and less time on telling  us to do ours, we would be in a lot better shape. I think the American  people deserve to know what is going on in these budget negotiations.   What is going on in these budget negotiations, Mr. Speaker, is that  the leadership on the other side of the aisle continues to move the  goalpost. They enjoy this political fight, this political dance. They  enjoy the sense that they can hold us hostage, they can hold the troops  hostage.   They seem to not have any concern at all about the fact that we are  now 30 percent of the way through the fiscal year and our troops have  not been funded.   So behind closed doors, what is going on is moving the goalpost; it  is Lucy and the football. They want to continue playing these games.   So I would suggest that my colleague on the other side of the aisle  ought to turn his focus and attention on his own leadership and ask  them to do their job.   In the meantime, Mr. Speaker, we are in a position where we are today  considering a bill that will fund the military.  [[Page H696]]    I applaud my colleague's efforts to try again and again and again to  make the case that he believes in funding the military, he believes we  ought to have a full year appropriation, he believes we have got to get  out from under the CR, and, therefore, he is going to vote ``no'' on  this bill. It takes, really, focus and attention and talent to be able  to do that, so I applaud that effort, but the reality is the reality,  Mr. Speaker. We are in a position today where we have the opportunity  to vote to fund the troops, and we ought to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, some things are complicated, but this one isn't. Our  colleagues, if they are so concerned about the national security of  this Nation, there is a very easy thing for them to do, and that is to  vote for this Defense Appropriations bill.   It is really important for us, as we are having this debate, to  remember the facts; and the facts of the budget negotiations are that  it was the Democrat leadership that walked away from the table and  stalled the negotiations. It was the Democrat leadership, Mr. Speaker,  that shut down the government.   So the Republicans, right now, understanding and recognizing how  crucial it is for us to get the Defense Department out from under these  damaging continuing resolutions, to provide them with sufficient,  secure funding, reliable funding, we are moving a clean Defense  Appropriations bill.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can yell all they want  about having us do our job, and, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. Our  job, our most important job, our job that is crucial and sacred above  all others, is to provide funding and resources for the military of  this Nation. That is what this bill does. That is why we are, today,  presented with an opportunity to do the right thing.   With this bill, with a vote in support of this rule, and a vote in  support of the underlying bill, we can begin to reverse the damage of  the last 7 years.   It is time, Mr. Speaker, to stop with these political games. It is  time to stop moving the goalposts. It is time to stop holding defense  spending hostage to illegal immigration issues, holding defense  spending hostage to increased domestic spending. It is time to stop.  Our troops are on the front lines fighting and dying for us, and our  actions in this body are putting them at greater risk.   It is not, Mr. Speaker, as though we can sit here and fail to act,  and we are just delaying. Our failure to act is putting our men and  women in uniform at greater risk. Our failure to act is aiding our  adversaries.   I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, frankly,  to look in the mirror and to recognize that they are the ones right now  who hold the key, as do the Members of the United States Senate, to  making sure that we get these resources to our men and women in  uniform.   I would say, once again, Mr. Speaker, if we fail to do this, if we  fail to do our constitutional duty, nothing else we do matters. There  are no other individuals in this Nation who are charged the way we are  with providing for the common defense, and it is an individual duty and  obligation of every single one of us.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to mind the words spoken by Ronald  Reagan 35 years ago. As we engage in the political theater that my  colleague on the other side of the aisle mentioned in this House, it  needs to stop,  [[Page H697]]  and we need to remember what is important.   Ronald Reagan said: ``It is up to us in our time to choose, and  choose wisely, between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace  and freedom, and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly hope for  the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger day by day.''   Mr. Speaker, it is truly up to us. It is an individual obligation on  each Member of this body. Therefore, I urge adoption of both the rule  and the Senate amendments to H.R. 695.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 714 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
