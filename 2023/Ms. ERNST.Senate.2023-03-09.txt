 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize Big  River Packaging of Clinton, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week for the week of March 13, 2023.   In 2001, Bob Simpson found himself reflecting on the 350 jobs that  were lost due to the recent closure of the large paper plant in  Clinton. He saw the value of the experienced professionals in the area  and wanted to see their talent stay in his community. He and John  Huling cofounded Big River Packaging in 2005 with the big idea of  utilizing the dedicated local talent to create high-quality boxes.  After hiring Bob's son Kip Simpson as the first employee, they began to  make their dream a reality. Through trial and error, they slowly grew  their business until they eventually found a niche that truly ``takes  the cake'': bakery boxes. Once they discovered the need for bakery  boxes, they became dedicated to providing the best customer service to  a unique clientele whose needs are often overlooked by large  corporations.   In the folding carton industry, small carton orders for specialty  items are an underserved market. Many in the industry choose to focus  on big-volume orders, but Big River Packaging, on the other hand, has a  short-order/value-added market strategy. Big River Packaging aims to  help local bakeries by providing them with customized boxes, in volumes  that the ``big guy'' often ignores. To continue to serve these  specialized accounts with excellence, the company has decided to forgo  a physical storefront and instead run all their sales solely through  their website. The company strives to provide quality customer service  and do everything they can to foster long-term relationships with their  clients. This dedication has been evident since the beginning or, in  other words, since the fateful day John Huling stopped at his local  bakery to pick up a dozen donuts.   Years prior, cofounder John Huling went to a local bakery to pick up  donuts. While he was there, he discovered that the bakery needed a  special box to keep their cupcakes steady. At the time, the baker was  using sheet-cake boxes to transport cupcakes, leaving the individual  desserts totally unsecure inside the box and, as a result, ruining the  meticulously painted frosting on the cupcakes. Big River Packaging came  to the rescue and developed an insert grid with holes for the cupcakes  to keep them steady and upright. Keeping that same knack for product  innovation in mind, Big River Packaging continues to cater to the  unique needs of any bakery. Currently, Big River Packaging offers a  plethora of boxes and bags to fulfill every baker's packaging needs,  including cocoa bomb packaging, cupcake boxes, and paper bread bags.  Over the years, their reach has grown to over 120,000 customers, and  they have even expanded to international markets. In addition to their  unique approach to the packaging industry, it is the team's commitment  to high-quality products and top-notch customer service that has led to  the growth and success of Big River Packaging.   When you chase a dream, you might be surprised where it takes you.  Big River Packaging's commitment to the value of hard work has even  allowed some of their boxes to end up on the silver screen. A 2019  episode of the hit television series Grey's Anatomy features one of Big  River Packaging's boxes. Big River Packaging has also been recognized  by the Iowa Small Business Administration in 2017 in celebration of  National Manufacturing Day and National Manufacturing Week, and Bob  Simpson was named the 2018 National Small Business Person of  [[Page S740]]  the Year. Clearly, Mr. Simpson and Mr. Huling proved to be a dynamic  pair as the two have led Big River Packaging through impressive growth  and innovation, all while receiving accolades from industry experts and  beyond. I want to congratulate Mr. Simpson and Mr. Huling along with  the entire team at Big River Packaging. I look forward to seeing your  continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
