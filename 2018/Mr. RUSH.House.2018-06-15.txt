 Mr. Speaker, I rise today out of anger and frustration at a  deplorable situation in my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. I was shocked  to read in yesterday's Chicago Tribune about the callous disregard  demonstrated for our poor and vulnerable citizens by Alden Management  Services, who operate Wentworth Rehabilitation & Health Care Center in  my district, and I am here today to call on Alden to shut it down.   This so-called skilled nursing facility allowed a patient to remain  on fire while an employee enjoyed a beverage. To add insult to injury,  many residents have to endure bug bites, bruises, and other forms of  neglect. This is the epitome of negligence and should not happen. This  is America.   It is not a coincidence, Mr. Speaker, that most of these residents  are poor seniors and African Americans. Where were CMS and the other  regulatory and oversight authorities?   Mr. Speaker, this is reprehensible. Once again, I call for this  hellhole to be shut down immediately.                            ____________________
