 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Eddie Bernice  Johnson and all of the chairs of the committees and members who helped  bring the America COMPETES Act to where it is.   Madam Speaker, today I offer my amendment to the America COMPETES  Act. My amendment simply adds ``media and entertainment'' to the list  of eligible programs for nontraditional industries or occupations.                                time  1245    The U.S. media and entertainment industry plays a prominent role in  defining who we are as a nation, not only within our borders but across  the world. The media, as I know the media is plural, but the media as  an institution continues to serve as one of the main narrative-creating  and image-defining institutions conveying America's values and ideals  to audiences around the world.   Yet the lack of diverse talent in the industry's workforce fails to  reflect our population, therefore, stunting our ability to accurately  portray the U.S. as a multicultural symbol on a global scale, and also  sidelining millions and millions of Americans from participating in an  industry with well-paying jobs.   By expanding apprenticeship programs, we can build a foundation for  more Americans to begin professional careers in the media industry,  particularly those that have been traditionally excluded, such as  Latinos and other minority communities that are often underrepresented  and undervalued.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, to address some of the concerns, the media and  entertainment industry is one that involves different STEM fields such  as a wide variety of engineering positions, for example, many of which  have gone unfilled in different media corporations.   Also, as the gentlewoman knows, the GOP in particular has made a big  deal about our film industry yielding to different Chinese demands, for  example. So it is important that our government collaborate with the  industry to make sure that we have a well-prepared workforce that is  able to, again, make sure that the America media is robust.   We also want to be sure that--as you have industries like the media  industry that continue to, for example, go film television and movies  overseas, that American workers are well-prepared to take on those jobs  so that industry does not have a single excuse to go somewhere else but  to one of our cities and States in the United States. That is exactly  what this amendment will help do, is to bring about a more prepared  workforce to take on these roles so that industry doesn't have an  excuse to go somewhere else.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to amendment  56 by Representative Crenshaw.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I believe the information being solicited is  important, although I don't think that we need to pass a law to get it,  and we shouldn't have to pass a law to get it. In that sense, I think  the amendment is overkill.   As chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs last  Congress, I saw how incredibly difficult it was to get basic  information and simple briefings from the Trump administration. So I am  sympathetic to getting information from an administration.   The checks and balances put in place by the Constitution require the  executive branch, no matter the party, to be responsive to  congressional oversight. As we saw during the last administration, the  executive branch has become increasingly empowered to not cooperate  with Congress on basic oversight matters; that much is true.   The Foreign Affairs Committee has found statutorily mandated  briefings, however, generally backfire. They give the executive branch  an excuse not to provide basic briefings on important subject matters  on which we do not mandate briefings through legislation.   These topics vastly outnumber those with statutorily required  briefings. By writing mandatory briefings into statute, Congress is  conceding to the executive that it does not need to be responsive to  legislative branch inquiries unless a statute says so.   Although I am opposing this amendment, I think the information is  important. I would also join Representative Crenshaw in a letter  requesting that kind of briefing from the Biden administration this  year and the next and until the next administration.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, again, I agree this is important information. However,  this should not be our approach, except on issues where the executive  branch has continuously, and over a period of time, refused to respond  to basic inquiries.   On climate issues, the Foreign Affairs Committee has not had any  issues obtaining core information that is shared on a bipartisan basis.  In fact, both Secretary of State Blinken and Special Envoy Kerry  addressed this question in their hearings in front of our committee  last year.   Again, I would be willing to work with Representative Crenshaw, and  everybody else who is interested in a bipartisan way, to request this  hearing.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
