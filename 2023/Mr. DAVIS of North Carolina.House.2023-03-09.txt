 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand with  farmers. For decades, farmers across eastern North Carolina have been  left behind.   As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, addressing barriers  to our farmers' growth and success has to be a significant priority for  us.   Our farmers are struggling to break even because input costs for  items like fertilizer and fuel are rising faster than commodity prices.  This imbalance forces farmers to pass unaffordable input costs on to  the consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I know we can ease the financial burden of farmers and  consumers alike by championing rural development initiatives.   Let's allow our farmers to do what they do best: feed America,  because at the end of the day, food security is national security.                            ____________________
