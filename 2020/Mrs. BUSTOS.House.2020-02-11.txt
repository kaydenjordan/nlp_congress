 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we celebrate Black History  Month across our Nation. And I want to recognize the extraordinary  efforts of three African American women from Rockford, Illinois, who  have honorably served three separate branches of our Armed Forces. Our  Nation is indebted to them.   Later this week, the stories of Margaret Patricia Whelcher, Lana  McCants, and Milana Herman will be displayed to the public at the  Veterans Memorial Hall and Museum in Rockford, Illinois.   Their contributions to our country have been chronicled by local  students from Harlem High School as part of the annual Harlem Veterans  Project, and they have conducted interviews, shot videos, and have  photographs and more.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to bring attention to  their sacrifices and thank them for their service today.   Margaret Patricia Whelcher, she served in the United States Air Force  from 1988 to 1991 and achieved the rank of senior airman.   Lana McCants, she served in the United States Navy from 1991 to 1997  and achieved the rank of operation specialist 3rd class.   Milana Herman served in the United States Army from 1989 to 1994 and  achieved the rank of staff sergeant.   In addition to their distinguished military service, these veterans  have worked to better our community. Lana is an active member of the  American Legion Post 340, while Margaret and Milana routinely  participate in local stand-downs, where they offer a variety of support  services for at-risk veterans.   I am proud to see them represent our community with such distinction  and such honor. Their selfless commitment to country and community sets  a strong example for the leaders of tomorrow. It is crucial that their  inspirational stories are spread far and wide.   That is why I applaud the work of those students participating in the  Harlem Veterans Project. These students have sought to build a unique  bond with members of the community and raise the voices of those around  them.   Institutions like the Veterans Memorial Hall and Museum in Rockford,  which will feature these incredible women, tell the stories of so many  who have made an immense impact on the lives of those across our  region. It is only fitting that the stories of Margaret, Lana, and  Milana will be displayed with the rest of them.   We must never forget those who paved the path before us. Stories like  theirs make up the very fabric of our Nation. They should be cherished  and celebrated.                            ____________________
