 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Turner, who is  retiring from his role as Walla Walla County Sheriff. He honorably  served the public in this role for 8 years.   Sheriff Turner dedicated himself to working to make his community  safer. He sought to provide 24/7 patrol coverage, reestablish the K-9  program, address gang activity in the county, and proactively address  other public safety concerns.   He was nominated by his peers across Washington State for the  National Sheriffs' Association Ferris E. Lucas Award for National  Sheriff of the Year and received the National Sheriffs' Association  Medal of Merit for his outstanding positive accomplishments.   In his retirement announcement, Sheriff Turner wrote: ``Being Walla  Walla County Sheriff for the last two terms has been one of the  greatest honors of my life. As I wind down my second term, I ask that  you continue to keep those brave men and women who regularly and  selflessly go into harm's way in your positive thoughts and prayers.''   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Sheriff John  Turner for his tremendous service to the people of Walla Walla County  and Washington State.                            ____________________
