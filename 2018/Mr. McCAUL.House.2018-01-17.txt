 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Cyber  Diplomacy Act, and I want to thank Chairman Royce and Eliot Engel for  their strong work on this very important issue.   As chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I have passed  numerous bills to strengthen our cyber operations to defend the  American people and the homeland. Now, I am pleased to see that we are  doing the same at the State Department.   As we have seen, rapid technological advancements have increased our  dependence on computer networks. With this growing dependence comes  exposure to the myriad vulnerabilities and threats from cybercriminals  and hackers but also nation states who continue to launch malicious  attacks against us.   Currently, as the chairman stated, there are no real international  norms or standards to follow when it comes to cybersecurity. As the  threat landscape continues to evolve, I believe that Congress must put  forth responsible policies to keep pace--protecting our systems, our  critical infrastructure, and American citizens' information and  privacy.   This legislation helps ensure the open, reliable, and secure use of  the internet by establishing the Office of Cyber Issues within the  Department of State, headed by an ambassador responsible for advancing  U.S. national security and foreign policy interests on cybersecurity  and issues of internet freedom around the globe.   This legislation also requires the Secretary of State to produce a  strategy on cyberspace to guide U.S. policy.   Lastly, it requires the State Department to add a section to its  annual report on human rights detailing governments'--such as Iran,  Russia, and China--silence of their opposition through internet  censorship.   Mr. Speaker, I stand proud to be with my colleagues in the House in a  bipartisan fashion to propose solutions to these very grave challenges  that face the United States and the world.                                time  1430
