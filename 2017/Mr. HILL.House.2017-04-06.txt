 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support today of H.R. 1219,  the Supporting America's Innovators Act, introduced by the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the chief deputy whip. I am proud to  have his leadership in promoting capital formation in our country.   Yesterday, as he has noted, marks the fifth anniversary of the JOBS  Act, which has had a positive impact on easing capital formation woes  for small businesses and startups.   I am proud to represent and have the opportunity to work every day  with The Venture Center in Little Rock and its FinTech Accelerator  program, and the innovation hub in North Little Rock and its medical  technology innovation hub. These high-tech innovations, combined with  angel funds, give good-paying job opportunities to people out in the  heartland and not just on the East and West Coasts.   But in order for these innovative startups to grow, they have got to  have access to greater sources of angel capital, and raising capital in  rural America is a challenge.   Having helped design and offer private placements for emerging  companies during my whole career, and participating in angel funds in 2  decades prior to coming to Congress, I know firsthand the importance of  having a multitude of options for our small businesses to raise  capital, no matter what their stage of formation.   This bill builds on the success of the JOBS Act by providing an  update to a limit set in 1940, Mr. Speaker, limiting the number of  accredited investors that can participate in a qualified venture fund.  I am glad we are rushing to a change since 1940. And this simple change  from 100 to 250 really allows more angel investors to participate in  funds of this nature across the country and gives particular advantage  off the East and West Coasts.   I thank the chairman for the time and my good friend from North  Carolina for his leadership. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support this worthy measure.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Quapaw Area  Council, which, for the first time, was recognized by the Boy Scouts of  America's Journey to Excellence program as a Gold Level Council, the  highest award possible.   The Boy Scouts of America's Journey to Excellence program is designed  to encourage excellence and reward success at all levels of scouting,  measuring several indicators that include fiscal management,  fundraising, youth advancement, youth camping, and membership  recruitment.   As a fellow Scout, I am proud of the high standards our Scouts in  Arkansas are setting. This achievement is a credit to the dedication of  members of the council, countless volunteers, devoted parents, and  committed Scouts.   On behalf of all Arkansans, congratulations. We look forward to  following your continued success for generations of Scouts to come.                            ____________________
