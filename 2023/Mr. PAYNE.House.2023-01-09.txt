 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend basketball superstar  LeBron James for calling out sports media bias.   Late last year, a photo resurfaced of Dallas Cowboys' owner Jerry  Jones blocking the integration of an Arkansas high school in 1957. Mr.  James asked why he was not getting any questions about this photo and  stated that the media had plenty of questions after former teammate  Kyrie Irving promoted an anti-Semitic film on social media.   Jerry Jones owns an $8 billion sports franchise, the world's most  valuable one according to Forbes. The Cowboys rank among the worst NFL  teams for minority hiring.   The possible connection between these points is far more important  than the hateful beliefs of one basketball player. Yet, the media asks  about Irving and stays quiet about Jones.   It is a question the media needs to answer for James and the Black  community in America.                            ____________________
