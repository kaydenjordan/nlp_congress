 Madam President, I wish to honor a brave citizen  of Topeka, KS, Tami Rossillon. This brave woman put herself in the face  of danger to rescue not only a drowning dog, but the dog's owner as  well.   In late January, Tami was taking a quick work call in her car near  Lake Shawnee, when she saw a dog going near the edge to grab a drink.  Suddenly, the dog fell through the ice, and shortly after, the owner  dove right in to save her pet. Before Tami even saw the owner go into  the water, she raced over to offer assistance. She initially tried  breaking the ice to get through, but she couldn't puncture enough. With  quick thinking, Tami then grabbed the dog leash from another person  walking their dog nearby and, after a few attempts, was successfully  able to throw the leash to the dog owner and pull her out of the water.   Once everyone was out, Tami's nurse instincts and training were able  to ensure that the owner and dog stayed  [[Page S673]]  warm and not harmed. All the while, Tami's work call was still going on  and what an explanation she had to give to her coworkers.   Brave acts like this truly showcase the best in Kansans. Tami put her  life on the line to save others, showcasing the selfless nature we all  possess. She is a true hero for her actions and makes me proud to be a  Kansan. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing this  noble woman.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to honor the hard  work, determination, and sheer grit of the community of Plains, KS.  Last month, Grand Avenue Market, the first grocery store in Plains in  more than 20 years, opened for business.   For too many across Kansas, food deserts--areas with little access to  fresh produce--are all too commonplace. Last month, thanks to the  decades-long commitment of community members in Meade County,  especially the Community Enhancement Foundation of Plains, the grocery  drought was finally brought to an end. But it wasn't easy.   The project to bring a grocery store to Plains began in 2008, when  the communities of Kismet and Plains raised nearly $500,000 out of the  $2 million required for the initiative. Every day since, amid  turbulence and trial, the greater community and the people of Plains  never gave up.   After receiving a loan from a USDA, the dream of not having to travel  between up to 25 miles to neighboring towns to simply get groceries  began to look more like reality. But hurdles in the form of a bank  unwilling to honor a letter of credit and banks reluctant to supply  another made that dream look rather dim. That is when the community  contacted my office.   Using our knowledge of USDA rural development financing programs, we  reached out to banks in the area to see if they would be willing to  participate in the project to bring fresh produce to Plains. Exploring  community banks that understand the importance in investing in  community infrastructure, one bank in particular began to emerge.   Heartland Tri State Bank in Elkhart simply made this dream of so many  in southwest Kansas possible. I know I speak for all Kansans when I say  thank you. Thank you for your investment. Not merely an investment in a  grocery store, but a much more important investment--an investment in  people and their lives.   It was my sincerest honor to play a small part in helping make Grand  Avenue Market a reality. It is with great pleasure that I recognize  Plains, KS; Heartland Tri State Bank; the Community Enhancement  Foundation of Plains; and the surrounding community for their  diligence, effort, and pure will in bringing an end to the grocery  drought in their parcel of the prairie that we Kansans call  home.                            ____________________
