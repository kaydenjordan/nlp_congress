 Mr. Speaker, this week, my State lost a friend  and a statesman. James V. Hansen, Utah's longest serving Member of this  body, passed away on Wednesday. My condolences go out to his wife, Ann,  as well as the rest of the Hansen family.   During his 22 years of service in the House, Jim became the first  Utahn in history to assume the responsibilities of a full committee  chairman. In 1997, Jim was chosen to be chair of the infamous Ethics  Committee, where former Leader Armey said: ``It is one of the most  extraordinary trusts that a body could put in another person.'' In  2001, Jim was named chairman of the Natural Resources Committee.   He was a trailblazer, not just for Utah, but for me. I followed him  into the State legislature; as Speaker of the House in Utah; as a  Member of this body; also as a chairman of the Western Caucus, which  Jim founded; and, finally, as chairman of the Resources Committee.   I will be forever grateful for the time he took to mentor me in each  and every one of these roles. His impact on my life and many others  cannot be overstated.   As chairman of the Resources Committee, Jim prioritized wise use of  public lands while developing sound energy policies and passing  numerous conservation bills.   As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, he defended Hill  Air Force Base, as well as the importance of U.S. military needs.   Jim accomplished much without ever succumbing to arrogance. He was a  good man, a fine leader, and a cherished man. He will be missed.                            ____________________
