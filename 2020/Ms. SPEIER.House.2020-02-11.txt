 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the Baku pogroms,  which took place in January 1990, some 30 years ago. The Baku pogroms  represented the culmination of years of atrocities by the Azeris  against ethnic Armenians living in Azerbaijani communities, such as  Sumgait and Kirovobad.   Time and time again, Armenians fell victim to their neighbors, as  gangs of Azeris roamed the streets, smashed windows, burned cars, and  attacked any Armenians they found. The gangs murdered and mutilated  some women and repeatedly raped others.   In Baku, the pattern held, as looters destroyed property and tortured  the murdered victims. Thousands of Armenians fled the systemic  violence, world chess champion Gary Kasparov's family counted among  them.   Mr. Speaker, Azerbaijan was engaged in a systemic effort to erase  this history and silence those who repeat it. I rise today so that they  cannot succeed.   The history of this violence is one of the many reasons I believe  that residents of Nagorno-Karabakh or Artsakh should be allowed to live  in peace, freedom, and security. The United States has a crucial role  to play in promoting this outcome.   For decades, U.S. aid has helped clear mines in Artsakh, saving  lives, promoting development, and giving communities a sense of  normalcy. Today, even though the work is not done, that aid is  threatened.   Today, even though Armenia and Artsakh have embraced the Royce-Engel  peace proposal, while Azerbaijan has rejected it, Artsakh could lose  the mining assistance. And today, even though Armenia has transformed  itself into a growing democracy, it is autocratic Azerbaijan that has  received a massive, disproportion increase in military aid from the  United States.   If the administration won't help those who stand for peace and  democracy, Congress must. The legacy of Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovobad  remind me why. We must fight for the memories of those we lost, for  their dreams of safety and security, and for the promise of a free  Artsakh.                            ____________________
