 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Special  Committee on Aging, having adopted rules governing its procedures for  the 118th Congress, have a copy of their rules printed in the Record,  pursuant to XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of the Senate.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         Special Committee on Aging                      Committee Rules--118th Congress                          Jurisdiction and Authority       A.        There is established a Special Committee on Aging       (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``special       committee'') which shall consist of nineteen Members. The       Members and chairman of the special committee shall be       appointed in the same manner and at the same time as the       Members and chairman of a standing committee of the Senate.       After the date on which the majority and minority Members of       the special committee are initially appointed on or affect       the effective date of title I of the Committee System       Reorganization Amendments of 1977, each time a vacancy occurs       in the Membership of the special committee, the number of       Members of the special committee shall be reduced by one       until the number of Members of the special committee consists       of nine Senators.        For the purposes of paragraph 1 of rule XXV; paragraphs 1,       7(a)(1)-(2), 9, and 10(a) of rule XXVI; and paragraphs 1(a)-      (d), and 2(a) and 1(d) of rule XXVII of the Standing Rules of       the Senate; and the purposes of section 202(1) and (j) of the       Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, the special committee       shall be treated as a standing committee of the Senate.      B.        It shall be the duty of the special committee to conduct a       continuing study of any and all matters pertaining to       problems and opportunities of older people, including, but       not limited to, problems and opportunities of maintaining       health, of assuring adequate income, of finding employment,       of engaging in productive and rewarding activity, of securing       proper housing, and when necessary, of obtaining care or       assistance. No proposed legislation shall be referred to such       committee, and such committee shall not have power to report       by bill, or otherwise have legislative jurisdiction.        The special committee shall, from time to time (but not       less than once year), report to the Senate the results of the       study conducted pursuant to paragraph (1), together with such       recommendation as it considers appropriate.      C.        For the purposes of this section, the special committee is       authorized, in its discretion, (A) to make investigations       into any matter within its jurisdiction, (B) to make       expenditures from the contingent fund of the Senate, (C) to       employ personnel, (D) to hold hearings, (E) to sit and act at       any time or place during the sessions, recesses, and       adjourned periods of the Senate, (F) to require, by subpoena       or otherwise, the attendance of witnesses and the production       of correspondence books, papers, and documents, (G) to take       depositions and other testimony, (H) to procure the serve of       individual consultants or organizations thereof (as       authorized by section 202(I) of the Legislative       Reorganization Act of 1946, as amended) and (I) with the       prior consent of the Government department or agency       concerned and the Committee on Rules and Administration, to       use on a reimbursable basis the services of personnel of any       such department or agency.        The chairman of the special committee or any Member thereof       may administer oaths to witnesses.        Subpoenas authorized by the special committee may be issued       over the signature of the chairman, or any Member of the       special committee designated by the chairman, and may be       served by any person designated by the chairman or the Member       signing the subpoena.      D.        All records and papers of the temporary Special Committee       on Aging established by Senate Resolution 33, Eighty-seventh       Congress, are transferred to the special committee.

If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his or       her counsel, or any spectator conducts him or herself in such       a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or       interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing the       Chairman or presiding Member of the Committee present during       such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate,       his representative or any law enforcement official to eject       said person from the hearing room.
