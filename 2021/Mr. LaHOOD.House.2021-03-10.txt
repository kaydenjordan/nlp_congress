 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Democrats  so-called COVID relief bill.   Congress' focus should be specifically dialed in on crushing this  virus, creating jobs, and getting our economy back open.   Unfortunately, this package falls well short.  [[Page H1275]]    As we battled the COVID pandemic over the last year, the economic  stress placed on communities that I represent in central and west- central Illinois has been immense.   Congress acted five times in a bipartisan way over the last year,  creating over $3.7 trillion to help keep businesses and workers afloat  and support the healthcare community, all of which we supported.   As of today, more than $1 trillion of those budgetary resources is  still available, including money for State and local governments, small  businesses, and schools.   Congress can do more to support the economic recovery from COVID, but  our efforts must be targeted.   We cannot spend our way out of this crisis.   In Illinois, we have seen the negative impact of the tax-and-spend  agenda that put our State on the path to economic disaster.   The proposed stimulus plan by the Biden administration will impose  new, burdensome costs, regulations, and rules on small businesses,  making the recovery even more difficult.   It is disheartening that, following calls for unity in his  inauguration, President Biden's first major legislative agenda item was  partisan and specifically designed not to allow Republican input.   Instead of rewarding fiscally irresponsible States with huge  bailouts, Congress should work to incentivize growth, focus on job  creation and vaccine distribution.   To generate a strong economy, we need to get government out of the  way, open our communities, and enable Americans to thrive.
