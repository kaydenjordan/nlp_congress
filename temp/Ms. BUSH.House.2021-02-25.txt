 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today in support of the  Equality Act because all people deserve to live safely and freely.   When we say that Black lives matter, we mean that every Black life  matters; that Black trans lives matter; that Nina Pop's life mattered.   When we protect the lives of our trans family, our unhoused  neighbors, our sex workers, our youth, we build a country where  everyone can thrive, not just survive.   For so many in St. Louis, this bill will be the difference between  life and death. Missouri has not only stalled justice, but actively  denied justice for our LGBTQIA-plus community. This legislation will  mean the difference between having a safe place to call home and being  unhoused because, to date, in the year 2021, that kind of  discrimination still exists.   We rise to tell our LGBTQIA community: Not only do you matter, but  you are loved and you are cared for, and we got your back.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler and Representative Cicilline for  their work on this.
