 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues from  Colorado and Alabama for a very interesting and robust debate, but I  would like to change the subject slightly.                                   Germany    Mr. President, Germany and America are dear friends, and friends tell  each other the truth.   On the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, German  Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that Germany plans to continue supporting  Ukraine ``as strongly and as long [as possible and] as necessary.''   I regret to observe that based on where we are today, that would  certainly be a change of pace. By all measures, Germany's so-called  strong support is more lamb than lion. The numbers don't lie. Germany's  current spending to help Ukraine by share of gross domestic product--if  you compare the spending of one country to another, it is not fair to  use raw numbers because some countries are wealthier than others. So if  you look at the current spending by our friends in Germany to help  Ukraine, by share of gross domestic product, Germany wouldn't even be  in the top 10 nations in terms of financial support for Ukraine. And  those are just the numbers.   Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and the United Kingdom have all  outspent Germany by share of gross domestic product. Our neighbors in  Canada have outspent Germany, too, both in raw dollars and by share of  GDP. And the same is certainly true of the American people. The  American people have spent roughly double--double--what our friends in  Germany have spent in Ukraine, fighting for freedom, by share of  domestic gross product.   With an entire ocean and most of Europe between America and Ukraine,  Americans are wondering why the United States and Canada have dug  deeper to deter Russian aggression than Germany has. That is a fair  question.   Germany, as we all know--and I am very proud of them for this--is the  economic leader of Europe. Germany has the fourth largest economy in  the world. Germany has the fourth largest economy in the world. But the  fact is--friends tell friends the truth--that Germany is failing to  pull its weight in Ukraine. And if we look back on the past year, it is  very clear that Germany's support of Ukraine has been heavy on words  and short on action. And I hate to have to say that.   Somehow, Germany's leadership has lost the urgency it had when Putin  began his march into Ukraine. At that time, if we think back a year,  Germany could not have been in a more vulnerable position. The  Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces, were dilapidated.   At the end of the Cold War, Germany had nearly 500,000 soldiers.  Roughly 3 percent of its spending by GDP was allocated to Germany's  defense. When Putin invaded Ukraine, Germany's military was roughly  one-third of that size, about 183,000 soldiers, and spending on defense  by our friends in Germany had plummeted to 1.3 percent of gross  domestic product.   Its airplanes couldn't fly. Its tanks were unusable. Its bloated  military bureaucracy appeared to be the only thing the German  Government properly maintained.   Were it not for the United States of America, Putin would be in  Paris. But we stepped up, and so did others. God bless them.   It wasn't just Germany's armed forces that were unprepared for  Putin's invasion. Germany's energy grid relied on Russian natural gas,  as we both know, Mr. President. For several decades--this goes back  many years--Germany became increasingly reliant on Russia's energy.  Germany appeared to believe, foolishly--``naively,'' maybe, is a better  word--that its energy trade with Putin would yield friendship. Instead,  it yielded dependency.   In this trade, these weren't some cupcakes that friends were  exchanging as neighbors. What we are talking about here is the very  security and dependability of the fourth largest economy in the history  of the world--or, rather, in the current history of the world--and its  power grid. Germany placed its power grid in Russia's hands, and Putin  knew that. Putin knew that Germany's energy dependency would make it a  lot easier for him to march into Ukraine, not harder. Everybody knew  it.   Now, with winter coming, I want to give our friends in Germany a lot  of credit. Germany did have some urgency in correcting its energy.  Germany built LNG terminals to expand its gas reserves. The United  States sold energy to our friends in Germany. We were happy to do it.   Germany expanded its renewable energy efforts. It still has not  embraced nuclear energy, as I hope it will, but Germany did expand its  renewable energy efforts. It has now as a goal reaching 80 percent  renewable by 2030, and that is good.   But there is just one problem. Even that effort could leave Germany  exposed to reliance on an adversary because, according to a report from  the International Energy Agency, China is on track to be responsible  for 95 percent of the global production of solar panels. China  currently makes up 80 percent of the world's supply. If it is not  careful, Germany may realize the new boss is the same as the old boss.   But that same urgency that our friends in Germany showed to address  the power grid is nowhere to be found on the military front--nowhere.   In the wake of Putin's rapid invasion, Chancellor Scholz made big  promises. He called it a turning point in German history. He said  defense spending is going to increase to 2 percent. He said he was  going to create an extra military fund valued at $107 billion. He said  his military was going to increase by 30,000 women and men by 2025. I  regret that Germany's urgency seems to have disappeared.   Military spending has barely nudged above 1.5 percent, still short of  the 2  [[Page S700]]  percent commitment that Germany made to NATO.   Germany did purchase 35 American F-35 fighter jets. Do you know when  they are going to be ready? 2027.   Experts much smarter than me doubt that Germany will reach its 30,000  promised new troops by the date that it said it would.   The truth is--the cold, hard, unvarnished truth--since the invasion  began, Germany has been slow to provide weapons to Ukraine. Friends  tell friends the truth. Germany only agreed to send its Leopard 2 tanks  after weeks of haggling with President Biden, during which Chancellor  Scholz refused to send the tanks--his own tanks--unless the United  States also committed to sending its M1 Abrams, after all we had done  and will continue to do. Even when offering up so little, the German  Chancellor demanded the United States of America do more.    One year ago, as Putin's invasion commenced, Chancellor Scholz vowed  to ``invest much more in the security of our country'' and ``guarantee  a secure energy supply.''   On the energy front, Putin turned off the gas, and our friends in  Germany, demonstrating extraordinary ingenuity, managed to pivot. But  on the defense front, Germany has failed to show any serious steps to  grow its military. The fourth largest economy in the world has fallen  short in its support for Ukraine.   Promises to recruit more troops, spend more money, and reinvigorate  its Bundeswehr--they are nice, but those are only words. Germany seems  to acknowledge that the barbarians are at the gate. I don't know how it  could be any clearer. So why aren't our friends in Germany willing to  act? I just don't understand it.   In every way--in every way--Putin poses a larger threat to Germany  than he does to the United States. That is saying a lot because Putin  poses a threat to the United States. But he is a much larger threat to  our friends in Germany. Yet the United States of America, the people of  this country, have outspent Germany sevenfold in helping our friends in  Ukraine. It is not right.   Mr. President, you and I both know that what you do--not what you  say, what you do--is what you believe, and everything else is just  cottage cheese.   Talk is cheap, and, in this case, it is literally cheaper than  funding the Bundeswehr. But Germany's natural gas was also cheap, and  that didn't end very well.   If Germany wants to be a leader in Europe--and, gosh, I hope they  do--it needs to lead. That starts with footing the bill for its own  defense--we are willing to share that burden, but the American people  can't do it alone--and it starts with helping Ukraine.   We have wasted a year. It is long past time for our friends in  Germany to step up and meet the defense promises it made when Putin  invaded.   I end as I began: Germany and America are dear, dear friends, and  friends tell friends the truth.   I yield the floor.
