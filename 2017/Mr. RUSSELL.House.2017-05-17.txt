The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect as if included in the Presidential and       Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 (Public Law 113-187).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I present today H.R. 194, the Federal Agency Mail Management Act of  2017. Approximately 2 years ago, President Obama signed into law the  Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014.   The law modernized and improved Federal recordkeeping statutes by  codifying agency responsibilities that have been in practice for  decades. Once the law was enacted, the General Services Administration,  or GSA, identified technical provisions in the law that the agency  interpreted as limiting its ability to regulate Federal agency mailroom  operations.  [[Page H4267]]    The GSA has been responsible for the regulation and oversight of  Federal agency mail management for many years. Congress did not intend  for the 2014 law to change the mail management structure.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 194 provides clarification to ensure that the GSA  is responsible for mailroom management oversight, and not the National  Archives and Records Administration. Both GSA and the National Archives  have worked with Congress to make the correction, and both entities  support H.R. 194.   Mr. Speaker, an identical bill was passed by the House with unanimous  voice vote near the end of last Congress. We hope that this legislation  will be signed into law this Congress to correct the unintended  consequences of a previous law.   This corrective measure has bipartisan support, and I appreciate  having my friend and colleague, Mr. Connolly of Virginia, join me as a  cosponsor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 195) to amend title 44, United States Code, to restrict the  distribution of free printed copies of the Federal Register to Members  of Congress and other officers and employees of the United States, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 195         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Register Printing       Savings Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION OF FREE PRINTED COPIES                     OF FEDERAL REGISTER TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND                     FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.         (a) Restrictions.--Section 1506 of title 44, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``The Administrative Committee'' and       inserting ``(a) Composition; Duties.--The Administrative       Committee'';        (2) in subsection (a)(4), by striking ``the number of       copies'' and inserting ``subject to subsection (b), the       number of copies''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(b) Restrictions on Distribution of Free Printed Copies       to Members of Congress and Officers and Employees of the       United States.--        ``(1) Prohibiting subscription to printed copies without       request.--Under the regulations prescribed to carry out       subsection (a)(4), the Director of the Government Publishing       Office may not provide a printed copy of the Federal Register       without charge to any Member of Congress or any other office       of the United States during a year unless--        ``(A) the Member or office requests a printed copy of a       specific issue of the Federal Register; or        ``(B) during that year or during the previous year, the       Member or office requested a subscription to printed copies       of the Federal Register for that year, as described in       paragraph (2).        ``(2) Administration of subscriptions.--The regulations       prescribed to carry out subsection (a)(4) shall include--        ``(A) provisions regarding notifications to offices of       Members of Congress and other offices of the United States of       the restrictions of paragraph (1);        ``(B) provisions describing the process by which Members       and other offices may request a specific issue of the Federal       Register for purposes of paragraph (1)(A); and        ``(C) provisions describing the process by which Members       and other offices may request a subscription to the Federal       Register for purposes of paragraph (1)(B), except that such       regulations shall limit the period for such a subscription to       not longer than 1 year.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect January 1, 2018.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My bill, H.R. 195, the Federal Register Printing Savings Act of 2017,  will save taxpayers dollars while providing needed reform in how we  conduct day-to-day business in Congress.   The Federal Register contains a large amount of information,  including proposed rules and public notices, regulations, executive  orders, and Presidential documents. This information is compiled by the  National Archives and published daily by the Government Publishing  Office, or the GPO. Often described by the National Archives as ``the  daily newspaper of the Federal Government,'' this service enables  Members, staffs, and agencies to keep track of activity across  government.   In 1994, the GPO began publishing the Federal Register online. To  improve user experience, the digital version has been enhanced over  time to provide navigational aids that include links to related  content.   The Federal Register is now fully searchable and downloadable, making  for quick access to any document. But sadly, Mr. Speaker, despite the  advance of technology, Members of Congress and Federal offices across  the entire government still receive printed copies of the Federal  Register every day.   In the course of a year, this stack of Registers would be 16-feet  high. This results in thousands of copies going directly into the trash  each week, unless occasionally used as doorstops. Subscriptions to the  Federal Register cost about $1,000 annually, meaning hundreds of  thousands of taxpayer dollars are wasted each year. This same money  could pay for the salaries of 50 soldiers who defend our Republic in a  given year.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 195 makes a small but significant change to fix the  problem and ensure that we operate in the 21st century. Instead of  automatically receiving printed copies, Members or offices of the  Federal Government who want to continue to receive copies need only  submit a request. There will be an opt-in, instead of an opt-out.   Current print and on-demand technologies make this possible. The  subscriptions will last for 1 year to ensure Members and offices are  able to evaluate if they want to continue the service. For Members in  offices that do not use or want the printed version, they will not  receive it and will still have full access to the searchable digital  version which most Members use.  [[Page H4268]]    This change will reduce unnecessary printing and, in context, will  prevent 96 Americans from having to work each year so that we can throw  Registers in the trash.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this efficient bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 653) to amend title 5, United States Code, to protect unpaid  interns in the Federal Government from workplace harassment and  discrimination, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 653         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Intern Protection       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITED PERSONNEL PRACTICES.         (a) In General.--Section 2302 of title 5, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(g)(1) All protections afforded to an employee under       subparagraphs (A), (B), and (D) of subsection (b)(1) shall be       afforded, in the same manner and to the same extent, to an       intern and an applicant for internship.        ``(2) For purposes of the application of this subsection, a       reference to an employee shall be considered a reference to       an intern in--        ``(A) section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42       U.S.C. 2000e-16);        ``(B) sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in       Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a); and        ``(C) section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29       U.S.C. 791).        ``(3) In this subsection, the term `intern' means an       individual who performs uncompensated voluntary service in an       agency to earn credit awarded by an educational institution       or to learn a trade or occupation.''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 3111(c)(1) of title 5,       United States Code, is amended by inserting ``section 2302(g)       (relating to prohibited personnel practices),'' before       ``chapter 81''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 653, the Federal Intern  Protection Act of 2017, sponsored by my colleague from the Oversight  Committee, Ranking Member Elijah Cummings of Maryland.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is well served by interns who  provide invaluable assistance to agencies across the Federal  Government. Our interns work alongside us and other Federal employees  helping conduct agency business on behalf of the American people.   Internship programs also help to identify and develop the next  generation of Federal employees. In exchange, interns gain invaluable  work experience in a field that they might hope to enter upon  graduation and credit they can apply at their institution of learning.   Unfortunately, there are no existing provisions in Federal law that  protect interns working at Federal agencies against harassment or  discrimination.   In the case of O'Connor v. Davis, the United States Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit upheld a decision finding an intern could not  bring sexual harassment claims under Federal law.                                time  1530    The court reasoned that since the intern was not a Federal employee,  that person was not covered by existing law. It concluded that: ``It is  for Congress, if it should choose to do so . . . to provide a remedy. .  . .''   Mr. Speaker, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee heard  testimony showing the damage this loophole can have at Federal  agencies. In a 2015 hearing on Environmental Protection Agency  mismanagement, witnesses described allegations of sexual harassment  against interns. According to testimony, ``one former intern stated  that because of this harassment, she changed her mind about not only  about working for EPA but also for working in the Federal sector at  all.''   This is simply unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2017 ensures that  interns working for the Federal Government receive anti-discriminatory  and anti-harassment protections. Specifically, the bill prohibits  discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin,  age, or handicapping condition for interns working at Federal agencies.  These protections are already in place for Federal employees.   I thank my friend and colleague, the ranking member, Mr. Elijah  Cummings, for his leadership and commitment in protecting interns who  work for the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill. I thank Mr. Cummings for  his hard work on this measure. I also thank the committee for their  broad, bipartisan, unanimous support and hard work in bringing this  practical measure. I urge adoption of it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
