 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  the so-called Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. It is outrageous that  today, of all days, 1 week before the 5-year anniversary of the  horrific murder of 20 schoolchildren and 6 educators in my district of  Newtown, 2 months after the slaughter of 50 Americans watching a  concert, that we are about to act on a bill to put more guns in the  hands of more dangerous people.   Rather than helping raise the standards nationally for gun safety,  this bill would override and lower most States' concealed carry laws,  making it easier for domestic violence abusers, stalkers, and violent  criminals to carry across State lines loaded hidden guns. This bill  should be called the ``Act to Carry Any Gun Anywhere Anytime by  Anyone.''   The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is an outrage and an insult to  the families in Newtown and to the hundreds of families who have lost  loved ones to gun violence who are gathered here today at the Capitol  for the fifth annual Vigil to End Gun Violence.   In the 5 years since Sandy Hook, this is the very first bill we have  been allowed to vote on in this Chamber, and it is a reckless giveaway  to the moneyed gun interests.   Mr. Speaker, since 2012, gun violence has killed over 170,000  Americans. It is time for this House to truly honor the victims of gun  violence and their families with action instead of caving in to the gun  lobby yet again.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose this dangerous  bill.
