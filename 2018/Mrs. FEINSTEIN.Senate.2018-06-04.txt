 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor Kate  Kennedy, a pioneering and inspiring San Franciscan.  [[Page S2965]]    Kate Kennedy was born in County Meath, Ireland, in 1827, the second  of seven children. After her father's death in 1841, she cared for her  five younger sisters, even overseeing their education at home. During  Ireland's Great Famine, Kate immigrated to the United States. She  worked as a seamstress in New York Before moving with the rest of her  family to California in 1856.   Shortly after arriving in California, she began teaching in San  Francisco's public schools. She rose to become the principal of the  North Cosmopolitan Grammar School, but was only paid the salary of a  primary school principal because she was a woman. In response to this  injustice, she began a campaign for equal pay all school teachers. Her  efforts were rewarded in 1874, when the California Legislature passed a  law requiring female public school teachers paid the same as male  counterparts.   Following her landmark victory, Kate continued to teach while  advocating for other social issues like labor and tax reforms. She  eventually ran for state superintendent of public instruction, becoming  the first woman to run for Statewide office in California.   Although she didn't win, she continued to leave a mark on her adopted  State. After being transferred for political reasons to a smaller  school with a lower salary, Kate fought the demotion and was ultimately  fired in retaliation by the schoolboard. She sued the board, taking her  case all the way to the California Supreme Court. The court sided with  Kate, delivering an opinion that still serves today as the foundation  of teacher tenure in California.   Shortly after the court's ruling, Kate Kennedy passed away in  Oakland, CA, and was buried in San Francisco's Laurel Hill Cemetery in  1890.   Kate Kennedy's commitment to justice and willingness to fight for her  rights is truly inspirational. As the first woman to represent  California in the U.S. Senate, I am proud to honor her legacy and the  historic role she played in the ongoing struggle for equality.                            ____________________
