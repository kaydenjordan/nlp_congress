 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the birthday and  the life of Nora Mae Pierce Gaulden, born August 27, 1930, in Rock  Hill, South Carolina.   Nora Mae originally grew up in Cullowhee, North Carolina, in part of  what is known as the Nantahala National Forest.   She would grow up on a rural farm during the Depression and  experience all the hardships associated with that era. ``If you didn't  farm, you didn't eat,'' she would say, and the family would often  barter and trade for their needs as they navigated life.   Around the time of her 18th birthday, times began to change, and the  family heard about a large company that would be hiring to fill shift  work and laborers for a large facility being built down at the  Piedmont. That company would be known as Celanese, and it was this turn  of events in her life that brought her to her present hometown of Rock  Hill, South Carolina.   The family would uproot and set out across the mountain to see what  this new place could bring.   As a new employee, employee number 47, Nora was tasked with learning  the job and then training others to fill shifts. She remembers sleeping  on a bench while others worked and trained during these times,  sometimes staying all night while work was ramping up.   She would work there for 21 years, marry, grow a family, and  eventually set on a direction leading her to today.   Celanese was going to place her on shift work, so she decided to take  a package instead and went to the unemployment office. There, she ran  into Woodrow Byrum. ``He told me not to even sign the papers, and come  with him. I didn't even get to draw my first check.'' He needed someone  to do food for the workers, so of course she went straight to work.   That path led her to M. Lowenstein Corporation's Rock Hill Printing  and Finishing plant located in downtown Rock Hill.   She would begin working there in 1959 and would stay on through the  many changes, from the height of the textile boom to its slow demise  within the Carolinas.   Many role changes and job requirements would come and go. The Rock  Hill Printing and Finishing Company would eventually be sold to Springs  Industries, and she would see even more changes in her life up until  her expected retirement in 1993.   However, one large change was looming on the horizon. That retirement  would be postponed due to the loss of her husband, Rufus, who suffered  an unfortunate drowning accident 6 months before their retirement.  Several friends and family close to her advised her to continue  working, so that is exactly what she decided to do.   ``I told Rufus to build me a porch, so we could sit and rock and look  out once we both retired.'' She would go on to say, ``He never got to  enjoy that.''   She stayed on with Springs continuing to do the things she had done  all of her life: love work, love family, love God, and never treat any  one person better than another. That is her defining legacy.   ``God made all people,'' she would say, ``and He didn't make one  better than the other,'' with her trademark finger pointing and one eye  closed.   Years would come and go. Time marched on, and part of Springs  Industries-Springs Creative would be born out of that time in 2007.  Many things changed during those days, but Nora Mae did not. ``I just  stayed with the building.''   She has continued to work with Springs and each year mulls over  retirement. ``Maybe this summer,'' has been repeated over the last  several years, ``maybe not.'' She keeps working hard, calls everyone  her children, stays true to God, never changes, and reaches a milestone  88th birthday this year.   For 70 years, she has been a part of the Rock Hill community, sharing  herself with her love to everyone she meets and making this world a  better place than when she found it. She would say, ``God doesn't  change. Why should I?''   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to say what a great life this lady has  lived. She is a great American, and she represents all that is good  with this great country.                            ____________________
