 Madam President, the Senator is now considering S. 914,  the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021. This  legislation was reported unanimously last month by the Committee on  Environment and Public Works on a vote of 20 to 0.   I rise today to join Senator Capito to urge our colleagues to join us  in voting for the adoption of this legislation. The legislation will  help upgrade our Nation's drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure--investments that are sorely needed.   So that our colleagues understand the real need for drinking water  and wastewater investments, let me just begin today by sharing a bit of  my own personal history on these issues and invite our colleagues to  maybe recall a bit of their own history.   My sister Sheila and I were born in Beckley, WV, a coal mining town  in the southern part of the State. For 2 of the 6 years that our family  resided in the Mountain State, we lived outside of Beckley, a coal  mining town, and we lived alongside a stream known as Beaver Creek. We  lived outside of Beckley by a couple of miles.   Sometimes, my sister and I, along with other kids in our tiny  community, would play on the banks of Beaver Creek, chasing frogs,  trying to catch the small fish that swam there. We were never allowed  to eat fish caught in Beaver Creek, though, and our neighbors didn't  eat them either. Why? Because we were told in no uncertain terms by our  parents that it wasn't safe to eat those fish.   In time, we learned some of the reasons why it wasn't safe. Some of  the septic tanks that nearby residents relied upon were not well  maintained, and as a result, raw sewage and other pollution would  sometimes end up seeping into Beaver Creek.   My sister Sheila and I would go on to grow up in Danville, VA,  located right along the border with North Carolina. Danville, VA, had  once been the last capital of the Confederacy. By the time we got  there, it had become the home of Dan River Cotton Mills, as well as the  world's biggest tobacco market. Even our radio station was WBTM,  World's Biggest Tobacco Market. We lived in what I suppose was a  middle-class neighborhood just outside of town, and we drank water from  a well in our own backyard that was located less than 100 feet from our  septic tank.   My senior year in high school, I was fortunate enough to win a Navy  ROTC scholarship and attended Ohio State University. There, in  Columbus, OH, we drank water provided by the city of Columbus, which  also treated the sewage of the city's close to half a million  inhabitants.   Several years after graduating from Ohio State in 1968 and while  deployed to Southeast Asia as a naval flight officer fighting during  the Vietnam war, I would learn that the Cuyahoga River, which flowed  through Cleveland, OH, had actually caught on fire. I dubbed it ``the  fire heard around the world.'' It served as a wake-up call to our  Nation to get serious and begin addressing the air and water pollution  that were all too prevalent in much of our country.   Spurred by this wake-up call, our President at the time, Richard  Nixon, by Executive order and affirmed by the Congress, created the  Environmental Protection Agency in 1970.   Inspired in part by the burning Cuyahoga River and outrage at the  indiscriminate dumping of pollution into rivers, streams, and wetlands  around this country, Congress enacted the Clean Water Act in 1972 over  the veto of then-President Richard Nixon.   The goals of the Clean Water Act are at the same time simple and  profound. These are the words: to ``restore and maintain the chemical,  physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.''  [[Page S2316]]    Let me repeat this: to ``restore and maintain the chemical, physical,  and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.''   In the Clean Water Act, Congress ambitiously declared that the waters  of the United States would be fishable and swimmable by 1983 and that  there would be no more pollution discharged into our waters by 1985.    Two years later, in 1974, then-President Gerald Ford signed the Safe  Drinking Water Act into law.   In the years that followed, cities and communities across our country  applied to EPA for grant funding to help build new drinking water  systems and improve existing ones. Similarly, with the help of EPA  grants, communities across America built or upgraded wastewater  treatment systems to clean up the wastewater being discharged into  rivers and streams.   Over time, grant requests greatly exceeded the funding available  through EPA grants. During the Reagan administration, a controversial  new approach was proposed--the creation of revolving loan funds  administered and managed by each State. After considerable debate and  compromise, this proposal was enacted into law. I was serving in the  House of Representatives at the time and ended up supporting that  proposal. Thus, the concept of State revolving funds was born in 1987.  The Clean Water Program was an alternative financing mechanism for the  construction of wastewater facilities. Congress extended the same  revolving loan fund concept to Federal drinking water programs in 1996.   Federal funds seeded revolving funds in all 50 States and in Puerto  Rico and provided support for projects in the other territories and in  the District of Columbia, right here. This Federal support leveraged  State and local funding, along with revenues generated by utilities.   In the years immediately following the creation of these funds,  Congress periodically modified them to meet the changing needs in  cities and communities across our country and inspire the use of new  technologies.   In more recent years, however, the programs languished, and the  authorizations for the State revolving funds were in dire need of  updating.   In 2018, for the first time in 22 years--22 years--Congress  reauthorized the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. It did so for 3  years. The Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund, used for wastewater  and other vital needs, has not been reauthorized in nearly--get this-- 35 years, and now the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund is set to  expire at the end of this year.   Somebody should do something, and that somebody is us. Needless to  say, we have fallen woefully short of Congress's lofty ambitions to  create fishable and swimmable waters by 1983 and to eliminate the  discharge of pollution in navigable waters by 1985. It is also clear  that the system we have now, despite our best efforts, isn't enough to  meet the needs of our communities, particularly those who cannot afford  to participate in loan programs to upgrade increasingly inadequate  drinking water and wastewater facilities.   For far too many families in this Nation, access to safe, clean  drinking water and a healthy environment is, frankly, a dream, just a  dream, and a lot of folks, too many folks, face a real crisis.   All too often, we see headlines telling of the poor state of water  infrastructure in our country and its lack of resilience in the face of  severe weather. Not that long ago in Texas, earlier this year, nearly  15 million people--15 million people--lost access to clean water when  plummeting temperatures broke water mains and brought power down at  drinking water facilities across that State. In Jackson, MS, that same  harsh weather caused over 80 water main breaks and left tens of  thousands of people without water, particularly in predominantly  African-American neighborhoods.   But, as we all know, this goes well beyond a few isolated cases. The  problem of water in our Nation runs much deeper. Millions of Americans  still lack consistent access to clean drinking water today.   The American Society of Civil Engineers' 2021 report this year  reported that America's infrastructure--they give out grades: A, B, C,  D, E, F. They gave our water systems a grade of C-minus.   I don't know about my colleagues, but I never got much of a pat on  the back when I brought home a C-minus on my report card, and neither  did my sister. C-minus is not satisfactory in my family or, I think,  for our country.   That same report early this year also revealed that there is a water  main break every 2 minutes--every 2 minutes--in the United States and  that 6 billion gallons of treated, drinkable water are lost each day to  leaks and crumbling water supply systems. That begs the question: How  much is 6 billion gallons, anyway? Well, it is enough lost water to  fill 9,000 swimming pools. Let me repeat that. It is enough water to  fill 9,000 swimming pools--not each year, not each month, not each  week--every day. Some communities report losing a quarter or even half  of their drinking water to leaking pipes.    In my own State of Delaware, where Senator Coons and I come from,  communities like Ellendale, DE, in the southern part of our State,  struggled for years to find and afford safe alternatives for  increasingly polluted drinking water wells. Ellendale is not alone.  Thousands in communities of color and Tribal communities, rural  communities, and others struggle, not only with access to clean water  and wastewater treatment, but also with the capacity to afford the  infrastructure necessary to provide and meet those services.   Let me emphasize: Clean water is an essential part of our healthy  lives, healthy economics, and a healthy environment. But for those  communities who simply cannot afford to pay back loans for needed water  infrastructure, we have to find a better way.   I think by working across the aisle and working hard, our committee-- the Environment and Public Works Committee--is suggesting that by way  of this legislation before us today.   I am pleased to report that these are the challenges that we have  sought to address head-on with this legislation. This bipartisan  legislation that we consider today authorizes more than $35 billion for  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure programs at the  Environmental Protection Agency over the next 5 years. These programs  will create jobs and make our communities healthier by building, by  repairing, by upgrading, and by modernizing our Nation's aging drinking  water and wastewater infrastructure systems.   Here is how.   First, the measure takes the historic step of reauthorizing the Clean  Water State Revolving Fund for the first time in 35 years--35 years.  And it does so by increased funding levels for the first time since  1987. This legislation also reauthorizes the Drinking Water State  Revolving Fund, a program whose authorization expires, I mentioned  earlier, at the end of this year. This fund helps to ensure that clean  water flows whenever we turn on our faucet--that clean water comes out  of it.   Next, this bill makes sure we are helping our fellow Americans most  in need--the least of these, the most in need--by boosting funding for  programs that fund projects in low-income areas, rural communities and  Tribal lands, and communities of color that have historically been left  behind by investments in our water infrastructure. According to a  recent analysis, water systems with multiyear Safe Drinking Water Act  violations are 40 percent more likely to be in places with higher  proportions of people of color. Drinking water quality violations are  by far the most frequent in low-income rural communities, where local  governments struggle to finance the most basic water infrastructure  needs.   To help resolve this historic injustice, more than 40 percent of this  bill's investments are targeted to help disadvantaged communities. Our  bill authorizes more than a billion in new funding to reduce lead in  drinking water. And particularly for our country's rural areas, Tribal  populations and low-income neighborhoods, our bill invests another  billion into programs to connect households to drinking water and  wastewater systems and services.   Wide disparities in opportunity and investment are also present in  Tribal communities. Our legislation grows the Tribal Drinking Water  Program by 20 percent and reforms programs to help  [[Page S2317]]  Tribal education agencies remove lead from their drinking water  systems, too.   This legislation does far more than just fix what is broken. To  borrow a phrase from our President, Joe Biden, this legislation  actually does ``build back better'' by fortifying water infrastructure  for new and worsening climate realities.   I will be honest with you, Madam President and colleagues. In this  country, ours is a future that promises more severe weather events like  hurricanes, like floods, droughts, and bitterly cold weather. It is a  future, like it or not, with more and more people living on the  frontlines of sea level rise, like my home State of Delaware, the  lowest lying State in our Nation.   To that end, the bill provides a combined $500 million to make our  water infrastructure systems more resilient and adaptable in the face  of extreme weather events. Within that historic investment is a new  $125 million program which will, for the first time, provide grants to  communities seeking to fortify their wastewater systems against climate  change's impact.   Finally, with our eyes focused on the future, our bill expands  government's role in researching and developing the water technologies  for tomorrow, by investing in technologies to improve, for example,  storm water control and waste management. By doing so, we can help  American companies export innovation while not exporting jobs, rather  by creating them right here. This is not just a bill to spend and build  on but legislation that would direct our Agencies to build and spend  more wisely. We know that investment in innovation, as envisioned in  the bill before us, can have a profound positive impact on our economy,  creating jobs and fostering growth for our entire Nation. We can, in  short, seize the opportunity in the face of so much adversity. As we  say in Delaware, ``Carpe diem. Seize the day.'' Actually, we say:  ``Carper diem. Seize the day.''   There is an old African proverb that comes to mind that goes  something like this: If you want to go fast, travel alone. If you want  to go far, travel together. On this bill, I can proudly say Senator  Capito and our colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee  have chosen to travel together. The Drinking Water and Wastewater  Infrastructure Act of 2021 passed out of the Environment and Public  Works Committee with a resounding vote of 20 to 0.    And from outside the Halls of Congress, this bill has earned praise  from across the political spectrum, from big cities to small  communities. A group of government officials that includes the U.S.  Conference of Mayors wrote that this measure will ``help address the  many water infrastructure challenges that communities face. Local  leaders support the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act as  a reliable, long-term and increased federal investment in water  infrastructure.''   Representing our less-populated areas of the country, there are  places like Raleigh County in West Virginia. Raleigh County is where I  was born, where my sister and I were born. Senator Capito knows it  well. Senator Manchin knows it well. His wife is from there.  Representing places like Sussex County in southern Delaware, the Rural  Community Assistance Partnership says this about our legislation:  ``Proud to support this bill because Americans deserve clean, safe,  reliable, and affordable drinking water, regardless of the community's  size or zip code.'' I could not agree more.   We know that access to safe, reliable and healthful water isn't a  blue State or red State issue. It is an issue that goes to the core of  the promise afforded to every American in Thomas Jefferson's  Declaration of Independence--largely penned by Thomas Jefferson--with  these words: a promise of ``Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of  Happiness.'' If we would be honest with ourselves, none of us can  expect to pursue, much less enjoy, this American ideal if we don't have  access to clean water to drink, because without water we have no life.   The need for action on this issue is clear. To that end, I have been  grateful to the partnership of our ranking member, Senator Capito. I am  proud this measure is the very first piece of infrastructure  legislation, I believe, to be reported out of a Senate committee in  this the 117th Congress. The Environmental and Public Works Committee  has a long tradition, as some know, for working across the aisle to get  significant legislation over the finish line. This bill is the latest  example of the kind of work that we do.   I would like to say we are work horses, not show horses.   This is the first one that Senator Capito and I have been able to  work on together, and I am grateful for all that she and her staff have  done to help get us here to this day. I oftentimes say that bipartisan  solutions are lasting solutions. Think about that: Bipartisan solutions  are lasting solutions. That is how I think we should approach almost  all of our work here in the Senate--by reaching out to our colleagues  across the aisle, where we can, creating lasting solutions to problems  and challenges facing our Nation. This bill before us today is a  product of that kind of partnership.   The legislation is the result of tireless, dedicated work by the  ranking member, Senator Capito, by her staff, and by my own. I want to  thank them and every member of our committee for all their outstanding,  bipartisan work and for all their contributions to helping us craft  this legislation over the last several months.   I especially want to note on my staff: John Kane, sitting behind me;  Margaret McIntosh, known as ``Mackie''; Tyler Hofmann-Reardon; and our  fearless staff director, Mary Frances Repko. And I want to thank  another member of our team, who used to be a part of our EPW team and  is now leaving our staff. This is her last day--Ashley Morgan. We want  to thank her for all her help in the last couple of years. I also want  to thank Adam Tomlinson for his leadership with Ranking Member Capito  and her EPW team, including Jess Kramer and Travis Cone. We thank them  all very, very much.   Finally, a big shout out to our Water Subcommittee chair, Senator  Duckworth, for taking the lead to introduce this excellent measure,  along with Senator Cardin and EPW subcommittee ranking members, Senator  Lummis of Wyoming and Senator Cramer. It has been a pleasure to work  with each of you and your staffs. I would go so far as to say that it  was a labor of love.   With this bill's level of support, it is my hope that we can seize  this momentum and pass this measure quickly this week. I urge all my  colleagues to join Senator Capito and me in supporting this excellent  bill.   Before I yield the floor, I want to reflect on last night and the  address that was brought to us by our President from Delaware, Joe  Biden, a long-time friend and colleague. I was encouraged by his  remarks. He is not a very partisan person, and I think he reached out a  hand of friendship to the other side of the aisle, in both the House  and the Senate, to try to work together.   I am a retired Navy captain, a Vietnam veteran, and a big believer in  leadership by example. In our committee, the Environmental and Public  Works Committee, Democrats and Republicans--Senator Capito and, before  that, John Barrasso; before that, Barbara Boxer and, gosh, Jim Inhofe,  as chairs of our committee--we have sought to provide bipartisan  leadership and show by example, and we are trying to do that again here  today.   My hope is that, God willing, about a month from now, we will bring  another bill up for a vote for debate in our committee on surface  transportation, roads, highways, and bridges, and maybe continue to set  a good example for this body and for the administration and the House,  too.   With that in mind, I am looking for Senator Capito. I don't see her  on the floor, but I do see the whip, my friend Senator Thune. I think  maybe I should yield to him.   I should tell you guys that Senator Thune and I, almost every  Thursday, are joined with the Chaplain of the U.S. Senate, Barry Black,  a retired admiral who is Chaplain of the Senate now. He is good enough  to host a Bible study in his office space. We usually end up sitting  there. It is one of my favorite parts of the week.   Almost every week he reminds us of Matthew 25. Senator Thune knows  the Bible better than most pastors. It is true. Senate Chaplain Barry  Black will oftentimes remind us of Matthew 25. It starts like this:  ``When I was thirsty, you would give me to drink.''  [[Page S2318]]    We have, I think, a moral imperative to act on this legislation, to  make it better, and to be able to hammer out a compromise with the  House and the administration. There is a moral imperative to pass  legislation of this nature.   There is also a fiscal imperative. I spoke about filling up how many  thousands of swimming pools from one water leakage a day.   There is a health imperative here in the middle of the worst health  crisis in 200 years.   There is an economic imperative, as well. It is hard to foster  economic growth and development in communities where wastewater is not  treated and there is drinking water you can't drink. Who wants to set  up a business and go into business in places like that?   There are a lot of reasons we need to embrace this legislation, make  it better if we can, and send it off to the House and get it to  conference.   We have been joined by a new Presiding Officer. He has just joined us  straight from New Jersey. For many years, he, Senator Booker, has  joined us in our Bible study. He, Senator Duckworth, and I formed a  caucus that is designed to make sure we don't overlook the least of  these, and I salute him for his leadership and good work in that  regard.   With that, I see Senator Capito here. I am not sure if I should yield  to the whip, Senator Thune, or yield to her.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, my neighbor, I want to take a few minutes  this morning--additional minutes this morning to discuss the water  issues facing rural America, and the Presiding Officer comes from the  Garden State, and a lot of people who have heard Senator Coons and me  talk about our State think of us as the poultry State. We think, for  about every person who lives in Delaware, we have got about 300  chickens. We raise a lot of the corn and soybeans to feed those  chickens. So almost every State is a rural State in one way or the  other.   But the issues facing rural America often do not get the same level  of attention or assistance with drinking water and wastewater programs  that larger, more urban or suburban areas receive.   As our Committee on Environment and Public Works was drafting the  Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021, the  legislation before us today, many of us focused on the need to invest  in small, rural, and disadvantaged communities because they often--to  be honest with you, often get left behind.   These communities are overlooked or overburdened when it comes to  addressing the drinking water and wastewater needs of their residents  too often.  [[Page S2319]]    Most of our country's drinking water and wastewater utilities are  small. Approximately, 80 percent of the country's almost 17,000  wastewater utilities serve a population of fewer than 10,000 people.  More than 90 percent of the country's 43,000 community water systems  serve a population of fewer than 10,000 people.   Small and rural communities have more difficulty affording public  water service. These communities lack the population density needed to  financially support a public drinking water system, and if they have  managed to build a system, they often lack the people to properly staff  it.   In fact--I was shocked to hear this, but 43 percent of small water  systems are operated and staffed by one person, by one single person.  Forty-three percent of small water systems are operated and staffed by  one person.   These rural towns' and villages' drinking systems face the same  challenges as large systems, larger systems, in making sure that water  is safe, making sure the water is clean, making sure that the water is  reliable.   Complicating matters, these communities have to do it with far fewer  resources, in many instances.   I want to share just a couple of examples of challenges facing these  communities just from my own home State, and I am sure every Member of  this body can provide examples in their own States.   For example, there is a town called Selbyville. It is right on the  Delaware-Maryland line, not too far from Rehoboth Beach and Dewey and  Bethany Beaches. But Selbyville is currently operating without a fully  licensed water treatment operator due to the death of a longtime  operator who passed away after a long battle with cancer. The only  other licensed operator for the town is currently out on disability,  and the remaining two operators are not fully licensed.   Through the Technical Assistance Program that this bill would  reauthorize, the town has been able to obtain the required training to  prepare the two partially licensed operators for the State licensing  exam.   This program has helped to train these individuals in areas like  disinfection control, filtration, provide the onsite technical  assistance for leak detection and hydrant maintenance.   Another example, the Pepper Ridge Mobile Park in Frankford, DE--not  too far away--suffered many years of waterline breakage, low water  pressure, no hydrants, valves, levers, and inadequate distribution  lines.   The Delaware Rural Water Association, through our State revolving  fund, was able to obtain funds to do a full water line upgrade.   And incidentally, we will also reauthorize this program at an  increased level of funding.   This legislation before us today specifically helps rural and  smalltown America by reauthorizing critical programs like the ones I  just mentioned in my own State and by adjusting the cost share for  these communities to make these infrastructure upgrades more affordable  to ratepayers.   Passing this legislation will be an important step toward addressing  the overwhelming infrastructure needs of 43,000 water systems in rural  communities, many of which have one person operating that system.   According to the most recent EPA drinking water infrastructure  assessment, rural drinking water needs are currently estimated at $74  billion over the next 20 years, including $3.3 billion just for Indian  Country.   To help rural communities, this bill expands drinking water technical  assistance opportunities for rural communities by authorizing more than  $75 million in technical assistance grants.   We have been joined on the floor by the prime author of this  legislation, the Senator from Illinois, and I am just going to stop  where I am in my discourse on rural American water needs of a lot of  our rural communities and to yield the floor, unless Senator Capito-- no. Senator Duckworth.   I just want to thank Senator Duckworth for being the prime sponsor of  this legislation, for allowing the rest of us--we have a big racetrack,  Dover Downs NASCAR track, we use the term ``drafting,'' when one car  gets really close behind the other and kind of holds on, but we want to  thank Senator Duckworth for allowing the rest of us to draft on her  legislation that she and Senator Lummis from Wyoming have introduced,  and we are grateful for her leadership   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object, I cannot agree to this  unanimous consent request because this is the exact reason why we don't  amend complicated formulas on the floor with limited oversight.   This bill was hotlined last night, I think, with the current language  from Senator Rubio, and now he would like to change it here literally  at the last moment. With all due respect, I just cannot agree to that.   I said to him in a conversation on the floor that I think he knows me  well enough that I am willing to work with him and others who would  like to see some modifications in this formula going forward. This is  not the end of the trail. We will have a conference with the House. We  will have negotiations with the White House.   I just want to say to Senator Rubio that I look forward to working  with him and Senator Capito to consider the changes that he is  proposing but not to do it at the last minute here on the floor. I am  unable to do that.   I reluctantly object, but I am going to have to do that. I object    Mr. President, our committee has worked on this  legislation all year. We have had hearings. We have had meetings,  discussions at the staff level and Member level to try to come to an  agreement on all kinds of provisions to the bill, and we are prepared  to do more of that once this legislation is adopted.   But we reported this bill unanimously because it will benefit  citizens across our Nation, better ensuring that, no matter where they  live, they will have access to clean and safe water.  [[Page S2321]]    Our bill ensures that every State, territory, and Tribe will receive  more funding to make critical investments in clean water projects. But  by proposing a formula that only takes population growth into account-- only takes population growth into account--Senator Rubio and Senator  Scott's amendment will ensure that many States, including rural States,  territories, and Indian Tribes, will lose water infrastructure funding,  in some cases as much as 80 percent.   We cannot afford to take money away from these governments when their  needs are so great, especially in communities that have historically  been underfunded and underserved. That is why more than 50 different  organizations, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the League of  Conservation Voters and a whole lot of others in between, oppose this  amendment.   As a result, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a  list of those organizations--a growing list of those organizations.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                Organization         AFL-CIO,        Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie,        Alliance for the Great Lakes,        American Council of Engineering Companies,        American Littoral Society,        American Rivers,        American Sustainable Business Council,        Anthropocene Alliance,        Associated General Contractors of America,        Black Women's Health Imperative,        Cahaba River Society,        Clean Water Action,        Clean Water Action Minnesota,        Ducks Unlimited,        Earthjustice,        Endangered Habitats League,        Environment America,        Environmental Defense Fund,        Environmental Law & Policy Center,        For Love of Water (FLOW),        Grasslands Water District,        Great Egg Harbor Watershed Association,        GreenLatinos,        Healthy Gulf,        Holy Spirit Missionary Sisters, USA-JPIC,        Hydraulic Institute,        Ilinois Council of Trout Unlimited,        International Union of Operating Engineers,        International Union of Operating Engineers (Also in WIN       Joint Letter),        Laborers' International Union of North America,        Leadership Team, U.S. Province of the School Sisters of St.       Francisisters of St. Francis United,        League of Conservation Voters,        Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewer District,        Milwaukee Riverkeeper,        National Association of Clean Water Agencies,        National Association of Counties,        National Association of Regional Councils,        National Coalition for Legislation on Affordable Water       (NCLA-WATER),        National Conference of State Legislatures,        National Electrical Contractors Association,        National Latino Farmers & Ranchers Trade Association,        National League of Cities,        National Parks Conservation Association,        National Wildlife Federation,        Natural Resources Defense Council,        Natural Resources Defense Council (Also in LCV Joint       Letter),        North America's Building Trades Union,        Ohio Environmental Council,        Onondaga Audubon,        Religious Coalition for the Great Lakes,        Rural Water,        Sierra Club,        Southern Environmental Law Center,        Surfrider Foundation,        United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters,        United States Chamber of Commerce,        United States Conference of Mayors,        United Steelworkers,        Vinyl Institute,        Water Infrastructure Network,        Water Systems Council,        Waterkeeper Alliance.     I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Capito in  voting no on this amendment--again, looking forward to subsequently  working with Senators Rubio and Scott to see if we can come to a  consensus on these changes.    I yield time.    Mr. President, the Shaheen-Collins amendment makes  changes to the State Response to Contaminants Program. Specifically,  the amendment expands the provisions for the State Response to  Contaminants Program from covering just underserved communities to also  small and disadvantaged communities, to allow communities that are  financially unstable, which cannot afford to address contaminants, or  small, which means less than 10,000 people in population, to qualify  for grants to address contaminants in the drinking water.   This is a good amendment, and we thank the sponsor and also join here  in cosponsoring. I urge a ``yes'' vote and a voice vote.    Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Kennedy's  amendment because we need to know more about boil orders, something  that I, frankly, hadn't heard a lot about. I thank the Senator for  bringing it to our attention.   We are in support of this amendment. These are frequently used, and  transparency is needed on them.   I yield to the gentlewoman from West Virginia.    Mr. President, I don't want to trivialize this important  moment, but I am tempted to say: I am Tom Carper, and I approve this  message. But I won't say that, but I certainly do approve this message.   So pretty remarkable. We have three Members of our body who were born  in West Virginia, and one is the daughter of a former Governor of our  State and maybe the mother of a future Governor of our State. We will  have to wait and see.   We have another former Governor of West Virginia who serves here with  us and whose wife Gayle actually was in the same high school graduating  class with my first cousin Dan Patton. It is really kind of incestuous.  But people ask why we get along so well, and I am reminded of the words  of Joe Biden. He and I rode the train together a lot of years to  Delaware and back when I joined him in the Senate and in the House  before that. Joe likes to say--the President likes to say that all  politics is personal. He says that all diplomacy is personal as well.  And I think you see a little bit of that at work here, and it is just a  good reminder for all of us.   Before we vote here in a couple minutes, I just want to express once  again my support for the legislation before us, the Drinking Water and  Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021.   I am a firm believer that actions do speak louder than words, so  before we move to a vote, let me close by saluting the unanimous action  taken by the Committee on Environment and Public Works on this bill.   Every member of the committee, all of us, every one of us, had a hand  in crafting the legislation with the help of our staff--half of us  Democrats, half of us Republicans.   First of all, the committee members worked together to formulate  legislation that would reauthorize critical financing mechanisms for  drinking water and wastewater infrastructure across our country.   In bipartisan negotiations, we addressed the fundamental needs of the  communities that have been left behind by our past efforts to address  clean water, and we have--or at least we sought to try to ensure with  this bill that rural and disadvantaged and Tribal communities will have  the needed resources they need to access the same safe water that the  rest of us really take for granted most of the time.   After all those efforts involving members on both sides of our  committee dais and many of our colleagues throughout this body, we  reported this much needed legislation to the full Senate by unanimous  vote, 20 to 0. That is right, 20 to 0. The bill we hope to take up  today passed out of our committee unanimously. In fact, the Republicans  like this bipartisan bill so much that they included it in their  infrastructure proposal, and President Biden supports this legislation  as a good first step forward. He reminded us of that last night in his  address.   We just don't see this kind of bipartisanship often enough, and I  think--I talked earlier about how we are leaders. We have a  responsibility to lead by example. That is what I was trained to do in  the Navy and a lot of us as well--lead by example. We are trying to do  that here today.   That remarkable consensus is why this bill is so worthy of our  support. The benefit that it provides will reach all corners of our  Nation. This legislation will be a boon not just to our towns and not  just to our cities but also to our rural communities. It will help  ensure the healthy environment necessary for our collective happiness,  vitality, and long-term success, no matter where we live. You know what  it says in the Declaration of Independence. Life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness. This is part of that. Without water, we just  don't have any of those things.   Not only does the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of  2021 provide the resources we need to build, the resources we need to  upgrade, the resources we need to expand critical infrastructure, but  it also ensures that we make a substantial investment in projects that  will withstand the increasingly harsh weather events--be they storms,  be they floods, freezing cold snaps, droughts--that have plagued places  like Texas and Mississippi in recent weeks and months.   As all my colleagues in this body are aware, the ravages of changing  climate in the form of devastating weather could hit any of our  communities at any time and in many cases already have.   There is a good reason why groups like the U.S. Conference of Mayors  on the one hand, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the other hand, and  the National Wildlife Federation support this legislation.   I mentioned earlier on the floor the American Society of Civil  Engineers, which gave our water systems a D--I think a D-minus average  grade on the 2021 report card on the state of our Nation's  infrastructure. This is what they say about this bill after giving us I  think a D-minus average grade on our Nation's infrastructure. Here is  what they said about this legislation. Senator Capito, here is what  they said:       . . . critical if we are to improve our nation's aging water       systems and ensure that they continue to provide and protect       public health, welfare, and safety.    There is plenty in it to inspire the Rural Community Assistance  Partnership to say the organization is ``proud to support this bill  because Americans deserve clean, safe, reliable, and affordable  drinking water, regardless of their community's size or zip code.''  Colleagues, I couldn't agree more.   This measure reauthorizes and increases funding for the bedrock  Federal water and wastewater infrastructure financing problems--the  drinking water and clean water State revolving funds. In the case of  the Clean Water Fund, this is the first reauthorization of the Clean  Water Fund in 35 years--35 years.   Local government leaders, policy experts, and advocates from all  parts of our country and all political stripes also support our bill  because it would invest $500 billion to ensure water infrastructure  systems are more resilient in the face of extreme weather events.   These leaders are urging us to pass this legislation because it  expands the government's role in researching and developing the water  technologies of tomorrow, opening the door to economic opportunity and  jobs across this country.   Finally, millions of Americans--too many Americans, millions of  them--cannot trust the water when they turn on their taps. Most of us  turned on our tap water this morning either at our homes or our  bathrooms or wherever and maybe in our offices and we drank the water  and we didn't think anything of it. We knew it was fine and it was  safe. Too many people in this country--millions of them, in fact--don't  have that benefit.   I think we have a moral responsibility to help make sure that  everyone in our Nation--it doesn't matter what their ZIP Code is. It  doesn't matter their race. It doesn't matter what their income is. We  have a moral obligation to make sure they have access to clean, safe  water.   The Golden Rule--treat other people the way we want to be treated-- very much is part of this and guides, I think, all of us.   With this legislation, we can move forward on that effort and, in  doing so, create jobs, foster innovation, and protect our public health  all at once.   I am proud of our bill. I am proud of all the work that has gone into  it and proud of the bipartisan process to produce it with our  colleagues that led us here. I hope our colleagues agree that it is  worthy of the same bipartisan support on the Senate floor as it  received in committee.   Nothing is perfect. What do they say in the Constitution? What did  the Framers say? In order to form a more perfect Union? Well, I have  never been part of writing or co-writing a perfect bill. This was not  perfect, and there are obviously some changes that--we can make it  better--some changes that we  [[Page S2327]]  will discuss with our colleagues on the committee, off the committee,  and with our friends in the House and the administration. But this is a  good start. This is a very good start. And we look forward to the next  step in this process, and I would ask everyone to please join us in  voting yes.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
