 Mr. Speaker, I stand tonight to offer my support for the  National School Choice Week.   Our public education system is in dire need of reform. School  administrators seem to prioritize indoctrinating students with critical  race theory and other leftwing ideology, not even actually teaching  them reading, writing, or math.   As a result, our students' scores in these subjects are far below  other nations in the past. Schools are clearly failing to prepare our  children for success. Instead, they are hiding their agenda from  parents who have a right to know.   Parents have the right to know and they only want the best for their  children. They want to put them in better schools and they want to have  the choice to do so. National School Choice Week gives parents the  option and flexibility to place their children in an institution that  best fits the child's needs and their values.   It is a simple, popular solution to fix our failing public education  system. School choice will incentivize public schools to compete for  each student by offering a quality education that will improve their  prospects for future success.   If the public education system doesn't work for students, it is time  to reform it so that it does.                            ____________________
