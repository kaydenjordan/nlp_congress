 Mr. Speaker, last night, we learned a Montanan died to  COVID-19, the first in our State. Our hearts are heavy back home.   Mr. Speaker, Montanans are concerned. They are concerned about the  health of their families and communities. They are concerned about the  fallout from this outbreak. They are concerned they may have to shutter  their businesses and lay off their workers. They are concerned they may  not have a job tomorrow or see their next paycheck.   We are addressing many of these concerns today in the CARES Act. It  helps families and workers so they can pay their bills and put food on  the table, provides loans and grants to small businesses so they can  keep their doors open. It boosts funding to support those on the front  lines, from hospitals to healthcare providers to CDC and the VA  clinics.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for the CARES Act and  provide emergency relief to the American people facing this crisis.
