 Madam President, as the Republican leader rightly  acknowledged a few moments ago, Joe Biden will be the next President of  the United States, and our colleague Kamala Harris will be the next  Vice President of the United States. Leader McConnell's Republican  Senators ought to follow suit. They ought to acknowledge that Joe Biden  will be the next President and that Kamala Harris will be the next Vice  President.   For the sake of the country, President Trump should take his cue from  Leader McConnell that it is time to end his term with a modicum of  grace and dignity--qualities that his predecessors took great pains to  display during our grand tradition of a peaceful transfer of power.   Enough is enough. Our Republican colleagues, for the sake of our  democracy and for the sake of the peaceful transition of power, should  stop the shenanigans, stop the misrepresentations, and acknowledge that  Joe Biden will be our next President. Enough is enough. Republican  Senators and Republicans throughout the country should follow Leader  McConnell's lead and acknowledge now that Joe Biden will be the next  President of the United States.
