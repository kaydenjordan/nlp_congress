 Madam Speaker, Saturday, March 23, we celebrated the  ninth anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which has  expanded health insurance to over 20 million people in the last 5  years. But quality health insurance remains unaffordable and out of  reach for far too many Americans.   Today, I introduced the Health Care Affordability Act to help fix  that and reduce premiums for Americans who purchase private health  plans through the marketplace.   My legislation would cut premiums by hundreds or thousands of dollars  per year for more than 10 million people. It does this by increasing  the tax credits people get to make premiums more affordable and  allowing more people to qualify for tax credits.   This important improvement would guarantee middle-class consumers  would pay no more than 8\1/2\ percent of their income on premiums. This  would be a huge help to families.   For example, in my district, a typical family of four currently pays  $1,741 per month for marketplace coverage. With my bill, their monthly  premiums would drop by nearly half.   A typical 60-year-old couple in my district making $80,000 currently  pays over a third of their monthly income for marketplace coverage. My  legislation would reduce their monthly premiums by over $1,700.   This legislation moves us forward by making lower cost coverage  available to at least 9 million uninsured Americans, while reducing  premiums for an additional 10 million Americans.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in making quality  health insurance more affordable by cosponsoring this important  legislation.                            ____________________
