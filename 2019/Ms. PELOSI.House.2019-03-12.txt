 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a dedicated and  deeply respected member of my staff, my departing chief of staff, Danny  Weiss.   For nearly three decades, Danny has brought wise counsel and  energetic leadership to the House of Representatives. He has committed  nearly his entire career to this institution, inspired by his great  respect for its history and empowered by his bold vision for its  future.   Danny, the Congress and the country are stronger for the innovation,  ingenuity, and insight that you have brought to this body.   Danny served in the office of my dear friend, Congressman George  Miller--Mr. Chairman--for more than 25 years, including decades as his  chief of staff.   In every position he has held in the Congress, Danny has been vital  in advancing a serious, substantive, and successful agenda to improve  the lives of hardworking families across America.   He has worked to expand opportunity, fighting for affordable quality  healthcare, childcare, and education, and for healthier communities to  his work on the: House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and  Families; House Natural Resources Committee, and House Education and  Labor Committee.   Danny has worked to expand justice by defending the rights and well- being of children, a mission he continued at the helm of Common Sense  Media; and he has worked to expand progress to safeguard clean air,  clean water, and preserve the beauty of God's creation. And we are  grateful for his leadership to elevate and amplify the issue of the  climate crisis.   We are grateful that Danny agreed to return to the Congress at a  pivotal moment for America. His efforts were vital to our Caucus'  strength and unity, as Democrats developed our For the People agenda  and won a historic midterm victory. My office is grateful for his  masterful work orchestrating the transition in the Speaker's office.   Danny's service has entailed sacrifice, not only from him, but from  his entire family. We are grateful for the patience, love, and support  from his wife, Anne, and his daughters, Catherine and Maria.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in thanking my  distinguished chief of staff, Danny Weiss.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio),  the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois  (Mrs. Bustos), the former co-chair of the Democratic Policy and  Communications Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott) to close for us, the chairman of the  Education and Labor Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank our colleagues, Chairman DeFazio,  Chairman Scott, and Chairwoman Bustos for their kind words.   Again, I want to express thanks and gratitude for the patience, love,  and support of Danny's wife, Anne, and their daughters, Catherine and  Maria.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues once again to please join me in  thanking my distinguished chief of staff, Danny Weiss.                            ____________________
