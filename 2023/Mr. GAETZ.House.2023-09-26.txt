 Madam Speaker, the gentleman is right, you are your  record, and our record in this country right now is $33 trillion in  debt, facing $2 trillion annual deficits. We are in so much debt, we  are driving up deficits so fast, we are devaluing American money so  rapidly that in America today, you can't even bribe Democratic Senators  with cash alone. You need to bring gold bars to get the job done just  so that the bribes hold value.   My friends, I am extremely in favor of this rule because this rule  moves us onto single-subject spending bills, and this is the only way  to liberate this House and this country from the scourge of governing  by continuing resolution and omnibus legislation.   It is an insult to our governing authority to have the Senate lash  Ukraine funding to the reauthorization of the FAA, and, by the way,  every other thing in government. The American people know that in our  State legislatures throughout this land there is a maturity and a  seriousness to set a top line, balanced budget number and then  appropriate to each of the agencies in government independently. The  fact that we don't do that is not a bug of the system. It is a feature  of the system.   The one thing I agree with my Democratic colleagues on is for the  last 8 months, this House has been poorly led. We own that, and we have  to do something about it. My Democratic colleagues will have an  opportunity to do something about that, too, and we will see if they  bail out our failed Speaker.
