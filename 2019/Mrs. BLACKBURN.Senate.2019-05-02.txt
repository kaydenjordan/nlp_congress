 Mr. President, I just have to say a couple of words  about the economy. Since my colleague from Ohio was speaking of the  economy, I will say this: Showing respect for workers and for work  means that you show respect by realizing that the best way to stimulate  the economy is with a job. That is something we have seen this  administration and, I will say, a Republican-led Senate, and,  previously, a Republican-led House do--generate tax reform, which is  giving us economic growth that we have not seen in years. Economic  growth of 3.2 percent is what our GDP numbers were last Friday--3.2  percent. We haven't had that in a decade.   How do you respect people? You create opportunity. How do you show  respect for workers? You open doors. That is what you realize. It is  not the government that creates jobs. It is the men and women who build  businesses, who grow businesses--the men and women who say: I have an  American dream, and I want the opportunity to make that dream come  true.   That is an element of respect, and this President and Republican  leadership have delivered on that with every single opportunity we have  had.   I disagree with the philosophical approach that my colleague from  Ohio has expressed, and I would encourage all Senators to look at what  is happening in their communities and look at the jobs growth.  Tennesseans are so excited that there is a growing economy and that  they have more money in their paychecks at the end of the month.
