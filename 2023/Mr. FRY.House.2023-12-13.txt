 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 918.   This year, House Republicans have conducted a methodical  investigation into the alleged actions of the Biden family, including  Joe Biden himself, in his family's foreign business dealings and  foreign-peddling schemes.   As a member of both the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, I  can say that our investigation has peeled back layer upon layer of  Biden family scandals and has exposed the safety nets designed to  insulate the Biden family and Joe Biden from impending accountability.   There is an old legal saying, Mr. Speaker, that if you don't have the  facts, you argue the law. If you don't have the law, you argue the  facts, and if you have neither, you pound the table.   What we are seeing from the other side today is that they want to  talk about Donald Trump and January 6. They want to talk about a  perceived lack of transparency, about how nothing is happening out in  the open.   Well, let me assure you that we have done this for months. We have  done more in 10 months than law enforcement agencies have done in 5  years.   Let's talk about the facts: $25 million has flowed to members of the  Biden family; 20 corporate entities and 9 members of the Biden family  have received these moneys; a $40,000 direct payment to Joe Biden  himself; a $200,000 direct payment to Joe Biden himself, allegedly  under a loan. We have WhatsApp messages, pseudonyms, fake email  addresses, and 22 meetings in which Joe Biden himself met with Hunter  Biden and his business associates.   We have been stonewalled. We have even seen this today, as Hunter  Biden paraded onto the Senate side and did not come to a lawfully  issued subpoena deposition in front of the House Oversight Committee.   Now is the time for an impeachment inquiry.
