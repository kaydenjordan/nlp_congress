 Madam Speaker, life begins at conception. I believe it is  our responsibility to protect the millions of unborn children whose  voices go unheard.   As a Christian and a father of three, I believe the lives of all  children, including the unborn, are just as important as yours or mine.  That is why I stand here today in support of H.R. 7. This bill  safeguards the lives of unborn children who are robbed of their  opportunity to experience the marvels of life.   H.R. 7 closes loopholes that have permitted the subsidization of  abortions by taxpayers who are morally opposed to the practice.  Additionally, this bill also requires insurance providers who receive  Federal subsidies through participation in the healthcare exchanges to  report to consumers whether or not they will be subject to a surcharge  that covers abortion services at the time of purchase.   It boggles the mind that our Federal Government had the arrogance to  skirt longstanding laws in order to trick the American taxpayer into  unknowingly contributing to abortions in the first place.   This bill has passed the House numerous times. The merits of the bill  are clear. I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of H.R. 7.
