 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to see us take up the HEROES Act today.  From State aid to essential pay, this is a step toward making sure  every American makes it through this crisis.   But I want to draw attention to something equally pressing. On both  sides of the aisle, this pandemic has allowed us to agree that there is  a floor below which we don't want any family to fall.   The truth is that, before COVID-19, countless Americans were just a  personal or local or national disaster away from not paying rent, not  buying groceries, or worse. COVID-19 is just one more crisis derailing  their lives, particularly those of Brown and Black communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill.
