 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our transgender  troops.   The United States is stronger and safer when our military reflects  our Nation's diversity. This administration's transgender ban makes a  mockery of that commitment. And let's be clear: This is a ban.   We must not ask transgender servicemembers to go back in the closet  or tell them: You are less than other Americans.   I wholeheartedly support every single American who wants to serve our  country. My father was a 30-year career marine, and he would never  judge another marine on anything other than their ability to complete  their mission. Why should there be another standard?   Trans servicemembers meet the same standards as every servicemember,  and this was confirmed during a subcommittee hearing when trans troops  testified as witnesses. These transgender troops were highly decorated  and earned recognition on the basis of the quality of their work.   As all military personnel do, transgender troops deserve our respect.  I challenge anyone who favors this kind of discrimination to look at  their transgender constituents and tell them they are not fit to serve.   I thank my colleagues for taking a stand for all of our  servicemembers today.                            ____________________
