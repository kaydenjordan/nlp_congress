Sensitive elements of the F-35A are also included       in operational flight and maintenance trainers. Sensitive and       classified elements of the F-35A CTOL aircraft include       hardware, accessories, components, and associated software       for the following major subsystems:        a. The Pratt & Whitney F135 engine is a single 40,000-lb       thrust class engine designed for the F-35 and assures highly       reliable, affordable performance. The engine is designed to       be utilized in all F-35 variants, providing unmatched       commonality and supportability throughout the worldwide base       of F-35 users.        b. The AN/APG-81 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA)       is a high processing power and high transmission power       electronic array capable of detecting air and ground targets       from a greater distance than mechanically scanned array       radars. It also contains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR),       which creates high-resolution ground maps and provides both       weather data to the pilot and air and ground tracks to the       mission system, the latter of which is used as a component to       fuse sensor data by the mission system.        c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System (EOTS) provides       long-range detection and tracking, as well as an infrared       search and track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared (FLIR)       capability for precision tracking, weapons delivery, and bomb       damage assessment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple separate       internal or podded systems typically found on legacy       aircraft.        d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS)       provides the pilot with full spherical coverage for air-to-      air and air-to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision       enhancements, a fire control capability and precision       tracking of wingmen and friendly aircraft. The EODAS provides       data directly to the pilot's helmet as well as the mission       system.        e. The F-35 Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a       reprogrammable, integrated system that provides radar warning       and electronic support measures (ESM) along with a fully       integrated countermeasures (CM) system. The EW system is the       primary subsystem used to enhance situational awareness,       targeting support, and self-defense through the search,       intercept, and location and identification of in-band       emitters and to automatically counter infrared (IR) and       radio frequency (RF) threats.        f. The F-35 Command, Control, Communications, Computers and       Intelligence/Communications, Navigation, and Identification       (C41/CNI) system provides the pilot with unmatched       connectivity to flight members, coalition forces, and the       battlefield. lt is an integrated subsystem designed to       provide a broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and data       communications, precision radio navigation and landing       capability, self-identification, beyond visual range target       identification, and connectivity to off-board sources of       information. It also includes an inertial navigation and       global positioning system (GPS) for precise location       information. The functionality is tightly integrated within       the mission system to enhance efficiency.        g. The F-35 C41/CNI system includes two data links: the       Multi-Function Advanced Data Link (MADL) and Link-16. The       MADL is designed specifically for the F-35 and allows for       stealthy communications between F-35s. Link-16 is an advanced       command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I)       system incorporating jam-resistant, digital communication       links for exchange of near real-time tactical information,       including both data and voice, among air, ground, and sea       elements. It provides the warfighter key theater functions       such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons       engagement coordination, and direction for all services and       allied forces. Link-16 equipment allows the F-35 to       communicate with legacy aircraft using widely-distributed J-      series message protocols.        h. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Global Sustainment (ALGS)       provides a fully integrated logistics management solution.

The ALGS infrastructure employs a       state-of-the-art information system that provides real-time,       decision-worthy information for sustainment decisions by       flight line personnel. Prognostic health monitoring       technology is integrated with the air system and is crucial       to predictive maintenance of vital components.        i. The F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS)       provides an intelligent information infrastructure that binds       all the key concepts of ALGS into an effective support       system. ALIS establishes the appropriate interfaces among the       F-35, the warfighter, the training system, government       information technology (11) systems, and supporting       commercial enterprise systems. Additionally, ALIS provides a       comprehensive tool for data collection and analysis, decision       support, and action tracking.        j. The F-35 Training System includes several training       devices to provide integrated training for pilots and       maintainers. The pilot training devices include a Full       Mission Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission Rehearsal       Trainer (DMRT). The maintenance training devices include an       Aircraft Systems Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection System       Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer Mold Line (OML) Lab,       Flexible Linear Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, Fl35 Engine       Module Trainer, and Weapons Loading Trainer (WLT). The F-35       Training System can be integrated, where both pilots and       maintainers learn in the same Integrated Training Center       (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and maintainers can train in       separate facilities (Pilot Training Center and Maintenance       Training Center).        k. Other subsystems, features, and capabilities include the       F-35's low observable air frame, Integrated Core Processor       (ICP) Central Computer, Helmet Mounted Display System (HMDS),       Pilot Life Support System (LSS), Off-Board Mission Support       (OMS) System, and publications and maintenance manuals. The       HMDS provides a fully sunlight readable biocular display       presentation of aircraft information projected onto the       pilot's helmet visor. The use of a night vision camera       integrated into the helmet eliminates the need for separate       Night Vision Goggles. The Pilot LSS provides a measure of       pilot chemical, biological, and radiological protection       through use of an On-Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS).       OBOGS takes the Power and Thermal Management System (PTMS)       air and enriches it by removing gases (mainly nitrogen) by       adsorption, thereby increasing the concentration of oxygen in       the product gas and supplying breathable air to the pilot. An       escape system provides additional protection to the pilot.       The OMS provides a mission planning, mission briefing, and a       maintenance, intelligence, and tactical debriefing platform       for the F-35.        2.
