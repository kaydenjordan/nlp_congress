 Mr. President, today, with a heavy heart, I  wish to pay tribute to Sergeant Rambo N557, a medically retired  military working dog--MWD--who dedicated his life to the Marine Corps  and raising awareness for his fellow retired working dogs. Sadly,  Sergeant Rambo passed away earlier this month. He will be remembered  for his loving spirit and lifetime of service.   Sergeant Rambo served as an explosive detection MWD based out of MCCS  Cherry Point, NC, from January 6, 2011, to April 11, 2012. Throughout  his Active Duty, Sergeant Rambo completed 620 stateside searches, two  official stateside missions, and about 1,000 hours of training.  Unfortunately, a left shoulder injury prevented him from deploying.  Nonetheless, he served valiantly alongside his handler, protecting  their base and the community until retirement.   Connecticut native Lisa Phillips, who served in the U.S. Army as a  veterinary technician, adopted Sergeant Rambo after his retirement.  Despite needing an amputation because of his earlier injury, he  remained committed to serving his Nation.   Well loved by people of all ages and capacities, Sergeant Rambo  visited summer youth groups and local nursing homes, connecting with  and bringing hope to children with special needs and elderly people  suffering from dementia. His joyful and empathetic personality allowed  him to bond with people across the Nation.   Sergeant Rambo also used his experiences to highlight animal welfare,  military, and veteran issues. He became the mascot for Alamo Honor  Flight, accompanying World War II veterans to Washington, DC, and for  Gizmo's Gift, a nonprofit that supports people who have adopted retired  working dogs by offering free medical care and other necessary  financial support. He and Lisa attended press events with me, helping  gain backing for the Canine Members of the Armed Forces Act, which  sought to improve care for MWDs once their Active Duty ends by  streamlining the adoption process and establishing a national non- profit to cover the veterinary costs associated with retired working  dogs. Several provisions of that act have become law.   In 2015, the American Humane Association named Sergeant Rambo the  Military Dog of the Year. He and Lisa used this platform to give a TEDx  Talk the next year about MWDs and Gizmo's Gift. Then, in March 2017,  they testified before the Connecticut General Assembly about a bill to  establish K-9 Veterans Day in our State.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Lisa during  this difficult time. We know without a doubt that Sergeant Rambo's  legacy will leave a positive impact on the lives he touched and causes  he championed for years to come.                            ____________________
