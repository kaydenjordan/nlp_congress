 Madam President, when we look back at the many  failures of the Biden administration, what I believe is going to stand  out is really their commitment to doing things that sound good to other  Washington Democrats but really are not serving we the people well. In  fact, after spending another weekend working with local leaders back in  Tennessee, I will take it one step further and say that all Joe Biden  and the Democrats have managed to do is find new ways to frighten we,  the people.   Yes, indeed, they are afraid of what this administration is going to  do next because everything the White House has done over the past 18  months seems to make their lives worse each and every day. And the  thing that is so interesting, as I talk to Tennesseans, this is  something where there is bipartisan agreement, whether it is crime in  the streets or the drug situation--much of that caused by this open  border that is out of control--inflation, the price at the pump, the  price at the grocery store. It is quite a stunning record on how to  make the lives of the American people worse.   Joe Biden and the Democrats have spent us into 9.1 percent inflation,  and now, they want to tax us into a recession. The latest scheme is  terrifying. Democrats are proposing a trillion dollars in new tax  increases. This includes a crippling new tax on small businesses as  well as a tax increase on low- and middle-income Americans, which, if  you recall, is something that President Biden said he would never do.   The Democrats are prepared to push the economy off a cliff on behalf  of a radical and radically unpopular agenda that the American people  have repeatedly said they did not vote for and they do not want.  According to recent polling by the New York Times, 77 percent of  Americans believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction,  and only 33 percent of Americans approve of the way Joe Biden is doing  his job. If that is not an indictment of this latest inflationary  spending spree, I do not know what is.   The American people understand that one man and one party are in full  control of the Federal Government and that Joe Biden and the Democrats  are responsible for the uncertainty and fear that is now driving their  decisions. Thank God Tennessee has strong, smart local and State  leaders who take their jobs seriously, who work hard every day to  represent the people of our great State.   I am about to wrap up my annual 95-county tour, and I can tell you  that none of the county mayors and city managers that I have spoken to  are worried about methane or proper pronoun usage. They just want to  know  [[Page S3327]]  what we plan to do about inflation, energy costs, supply chains, crime,  drugs, and the open border.   Jackson Mayor Scott Conger recently described for me the nightmare  that is planning for the future of a midsize city in Joe Biden's  America. Healthcare costs for police and firefighters are up half a  million dollars. Between public works and public safety, fuel costs  alone are projected to beat last year's total by $450,000. And utility  and sanitation costs are already 10 percent over budget.   Now, Jackson and other cities in Tennessee don't operate like  Washington. They are very conservative with how they spend the  taxpayers' money, and they budget for the worst-case scenario. But even  when they do have money to spend, Joe Biden's supply chain crisis gets  in the way.   In Jackson, delays on new orders of police cars, trucks, construction  supplies have put growth on hold. They even have had to delay and scale  back plans for a new homeless shelter. City officials in Dayton told me  that the cost of a foot of pipe has gone up $10 in a year, from $4 to  $14 a foot. I would ask my Democratic colleagues how they expect local  government to handle a 200-percent increase in something as basic as  pipe. We know that is a trick question because there is no planning for  instances like that. Covington Mayor Justin Hanson also had a message  he wanted me to pass on for the record. Here is what he said:         The rising cost of goods and services is really hitting       municipal pocketbooks, especially at the gas pump. The rapid       inflation combined with supply chain issues are really       hurting cities like Covington. Parts, chemicals, fleet       vehicles . . . the list goes on. Some items ordered over a       year ago still aren't in our inventory.    But I think the most shocking example of how localities have suffered  under these reckless policies is happening right now in McNairy County.  Now, McNairy County is a rural county, and it has fewer than 30,000  people. But the county still had to pad their budget by $700,000 to  cover fuel for the sheriff and other county-owned vehicles. That is  almost a million dollars just to keep the police on patrol and the  potholes filled.   We used to have such bright prospects. When Joe Biden and the  Democrats took power, the economy was recovering. We were energy  independent. And there was a plan to protect our supply chains. Now,  instead of planning for the future, local leaders are working overtime  just to keep their budgets from imploding.   Just a few short years ago, these same Tennessee leaders were focused  on innovation and growth. Now, they are focused on survival. They know  that the only way we will pull this country back on track is to halt  inflationary spending, prioritize supply chains, and ramp up an  Operation Warp Speed for energy independence.   But Joe Biden has taken us backwards. So, yes, the people are fearful  of what this administration will do next. But they continue to say they  will not be frightened into submission.   I would urge my Democratic colleagues to remember that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
