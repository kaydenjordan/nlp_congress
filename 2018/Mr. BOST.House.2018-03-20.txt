 Mr. Speaker, today I proudly honor the Belleville West  basketball team for winning the 2018 4A State tournament.   It was truly a ``March Madness'' in Peoria, Illinois, this weekend as  the Maroons played in a back-and-forth State title game against Whitney  Young Dolphins. It took overtime, but Belleville West held off Whitney  Young for a 60 to 56 victory to take home the championship trophy. This  is the first basketball State title in school history.   I extend a heartfelt congratulations to the players, coaches, staff,  school officials, families, and friends who supported these young men  on this incredible journey. Illinois 12th is proud of you.   Go, Maroons.                            ____________________
