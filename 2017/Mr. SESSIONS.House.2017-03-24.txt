The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Womack). The gentleman from Texas is  recognized for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.                                time  0915     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and the  underlying legislation.   This rule is a fair rule that adequately provides both sides of the  aisle with ample time to debate the merits of the underlying  legislation. In fact, the Rules Committee thought it was so important  that ample time be provided to this debate, that we are provided 4  hours of general debate on the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, in honor of our former President, Ronald Reagan, I wear  brown today. The former President, when he was President, believed that  wearing brown was good luck to him and good luck for the things which  he was undertaking. So, in honor of Ronald Reagan, I, too, wear my  brown jacket today.   Mr. Speaker, it has become abundantly clear that ObamaCare has failed  the American people. Our Nation's healthcare system today is broken and  only getting worse under the current law, known as the Affordable Care  Act, or ObamaCare.   Simply put, ObamaCare is collapsing, and it is collapsing fast.  Options and choices are disappearing for consumers, and an  anticompetitive marketplace has been created that firmly harms  patients.   How bad is it? Nearly one-third of all U.S. counties currently have  only one insurer offering plans on their State's exchanges. That is a  government-created monopoly, Mr. Speaker, and that kills the free  market, meaning no choices for the American people and higher costs are  what the American consumer and the healthcare market are finding.   And it is only continuing to get worse. As more and more insurers  leave the marketplace, prices will continue to rise, forcing healthy  individuals to make economic decisions not to purchase health care,  creating a self-defeating spiral of rising costs and less options. That  is why we must act, and act today, which is what we are doing.   It is no wonder that in such a government-controlled system that  premiums have increased by an average of 25 percent on the ObamaCare  exchanges this year alone. And it is no wonder that some 19.2 million  taxpayers chose to outright pay the individual mandate penalty or  claimed an exemption. What this means is that ObamaCare is not a good  option to these 19.2 million people.   Mr. Speaker, the American people, I believe, sent us to Washington,  D.C., to fix this issue. They are telling us directly: this must be  fixed now. And people certainly outside of Washington resent the  Federal Government telling them how to purchase health care and what  that healthcare marketplace would look like. But we really do not have  to tolerate this. We do not have to agree that we will accept the  status quo.   Mr. Speaker, I believe the American people are smart. I believe the  American people want independence, they love freedom, and they want to  know that they can make their own choices, because they believe they  make better choices than a one-size-fits-all plan out of Washington,  D.C.   What brings us here today, however, most assuredly, is a broken  system. So, Republicans offer today H.R. 1628, the American Health Care  Act of 2017, which will eliminate Washington's one-size-fits-all  healthcare policy for the American people. It dismantles the disastrous  ObamaCare taxes that are strangling the working middle class and  diminishing America's economic prowess. We will end this with the  opportunity to vote today to change the status quo.   It eliminates the onerous employer and individual mandates. It  prohibits health insurers from denying coverage and helps young adults  access health care by getting back into the marketplace while  stabilizing and restoring the free market opportunities for all  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, the American people are counting on Washington getting  it right this time. What does getting it right mean? Getting it right  means giving them the opportunity to exit a bad system and to have a  better chance at a new system.   This rule provides House Republicans with the opportunity to restore  exactly that--a better healthcare plan to provide the middle class and  low-income families who have been left behind on either side of the  aisle, and it gives them an opportunity to have tax advantages in the  employer marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, today, we will be dissecting this into three separate  areas. We will have Members of the Republican majority here to explain  that and the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Sessions), my friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the majority is rushing to congratulate itself for  finally having a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. For 7 years,  Republicans had nothing to actually replace the law with, but that  didn't stop them from making one empty political promise after another.   And after all that, what do we have in front of us today? This bill  will take away health care from 24 million hardworking Americans. It  forces families to pay higher premiums and deductibles, increasing out- of-pocket costs. It is a crushing age tax, forcing Americans age 50 to  64 to pay premiums five times higher than what others pay for health  coverage, no matter how healthy they are. Not to mention the $880  billion cut to Medicaid or the fact that it steals from Medicare,  shortening the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years and  ransacking funds that seniors depend on to get the long-term care they  need.   I don't see anything there to be excited about. But then again, I  come from the old-fashioned school of thought that we should actually  take care of our fellow citizens as they grow older, rather than  tossing them off the ship without a life preserver.   It is no wonder that after developing such an ill-conceived and far- reaching bill on the fly, the majority has had to try and jam this  legislation through our Chamber.    First, they rushed this bill through the committee process without  holding a single hearing, and without the benefit of a nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office score outlining its costs and impacts.   Then the majority came out of a back room somewhere and filed four  managers' amendments in the dark of  [[Page H2376]]  night to try to appease the conservative and moderate holdouts,  including the infamous Buffalo bribe. The Republican leadership has  been trying to strong-arm their conference into voting for this bill  all week, and nobody knows how today's vote will go. The only thing we  do know is that this is a terrible bill that is only getting worse, not  better.   This thing has been a mess from beginning to end. Now, I know our  President prides himself on his negotiating skills, but this seems more  like the art of no deal to me, no matter what the final vote tally  looks like.   That brings us to this early morning, when we met at 7 a.m. in the  Rules Committee to report out this rule, which rewrites the bill to  make it far worse.   Last night, we were presented with a provision, concocted in some  back room, that boggles the mind with its cynicism. So what is this  mysterious grand bargain that will appease the Republican Conference  and finally buy Speaker Ryan enough votes to pass this disaster of a  bill? Well, Mr. Speaker, it is so cartoonishly malicious that I can  picture someone twirling their mustache as they drafted it in their  secret Capitol lair last night.   Republicans are killing the requirements that insurance plans cover  essential health benefits--essential health benefits. Now, perhaps you  are wondering: What are these so-called essential benefits? Well, I  will give you a partial list: emergency room trips, maternity care,  mental health care and substance abuse treatment, and prescription  drugs. These are the types of exotic, extravagant benefits that  Republicans apparently don't think are important for working Americans  to be able to afford.   It would be literally unbelievable if we weren't here considering it  right now, Mr. Speaker. Now, I have been awake since before dawn-- thanks to our Rules Committee meeting--so I know that this isn't a  nightmare. We are actually voting on a bill with a backroom deal, made  in the dark of night, that would take away any guarantee that plans  would cover these basic essential benefits.   And, of course, we have no idea what the costs will be or how many  people it will affect. We can't know those things until we get an  analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which,  obviously, we will not have before we vote on this reckless  legislation.   And that is the real problem. Because every time you come out of a  back room, this bill gets worse. For the sake of our country, maybe we  should consider putting locks on the back rooms you huddle in.   President Trump keeps talking about crowd size. My colleagues across  the aisle keep talking about page size. This morning, in the Rules  Committee, Republicans kept saying that the fifth manager's amendment  is only 4 pages long. How bad could it be?   Well, they need to stop worrying about size and pay more attention to  how this bill will affect regular, working Americans. These 4 pages are  the worse 4 pages on this planet because of the terrible consequences  it will have on real people. It will be devastating for millions and  millions of Americans.   So, Mr. Speaker, instead of rushing this horrendous bill, patched  together with backroom deals, to the floor and voting on it just hours  after seeing the final product, we should be working together in a  bipartisan way to improve people's lives, and certainly not putting  them at risk. My colleagues seem too concerned about winning at any  cost to stop and think about the consequences for millions upon  millions of Americans. This is a lousy bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from  Lewisville, Texas (Mr. Burgess), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee, a gentleman who sits on both the Energy and Commerce and the  Rules Committee. He is quite literally the most knowledgeable person on  health care in the United States Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank the gentleman from Florida very much. In fact, the  gentleman is correct. We had an opportunity to quote the Bible, Janis  Joplin, and ZZ Top when we were doing our hearings. We had so much time  with each other, and I enjoyed the hours and hours that we had to  debate these essential items.   But the other side of the story is essential health benefits are not  being done away with. They are being transferred entirely to States.  States have asked for the ability to manage their own money, and manage  their own people's benefits of what would be required in the States. So  in no way should a person take away, well, we just did away with it. In  fact, we transferred the authority and the responsibility of essential  health benefits to the States because Governors have been asking for  this.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take just a moment to explain what I believe  is at the heart of the legislation and really, in reality, the key to  fixing health care. It is the second part of this.   We heard the gentleman from Lewisville, Texas, Dr. Burgess, speak  about the Energy and Commerce portions. I now would like to take a  minute to talk about the portions that come directly out of the Ways  and Means Committee.   The gentleman, Mr. Brady, from The Woodlands, Texas, today, spoke  about many of these; but at the heart of it, 170 million Americans  currently receive their health care through an employee-employer tax  advantage or tax benefits, an untaxed benefit whereby people who have  an employer who can provide their health care, it is not taxed-- pretaxed to the employee, allowing them to have a good healthcare  system. Well, all the while, millions of Americans pay higher premiums  out of their pockets in the individual market. Those are people that do  not have an employer who is able to help them. So that is not fair.  That does not help these people.    What we are doing here is putting together an addition of, really, a  great Republican idea; and it takes the important step to provide the  same tax-free benefits for those employer-sponsored plans that we will  give to regular employees, and it is called a tax credit. This tax  credit is going to work because it allows every single American that  does not receive the tax benefit at work to get it for themselves.   Who is this? Well, quite honestly, it is small-business owners; it is  low-income workers; it is entrepreneurs. It includes, really, a lot of  real estate agents and people that work for a small business, maybe  heating and air-conditioning systems like we have all across this  country. It will give their families an opportunity.   How much money? Well, we will provide them between $2,000 and $14,000  a year for their families to be able to have these opportunities to  purchase a nongovernment healthcare plan, meaning that, as they would  go to the marketplace, we are going to help these people through a tax  credit available January 1, providing them with an opportunity to  purchase health care on a benefit basis.   Why is this important? It saves money because what it does, it  creates two things: a family then has an insurance plan, including a  healthcare component that goes to the hospitalization; and secondly, it  gives them an opportunity to have their own doctor or healthcare plan  that they choose. This is important because many of these people end up  in the hospital in the most expensive kind of way we can provide health  care: at the emergency room.   So this gives these families parity in the marketplace. We believe  that that is important and is another part of this Republican  healthcare plan.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I hear my friend talking about what came  out of the Ways and Means Committee. I will tell you what came out of  Ways and Means Committee: a $1 trillion tax cut for the wealthy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Polis), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall), who will be describing the third piece of this,  and that is the putting together of the piece from the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the vice chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the vice chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2386]]        Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a second to summarize  this rule because people have been asking about it.   It is a closed rule. The only amendments allowed are amendments  offered by people who wrote the bill. Those amendments are fixes to  fixes to fixes to fixes in their bill and, in the words of Trump, sad.   I would just say, you know, usually when you have a lousy process you  have a lousy bill, and that is why only 17 percent of the American  people support what my Republican friends are doing.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).    Mr. Speaker, we are going to keep moving on. We were  allocated the same amount of time. I guess the answer would be no.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Kelly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), who is the favorite daughter of Wyoming and  serves on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), who is the favorite daughter of Wyoming and  serves on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Pasco, Washington (Mr. Newhouse), who is a member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 87 patient and  provider organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which  is strongly opposed to this bill.                                                     March 20, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: The undersigned       organizations write to express grave concern about proposals       put forth in the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to alter the       fundamental structure and purpose of Medicaid, a vital source       of health care for patients with ongoing health needs.        We feel compelled to speak out against proposals to phase       out Medicaid expansion and implement per capita caps, which       threaten the ability of Medicaid to provide critical health       care services to many of our most vulnerable citizens. These       proposals aim to achieve cost savings of approximately $880       billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office, at the       expense of tens of millions of patients who rely on Medicaid       for life-sustaining care. While we appreciate the       opportunities we have had to work with your staff, we cannot       support the Medicaid provisions in this bill and cannot       accept policies that prioritize cutting costs by limiting       patients' access to care.                      Medicaid is Critical for Patients         Medicaid is a crucial source of coverage for patients with       serious and chronic health care needs. Pregnant women depend       on Medicaid, which covers roughly 50 percent of all births       including many high-risk pregnancies. Medicaid covers cancer       patients: nearly one-third of pediatric cancer patients were       enrolled in Medicaid in 2013 and approximately 1.52 million       adults with a history of cancer were covered by Medicaid in       2015. Over fifty percent of children and one-third of adults       living with cystic fibrosis rely on Medicaid to get the       treatments and therapies they need to preserve their health.       Nearly half of children with asthma are covered by Medicaid       or CHIP and adults with diabetes are disproportionally       covered by Medicaid as well. The patients we represent are       eligible for Medicaid through various pathways, including       through income-related and disability criteria.                            Reject Per Capita Caps         The proposal to convert federal financing of Medicaid to a       per capita cap system is deeply troubling. This policy is       designed to reduce federal funding for Medicaid, forcing       states to either make up the difference with their own funds       or cut their programs by reducing the number of people they       serve and the health benefits they provide.        For patients with ongoing health care needs, this means       that Medicaid may no longer cover the care and treatments       they need, including breakthrough therapies and technology.       In order to save money, the per capita caps are set to grow       more slowly than expected Medicaid costs under current law.       As the gap between the capped allotment and actual costs       increases over time, states will be forced to constrain       eligibility, reduce benefits, lower provider payments, or       increase cost-sharing. Moreover, by capping the federal       government's contribution to Medicaid in this manner, states       will be less able to cover the cost of new treatments. This       could be devastating for people with serious diseases, for       whom groundbreaking treatments represent a new lease on life.       For people with cystic fibrosis, cancer, and other diseases,       new therapies can be game changers that improve quality of       life and increase life expectancy. In fact, we have already       seen Medicaid programs respond to current budget constraints       by using clinically inappropriate criteria to restrict access       to therapies old and new. A per capita cap will only       exacerbate the downward pressure on Medicaid budgets and will       further reduce access to these therapies for patients.        Pairing financing reforms with increased flexibility, as       has often been proposed, would further undermine Medicaid's       role as a safety net for patients. Without current guardrails       provided by federal requirements--coupled with reduced       federal funding--states will have the authority to reduce       benefits and eligibility as they see fit and to impose other       restrictions, such as waiting periods and enrollment caps.       These policies have serious implications for patients--for a       person with cancer, enrollment freezes and waiting lists       could mean a later-stage diagnosis when treatment costs are       higher and survival is less likely. For a person with       diabetes, this would risk the ability to adequately manage       the disease. Many of our patients rely on costly services       that will be quickly targeted for cuts if states are given       such flexibility, so it is imperative that current federal       safeguards remain in place.                         Maintain Medicaid Expansion         While the AHCA has been described as preserving Medicaid       expansion for those already enrolled in coverage, we are       concerned that estimates show that eliminating the enhanced       match for any enrollee with even a small gap in coverage       would actually result in millions of people losing       coverage. By eliminating the enhanced federal match for       any enrollee with a gap in coverage, eventually states       will be on the hook for billions of dollars to continue       covering this population--an insurmountable financial       hurdle. Additionally, seven states have laws that would       effectively end Medicaid expansion immediately or soon       thereafter when the expansion match rate is eliminated.       Nearly half of adults covered by the Medicaid expansion       are permanently disabled, have serious physical or mental       conditions--such as cancer, stroke, heart disease,       arthritis, pregnancy, or diabetes--or are in fair or poor       health. Repealing Medicaid expansion will leave these       patients without coverage they depend upon to maintain       their health.        The proposed financing reforms are a fundamental shift away       from Medicaid's role as a safety-net for some of the most       vulnerable members of our society. Repealing Medicaid       expansion would leave millions without the health care they       rely on. Our organizations represent and provide care for       millions of Americans living with ongoing health care needs       who rely on Medicaid and we cannot support policies that pose       such a grave risk to patients.        We hope that we can continue our dialogue as you move       forward in this process to arrive at solutions that provide       all Americans with high-quality, affordable care regardless       of an individual's income, employment status, health status,       or geographic location.

Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would say to my colleagues that this is  a sad day for this institution. This process has been awful. But this  is even a sadder day for the American people.   I remind my colleagues that we are supposed to care about one  another, especially the most vulnerable in our society. In this era of  Trump, Washington has become a mean place. It is a place where it has  become unfashionable to worry about the poor, about older Americans,  and about those who struggle.   There is absolutely no justification for giving huge tax breaks to  billionaires--$1 trillion in tax breaks to millionaires and  billionaires, and at the same time throwing 24 million people off of  health care and denying millions more essential healthcare protections.   Twenty-four million people--my Republican colleagues have lost their  human ability to feel what that means. That is the entire population of  Australia.   Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues, but  when I look at this bill and I read this bill, I have to wonder: What  are you thinking? How could you do this?   I have come to the conclusion there are only two reasons--there are  only two ways you can vote for this bill. One is you don't know what is  in the bill; or two is you have to have a heart of stone, because this  bill is shameful. It is going to hurt people. It is going to hurt your  constituents.   Withdraw this bill or vote ``no'' on this bill, but this bill cannot  become law. The health care and healthcare protections for the American  people are too important.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues--both Democrats and  Republicans--reject this. Vote ``no.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking our colleagues, the  gentleman from Massachusetts leading the Rules Committee, and his  ranking members as they came from each of the committees, some 50  hours' worth of hearings and markups, including some 16 hours in the  Rules Committee to not only talk about and vet, but to understand more  clearly what we would be voting on.   Mr. Speaker, today is a bill that is a compromise bill, no doubt  about it. I had my own plan and I had my own ideas. I took 2 years to  get involved in this process. It is difficult to write a healthcare  bill. But it didn't have to be my bill; it had to be a bill that we  could all work together on.   President Trump has been a part of that. President Trump took time  out of his schedule to do this. It is important to the American people.  President Trump, more than any single Member of Congress, gave the  message to the American people about what was necessary and what he  would do. He is going to live up to that, and we should, too.   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line to this whole thing is we are going to  present a Republican plan, and we are going to stand behind what we  sell. It is better for the American people. But make no mistake about  it: we are transferring power, authority, and responsibility not just  to States, but also to the American people. It will be up to them to  make determinations about their own health care because, for the first  time, we will allow some 50 million Americans to have a tax equity, an  opportunity to use tax credits that will be available to families  anywhere from $2,000 for an individual to $14,000 for a family.                                time  1030    This will empower people who have not found a fair shot at the tax  advantages it will give them: small-business owners; the American  people; the average worker in this country, including those who work  two or three different jobs; as well as those who are uninsured. We  believe it is a better shot, an opportunity. We are willing to put our  name on it and behind it.   For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge us to move forward. There will  be 4 hours of debate that remain in this opportunity. For that reason,  I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bill.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule  governing House consideration of H.R. 1628, the ``American Health Care  Act of 2017,'' better known as ``Trumpcare.''   I oppose the rule, and the underlying legislation, for the following  reasons:   1. The rule under consideration is brought pursuant to ``martial  law'' rule passed yesterday which suspends the normal House procedure  and allows for same day consideration, debate, and vote of legislation  that will adversely affect the lives of everyone in America except for  the top 1 percent;   2. The underlying bill is less than 2 weeks old and has not had a  single hearing in any of the Committees of jurisdiction; and   3. The underlying bill does not reflect the input of nearly half the  Members of this body because the legislation was drafted in secret,  marked up in a single overnight session, and brought to the floor  without incorporating a single amendment or idea proposed by the  minority.   Mr. Speaker, none of us here has had a meaningful opportunity to  review the bill, ``Trumpcare 2.0'' we are being asked to vote on.   This bill has undergone significant revision from the one marked up  just last week by the Budget Committee of which I am a member.   Trumpcare 2.0 no doubt contains many sweeteners and olive branches  granted by the Administration and House Republican leaders in backroom  deals in a last ditch effort to secure the necessary votes of  Republican members to take away health care from 24 million Americans,  many of whom are among the most vulnerable persons in society.   None of these changes to the bill before us has been scored by the  Congressional Budget Office so we do not know exactly how many more  millions of Americans will be hurt.   But what is unlikely to change is that 14 million Americans will lose  Medicaid coverage and more than 52 million persons will be uninsured by  2026 under this Republican plan.   In addition to terminating the ACA Medicaid expansion, the  ``Trumpcare'' converts Medicaid to a per-capita cap that is not  guaranteed to keep pace with health costs starting in 2020.   The combined effect of these policies is to slash $880 billion in  federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.   In short, Trumpcare represents a clear and present danger to the  financial and health security of American families, and to the very  stability of our nation's health care system overall.   We should follow regular order in the consideration of all  legislation, but especially in a matter with great importance to the  American people that could impact nearly 300 million people.   For these reasons, I believe the House should reject this rule and  the underlying bill.   Instead of trying to enact the largest transfer of wealth from the  bottom 99 percent to the top 1 percent in history, House Republicans  should work with Democrats to strengthen the Affordable Care Act which  has and continues to make life-affirming differences for the better in  the lives of more than 300 million Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.
