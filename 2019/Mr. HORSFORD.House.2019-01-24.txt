 Madam Speaker, I stand here today to share the story of  Laurie Wall, a Las Vegas resident, a mother of three, and a Federal  employee denied a paycheck because of this government shutdown.   Like many of Nevada's Federal employees, Laurie is still reporting to  work every single day, doing her job on behalf of the American people.  But because she is not getting paid, Laurie also has to add trips to  the local food bank to pick up needed food and diapers for her family.   Because of this shutdown, 3,520 Nevada-based Federal employees are  being denied a paycheck; 30,000 southern Nevadans are at risk of  homelessness because of reduced housing assistance; and 34,000 people  in my district could lose their nutritional assistance.   The House has already voted 11 times to reopen the government. It is  long past time that the Senate does the same and stops holding Nevadans  like Laurie Wall hostage.                            ____________________
