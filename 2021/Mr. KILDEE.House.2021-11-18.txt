 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize an incredible  leader in mid-Michigan, Angie Hendershot.   For the past 25 years, my constituents in Flint, Saginaw, and Bay  City have welcomed Angie Hendershot into their homes as a reporter and  anchor with ABC TV-12. She is a trusted voice in our community. Local  reporters like Angie play a vital role in democracy.   For the past 25 years, she has kept mid-Michigan informed and  connected through her on-the-ground reporting and investigative  journalism. Throughout her course of work, Angie has won many awards,  including 10 Emmys and numerous awards from the Associated Press and  Michigan Association of Broadcasters.   But for Angie, working at ABC 12 isn't just a job; it is a way to  give back to the community she loves. She has demonstrated time and  time again her commitment to mid-Michigan throughout her career with  volunteerism and charity work. One of those initiatives is the annual  diaper drive, where Angie helps to collect donations of diapers, wipes,  and cash to help the Flint Diaper Bank supply more than a million  diapers to local, needy babies every year.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Angie on her achievements and this  important milestone. I speak for our entire community when I say we  look forward to welcoming her into our living rooms for many, many  years to come.   Great work, Angie.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  his work on this important piece of legislation.   With the Build Back Better budget, we help lower costs for the  working families that I represent. We lower healthcare costs by  allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs like insulin,  lowering out-of-pocket costs for those families back home that I  represent.   It will lower childcare costs by ensuring universal preschool for all  3- and 4-year-olds and expanding the child tax credit, which is a  monthly tax cut helping working families with children pay for  groceries and school supplies and take care of their monthly mortgage  payments.    This Build Back Better budget isn't free. It is fully paid for. It is  paid for by making corporations and the wealthiest Americans finally  step up and begin to pay their fair share.   Today, Democrats are delivering on this important legislation to cut  taxes and to lower costs for working Americans and for those middle- class families that I represent.
