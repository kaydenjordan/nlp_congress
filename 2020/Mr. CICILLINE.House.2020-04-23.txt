 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the interim relief  package.   Thanks to the strong leadership of the Speaker and our outstanding  committee chairs, this bill helps our smallest small businesses, our  hospitals, and a national testing strategy, which were not included in  Senator McConnell's original bill. So thanks again for their  leadership.   Madam Speaker, we also have to work hard to flatten this curve, and  we have to do a lot more for America's working families.   In the next phase of relief, we need to include recurring direct cash  payments to workers, additional small business relief, aid to States  and cities to pay first responders and their healthcare heroes that are  on the front lines, and even more in unemployment benefits.   Our response must meet the gravity of the moment. I hope my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join with us to make  sure we respond to this issue in the way that is necessary and not  resist efforts to help hospitals, to help workers, to help expand  testing, all of the things we know we need to do to defeat this  pandemic.   Thank goodness we stood up. Otherwise, we wouldn't have $75 million  for healthcare workers, $25 million for testing, and all of the other  things which are in this bill to help the smallest of small businesses.
