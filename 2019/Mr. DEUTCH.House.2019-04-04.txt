 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this motion.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today with solemn responsibility. I  carry the legacy of the history of the Jewish people, a history of  persecution, of discrimination, of scapegoating, but also a history of  perseverance and survival. The embodiment of that perseverance is the  establishment of the State of Israel, the home of the Jewish people.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly condemn the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions  movement, economic warfare against the State of Israel, and there is no  one in this Chamber--no one--who would question my commitment to  opposing BDS or fighting anti-Semitism or supporting our ally, Israel.  But I also strongly reject what my colleagues are doing here today.   My colleague, my friend from Texas, is right. There has been a long  and bipartisan history of support for Israel, and it has been so strong  because of that bipartisanship.   This is not a motion to commit about BDS. We have seen this play out  before. The last time this resolution came up, my colleagues introduced  a resolution condemning BDS and anti-Semitism and supporting Israel,  and we all voted for it until it was time to actually go on the record,  and almost every one of them voted against it.   This is about politics. This is about trying to drive a wedge into  this Caucus where it does not belong. That is what they are trying to  do today.   Mr. Speaker, the Jewish community also has a history of standing up  against atrocities like the humanity crisis in Yemen. My colleagues are  trying to block us from standing in support of our human rights and  American values to condemn what is happening there. That is what this  is about. That is why I am opposed to it, and we should all oppose it.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority  leader, for his comments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                           Parliamentary Inquiries
