 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Pella  Marching Dutch of Pella High School, who recently participated in the  Rose Bowl Parade.   Each year, only 21 bands across the world receive an invitation to  play in the parade. The Pella Marching Dutch have joined the ranks as  one of the greatest marching bands of our time.   This is not the first time the Pella Marching Dutch have received  this high honor, having appeared in the parade in 1988 and 2002. I was  fortunate enough to watch the Marching Dutch on Monday, and I was  amazed by the talent that was demonstrated by the students at Pella  High School.   I congratulate the Pella Marching Dutch again on representing Iowa in  the Rose Parade, and I look forward to watching their future  performances.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).                                   Go Dawgs     Mr. Speaker, it was difficult to yield--I had to  pause a little bit, as a TCU Horned Frog--to my colleague, but in the  spirit of camaraderie, I did so.                            ____________________
