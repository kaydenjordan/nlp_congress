 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S7237]]                                                     Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION         Government of Australia--155mm Ammunition and Accessories         The Government of Australia has requested to buy M825A1       155mm White Phosphorous projectile munitions, M782 Multi-      Option Fuze for Artillery, M762A1 electronic-timed fuzes,       M231 and M232A2 propelling charges, percussion primers,       technical publications and books, technical data for       operational maintenance, technical assistance and services,       and other related elements of logistics and program support.       The total estimated program cost is $132.2 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region.        This purchase will enable effective training and extend the       Australian Defence Force's (ADF) capability to conduct       combined operations. The ADF already has these rounds in       service, and is trained and equipped to use them. Australia       will not have any difficulty absorbing these weapons into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be determined at a later       date. The material could potentially be sourced from a       combination of DoD stocks and new procurement. There are no       known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of U.S. Government or contractor representatives       to Australia.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 20-78       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M825A1 is a 155mm artillery projectile which       utilizes a payload of white phosphorous impregnated felt to       produce a smoke screen at a target location. The Government       of Australia has stated their commitment to use these rounds       exclusively for its intended purpose, which is to provide       signaling and to obscure enemy visibility on the battlefield.        2. The M782 Multi-Option Fuze for Artillery (MOFA). The       M782 is a selectable multi-option fuze that provides height       of burst capability to artillery rounds. The M782 is a       sensitive military technology and has been approved for       release to the Government of Australia.        3. Also included in this case are propelling charges and       other fuzes that enable the effective use of the M825A1 end       item. While these technologies are controlled military       hardware they do not represent a significant technology       transfer risk.        4. The highest level of classified information associated       with the sale of this equipment is SECRET.        5. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        6. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sale is necessary to further the U.S. foreign policy       and national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        7. All defense articles and services listed on this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Australia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The Field Information Communications System (FICS) is       made up of commercially available, non-program of record       components. The FICS system (also referred to as ``Syun       Lien'') is an area-switched communications system which is       designed to provide mobile and secure communications in a       wide range of battle situations. The FICS system provides       mobile and secure voice and data communications on an       automatic, discrete addressed, fixed-directory basis to the       military Tactical Operations Center (TOC)-level command posts       (CPs), and remote (mobile) users employing technological       improvements in radio transmissions, data networking and       packetized voice, while minimizing system footprint (power,       size, personnel and logistics train). The system supports       both mobile and wire subscribers with a means to exchange       command, control, communications, and intelligence       information in a dynamic tactical environment.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       UNCLASSIFIED.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4.
