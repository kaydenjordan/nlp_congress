 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the preamble of our Constitution lays  out a vision that includes establishing justice and promoting the  general welfare. Certainly we have the challenge in America of making  sure the doors of opportunity are wide open and not slammed shut.   For centuries, we have been working to try to make sure that vision  comes into full realization, but today we are considering the  nomination of Stuart Kyle Duncan to a lifetime appointment on the Fifth  Circuit Court of Appeals. This individual is not supportive of our  constitutional vision of open doors; he is intent on slamming them  shut--slamming them shut on all LGBTQ communities; slamming them shut  on women seeking reproductive rights and healthcare; slamming  opportunity shut on those who simply wish to vote in America in  fulfillment of the vision of our constitutional democratic Republic;  slamming the doors shut on those who are here and have been here  legally, who are seeking to become citizens.   Mr. Duncan is probably best known for his work on Burwell v. Hobby  Lobby, a landmark case opposing the ACA's requirement that employers  provide insurance coverage opportunity for contraception and for  undermining the healthcare of countless women across America.   You might say: Didn't his side of this case win in the courts? Well,  not for the reasons that this individual put forward. The Court  rejected the arguments Kyle Duncan made. He refused to acknowledge the  importance of birth control in women's lives, arguing that the  government does not have a compelling interest in ensuring access to  birth control without cost-sharing. The Court said that is wrong and  that the government does have a compelling interest. Mr. Duncan argued  that the Court was not required to consider the impact of this law--or  the possibility of overturning it--on employees under the Religious  Freedom Restoration Act. Every single member of the Court, whether in  the majority or in the minority on the opinion, threw out that  argument, reaffirming that burdens on third parties must be considered.  Although the verdict came down on the side Mr. Duncan advocated for,  the Court soundly rejected his arguments and his reasoning.   After Hobby Lobby, he wrote an amicus brief in Zubik v. Burwell on  behalf of Eternal World Television Network, a nonprofit seeking an  exception from the ACA birth control benefit. He made some of those  same arguments again, and again the Court rejected his reasoning and  directed the government and all parties involved to arrive at an  approach that ensures that affected women ``receive full and equal  health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.''   It is certainly a concern to have a nominee who wants to slam the  door shut on the freedom of women to access the reproductive healthcare  that they desire, but there is more door-slamming here than that. He is  an ardent opponent to equality and opportunity for the LGBTQ community  here in the United States of America. He is recognized as one of our  Nation's leading opponents of opportunity for the LGBTQ community.   He authored legal briefs opposing marriage equality in Obergefell v.  Hodges, going so far as to question the legitimacy of the Supreme Court  when the Court came down saying that ``love is love'' and that marriage  equality is the law of the land under the Constitution of the United  States of America. He called that decision ``an abject failure.''   I ask you, what kind of fairness do you anticipate from a judge who  is ardently opposed to the freedom of opportunity for LGBTQ Americans,  who condemns a previous decision of the Supreme Court as ``an abject  failure,'' and  [[Page S2337]]  who said that this decision would ``imperil civic peace''? He said:         No one can possibly predict with any degree of confidence       what are all the possible ramifications for our society that       are going to take place. No one could have predicted all of       the social pathologies from no-fault divorce. This is a far       more radical change than no-fault divorce.    He said that ``harms'' to our democracy from marriage equality  ``would be severe, unavoidable, and irreversible.''   Certainly, he wanted to slam the door on marriage opportunity for  LGBTQ Americans, but he made an outrageous argument that the concern of  others should enable his court, as he envisioned it, to deprive  Americans of the opportunity to marry the individual they love--no  concern for the Constitution, just that some folks might find it  uncomfortable. He made an extensive, hyperbolic, hysterical argument  that it would completely debase society for people to be with the  person they love.   His attacks against the LGBTQ community go on and on, from  introducing expert declarations in one case that characterized  transgender Americans as ``delusional.'' If you have been characterized  as delusional based on who you are and whom you love, what fairness can  you expect from the judgment of this individual? He fought to deny  parental rights to the woman who adopted the children of her same-sex  partner--the same children she had helped raise for 8 years.   Clearly, this individual is interested in rightwing, opportunity- denying legislating from the bench, not protecting the vision of  opportunity embedded in our Constitution.   All that doesn't even touch on his other efforts, such as his effort  to make it difficult for communities of color or communities of modest  economic means to be able to vote in the United States of America. If  you believe in the Constitution of the United States, you should be a  fierce advocate for voter empowerment and participation, not voter  suppression, but this individual is a fierce advocate for voter  suppression. Isn't it right to have people confirmed to the bench for a  lifetime appointment who actually admire the vision of our Constitution  for opportunity and for citizen engagement, not one who wants to tear  down opportunities and slam doors on opportunities and stop people from  voting.   That is not all. There is more. There are his attacks on deferred  action for parents of Americans in which he spreads false and  frightening stereotypes about immigrants, echoing his previous  hysterical comments, saying that ``[m]any violent criminals would  likely be eligible to receive deferred action under DAPA's inadequate  standards.'' It is kind of the last refuge of a scoundrel, an  individual who proceeds to attack our immigrants, saying: Oh, they  might all end up being criminals--completely contrary to the facts,  where immigrants are far more law-abiding than the vast average among  Americans born here in the United States.   Isn't it the case that we are a nation of immigrants? Unless you are  100 percent Native American Indian, then you are here because you  immigrated or your parents immigrated or your ancestors at some level  immigrated generations ago. So basically descending to attack  immigrants as all criminals is simply another example of this  individuals's unsuitability to serve on the bench.   We are a ``we the people'' nation, founded on equality, justice, and  opportunity for all. Our Nation is about opening doors for each  individual to participate to the full degree of their talent, not to  have the prejudices of some allow them to slam doors on others. That is  why this individual, Stuart Kyle Duncan, should never be on the floor  of the Senate to be confirmed as a judge in the United States of  America. Let him carry on his advocacy outside the hallowed halls of  the courtroom but not inside, sitting on the bench. That is why  everyone here tonight should vote against confirming this nomination.   Thank you, Madam President.
