 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim  Risch, Representative Mike Simpson and Representative Russ Fulcher, we  congratulate Brian Ness on his retirement after 13 years of outstanding  service as director of the Idaho Transportation Department, ITD.   In 2009, Brian Ness was appointed to serve as director of the Idaho  Transportation Department, and he has been responsible for an annual  budget of approximately $800 million and leading 1,650 employees. We  have greatly valued his input on advancing Idaho transportation  priorities, including through the Federal appropriations process and  other infrastructure-related proposals. He also testified before the  U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Research and Technology  in 2019 on ``The Need for a National Surface Transportation Research  Agenda.''   Director Ness has devoted considerable time utilizing his experience  as a transportation professional to help lead a number of related  organizations. He has served on the boards of directors and in many  other leadership roles for the American Association of State Highway  and Transportation Officials, AASHTO; the Western Association of State  Highway and Transportation Officials, WASHTO; the Transportation  Research Board, TRB; the American Road and Transportation Builders  Association, ARTBA; and the Idaho Rural Partnership. His leadership  roles include the Governor appointing Director Ness to chair the Idaho  Autonomous and Connected Vehicle Testing and Deployment Committee.  Additionally, in 2019, Director Ness became president of the ARTBA's  Transportation Officials Division. He also served as president of  WASHTO in 2015.   Throughout his career, he has earned many recognitions for his  remarkable work and led teams that have received many honors. For  example, since Director Ness joined the ITD, it has received nearly 170  national awards for its programs and projects, including the  prestigious Francis B. Francois Award for Innovation. ITD has also won  an extraordinary 17 AASHTO President's Transportation Awards. Director  Ness also received the 2016 Navigator Award from the national  organization, Route Fifty; was named Trine University's--formerly Tri- State University--2014 Alumni of the Year; AASHTO's President's Award  for Administration in 2013; and was honored in 2012 as Leader of the  Year by the Treasure Valley Chapter of Women's Transportation Seminar.   Before becoming director at ITD, Director Ness worked for 30 years at  the Michigan Department of Transportation, holding a variety of  positions in research, operations, aeronautics, construction, and  project development. He earned a bachelor of science degree in civil  engineering from Tri-State University and a master's degree in public  administration from Western Michigan University, and he is a licensed  professional engineer in Michigan and Idaho.   We understand the ITD's employee-driven innovation program started  during Director Ness's leadership is credited with saving nearly $35  million, creating 691 customer-service improvements, and saving 540,000  contractor and employee hours. Thank you, Brian, for your focus on  ingenuity, efficiency, accountability, and results all these years at  the helm of the ITD. Your work to empower employee-driven innovation  and support emerging leaders will no doubt have lasting effects on  government efficiency and countless individual careers. Thank you,  especially, for your service to Idaho, the transportation department  and its employees, and congratulations on your retirement.                            ____________________
