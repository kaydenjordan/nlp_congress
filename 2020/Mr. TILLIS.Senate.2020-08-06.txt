 Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I have been in the Senate now for 5\1/2\  years, and I don't consider somebody a better friend, an advocate for  his State than Senator Sullivan. I have actually spent a lot of time-- even though Senator Gillibrand and I have differences in certain  situations, we find ways to work together.   What I have before me, though, is something that is very important  for people to understand. I agree with everything Senator Sullivan  said. His measure, I suspect, has broad support, probably support on  its own. But what we have here is the addition by the motion of Senator  Gillibrand that affects my State, North Carolina. It has to do with  reallocation of quotas. It would particularly affect the flounder  industry in North Carolina.   I hope that we are able to work out our differences. I hope that we  can get Senator Sullivan's bill passed. But because it has been amended  to include something that hurts my fisheries in North Carolina and my  commercial fishermen at the worst possible time, when they are  suffering like everybody else from the COVID-19 crisis and all the  challenges that that produces, I do object.
