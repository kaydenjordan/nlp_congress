 Mr. President, fire departments across the country rely  on critical Federal resources that keep firefighters and emergency  responders safe. These heroes need our support as they continue  protecting our communities. That is why I urge my colleagues to support  the Fire Grants and Safety Act.   This bipartisan bill reauthorizes two vital grant programs  administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and also  reauthorizes the U.S. Fire Administration.   Fire departments depend on these programs to address staffing needs,  replace outdated equipment, fund fire training and education programs,  and invest in health screenings for firefighters in the line of duty.   It is clear that, without these grant programs, many fire  departments, especially those in smaller or more rural communities,  would simply not be able to invest in their vehicles, equipment, or  training that they need to protect their communities.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote to move forward with this  important, bipartisan legislation that will help ensure that our  firefighters and first responders have what they need.                            ____________________
