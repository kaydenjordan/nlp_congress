 Mr. Speaker, we all have subjects that we find  fascinating.   For 25 years, I have actually kept files of abstracts on this because  I actually participated in writing Arizona's 1993 concealed carry law.   I desperately wish this was an intellectually honest conversation  about the data, because we all want our communities and families to be  safer. I believe I can show you the statistical abstract data.   In States like Arizona, adjusted for population, the violent use of  firearms is almost one-half of what it was before the adoption of our  concealed carry law.   Now, was concealed carry responsible for that?   Of course, not. But it is a factor. Some of it is mental health, some  of it is law enforcement, some of it is incarceration. It is  complicated. But if you actually look at these data abstracts of crime  statistics in the United States on the misuse of firearms, it turns out  that States that have adopted concealed carry compared to States that  have gone other directions, States that adopted have gotten safer.    There is actually some brilliant articles when you compare Florida  and Illinois: big, populated, demographically complex States. Florida  has gotten dramatically safer. Illinois has not.   If you really love our families, love our communities, this needs to  be an intellectually sound discussion of what factors make us safer as  a society. I believe this bill leads us in that direction.
