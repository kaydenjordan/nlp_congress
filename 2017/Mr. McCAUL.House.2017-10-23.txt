 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4038) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to reassert  article I authorities over the Department of Homeland Security, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4038         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Accountability       Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. REPEAL.         (a) In General.--Section 872 of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 452) is repealed and the item relating to       such section in the table of contents in section 1(b) of such       Act is struck.        (b) Technical and Conforming Amendments.--The Homeland       Security Act of 2002 is amended--        (1) in section 506 (6 U.S.C. 316)--        (A) by striking subsection (b); and        (B) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections       (b) and (c), respectively;        (2) in section 702(b) (6 U.S.C. 342(b)), by amending       paragraph (4) to read as follows:        ``(4) Reorganization.--The Secretary may allocate or       reallocate the functions of the Office, or discontinue the       Office.''; and        (3) in paragraph (3) of section 2006(b) (6 U.S.C. 607(b)),       by striking ``sections 506(c)(2)'' and inserting ``sections       506(b)(2)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the bipartisan DHS  Accountability Enhancement Act.   Mr. Speaker, the current threats confronting our homeland continue to  evolve each and every day. They come from international terrorists,  drug smugglers, human traffickers, hackers engaged in cyber warfare,  transnational gangs like MS-13, and natural disasters.   To best address these threats, the American people need a Department  of Homeland Security that is effective and accountable to the people it  protects.   The Founding Fathers gave Congress the authority to write laws and  give direction to the executive branch under Article I of our  Constitution. Today, we have an important opportunity to reassert that  constitutional authority.   The legislation before us eliminates an outdated provision that gives  DHS overly broad authority to act on its own and reorganize without  congressional approval. It is authority that was well-intentioned when  it was first provided right after 9/11, but the time has come to  rebalance this legislative equation.   Mr. Speaker, as you may be aware, it is the only authority of its  kind in the entire executive branch. As Members of Congress, we have a  solemn obligation to help protect the American people from anyone who  wishes to bring us harm.   In the wake of 9/11, we reached across the aisle and worked together  to create the Department of Homeland Security and demonstrated that the  security of our homeland is not a partisan issue.   This is not just an academic exercise. On October 6 of this year, DHS  used this authority for the first time in many years. We also want to  work with DHS to support them, but continued use of this authority is  not the best way to make the Department stronger.   I am proud to say that the Committee on Homeland Security, which I  chair, has a strong bipartisan track record. This year we came together  as Republicans and Democrats and passed the first-ever comprehensive  reauthorization of DHS through the House with an overwhelming majority  support.   Let's continue that progress today and pass this legislation. I also  call on the Senate to pass our reauthorization of DHS as soon as  possible so our country can be more secure.   I would like to thank Ranking Member Bennie Thompson, Congressman  Vela, and all of the staff on the committee for their hard work on this  issue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 4038.   I will say that this committee has passed over 50 bills out of the  House that are currently sitting in the Senate waiting action. I urge  the Senate to take action on this important legislation, all 50-plus  bills, that will help better protect the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Cuban Airport  Security Act. Last-point-of-departure airports are critically important  to our homeland security. One only need look at the latest laptop ban  that was instituted at 10 last-point-of-departure airports, given the  fact that the terrorists have now learned how to turn them into  explosive devices.   The American people should have grave concern about the level of  security in place at any foreign airport where the host government  refuses to allow strict inspections of airport security by Members of  Congress.   As a footnote, Mr. Speaker, it was just last year that Mr. Katko and  I applied for visas to the Government of Cuba to inspect these airports  to see how safe they were, and the Cuban Government's response to that  was to deny our visa applications.   What is more concerning is that over the course of the last year, the  United States Government personnel in Cuba have been targeted and  subjected to harmful sonic attacks, which in some cases have caused  permanent brain damage. This must not be tolerated.   Too many questions remain when it comes to Cuba's airports. Congress  is still largely in the dark in terms of Cuba's security equipment,  training procedures, and other perimeter security.   This bill takes an important step forward to shed light on current  inadequacies and help to ensure proper oversight of inbound flights  from Cuba to the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my good friend from New York  (Mr. Katko) for his continued leadership on aviation security and last- point-of-departure airports, which has been critical in bringing these  issues to the forefront, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
