 Mr. Speaker, nothing unites Indiana's Sixth Congressional  District quite like the simple phrase, ``we must stand with Israel.''  Throughout most of my rural district that has far more Christian  churches than synagogues, Hoosiers are united in their support of the  Jewish state.   Hoosiers, myself included, were deeply distressed when the Obama  administration stood silent as our great ally was demonized by the U.N.  Israel is our most important friend in the region, and among America's  best partners in the world. President Obama's silence and defection  from Israel was unconscionable, and he has made our ally less safe and  peace less likely.   I am eager to vote today to send a strong signal to the world that  the  [[Page H119]]  American people reject the U.N.'s one-sided, shortsighted U.N. Security  Council resolution, and the American people stand united with Israel. I  urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Section 801(a)(1)(A) of title 5, United States Code, as       proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill, is amended       by inserting after ``the Federal agency promulgating such       rule'' the following: ``shall satisfy the requirements of       section 808 and''.        Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, as proposed to be       amended by section 3 of the bill, is amended by adding at the       end the following (and amending the table of sections       accordingly):       ``Sec. 808. Regulatory cut-go requirement         ``In making any new rule, the agency making the rule shall       identify a rule or rules that may be amended or repealed to       completely offset any annual costs of the new rule to the       United States economy. Before the new rule may take effect,       the agency shall make each such repeal or amendment. In       making such an amendment or repeal, the agency shall comply       with the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 5, but the       agency may consolidate proceedings under subchapter with       proceedings on the new rule.''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his  help on this amendment as well. It is an amendment designed to take an  already very good bill and make it just a little better.   A good friend of mine, former Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels, used to  say ``you'd be amazed how much government you'll never miss'' when  talking about reducing the size of government bureaucracy.   So much of government's excess is created by unelected officials who  wield enormous influence over our everyday lives. Last year, Federal  agencies issued 18 rules and regulations for every one law that passed  Congress. That is a grand total of 3,853 regulations in 2016 alone. In  2015, Federal regulations cost the American economy nearly $1.9  trillion--T, trillion dollars--in lost growth and productivity.   Think about that for a second. A $1.9 trillion tax, a government  burden on the American people. That means lost jobs, stagnant wages,  and decreasing benefits for workers.   My amendment looks to help change all that. Very simply, my amendment  requires every agency issuing a new rule to first identify, then repeal  or amend at least one existing rule to offset any annual costs the new  rule would have on the U.S. economy. This isn't some new radical idea.  President-  [[Page H136]]  elect Trump announced his administration will implement a new practice  that for every new regulation, two would have to be repealed.   Governments in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the  Netherlands have all implemented similar versions of one-in/one-out  when addressing new rules and regulations. In fact, in Canada,  bureaucrats used the new direction to find and cut more red tape than  was even required by the law. My amendment gives the new administration  that same flexibility.   Mr. Chair, it is past time we stop bureaucratic abuse and shift the  balance of power from government back to the people, where it belongs.  That can start today by passing the REINS Act and putting our  government on a path to reduce the amount of red tape that our  businesses and the American people deal with every day.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment  and the underlying bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I oppose the gentleman's  amendment, which would require that agencies offset the cost of new  rules, no matter how critical or mundane these protections may be,  prior to promulgating new rules. This proposal, also referred to as  ``regulatory cut-go,'' appears as title 2 of H.R. 1155, the Searching  for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, or  the SCRUB Act, that was introduced in the previous Congress.   In the context of a veto threat of that bill, the Obama  administration cautioned that this requirement would make the process  of retrospective regulatory review less productive and, in the process,  create needless regulatory and legal uncertainty, and that it would  increase costs for businesses and for States, local and tribal  governments, and it would also impede commonsense protections for the  American public.   By enacting Federal statutes, tasking agencies with responsibilities,  Congress authorizes agencies to carry out matters that are too complex,  routine, or technical for Congress itself to administrate. We must  ensure that agencies have the proper flexibility to issue new  protections without encumbering other regulations with political  obstructions. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), my good friend and the chairman of the House  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is long past time to stop the  runaway train of the Federal regulatory bureaucracy. I urge support for  the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Messer).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grijalva    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in  House Report 115-1.
