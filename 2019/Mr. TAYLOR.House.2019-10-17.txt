 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 13 Plano ISD  schools on receiving the National PTA School of Excellence designation.  This recognition program, accredited by the National Parent Teacher  Association, works to support and celebrate the partnership between  PTAs and schools across this great land.   Plano ISD is setting an incredible example with a current PTA  membership of more than 16,000 parents. With the help of their PTAs,  Plano ISD is cultivating crucial relationships between parents,  teachers, and the surrounding community. Their dedication to improving  the learning environment for students in and outside the classroom  serves as a crucial reminder of the volunteerism and its role in  shaping a community.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these 13 Plano PTAs  on their success of putting students first and championing a quality  education.                            ____________________
