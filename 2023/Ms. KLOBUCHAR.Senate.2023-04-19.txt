 Mr. President, I am here to talk about the Fire Grants  and Safety Act.   I do appreciate the words of my colleague. It was good to hear his  concerns, and I think we all share concerns about Americans being spied  on and their data.   I also note that as we look at dealing with platforms and social  media and the like at the same time we pursue this, we must pursue the  bills that have been out there for well over a year now and passed  through the Judiciary Committee last year and will do so again. And  those are bills related to monopoly power; bills related to the  incredible imbalance in power with two of the platforms, Google and  Facebook, when it comes to dealing with small newspapers and radio  stations and TV and their content, a bill that was nearly passed at the  end of last year; another bill that Senator Grassley and I have that  speaks to the fact that other countries in the world are now putting  forth regulations and rules about self-preferencing and the unfairness  to our small businesses; and then, of course, other bills, some of  which are in the Commerce Committee, on privacy and children's issues  and the like.   All of these bills must be considered on this floor because, as noted  by my colleague, we have not passed any rules when it comes to not only  the issues he was addressing but also when it comes to a competition  tech policy since the advent of the internet.   I think we know a lot more than we knew when Facebook was in a  garage. We know a lot more, and it is time for us to get up to speed  and to actually pass some rules and stop talking about it.                                    S. 870    So I rise today in support of the Fire Grants and Safety Act. I would  like to thank Senators Peters, Collins, Carper, and Murkowski for their  leadership. Our communities are strongest and safest when local fire  departments have the funding that they need to hire firefighters and  pay for equipment.   We all know that firefighters do lifesaving work. They are there for  us during house fires, car crashes, medical  [[Page S1225]]  emergencies, and so much more, and I am committed to being there for  them.   Over the past several months, I have visited fire halls across my  State. I have heard from local departments in both cities and rural  communities about how important the Assistance for Firefighters Grant  and the SAFER Grant Programs are to them.   That is why we must pass the bipartisan Fire Grants and Safety Act to  ensure that we continue providing Federal funding for these critical  programs.   Local fire departments in Minnesota and across the country rely on  these programs to invest in training and purchasing critically needed  equipment. I have seen some of these firetrucks in small communities,  like in Houston, MN, firetrucks that are outdated, things that need to  be changed. Fires burn just as strong and are just as dangerous in  small rural communities as they are in a big city. Yet they don't have  the equipment that some of the larger communities have.   We also must support fire departments' efforts to hire and retain  trained firefighters so they can keep our communities safe. Because of  a SAFER grant, for instance, the Minneapolis Fire Department was able  to hire 15 additional firefighters, which means an additional 5  firefighters on every shift, and it helped the department to reduce  reliance on overtime shifts, which in the end saves money.   Thanks to another of these grants, Bloomington, MN--the home of the  Mall of America for those listening today who are looking for a great  place to visit--which has been facing a serious shortage of staff in  the fire department there, was able to add 18 full-time firefighters  and will now have firetrucks available 24 hours a day. That is one of  the biggest cities in my State.   As a result of an assistance for firefighters grant, the Duluth Fire  Department sent 40 firefighters to a training program to reduce  emergency response time and increase safety for firefighters. And let  me tell you, in Duluth, they don't just fight fires; they have people  stranded on icefloes in the middle of Lake Superior.   They have all kinds of disasters that maybe some of our warmer States  do not experience that they must respond to each and every day,  including how to get to fire hydrants when they are surrounded by six  feet of snow. In the town of Proctor, which has a population of just  over 3,100, because of one of these grants, the local fire department  there was able to purchase 20 air packs, including five with thermal  imaging cameras, and get a new set of cutting-edge rescue tools. I  think many of my colleagues have similar stories about how important  these resources are to fire departments.    One of the things that I learned in my last few years of visiting  with our firefighters and chiefs is that, in fact, one of the major  problems facing them is not always discussed. And that is similar to  what so many of our veterans have faced when they were stationed next  to burn pits, and that is what is happening with a number of our  firefighters getting cancer and, sadly, perishing from cancer at very  young ages.   Cancer is the leading cause of death among firefighters. Firefighters  can be exposed to hundreds of potential carcinogens when responding to  fires. It is only right that we treat cancer caused by on-the-job  exposure the same way we treat other physical injuries.   Two solutions here: One is, with these fire grants, helping,  especially, smaller departments that didn't have them to get up-to-date  washing machines, up-to-date dryers that do a much better job and  quicker job in terms of cleaning off this equipment, because the stuff  that is burning in these buildings--just as what has happened with our  veterans--that wasn't being burnt 20, 30, 50, 100 years ago. We know  that is what part of the problem is.   The second is to make sure we take care of them, not just in our  words as well as speaking from the Senate floor, but in what we  actually do to have the backs of their families. To truly do right by  our firefighters, we have to look out for those who tragically get  cancer as a result of their service. That is why Senator Kevin Cramer  of North Dakota and I have joined forces and introduced a bill to do  just that. This, for me, goes back to 2018, when I championed the bill  to create a national firefighter cancer registry, along with Senator  Menendez and others.   Senator Cramer's and my bill is called Honoring Our Fallen Heroes  Act, and it would make sure that firefighters who become disabled or  die from cancer as a result of their service get the benefits that they  deserve.   We must make sure that our firefighters have everything they need to  do their job. It is the least we can do for our heroes who sacrifice so  much to keep us safe.   I am excited to support this bill, and I see Senator Peters is here  and has been such a great leader on this issue.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 10 to  roll back protections for veterans and their family members who are  seeking to access basic reproductive healthcare. I would like to thank  Senator Murray, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Duckworth for their  leadership in standing against this resolution.   Almost 10 months ago, the Supreme Court issued a ruling overruling  nearly five decades of precedent protecting a woman's right to make her  own healthcare decisions. Now, women are at the mercy of a patchwork of  State laws governing their ability to access reproductive care, leaving  them with fewer rights than their moms and grandmas.   S.J. Res. 10 is yet another attempt to roll back women's access to  care. It would overturn a decision by the Department of Veterans  Affairs to allow veterans and their family members to access basic  healthcare. Currently, the rule allows Veterans Affairs doctors to  provide counseling and care to women veterans and beneficiaries covered  by Veterans Affairs insurance, as well as abortion care in the case of  rape, incest, or when the life or health of the women is at risk. The  rule is limited, and the Department has said that Veterans Affairs  doctors, nurses, or healthcare professionals can opt out of providing  abortion care.   Women across the country are already facing so much uncertainty  because of the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's  Health Organization. This resolution threatens the lives and health of  women veterans who risked their lives for our country. Today, we are  standing up for  [[Page S1238]]  them by making it clear that we will not settle for a reality where  they cannot access basic care.
