 Mr. President, on September 27, the Environment and  Public Works Committee favorably reported the Strengthening Coastal  Communities Act of 2023 as an original bill by voice vote. This bill,  S. 2958, expands and improves the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, also  known as CBRA. I would like to formally recognize the colleagues who  have worked with me on this bill and share some thoughts on its  significance.   According to Senate procedure, original bills are considered a  product of the committee and do not have sponsors or cosponsors. With  this in mind, I wish to acknowledge for the record that Senators  Graham, Whitehouse, and Tillis assisted in authorship of the  Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2023. While these colleagues  cannot be formally added as cosponsors, I want to thank them for their  participation in developing this bipartisan legislation and note that I  consider them to be cosponsors.  [[Page S5253]]    I would also like to ask our colleagues across the Senate for their  support to pass this bill. CBRA was originally enacted in 1982, and it  protects sensitive habitats along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic  coasts by restricting Federal investment within designated areas. In  doing so, CBRA has saved billions of Federal tax dollars since  enactment, while simultaneously protecting hundreds of thousands of  acres of coastal wetlands from development. In 2019, a scientific study  found that CBRA had saved the Federal taxpayer roughly $9.5 billion  since its passage and is projected to save up to $108 billion over the  next 50 years. Coastal wetlands that CBRA protects continue to provide  key habitat areas for commercial and recreational fisheries, migratory  birds, and endangered species.   Importantly, the areas protected under CBRA play a crucial role in  coastal resilience by mitigating hurricane and flood damage. A 2023  study found that CBRA provided $112 million per year in prevented  National Flood Insurance Program claims, a 7-percent savings in annual  claims.   Given this broad range of benefits, CBRA has enjoyed strong  bipartisan support since its inception. CBRA was developed and  introduced on a bipartisan basis in 1982, with 58 cosponsors in the  Senate led by sponsor Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island. CBRA's  co-author, Representative Thomas B. Evans from my home State of  Delaware, said CBRA was needed because ``the U.S. taxpayer should not  subsidize and bear the risk for private development on coastal  barriers.'' President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law, noting  that CBRA adopts a ``sensible approach'' to conservation that also  saves taxpayer dollars. CBRA has continued to enjoy strong bipartisan  support in subsequent improvements, map enactments, and  reauthorizations in 1988, 1990, 2000, 2006, and 2018.   The areas protected under CBRA are identified in official maps that  must be authorized by Congress and have not been comprehensively  revised since 1990. The 1990s-era maps were created using now- antiquated mapping techniques and, as a result, are imprecise,  difficult to apply in practice, and contain errors that impact property  owners and project proponents. Congress has recognized this problem and  directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to undergo a yearslong  modernization process to recommend updates to these maps. In 2013, the  Fish and Wildlife Service received supplemental appropriations related  to Hurricane Sandy in order to modernize CBRS maps, resulting in  extensive recommended revisions along the Mid-Atlantic and New England  coasts.   The Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2023 adopts the  comprehensively revised maps prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service for 187 updated CBRS maps and 11 new maps, including maps  prepared through the Hurricane Sandy Remapping Project and other  technical correction reviews. Enacting this legislation will provide  critical modernization of CBRA implementation, in addition to making  other improvements and technical corrections in CBRA.   With that said, I would like to reiterate my gratitude to Senators  Graham, Whitehouse, and Tillis, who have been indispensable partners in  the development of the Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2023. I  look forward to continuing to work with them and our colleagues in the  House to pass S. 2958 and enact it into law.                            ____________________
