 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 5037, which is a tribute to my predecessor, friend, and mentor,  Congressman Walter B. Jones. Sadly, he passed away while serving  diligently in his office nearly a year ago.   This legislation would designate the post office in his hometown of  Farmville, North Carolina, as the Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office.   He was the son of Walter B. Jones, Sr., and Doris Long. A devoted  public servant, a man of great faith, and a proud American, Walter put  the people and the needs of North Carolina's Third District first.   I knew Walter first as a patient, who then became a dear friend and  then became a political mentor. His passing was a loss for our State,  our Nation, and for all who knew him and loved him.   In part due to his own service in the military, Walter cared deeply  about the brave men and women who served our country. After attending  Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia, Walter graduated from Atlantic  Christian College in 1966 and went on to serve in the North Carolina  National Guard for 4 years.   After serving for 10 years in the North Carolina House, he was  elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1995, where he  would spend the remaining 24 years of his life diligently serving the  people of North Carolina's Third Congressional District.    He worked tirelessly to ensure that he was always available to his  constituents and saw that they received assistance whenever they needed  it, particularly with the VA and healthcare benefits.  [[Page H831]]    Both in our Nation's Capitol and in eastern North Carolina, Walter  was known for his humility and kindheartedness. In fact, Walter was  voted the nicest Member of Congress in 2004 in a survey conducted by  the Washingtonian among top Capitol Hill staffers.   Of course, Walter was known for his vigorous support of our military  and particularly thousands of marines based in eastern North Carolina  at Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps air stations in Cherry Point as well  as New River, along with FRC East.   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, he began a letter- writing campaign, ultimately sending over 11,000 letters of condolences  to families and extended family members of fallen soldiers. Outside of  his office--and now my office--are hundreds of photos of those who have  fallen for the freedom of this Nation.   This was the kind of man he was: admirable, selfless, and caring.   Additionally, some of Walter's greatest achievements while serving in  Congress included the work to ensure autistic children of military  families received a proper education. He also advocated for the use of  hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat veterans with traumatic brain injury  and to protect the beautiful wild horses on Shackleford Banks and North  Carolina's beaches. He had compassion and respect for these beautiful  animals on the eastern shores.   Walter left behind a legacy that epitomized what we all should aspire  to be as a public servant. So it is my privilege to introduce this bill  honoring such a great American like Walter Jones.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the entire North Carolina  delegation for joining as original cosponsors of this piece of  legislation, and I urge Members to adopt H.R. 5037, which would  permanently name the post office after him in Farmville.                                time  1645
