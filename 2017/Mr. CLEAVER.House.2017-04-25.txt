 Mr. Speaker, while it is widely known that Horace  Peterson of Kansas City was the visionary and sole founder of the Black  Archives of Mid-America, it is little known who saved the institution  from vanishing years later.   During the spring of 1998, Ruby Arnold, a diehard board member, began  a personal crusade to secure a new home for the organization she held  dear. One Monday morning, during a heavy rainstorm, Ruby Arnold  appeared at the front desk of the 29th floor of city hall.   The security guard asked her if she had an appointment with anyone in  particular. ``I don't have an appointment,'' she said, ``but I have  come to see Mayor Emanuel Cleaver.''   The assistant to the mayor replied: I'm sorry, but the mayor is not  in.   A week later, Ruby came by again to see the mayor and waited two  hours for an appointment that she did not have to discuss a home for  the Black Archives.   And then, at a public event the next week, she asked again: Mayor,  have you found a place for the Black Archives?   Ruby Arnold died before the opening of the new archives in the summer  of 2010, but former mayor, Emanuel Cleaver, now the U.S. Representative  from the Fifth District, said this location for the Black Archives was  not secured by wishing or hoping but by the merciful harassment I  received from one determined Ruby Arnold. May God bless her remarkable  spirit.                            ____________________
