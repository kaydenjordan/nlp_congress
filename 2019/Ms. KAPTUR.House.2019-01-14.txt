 Madam Speaker, let's pay tribute to the thousands of  America's patriots going to work with no  [[Page H536]]  pay. It is wrong for the President to use his authority to harm our  Republic. Public service employees hold our country together.   Take this story shared by Micah Maziar, an air traffic controller  from Toledo, Ohio, who told his account of a new trainee struggling to  make ends meet. He is not being paid. After a full day's work, a full  shift in a very stress-filled job, the trainee reports to his apartment  complex to pick up trash as part of a deal with his landlord to offset  rent during this Trump shutdown. This is unacceptable.   The Commander in Chief holds our entire government hostage to his  harebrained notion that you can stop drug trafficking with a wall. The  drug traffickers must be laughing up a storm. They already dig tunnels  under the existing walls and fly over them, too.   To secure the border, our Nation needs thorough inspection of cargo.  We need enhanced electronic surveillance through drones. Most of all,  we need a President who understands you don't stop the drug trade by  furloughing border agents without pay.    For the hundreds of thousands of America's hardworking Federal  patriots and for the American people whom they serve, we must reopen  the government immediately.                            ____________________
