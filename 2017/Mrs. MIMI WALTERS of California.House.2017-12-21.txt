 Mr. Speaker, California is  experiencing the worst fire season in its history. Tragically, these  fires have taken 46 lives, including one of our brave Cal Fire  firefighters, Cory Iverson.   California has lost nearly 10,000 homes and structures since the  start of the October wildfires. The need for relief and assistance is  immediate.   Mr. Speaker, I support the swift passage of the Emergency Disaster  Aid Package, which includes legislation I introduced, the California  Wildfire Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2017.   These specific provisions will allow victims to deduct property  damages and access retirement funds without penalty, as well as  encourage charitable giving.   Passage of this bill will help mitigate the burden of these  devastating wildfires and allow people to begin rebuilding their lives.   Mr. Speaker, California faces a long road to recovery and rebuild  from this devastating fire season. I urge my colleagues to aid in that  recovery by voting for the Emergency Disaster Aid Package.
