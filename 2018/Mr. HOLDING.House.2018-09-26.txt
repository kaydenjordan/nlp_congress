 Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Florence devastated North  Carolina. Historic levels of rainfall have upended countless families  and destroyed crops, with flooding and debris strewn about unlike  anything our communities have ever witnessed. The $1.68 billion of  disaster relief in this legislation is a much-needed first step in  providing relief. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to provide for those in need.
