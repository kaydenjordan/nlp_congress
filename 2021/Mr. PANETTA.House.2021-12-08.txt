 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the bipartisan  CAROL Act and my good friend, Representative   Andy Barr, and so many  others in this Nation who either have valvular heart disease or have  lost loved ones to this disease.   The CAROL Act is necessary now more than ever, as each year 25,000  Americans lose their lives to this often hidden yet very deadly  deficiency of the human heart.    This legislation would help prevent those deaths by authorizing grant  programs at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute that will not  only bolster research on heart valve disease but also will help  identify those with this disease so that they can treat this disease  before it is too late.   On behalf of the very fruitful life lived by Carol Barr, on behalf of  the future fulfilled lives of Mary Clay and Eleanor Barr, I not only  support the CAROL Act, but I, and I urge my colleagues to, stand in  solidarity with   Andy Barr to give him our vote and the full strength  to fulfill Carol's legacy and to continue carrying the torch so that  those with this disease can continue living their lives to the fullest.
