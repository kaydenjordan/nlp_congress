 Mr. President, section 1301 of title XIII of the FY21  consolidated appropriations act delays implementation of reforms to the  U.S. Agency for Global Media outlined in section 1299Q of the William  M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2021. While the FY2021 NDAA has not yet been enacted and may be enacted  following the enactment of the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act,  Chairman Risch and I believe it is Congress's intent that these two  provisions be understood concurrently and that the reforms outlined in  section 1299Q be delayed for 90 days following enactment of the FY2021  NDAA.                            ____________________
