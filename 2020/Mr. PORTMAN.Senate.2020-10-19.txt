 Mr. President, I am glad we just voted down the motion  by the Democratic leader to adjourn because we have work to do here,  including the COVID-19 legislation that we need to be here to be  working on. So I am glad the motion to table was successful. And, yes,  we also have to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.                           Tribute to John Ruthven    Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to pay tribute to John  Ruthven, a beloved son of Ohio who passed away last week at the age of  95.   John Ruthven was a nationally recognized wildlife artist and a  naturalist whose extraordinary artistic skills earned him numerous  awards and other recognitions. But it was John's integrity, his  humility, his generosity, and personal warmth that led to so many  admirers.   John never met a stranger, and even in these strident times, John  never had an enemy. He was an eternal optimist who looked for the best  in people and in doing so, brought out the best in everyone.   John was a true son of Ohio who grew up in Cincinnati and, as a boy,  was often found fishing and hunting and sketching along the Ohio River.  He was a lifelong patriot who was very proud of his country and proud  of having served his country as an 18-year-old sailor during World War  II. He was generous of spirit and generous in giving back to his  community, contributing his time and artwork to literally hundreds of  good causes.   John loved his family--his kids, Ricki and Kevin; his grandsons, Adam  and Matt; and his great-grandsons, William, Jack, and Michael. He lost  the love of his life, Judy, just under a decade ago. They were  inseparable, and they are now together.   My wife Jane and I feel John's presence every day through his artwork  that hangs on our walls at home and at work. Here in my Washington, DC,  office, we displayed his painting ``Eagle to the Moon,'' for the past  decade, a masterpiece of natural painting signed not just by John but  also John's good friend, the famous astronaut Neil Armstrong.   Each Ruthven painting has its own story, and ``Eagle to the Moon'' is  no exception. Ohio Governor James Rhodes had commissioned John to paint  an eagle on the Moon in honor of the Apollo 11 mission and Neil  Armstrong's famous words, ``The eagle has landed.'' John told the  Governor there were no eagles on the Moon, and as a naturalist painter,  he refused to place one there. Governor Rhodes insisted, so John-- always a peacemaker--found a compromise. He painted a majestic bald  eagle flying past an Ohio buckeye tree--tying the eagle, therefore, to  the Earth and to Ohio--and put a glowing Moon in the background to  please Governor Rhodes. The Governor could not say no to such a  beautiful portrayal, and it is beautiful.   His paintings are displayed in the statehouse in Columbus and in  thousands of offices and living rooms all across Ohio and beyond. You  will see his work when strolling through my hometown of Cincinnati,  where the side of a downtown building displays a three-story high mural  dedicated to Martha, the last passenger pigeon who died at the  Cincinnati Zoo. At age 88, high on a rickety scaffolding in the August  heat, John Ruthven led the volunteers in creating that rendition of  passenger pigeons, taking it from one of  [[Page S6059]]  his paintings. Those passenger pigeons, once numerous and now extinct,  are soaring through the air in a thick flock, warning us all of the  fragility of nature.   I will always feel John's presence personally when I am in the woods  of Southern Ohio, where I had the privilege of spending many hours with  him hunting for edible wild mushrooms, hunting turkeys, and learning  from an accomplished naturalist who had stories about every single  tree, flower, and bird. It was a joy to learn from John. It wasn't a  lecture; like every good teacher, John drew you in.   John was called a modern-day James Audubon, and there were striking  similarities between the two. Both were naturalists, good hunters,  artists, and authors whose work was influential in teaching us about  the natural world. Like Audubon, John was rightly recognized as one of  the most important ambassadors for nature of his time.   Starting with his delivery of a hummingbird to the Cincinnati Museum  of Natural History at age 10, his name is on specimens he collected  around the world and donated to museums. Four Presidents commissioned  painters from John Ruthven, and his artwork is hung in the galleries of  the Smithsonian and right here in the Halls of Congress.   Early in his career, John had the great honor of being selected as  the artist for the annual Federal duck stamp. He has been featured in  many major magazines and documentaries. He received numerous awards and  honors, including from some of his favorite organizations like the  Cincinnati Zoo, the Cincinnati Nature Center, the Museum Center, and so  many others.   One accolade John was most proud of was when he and his wife Judy  were inducted into the Brown County Hall of Fame. Judy and John had a  beautiful farm and an art gallery in Brown County, 50 miles east of  Cincinnati. They developed lifelong friendships there and dedicated  time and energy to their adopted home, leading to the restoration of  the historic courthouse in Georgetown, OH, and preserving and promoting  the boyhood home of Ulysses S. Grant, one of John's heroes.   In 2004, I was with John and President George W. Bush at the White  House when he became the first wildlife artist ever to receive the  National Medal of the Arts, the highest honor that can be bestowed upon  an artist.   Until his death, John continued to paint every day at his home  studio. He still had a number of commissions he was working on. For  countless young artists and lovers of nature, he was and will continue  to be a true inspiration.   As we mourn our loss, we take heart in knowing that we will all  continue to feel his presence, that John Ruthven will live on through  his masterful artwork, his loving family, and all he did to advance the  cause of appreciating and protecting the natural world.
