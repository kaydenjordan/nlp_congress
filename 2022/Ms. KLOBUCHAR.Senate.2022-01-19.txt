 Mr. President, I am here on this momentous day for our  country, and I would like to address some of the remarks from my friend  and neighbor from the State of South Dakota. I hope he will stay for my  remarks.   What is the Senate about? That is what Senator Thune was just  addressing. What is the Senate about? We come here to represent the  people of our States, and we come here to make decisions and to vote. I  don't think anyone in our States wants us to come here and hug an  archaic tradition and then simply stop votes, stop debates; hug that  tradition tight and then throw the voters under the desk and go home  and raise money; because, basically, that is what this tradition has  turned into.   I believe what our Founding Fathers wanted when it became clear that  this country was forming, they wanted to have a Senate that worked. And  when you go back and look, there is no mention about filibuster in the  Constitution. There is no mention of 60 votes. There is no mention of  cloture. Rules developed over time. And believe it or not, to my friend  from South Dakota, those rules changed with the times. In the words of  Senator Byrd, someone who believed in the traditions of this place, the  rules change with the circumstances. And in the words of our  Constitution, which the Senator from South Dakota failed to mention,  ``The Times, Places and Manner of . . . Elections''--well, this is what  it says: ``Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such  Regulations.''   That is what it says. It was very, very clear, at the beginning of  this country, that it was anticipated that the Congress would have a  role in these elections. Why? Because they are Federal elections.   And now before us--before us--is the freedom to vote, something that  has been a long and hard fought battle in our country's history. And  today we continue that march toward justice in the Senate because we  face a coordinated and relentless campaign to limit Americans'  constitutional right to vote.   As President Biden said last week--I was honored to be there with him  and Vice President Harris in Atlanta. As he said, ``This is the test of  our time.''   There are moments in the life of our Nation, like when a bomb blew up  the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham and four little girls were  murdered; like when John Lewis and so many others were bloodied as they  crossed that bridge in Selma--there are moments in time when things  stand still.   And make no mistake, our country is at one of those moments right  now. It is no coincidence that after more Americans voted than in the  history of this country in the 2020 election, that suddenly there was a  slew--a flood--of State election laws meant to suppress the votes of  Americans.   It is not, as the minority leader just described, a fake panic. A  fake panic? Let's see what is fake about this. What is fake about this  law that passed in Georgia, where, suddenly, when 70,000 people  registered to vote during the runoff period--I would say to the  minority leader if he were here, when 70,000 people registered to vote  during the runoff period--they changed that law. They reduced the time  of the runoff period. They make it so no one can register during that  time. In Montana, 8,000 people availed themselves of  [[Page S284]]  same-day registration in the last election by either changing their  address because they moved or registering for the first time. What did  they do? That is it. That is not going to happen, even though it has  been in place for 15 years, long before the pandemic.   That is not fake. There is nothing about that that is fake.   And when I think about the moment in time we are in now, I look back  to that moment when Senator Blunt and I and Vice President Pence--the  last ones remaining in this Chamber, with two young women holding the  mahogany box with the last of the electoral ballots through W, Wyoming.  At 3:30 in the morning, as we took that long walk over to the House of  Representatives--that walk that had been so joyful just that  morning. That glass, broken on the sides of that wall, that was not  fake. The statues covered in spray paint, that was not fake. That was  real--just as real as the fact that over 440 bills, since that fateful  day, have been introduced to restrict voting, and 30 of these bills  have been signed into law in 19 States. What is happening in States  like Florida, Georgia, and Texas, with their omnibus bills, that is  very real.    The voters--they know it is real. Last summer, when we took the Rules  Committee on a field hearing--joined by Senator Ossoff, who is a member  of the committee, and Senator Reverend Warnock, who has taken on this  torch in his State and across the country--we met a veteran, living in  central Georgia. He told us how he took his older neighbors to vote  early, but they had to give up and go home after seeing the line  wrapped around the block, and when he later went back to vote, he had  to wait, himself, for 3 hours in the hot Sun.   That is not fake, I say to the minority leader. That is real.   This guy is a veteran. He served in the Air Force during Operation  Desert Storm. When I asked him if he had to wait in line when he signed  up to serve, he said no. But when he came home and wanted to vote in an  election in the United States of America, he had to wait in the hot Sun  hour after hour, after hour.   When the minority leader said that no American deserved to have his  voice silenced, as he just said in this Chamber--those long lines, one  ballot box in the middle of Harris County, TX, with over 5 million  people, which would be like putting one ballot box in the middle of my  entire State--then what are those laws about? Silencing people. That is  what it is about.   When we were in Atlanta, we also heard from Helen Butler, a former  elections official for a rural county, who told us how she was ousted  by the Republicans in the State legislature after over a decade of  service, which the new law makes even easier to do by stripping power  away from local officials and, ultimately, putting it in the hands of  the State legislature. They are messing around, my friends, with the  very counting of the votes, with proposals made in Wisconsin, with  proposals made in other States.   One Montana woman, living on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, had  open heart surgery a week before the 2020 election and relied on a  Tribal assistance provider to return her ballot, but under another new  law, the assistance she received is now banned. These are real, and  these are real people.   It is voters who were made to stand in the rain, in homemade masks  and garbage bags, at the beginning of the pandemic, just to exercise  their right to vote. It is veterans standing in hot lines in the Sun in  Georgia. It is a voter in a wheelchair in Texas being forced to travel  3 hours and take 4 buses roundtrip to reach a ballot drop-off box. It  is a voter in Arizona being told that she didn't receive her mail-in  ballot for the State's primary because she had been marked as an  inactive voter even though she had just cast her ballot in the  Presidential primary.   It is five States--Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and  Texas--still telling over 30 million--30 million--Americans, registered  voters, that they cannot request a mail-in ballot during a pandemic  without an approved excuse. That is why it is on us, with the support  of the Constitution, to take action. As I noted at the beginning of my  remarks, it was, in fact, anticipated in the Constitution with that  clause that empowers Congress to make or alter rules for Federal  elections.   What does the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act do?   It sets basic Federal standards to ensure that Americans can  participate in the franchise. It guarantees at least 2 weeks of early  voting, like voters now have in two-thirds of States, including red  States. It provides for same-day registration, like they had for 15  years in Montana. It allows all voters to request a mail-in ballot,  without an excuse, and ensures voters do not need to provide witness  signatures or notarizations of notary publics, whom they would have to  hire, on mail-in ballots because, if you are in South Carolina right  now and you want to cast a mail-in ballot and you have COVID or you are  in a hospital, you have to have a witness sign off on that ballot. It  also makes your voters have access to drop boxes.   The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act would also include much needed  protections against those seeking to undermine our elections. Senator  Blunt and I held a bipartisan hearing this last year, and we found out  that nearly one in three local elections officials feels unsafe because  of the job, and nearly one in six has received threats of violence.   The Republican Kentucky secretary of state said that, if something  doesn't happen, they are not going to have enough people to work at  elections. Now, he didn't agree with what we were going to do, but he  did note that they no longer have enough volunteers to work their  polls.   A Republican Philadelphia city commissioner who did want to see  legislation passed, Al Schmidt, told us about the threats--he is no  longer in his job--he received as a result of his work of simply  counting the ballots. He told us--I see the Senator from Pennsylvania  here--that his family's names, his kids' names have been put out on the  internet as well as his address, a picture of his house, and a message,  saying: Tell the truth or your three kids will be fatally shot.   Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs told us she received a  message: I am a hunter, and I think you should be hunted.   These are not just 1-point examples. Over 9,000 Members of Congress  have received threats--double, triple. This is according to the Capitol  Police, in numbers that we have never seen before.   So, no, I say to the minority leader. This is not fake. This is not  one big fake. It calls for Federal action. Yes, I am disappointed that  four times our colleagues have voted down allowing us to go forward  with the Freedom to Vote Act or the John Lewis bill, which are now  combined into one. With the exception of Senator Murkowski, who did  allow for the debate to continue on one of the bills, the John Lewis  bill, no one stood up and joined us in allowing for a debate on these  bills--no one. So that is why we are here.    I say to Senator Thune: The reason we are looking to restore the  rules of the Senate is that there is no other way to move forward to  guarantee Americans the right to vote. In the past, this was  bipartisan. In 2006, the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized under  President George W. Bush by a vote of 98 to 0--98 to 0--but that is,  sadly, not where we are today.   When it comes to the rules of the Senate--and I am not going to  belabor this, as I see my friend Senator Merkley of Oregon, who is a  historical expert on all of this--I will say this: There are 160  exceptions--160 exceptions--to the filibuster rule. Things have been  changed to benefit my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  Somehow, it only took 51 votes to put in place the Trump tax cuts or  the Bush tax cuts. Somehow, it only took 51 votes to put Amy Coney  Barrett on the Supreme Court of the United States--a change by them,  made by them. Somehow, it only takes 51 votes to try to overturn a  regulation or to try to mess around with the Affordable Care Act.   But then, when it comes to something like voting rights, suddenly,  everyone on the other side of the aisle is hugging that filibuster  tight, knowing that, in so many times in history, including most  recently with the debt ceiling, changes have been made to allow a vote  with less than 60 votes: the National Gas Policy Act in 1977; in 1995,  the Endangered Species Act; in  [[Page S285]]  1996, a change to the reconciliation process--160 times.   And, as Representative Clyburn pointed out so well, there have been  times in our history when that most sacrosanct of rights has been  extended or defended--the right to vote--on a bipartisan basis, like  with the 15th Amendment. But we know, as he said, that that was a  single-party vote that gave Black people the right to vote, and that  fact does not make the 15th Amendment any less legitimate.   During the past week, so many in this Chamber celebrated the life of  Martin Luther King, but let us not forget what he stood for. He did not  stand for the filibuster. He didn't like it. As Reverend Warnock has  pointed out so many times, he stood for action and fairness and  freedom.   Last week, I met with Martin Luther King III and his wife and  daughter, who came to Washington to help us pass this legislation. They  told me that their daughter was born in 2008, the year that President  Obama was elected. They told me how the Supreme Court's Shelby County  decision was issued 5 years later, followed by Georgia's anti-voting  law, enacted just last year. How sad is it that, if we do not act,  their daughter--the granddaughter of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.--and  her classmates will face more obstacles in voting, in casting a ballot,  than the promise that they were born with? This cannot be the democracy  that our children inherit.   Dr. King once said--and I will paraphrase--that disappointment is  finite. I don't know how today is going to end, but if it ends without  this bill's passing, we will be much less of a country moving forward.  Yet I will keep this in mind, what he said: Disappointment is finite,  but hope is infinite.   The people of this country will not tolerate, as the minority leader  has said, the silencing of their voices. Truly, I think, by voting this  down, by not allowing us to even debate this to get to the conclusion  of a vote, that this is silencing the people of America--all in the  name of an archaic Senate rule that isn't even in the Constitution.  That is just wrong.   I yield the floor.    Thank you, Senator Wyden.   I want to thank you. Oregon was the first to use vote-by-mail for a  Federal election. Although, I think Senator Padilla, a great member of  the Rules Committee from California, would tell you, in fact, that  California and Washington first allowed any voter to request a mail-in  ballot in the 1970s.   But since then, what has happened? Utah, considered a red State by  all accounts has mail-in balloting for nearly all of their voters. We  have seen this across the country.   Today, 34 States allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot. During  the pandemic, 45 States actually allowed this to happen without an  excuse. What happened during the pandemic is that we saw 11 States that  didn't typically allow all voters to request a mail-in ballot do so.   Sadly, 10 of them have already started rolling this back for the next  election. We know that this is a really safe and good way to vote,  whether there is a pandemic or there isn't a pandemic. And the key is  voters got used to it, they liked it, and attempts to roll this back  and to make it harder to vote are the wrong way to go for our country.   And, instead, we should be assuring everyone that regardless of their  ZIP Code, regardless of their State, they should be able to vote by  mail.   Thank you for the question.    Madam Vice President, I rise today after hearing from  my friend Senator Blunt. I remember on January 6, as all of you do that  day, when he and I and Vice President Pence and two young women with  the mahogany box filled with the last of the ballots--up to Wyoming-- took that long walk through the shattered glass, the spray-painted  statues, and we did our jobs. I will be forever grateful for what he  did that night and what so many people in this Chamber did.   But, for me, it didn't end that night because, sadly, what wasn't  accomplished by the people who rifled through these desks and got up on  that dais, Madam Vice President; what wasn't accomplished with bear  spray; what wasn't accomplished with the bayonets--and I still remember  the blood on the officers' faces--sadly has continued on.   The votes that we took that night were important, but the votes that  the people of this country take in every election are just as  important. That is why, when you look at the Freedom to Vote: John R.  Lewis Act, you have to understand what it is grounded in, and that is  our belief in our democracy.   I want to thank every single Member of the Democratic caucus who has  worked so hard to agree on this bill. I will say the voting rights  groups, the Rules Committee--and I do differ from Senator Blunt on  this. We spent a lot of time making changes to that bill over the year.  We have made many changes in response to concerns from secretaries of  state and local election officials all across this country.   I also thank the Vice President and the President for your  leadership.   Since this country's founding when brave patriots rose up and  ultimately established a country in the name of ``we the people,''  America has been a shining beacon for the world, a touchstone for  democracy.   We travel the world as Senators, as Senators Shaheen and Portman and  I and several of our Democratic and Republican colleagues did just this  weekend. When we went to decry dictators and bullies who attempt to  undermine democracies, as Vladimir Putin is doing in Ukraine, we were  proud on that trip to wear lapel pins with the Ukrainian flag on one  side and the U.S. flag on the other. We are proud of our democracy, and  that democracy is fundamentally based on the freedom to vote.   Over the years, we made improvements to address wrongs that kept too  many Americans from joining in the rights on which our Nation was  founded. But for generation after generation, Americans have believed  truly in our country's founding promise. They fought for it, and they  died for it.   We are here today against that backdrop of history, at a time when  our democracy is facing a new wave of threat, a flood that has surged  up since the 2020 elections, when more Americans cast a ballot than  ever before as a pandemic raged. It is up to us to turn back that tide  and to preserve the right that lies at the bedrock of our system of  government.   Again, I disagree with Senator Blunt about what has been going on. I  look at the law that was passed in Montana that Senator Tester  described. That was set in place for 15 years for same-day registration  in the State of Montana--15 years. In the last election, 8,000 people  took advantage of it on election day, either newly registering to vote  or changing their address because they moved. It was just taken away  from them with what one court described for another law years ago in  North Carolina as ``surgical precision.''   You look at what our friends Senator Ossoff and Senator Warnock have  described has happened in Georgia, where 70,000 people registered  during that last week of the election in the runoff period--70,000  people in the last election. That has been stripped away, passed into  law that that cannot happen again.   The Founding Fathers knew that our democracy would face obstacles. A  lot of people have been quoting them. I will quote this one from Samuel  Adams. He said this:         The liberties of our country . . . are worth defending [at]       all hazards. And it is our duty to defend them against all       attacks.    When you have had over 9,000 threats against Members of Congress in  just  [[Page S339]]  the last year--double, triple what we have seen before--I don't see  that walk we took, that really important walk--that it all ended that  day. When you have local election officials across this country being  threatened and the names of their kids and their homes put out on the  internet, like the Republican local election official in Senator  Casey's home State of Pennsylvania--his house, his kids, with a threat  that said: ``Tell the Truth Or Your Three Kids Will Be Fatally Shot''-- it is on all of us to uphold and protect this democracy.   The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act meets the challenges before us  by establishing basic Federal standards for our election, restoring and  strengthening the Voting Rights Act, countering the power of secret  money in our politics, and taking on new threats to our elections to  ensure that every vote is properly counted.   And, again, let me read from the Constitution from article I, section  4. That clause empowers Congress to ``make or alter'' rules for Federal  elections ``at any time''--at any time.   As Senator Kaine noted, that is the only time that ``any time'' is  used in the Constitution, ``at any time.''   The word ``filibuster'' isn't in this document. The word ``cloture''  isn't in this document. But it was anticipated that Congress could and  should be involved in Federal elections when necessary.   What brought us to the point today? We are here in the midst of a  concerted effort to stop people from exercising the most fundamental  right in our democracy. Because, as Reverend Warnock has put so well,  ``some people don't want some people to vote.''   We are here because the people of this country know what is going on.  I am talking about a veteran in Georgia who didn't have to stand in  line to serve his country, but he had to--I met him myself. He had to  stand in line hours and hours and hours in the hot Sun just to cast a  ballot.   We are here because of those voters in Wisconsin who stood in the  rain, in homemade masks and garbage bags in the beginning of a  pandemic, just to exercise their right to vote. We are here because of  a voter in a wheelchair in Texas who traveled 3 hours on four buses  just to vote; a woman in Montana who had open-heart surgery, uncertain  about how to return her mail ballot; a former election official from a  rural county was ousted by Republicans in the Georgia Legislature after  a decade of service; and a 92-year-old woman who was purged from the  rolls after voting in every election for decades, since 1968.   We are here because after a record number of voters voted to make  their voices heard, there are people, sadly, who are working in every  State capitol to make sure it never happens again.   And I note that for every one of these laws that have passed in 19  different States, it has been with a simple majority, State by State by  State--a simple majority.   And then, as was noted by several of my colleagues, after this  Chamber has established over 160 carve-outs, 160 processes in law to  allow for a final vote without a 60-vote threshold--whether it is for  the debt ceiling, whether it is for the Bush tax cuts, whether it is  for the Trump tax cuts, whether it is for Justice Amy Coney Barrett--51  votes--now we hear, at this very moment, that we must embrace this  archaic rule that is not in the Constitution and did not exist when the  Senate was founded.   And we are not even talking about getting rid of this rule. We are  simply talking about restoring the Senate to what it once was so we can  have debates, and we can actually vote on bills when those debates have  concluded and when the speeches are exhausted.   We are here because we took an oath to defend the Constitution as we  did that night on January 6. We are here because we know that the eyes  of the world are on us, watching to see if America will stand up and  take on the challenges of our time.   To paraphrase Dr. King, whose legacy has been honored many, many  times today, while there may be finite disappointment in this country  for so many people every day, we must never lose infinite hope.   We are not losing it. That, my friends, is why we on the Democratic  side of the aisle are supporting this bill. With history's eyes on us  and with so much at stake, we must and we will fight on.   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.
