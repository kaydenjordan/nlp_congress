 Mr. Speaker, under the advice of my physician, due to a  bulging disk in my back, I could not get on a plane to return to  Washington to vote on H.R. 8015, the Delivering for America Act. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 179, ``nay''  on rollcall No. 180, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 181, and ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 182.
