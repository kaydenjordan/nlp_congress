 Mr. Speaker, this Wednesday, June 26, marks the 1-year  anniversary of the Supreme Court upholding President Trump's travel ban  which suspended the issuance of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas to  applicants from five Muslim-majority countries: Iran, Libya, Somalia,  Syria, and Yemen; plus Venezuela and North Korea.   In upholding the travel ban, the court indicated that by including  North Korea and Venezuela, the administration was not targeting only  Muslim countries. In addition, the administration was creating a  mechanism by which foreign nationals from those banned countries could  be issued a waiver to enter the United States if: one, the applicant  did not represent a security threat with their entry; or, two, if  denying entry would cause undue hardship.   One year later, we can evaluate whether the Trump administration has  honored the court ruling.   Mr. Speaker, from my experience with my constituents in Sacramento  County, the resounding answer is ``no.'' In my district, a young girl  named Omnia, who was born in Libya to an American mother and a Libyan  father, was separated from her family for 2 years because of the travel  ban.   Her mother, an American citizen, took Omnia, who was then 2 years  old, to the immigrant visa interview at the Embassy in Tunis, where the  interview was only minutes long with no questions. Instead, the  consular officer said the Embassy had all of the documents and  everything was in order, but they could not issue the visa for the 2- year-old. The consular officer told the mother, who was 7 months  pregnant at the time, to go back to the U.S. and have her baby, and  then come back when the travel ban was over.   The consular office did not reference the undue hardship exception  which was stipulated in the visa waiver process. I don't believe this  2-year-old was a security risk and separating a 2-year-old from their  mother clearly causes undue hardship, so I am not sure what that  process was.   There is also the disturbing case last year of a Yemeni mother who  fought to obtain a visa waiver to travel to California to see her  terminally ill son. It was only after widespread media coverage that  she was finally granted a visa waiver to visit the United States to see  her son just days before he passed away.   This story takes place over and over again in districts all across  this country. Thus, I have serious concerns about the waiver process,  how it is being implemented unevenly and with little guidance, and that  waivers granted are not leading to the issuance of visas for cleared  individuals.                                time  1215    My concern is further heightened due to the cases of constituents in  my district and across the country who are being negatively impacted by  confusing and uneven processes.   Now, in my role as chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations for the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I am aiming to  shed light on how the visa waiver process is being implemented. We have  asked--and the  [[Page H5043]]  State Department has not provided information to us that we have  requested--about how to gain a waiver, what is the process, and what is  the yes/no here.   I think I know why. It is because there isn't one, as countless  examples and stories have shown.   We have got to continue to shine a spotlight on the millions of  Americans whose lives have been thrown into chaos due to the  President's reckless and ill thought-through process. I, as an  American, am going to continue to fight on their behalf.                            ____________________
