 Mr. Speaker, as Congress reconvenes for the Second  Session of the 117th Congress, I want to take a moment to reflect on  the important achievements that the Democrats have made this past year.   The pandemic continues to be a challenge, but thanks to the funding  provided by the Democrats' American Rescue Plan Act, the vast majority  of Americans have been vaccinated and are protected from severe  illness, hospitalization, and death.   We must also acknowledge that the Democrats' commitment to building  back stronger and more equitably than before has resulted in  unprecedented economic recovery from the initial impact of the  pandemic.   Last month, the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent, the largest  calendar-year decrease in the unemployment rate in history. We reached  this rate 5 years before experts anticipated. That is the result of  adding 6.4 million jobs to the economy since President Biden took  office, regaining 84 percent of the jobs lost during the pandemic.   This economic boom was brought to you by President Biden and the  Democrats in Congress who voted for the American Rescue Plan.   The American Rescue Plan supercharged our economic recovery by  providing critical support to small businesses as they navigated the  pandemic. It expanded the child tax credit, which helped families put  food on the table and pay for childcare. It provided rent assistance so  families could keep their housing.   Now, the bipartisan infrastructure law is creating millions of good- paying jobs while rebuilding our Nation's crumbling infrastructure and  combating the climate crisis.   Through the American Rescue Plan and the bipartisan Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, Democrats have delivered for the American  people and created historic economic growth.   We have more important work to do. We must encourage the Senate to  pass the voting rights protections that we in the House passed months  ago that are critical to ensure that all citizens can exercise their  most precious right to vote.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to continue our  important work, building back stronger and more equitably than ever  before.                            ____________________
