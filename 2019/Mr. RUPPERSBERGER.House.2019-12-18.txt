 Madam Speaker, I spent 12 years on the House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, including 4 as ranking  member. My bipartisan cooperation with the Republican chairman was  widely recognized. When it comes to national security, there is no room  for bipartisan politics.   All 17 witnesses--mostly Trump appointees--told the same story during  the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearings, each  testifying that our Commander in Chief jeopardized American national  security for the sake of his reelection. The President held hostage  military aid for the fight against a common enemy, Russia.   He willfully obstructed Congress' constitutionally prescribed  impeachment powers.   Over the last 2 years, I resisted calls to begin impeachment  proceedings, and I resent those who say this is about reversing the  election. This isn't about whether or not you like Trump. It is about  upholding our Constitution.   Allowing this conduct to go unquestioned sets a dangerous precedent  and permanently damages our system of checks and balances. No one is  above the law. President Trump's actions are a clear threat to our  national security and democracy. We must uphold our oath of office and  support these articles.
