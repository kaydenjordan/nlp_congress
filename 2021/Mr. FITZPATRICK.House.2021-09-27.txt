 Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to  recognize Maxim Skripnik and the Gostomel Animal Shelter, an amazing  individual and an amazing organization.   The Gostomel Animal Shelter, located just outside of Kiev, Ukraine,  is serving homeless animals in Ukraine, both in Kiev and outside.   As the co-chair of the Ukraine Caucus here in Congress, Madam  Speaker, I recently visited that country, and one of my many stops was  at the Gostomel Shelter. This was originally established by the Kyiv  Society for the Protection of Animals. For the past 20 years, the  Gostomel Shelter has rescued abandoned animals off the streets of  Ukraine, nursed them back to health, and gave them a second chance at  life.   The shelter is operated by Maxim, who graciously gave me a tour of  the facility during my visit to Ukraine. Maxim has devoted his entire  life to providing care for these vulnerable animals.   Madam Speaker, there are an estimated 50,000 stray animals on the  streets of Ukraine. This poses a considerable risk to the welfare of  the animals and the overall public health of the community. The future  for the majority of these vulnerable and abandoned and animals is  bleak, but the Gostomel Shelter provides them with the opportunity to  find a loving forever home.   Since its inception, the Gostomel Shelter has advocated for their  animals and promoted humane methods of controlling the ever-growing  population of stray animals. Each victory, no matter how small, creates  an environment more accepting of these vulnerable animals and proves  that they can be rehabilitated and adopted into loving families.   The shelter, which is housed in a former cowshed, provides  safekeeping for up to 700 stray and abandoned dogs and cats. In 2006,  the shelter established a veterinary hospital and rehabilitation  center, which is now one of the largest in all of Ukraine. Here,  homeless animals are sterilized, after which they undergo compulsory  rehabilitation in a hospital and return to the shelter where they await  their forever homes.   Madam Speaker, the Gostomel Shelter, Maxim, and KSPA do not have  reliable sources of funding and permanent employees. They often rely on  public donations and volunteers to provide food and medicine to the  animals.   During my visit, I witnessed firsthand how Maxim and these volunteers  work tirelessly, literally around the clock, to ensure these innocent  animals have a second chance.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the incredible work being done by Maxim and  all the volunteers of the shelter. I paid a visit to the mayor of Kiev  to relay all of my experiences and the positive impact that Maxim and  those volunteers are making, and I wanted to formally recognize them  here in this Chamber.                            ____________________
