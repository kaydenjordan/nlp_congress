 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Chair, if drilling off Florida is the only thing that is going  to keep us from having high energy prices and a reliance on foreign  energy, I don't know why that hasn't happened yet. Right now, we are  not drilling off the coast of Florida, and we are energy dominant in  the world. We are not drilling off the coast of Florida, and we  continue to see energy prices dropping.   As my colleague Representative Castor said, 69 percent of Floridians  do not want to see drilling off our shores. Madam Chair, if you would  like to drill off the coast of Louisiana or South Carolina, I would say  have at it, but leave my beloved Florida alone.   There are many reasons to oppose drilling off Florida's shores: our  environment, our tourism economy, and our real property values. But I  come to the floor today to plead the case for northwest Florida's  military mission.   The Gulf of Mexico test range is one of the only places in the world  where we launch live-fire over water and land it on land. I cannot  believe that I have to come here to make the argument that it is an  incredibly stupid idea to launch experimental missiles over active oil  rigs. That would seem to be obvious to most people. I know it is  obvious to many in my district.   This military mission is what keeps us safe. It is ludicrous to  suggest that we have more to fear from LNG from Russia than we have  from a China that continues to close the technological capability edge  with our country. The Gulf test range is one of the places where we  will be testing hypersonic and supersonic weapons. If we do not  continue to maintain that advantage, everybody had better brush up on  their Mandarin because we won't be able to protect our country, and  that is the far more significant venture.   In Florida, we will protect our environment from the Congress. Please  don't do anything to harm us.
