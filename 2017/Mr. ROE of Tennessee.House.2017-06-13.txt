 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 1094.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 378,  I call up the bill (S. 1094) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  improve the accountability of employees of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day. You and many Members of this  body  [[Page H4890]]  are well aware that bringing real accountability to the Department of  Veterans Affairs has been a goal of mine and many of my colleagues for  many years. That is why I am proud to rise today to support S. 1094,  which passed the United States Senate last week via voice vote.   This bill is heavily modeled off of my bill, H.R. 1259, which passed  out of the House with bipartisan support earlier this Congress, and I  am proud to have worked with Senators Isakson, Tester, and Rubio to  craft this vital piece of legislation.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection Act of 2017 would provide the Secretary of the Department of  Veterans Affairs with yet another tool to instill accountability at VA  by giving him the authority to expeditiously remove, demote, or suspend  any VA employee for poor performance or misconduct while still  preserving an employee's rights to due process.   This bill would create an expedited procedure for all VA employees to  respond and appeal to proposed removals, demotions, and suspensions for  performance or misconduct, or in the case of title 38 employees, which  are our healthcare providers, for a question involving direct patient  care or clinical competence.   The prenotification and response process would have to be completed  within 15 business days, and the employee would be entitled to an  expedited appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board where the first  step at the administrative judge level would be limited to 180 days.   Additionally, either party would be able to appeal the administrative  judge's decision to the full MSPB and would be provided the opportunity  for limited judicial review.   This bill would also provide improved protections for whistleblowers  by creating a new office and an Assistant Secretary position  specifically for accountability and whistleblowers. It would allow the  Secretary to reduce an employee's Federal pension if they are convicted  of a felony that influenced their job at VA. It would provide the  Secretary with the authority to recoup a bonus provided to an employee  who engaged in misconduct or malfeasance prior to receiving the bonus,  and would allow the Secretary to recoup any relocation expenses that  were authorized for a VA employee only through the employee's ill- gotten means, such as fraud, waste, or malfeasance.   Lastly, it would also provide the Secretary with the direct hiring  authority he has been asking for so that he can hire medical center  directors and VISN directors in a more expedited manner and fill the  leadership vacancies across VA.   Mr. Speaker, as I have always said, I agree with all of my colleagues  that the vast majority of VA employees--many of whom I know personally  and call friends--are hardworking public servants who are dedicated to  providing quality healthcare and benefits for veterans.   But for far too long, the failures of bad actors have tarnished the  good name of all VA employees. Unfortunately, despite the tireless  efforts of our courageous whistleblowers, the extensive reporting on a  lack of accountability by the media and the outrage of the American  public, we still see far too many instances of VA employees not living  up to the standards America expects. Most importantly, they are not  living up to the standards that the men and women who have served this  great Nation deserve.   This isn't a political issue. This is a veterans' issue. I can't  imagine how any Member of this body can defend not standing for  veterans to vote for this bipartisan legislation. The lack of  accountability isn't specific to any one area of the Department. It is  systemic. In the last few years, the committee discovered an instance  of a VA nurse scrubbing in drunk for a veteran's surgery--I found that  unbelievable--and a care support specialist in the agency's drug and  addiction program taking a recovering addict to a crack house to buy  him drugs and a prostitute, a VA medical center clerk participating in  an armed robbery, and a practitioner watching pornography at work while  they were supposedly treating a patient.   What is more, it has been proven that some senior managers have  retaliated against whistleblowers, costing VA and, in turn, taxpayers  hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution.    All of these acts in and of themselves are egregious, but they are  just the tip of the iceberg. They have one thing in common: none of  these employees were held accountable in a reasonable timeframe, if at  all.   There are many factors that contribute to this failure, but an  antiquated civil service system and a complicated grievance process  have left VA unwilling--and sometimes just unable--to jump through the  many hoops to do what is right. This is not an issue unique to VA. Too  often it is nearly impossible to remove a poorly performing government  employee.   Officials on both sides of the aisle have expressed their concern  about the current process to remove or discipline subpar employees.  Just last year, Mr. Speaker, VA's then-Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson  sat before our committee and admitted that it was too difficult to fire  a substandard VA employee.   Further, the Government Accountability Office studied the  government's ability to hold low-performing employees accountable and  found that it took 6 months to a year on average, and sometimes  significantly longer, to fire a poorly performing government employee-- 6 months to a year.   I have heard concerns that the bill will hurt the Department's  ability to recruit and retain good employees. I don't buy this argument  as every employee I speak to tells me the exact opposite.   Good employees want to work in an environment where they know  everyone can be held accountable for their actions. I believe the  current status quo hurts the morale of the employees who are doing the  right thing each and every day.   This is the same for employees of the Department who are veterans. I  know that some have said that this would hurt veterans who are employed  at the VA since they make up a large percentage of our VA employees.  But as a veteran myself and as my fellow veterans here today would  agree, we don't serve, whether in uniform or civilian clothes, because  we prioritize our individual protection. The mission always comes  first, and at VA, the mission is our veterans.                                time  1445    Veterans want to work alongside colleagues they know are working hard  for the men and women who they served alongside.   Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to acknowledge some individuals  who have made this bill become a reality.   First and foremost, I want to thank the 18 veterans groups  representing millions of veterans and their families who are supporting  this bill and real accountability at the VA. Many of them are in the  gallery today, and I can't thank them enough for all they have done and  all they continue to do for our Nation's heroes.   Many of these groups took a courageous stand in support of VA  accountability, even when it wasn't a politically popular idea. And I  especially want to thank Concerned Veterans for America, The American  Legion, and Paralyzed Veterans of America for being some of our  earliest and staunchest supporters.   I also want to thank someone who, this Congress, has been with us  from day one, and that is the Secretary of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin. We have worked with Secretary Shulkin and  his team to draft the bill that is before us today, and I am thankful  for his and President Trump's support.   President Trump and Secretary Shulkin have endorsed this legislation,  not because they want to punish or make it harder to recruit employees,  but because they see this change is needed if the Secretary is going to  meet the President's goal of truly reforming the VA.   I also want to thank the bipartisan group of Senators who we worked  with in crafting this bill, including Senator Isakson; Senator Tester;  and the primary sponsor, Senator Rubio. Senator Rubio and his staff  have been with me every step of the way, and I am thankful for his and  his staff's efforts over the years.   I also want to thank a good friend of mine, Ranking Member Walz, and  his staff for their support and leadership.  [[Page H4891]]  They have been fantastic. I also want to thank Speaker Ryan and  Majority Leader McCarthy and their staffs for helping us bring this  bill to the floor.   Lastly, I would like to single out former Veterans' Affairs Committee  Chairman Jeff Miller, a good friend, great leader of this committee,  and my chairman for 6 years. His leadership got the ball rolling on  this issue, which led to House-passed legislation twice last Congress  and kept the spotlight on accountability issues at VA through his  dogged oversight.   Finally, I would like to thank my staff, and especially the  professional and communications staff of the House Committee on  Veterans' Affairs, for their years of hard work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, today, we have a bipartisan, bicameral bill that makes  meaningful change to VA's civil service system, while maintaining due  process rights.   Today, we have the opportunity to make real and lasting changes to a  broken system.   Today, we can stand together with veterans against the status quo  that has failed them for far too long. They deserve better.   I hope all of you will join me, and the 18 veterans organizations  that support this legislation, to do what is right and send this bill  to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California  (Mr. Takano) for his support.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), my  good friend and vice chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), an Army and Marine veteran  deployed to Iraq.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), my good friend and a member of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Dunn), a veteran and a member of the committee, to  speak on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington), chairman of the Economic Opportunity  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), a member of our committee and,  for many years, who was in the process of protecting us in law  enforcement.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee chair and a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman  [[Page H4895]]  from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon), a new member of our committee,  who is doing a great job.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, since the day I was  elected to Congress, I pledged to do everything in my power to help  veterans receive the care and attention they deserve. S. 1094 will  ensure that persons hired to care for the health and the well-being of  our veterans do so according to VA regulations, and those who fail in  their duties are held accountable. Moreover, this bill protects  whistleblowers from retaliation when they alarm us of VA misconduct.   Currently, Puerto Rico has one VA regional benefit office, one VA  hospital, and a few outpatient clinics. These facilities provide all  the VA services to the island's veterans. This bill will help ensure  places with limited VA facilities, like Puerto Rico, will be  efficiently administered and make certain that the VA's employees  adhere to the standards of excellence that our men and women in uniform  expect.   I thank Senator Rubio for sponsoring this bill, but I need to thank  Chairman Roe for guiding this important legislation on the House floor  the same way he did with H.R. 1529.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Indiana (Mr. Messer), my good friend who I have served with for 6  years on the Education and the Workforce Comittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Mast), a combat-wounded veteran, Bronze Star winner,  Purple Heart winner, Defense Meritorious Service and Army Commendation  Medal winner.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Mast for those  kind words and words spoken for every American veteran.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick).                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today is a proud day, I think, for this Nation. The United States of  America does more for its veterans than all other nations in the world  combined; and I don't think that, on some days, that is even enough for  these heroes that have served us and many of whom have spoken this  afternoon.   I want to express my appreciation to the minority and the majority  staff, and to Sergeant Major Walz for walking hand in hand. As he said,  this was not an easy process. There were a lot of difficult issues that  we both dealt with.   I also want to thank our friends on the Senate side who also went  through the same process and brought a bill to the floor that we can  all, I think, enthusiastically support.   The Secretary said when he was first chosen--and I might add, 100-0,  Secretary Shulkin was a bipartisan agreement in the Senate. I think he  is a leader to transform the VA. He asked for accountability. He said:  I cannot do my job as Secretary if I don't have this piece of  legislation.   So he was very supportive, along with President Trump, so we gave him  that.   We also protected due process rights for the employees who work for  the VA--a very important issue.   Whistleblower protections. We could not do our job, Mr. Speaker, if  we did not have these whistleblowers. There are 350,000 employees, 154  medical centers, and over 800 outpatient clinics. There is no way that  we could monitor that without their help. So their protections are  there.   Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage both sides of the aisle to support  S. 1094, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Walker for yielding.   I would like to associate my remarks with Mr. Hudson, Dr. Wenstrup,  Mr. Franks, and my good friend Diane Black.   I am a concealed carry permit holder--full disclosure--and what Mr.  Franks said: I am an OB/GYN doctor by training. I have delivered 5,000  babies in my lifetime, and every single one of them I view as valuable.  I have watched these young people that I have delivered grow up and  become very productive citizens not only in my community, but around  the country.   Mr. Speaker, 44 years ago, I was a young soldier in southeast Asia.  When we came home from the military, we were advised not to wear our  uniforms when we traveled because of basically what was going on in the  country: the opposition to the Vietnam war. That left a very deep,  indelible mark on me, and I thought that is no way we should be  treating our men and women who protected us and gave us the freedoms  that we have and live by to this day.   When I got the privilege of being elected--when I retired from my  medical practice in northeast Tennessee and ran for Congress and was  fortunate enough to win--I was asked to be on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, which I have served on for the past 8 years.   We know that 3 years ago there was a scandal in Phoenix, Arizona.  Then we realized it was not just Phoenix, Arizona. It was all across  the country where veterans were not being served, and, actually,  veterans were dying while they were waiting for care at a VA. That is  as wrong as it gets.   So, what we elected to do in our committee, when we discovered this,  was to try to get some legislation up that actually did something about  this. And one of the things that touched me--I watched late into the  evening, like many of you all probably around the country and in this  gallery watched--was the election results. It was around 3 or 3:30 in  the morning when then President-elect Trump gave his election speech.   Very shortly into it, not a minute or two into that speech, he  mentioned our veterans. And it really, really encouraged me because I  think he is an administration that is very sincere in improving care.   And, Mr. Speaker, it is not money. When I came here in 2009, you, the  taxpayers, were spending about $97 billion on VA care, on benefits, and  on cemeteries. Today, that number is going to be $186 billion. We have  gone from 260,000 employees in the VA to over 360,000 employees. There  is enough money and personnel to take care of the problems.   When the President was sworn in and he selected his Secretary of the  VA, Dr. David Shulkin--I believe is now the man for the job--he was  approved 100-0 by the Senate. Dr. Shulkin said: The first thing I need  is accountability legislation that allows me to terminate bad  employees.   At the VA, the vast majority--and many of them are personal friends  of mine that I have worked with in healthcare--are good people taking  the very best care they can of veterans. But there are some bad apples  there, and they cannot be terminated. It almost could not happen, Mr.  Speaker.   So what this legislation does is it protects the whistleblowers who  call these people out. It provides due process rights for employees so  that they don't have those trampled on, but it allows the Secretary  to terminate these bad apples and, hopefully, improve the morale of the  entire VA. This is only phase one.    We also have passed out of this body and over to the Senate--I want  to thank our Senate colleagues, Senator Isakson; Senator Rubio, who is  a lead sponsor in the Senate; and Senator Tester, the minority leader.  I also want to thank the minority leader on our side of the aisle,  Sergeant Major Walz, who worked hand in hand. This was a bipartisan  bill, which is how legislation should be passed. We passed it in the  House and it went to the Senate. They reformed the bill. It came back,  and we now await the President's signature.   We are also doing repeals reform. We passed that out of here. We  have, now, 470,000 backlog claims of veterans waiting for their  appeals. Hopefully, we are going to address this problem.   The Secretary, we have just extended the Choice Program for veterans  who want to choose care outside of the VA, and also a new electronic  health system. So we have a lot of work to do.   It is a true privilege to do what I get to do, which is to help the  21 million men and women who have served this country, who allow us to  be free.   I thank the gentleman for the privilege to be down here tonight to  share this with the American people.                                time  1730
