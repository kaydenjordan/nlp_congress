 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Appropriations Committee is  reportedly preparing to announce the return of earmarks. That is a  process that, around here, we know. People back home might not know, so  let me explain that the process of earmarks inserts individual projects  designated for specific interests into a bill, most often an  appropriations bill. When I say ``individual projects,'' it means  Senators doing it for probably their district or their State.   Earmarks are a practice that has become a symbol to the American  people of the waste and out-of-control spending in Washington. I am  strongly against the return of earmarks.   The earmark moratorium was implemented as a direct result of the  events leading up to the election of 2010, and there was clearly a  mandate coming from that 2010 election to do away with earmarks. So  people sometimes think, through the elections or through contacting  Congress, they don't have an impact. In this case, it had a very  dramatic impact that has lasted at least until now, and hopefully it  will last longer.   The American people spoke because they were worried at that time  about the country's growing Federal deficit and ballooning public  debt--something we aren't as concerned about now as we were then and we  ought to be concerned about more so now because the debt has more than  doubled during that period of time.   At that time, back in 2010, the debt was estimated to be 62 percent  of gross domestic product.   In 2009, President Obama and congressional Democrats passed a $787  billion stimulus bill that was filled with wasteful spending, special  projects, and unauthorized programs that completely violated the rules  of the road for responsible governance.   In September 2010--so at the time of the election I am talking  about--in a Rasmussen poll, 61 percent of U.S. voters said cutting  government spending and deficits would do more to create jobs than  President Obama's proposed $50 billion infrastructure program. It was  pretty evident, then, from people's opinion at that time, that the  election of 2010 sent a clear message that the American people wanted  Congress to stop wasteful spending. So it didn't take long for  President Obama to get the message. He had a weekly address on November  13, 2010, calling upon Congress to stop earmarks. He said: ``Given the  deficits that have mounted over the past decade, we can't afford to  make these investments''--in things like infrastructure, education,  research, and development--``unless we are willing to cut what we don't  need.''   Now, I am going to give you a further Obama quote, and it is a fairly  long one, but it is coming from a Democratic President.         I agree with those Republican and Democratic members of       Congress who've recently said that in these challenging days,       we can't afford what are called earmarks. Those are items       inserted into spending bills by members of Congress without       adequate review.        Now, some of these earmarks support worthy projects in our       local communities. But many others do not. We cannot afford       Bridges to Nowhere like the one that was planned a few years       back in Alaska. Earmarks like these represent a relatively       small portion of overall federal spending. But when it comes       to signaling our commitment to fiscal responsibility,       addressing them would have an important impact.        We have a chance to not only shine a light on a bad       Washington habit that wastes billions of taxpayer dollars,       but take a step towards restoring public trust. We have a       chance to advance the interests not of Republicans or       Democrats, but of the American people; to put our country on       a path of fiscal discipline and responsibility that will lead       to a brighter economic future for all. And that's a future I       hope that we can reach across party lines to build together.    Remember, President Obama said in 2010 that earmarks are bad. Unlike  2020--today we are in even more dismal fiscal shape with even larger  Federal deficits and a ballooning Federal debt. According to the  Congressional Budget Office, the Federal debt held by the public stood  at 100 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2020 and is projected  to reach 102 percent of GDP at the end of 2021.   In other words, even though we have the largest economy in the world,  we owe more than the entire U.S. economy is producing in a year. If we  stay on this course, CBO projects that by 2031, debt will equal 107  percent of GDP, the highest in the Nation's history.   America cannot afford to go back to including earmarks in some ill- conceived effort to grease the wheels to pass legislation only because  it includes the pet projects of Members of Congress.   While a small part of the budget--and I would have to admit, earmarks  are a small part of the budget--earmarks can cause Members of Congress  to focus on projects for their districts or States instead of holding  government accountable and being fiscally responsible.   Congress should follow regular order by authorizing funding for  programs  [[Page S915]]  with very specific criteria. Legislation, including funding bills,  should be passed on its merits, not on whether an earmark is included.   Dr. Tom Coburn, former Senator from Oklahoma, said:         Earmarks are the gateway drug to . . . spending addiction.    There is an insatiable appetite for projects, and this leads to large  bills weighed down with spending our country can ill afford, whether we  are talking about appropriations or authorization bills.   A Congressional Research Service--CRS, as we know it--study showed  that from 1994 to 2011, there was a 282-percent jump in earmarks in  appropriations bills. In the fiscal year 1994 appropriations bill,  there were 4,155, and--can you believe this?--by 2011, that number for  earmarks had risen to 15,887. Also according to the CRS, the total  value of earmarked funds increased from about $35 billion for 6,000  earmarks in 2000 to over $72 billion for nearly 16,000 earmarks in  2006.   Earmarks get out of control when there is no effective check on total  spending, while at the same time, earmarks lead to overspending.  Committee chairmen kindly say to the Members who have earmarks in bills  or who want earmarks in bills: Are you going to vote for this  appropriations bill if we put your earmark in? That sort of thing  should never be a determination whether or not a Member votes for an  appropriations bill.   So you shouldn't feel pressured to support a vicious cycle of  increased spending on bad legislation just because it includes  earmarks, especially in this time of the pandemic. Congress should be  focused on targeted spending to continue to help the American people  who are suffering to recover, not finding ways to load up a bill with  sweeteners that may be problematic on their own.   According to a 2016 Economist/YouGov poll, 63 percent of Americans  approve the ban on earmarks; only 12 percent disapproved.   This quote by Citizens Against Government Waste President Tom Schatz  to this publication, Just the News, makes a strong argument for not  lifting the earmark ban. He said:         Earmarks are the most corrupt, costly, and inequitable       practice in the history of Congress. They led to members,       staff, and lobbyists being incarcerated.    You know, there are people who went to jail because of how some of  this stuff was handled. In the form of legalized bribery, Members of  Congress vote for tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in  appropriations bills in return for a few million dollars in earmarks  for their State or congressional district.   Earmarks go to those in power, as shown during the 111th Congress  when the 81 members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees,  who constituted 15 percent of Congress, got 51 percent of the earmarks  and 61 percent of the money. Restoring earmarks will lead to the same  result.   I have heard the argument that earmarks are needed to pass bills in a  bipartisan manner. I have consistently been ranked among the most  bipartisan Senators by the Georgetown University Lugar Center. Check it  out for yourself. I know from experience that true bipartisanship  doesn't come from voting for legislation that I might otherwise have  concerns about because an earmark or a pet project is included in the  bill. True bipartisanship comes from reaching out across the aisle to  reach consensus, even when there are disagreements on other issues, to  really get things done for the American people.   President Biden, in his inaugural speech, called for ``Bringing  Americans together. Uniting our people. And uniting our nation.'' He  also recognized that Americans have serious disagreements. Everyone  knows that our country is deeply divided politically. I know from his  time in the Senate that President Biden understands that people of good  will can have honest disagreements about policy, so he knows that unity  does not mean dropping deeply held beliefs and accepting his policy  agenda. He said:         Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total       war.        Disagreements must not lead to disunion.    Real unity requires true bipartisanship and working together to  discover what binds us together as Americans, even when we strongly  disagree politically. Earmarks are not a way to bring this unity, and,  in fact, would make this unity more difficult by attempting to paper  over fundamental disagreements with window dressing while bypassing the  real work of compromise.   Now, in a similar vein, some people argue that earmarks are needed to  help pass bills in a timely manner. In 2006, at the height of earmark  spending in appropriations bills, only two appropriations bills passed  on time. In the 10 years prior to the earmark ban, Congress never  enacted more than four standalone appropriations bills on time.   This holds true for reauthorization bills as well. Most, then, as you  know the practice is, we just simply extend them for 1 fiscal year at a  time.   In the case of the past several highway reauthorization bills, which  were notorious for earmarks before the earmark moratorium, all needed  multiple extensions before they were signed into law.   I have also heard the argument that article I of the Constitution  says that Congress holds the power of the purse and that Congress has  ceded its own power without earmarks. I agree that Congress now cedes  its own power but not by not having earmarks. Rather, Congress cedes  its power by failing to follow the budget process and stick to a  budget.   Now, the greatest sin: Congress can be fairly accused of lazy  legislation by drafting vague provisions granting authority to Agency  heads to work out the details, and most of those details are worked out  through massive regulation writing.   Congress can reclaim its legislative authority by including specific  guidelines for implementing programs in both authorization and  appropriations bills. Congress should regularly review Federal programs  to ensure that funding criteria reflect the needs of the Americans and  engage in robust oversight of Departments and Agencies to ensure  congressional intent is met. Rigorous oversight and well-drafted  legislation that clearly sets out congressional intent for how a  program should be administered is the constitutional job of Congress.   A good example of Congress not keeping the power of the purse and  delegating significant authority to unelected bureaucrats at the  programmatic level is the Affordable Care Act, sometimes called  ObamaCare, which was rammed through Congress on a party-line vote. The  text was around 2,700 pages long, but the regulatory implementation of  ObamaCare required well over 20,000 pages. That is a bad way to  implement public policy, particularly considering that the law  redirected one-fifth of the U.S. economy.   On top of the law are tens of thousands of pages of Federal rules and  regulations administered by a score of Federal Departments, Agencies,  and Boards. This isn't how our Founding Fathers envisioned Congress  protecting the American people, and it is a bad way to do business.   As a matter of fairness, earmark project funding should be merit- based and competitive or allocated by formula. Earmarks undermine State  decision making over funds that are allocated to States through  formula-based grants. Political decisions should not preempt State and  regional decision making. Earmarks should not be a shortcut for State  and local governments engaging in long-term planning and budgeting for  anticipated needs. And, furthermore, State and local governments and  other organizations should not be spending time and money to hire  lobbyists to chase after Federal dollars in hopes of getting an  earmark.   The money spent on lobbying and travel to pursue an earmark should be  applied toward the local project itself. If a Federal Agency or program  isn't working, then Members of Congress should fix it instead of  seeking a carve-out. Highway authorizations bills are a perfectly good  example of the problems with earmarks.   In 1987, President Reagan vetoed the Transportation bill because of-- guess what--too many earmarks. That bill included only 152 earmarks. In  1998, the Transportation bill, called TEA-21, included 1,850 earmarks.  The State of Florida challenged the earmarks included for the State,  arguing that the allocated funding did not address the actual  transportation needs of the  [[Page S916]]  State. The U.S. Department of Transportation overruled Florida's  objections.   In the 2005 bill--so I am going to another Transportation bill; it  was called the SAFETEA-LU--included 6,371 earmarks. Let's go over that  again. Let's go back. In 1987, President Reagan vetoed a bill because  there were only 152 earmarks. Ten years later, TEA-21 included 1,850  earmarks and then, 2005, 6,371 earmarks.   However, under the earmark ban, the last Transportation bill  distributed 92 percent of the funding to the States through formulas.  And then, you know, that gives States and local governments control  over the funding decision based on the needs of the 50 different  States, based on safety, engineering, and other objective criteria, as  opposed to politically directed earmarks that totally sweep aside those  criteria. It was almost a political decision where that money ought to  be put.    It should also be pointed out that the majority of the earmark funds  in the past came straight out of the allocated formula dollars for each  State, which then further eroded merit and State and local decision  making. In other words, Washington politicians were making decisions  better made by the nonpartisan boards in State capitols and local  communities. And when I say ``nonpartisan boards,'' I don't suppose it  is that way in all 50 States, but I know in most Midwestern States it  is that way.   I know that a lot of good has come from projects that I have helped  support in Iowa, when we had our earmarks, and I certainly did not want  Iowa to miss out on funding just because of a Washington dysfunction  that we called earmarks. However, I also know that many of these  earmarks disrupted our State and regional planning efforts. I have no  way of knowing what good might have been done had we not had earmarks  banned earlier. I do know that I have faith that the Federal money that  goes back to Iowa for Iowans and the Iowans deciding how it is to be  spent is being spent thoughtfully and well and not with a lot of  political consideration.   Any good that might come from my being able to direct small amounts  of Federal taxpayer dollars to some worthwhile pilot project would be  dwarfed by the negative effects of restarting the mad scramble for  earmarks.   So I hope, my colleagues, the rumors I have been hearing about the  Appropriations Committee wanting to reinstitute earmarks, I hope that  those people would pay some attention to the history of it and  particularly pay attention to what President Obama said in 2010 about  earmarks and not go through another process, maybe starting out with  just a few earmarks but getting up into more than several years, more  than 10,000 earmarks in various appropriations bills, and then all of a  sudden then have a mandate that came from the electorate, like it did  in 2010, and both Republicans and Democrats come back to these halls  where we have debate and make policy, saying no more earmarks.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, just barely a year ago, I was here  making a similar statement. Impeachment is one of the most solemn  matters to come before the Senate, but I worry that it's also becoming  a common occurrence.   Before getting into the merits of this impeachment, it is important  to reiterate that January 6 was a sad and tragic day for America. I  hope we can all agree about that.   What happened here at the Capitol was completely inexcusable. It was  not a demonstration of any of our protected, inalienable rights. It was  a direct, violent attack on our seat of government. Those who plowed  over police barricades, assaulted law enforcement, and desecrated our  monument to representative democracy flouted the rule of law and  disgraced our Nation. Six people, including two U.S. Capitol Police  officers, now lie dead in the wake of this assault. The perpetrators  must be brought to justice, and I am glad to see that many such cases  are progressing around the country.   While the ultimate responsibility for this attack rests upon the  shoulders of those who unlawfully entered the Capitol, everyone  involved must take responsibility for their destructive actions that  day, including the former President. As the leader of the Nation, all  Presidents bear some responsibility for the actions that they inspire-- good or bad. Undoubtedly, then-President Trump displayed poor  leadership in his words and actions. I do not defend those actions and  my vote should not be read as a defense of those actions.   I am a member of a Court of Impeachment. My job is to vote on the  case brought by the House managers. I took an oath to render judgment  on the Article of Impeachment sent to the Senate by the House of  Representatives. We are confined to considering only the Articles  charged and the facts presented.   First and foremost, I don't think this impeachment is proper under  the Constitution. This is the first time the Senate has tried a former  President. Whether or not it can do so is a difficult question. The  Constitution doesn't say in black and white ``Yes, the Senate can try a  former President'' or ``No, it can't.'' In contrast, many State  constitutions at the time of the founding specified that their  legislatures could, so it's notable that our Federal charter did not.  In order to answer this question it's therefore necessary to look at  the text, structure, and history of the Constitution. That's what I  have done. In the end, I do not think we have the ability to try a  former President.   I start always with the Constitution, which gives Congress the power  of impeachment. As I mentioned, impeachment was a feature in many State  constitutions at the time, and it came from a power enjoyed by the  English Parliament.   Impeachment in England was a powerful tool whereby Parliament could  [[Page S925]]  hold individuals accountable for actions against the government without  having to rely on the King to enforce it. It applied not just to  sitting government officials but also to former government officials  and even to private individuals. It was not simply a way to remove  government officials but a general method of punishing the enemies of  Parliament, including with fines, jail time, or even death.   This is not the system established by our Constitution. Our  Constitution restricts the power of impeachment in two important ways.  First, it says that Congress can't just impeach anyone: only the  President, the Vice President, and ``all civil Officers of the United  States'' can be impeached. It then restricts the penalties for  impeachment to removal from office and disqualification.   A former President is not in any of those three categories. He is not  the President. In fact, the Constitution also specifies that when the  President is impeached, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall  preside over the trial. Chief Justice Roberts has not presided over  this trial, thus making it clear that it is not the trial of a  President. He is obviously not the Vice President. He is not a civil  officer of the United States.   Because he does not fall into any of these categories, I don't think  that this trial was appropriate.   Moving beyond the text of the Constitution, the history of the Senate  confirms this. The U.S. Senate has never convicted a former official in  an impeachment. The Senate has tried three individuals who were former  officers--William Blount a former Senator in 1798; William Belknap a  former Secretary of War, in 1876; and Robert Archibald an incumbent  Commerce Court judge, in 1912, tried as well for conduct while a  district judge). Belknap is the only executive branch member tried  after leaving office. None was convicted for his prior conduct,  Archibald was convicted on counts relating to his incumbent judicial  service on the Commerce Court. In all three cases, the jurisdictional  question loomed large at the trial and was cited as an important  argument justifying the acquittals. In other words, Senate practice is  consistent: It has never convicted a former official in an impeachment.   Between the text of the Constitution and the consistent practice of  the Senate, I'm convinced that this is not an appropriate use of our  power. While I realize there are arguments on the other side from  learned scholars, to me, they do not overcome these problems of text  and history.   That's why I voted twice to deal with this impeachment on  jurisdictional grounds. But my position didn't prevail, with the  majority Democrats voting in lockstep to proceed, and we went to trial.  As I've said, even though I think this is inappropriate, I kept an open  mind during the process, and I listened to both sides as they presented  their evidence.   The House managers tried to prove that President Trump incited an  insurrection. That is a difficult argument to make. There were many  other Articles over which they could have impeached President Trump,  but this is what the House of Representatives chose. They didn't meet  their burden.   Before getting to the merits of the charge, I need to point out that  this impeachment trial has not aligned with principles of due process  of law. Other impeachments have involved significant fact-finding in  the House, where proper legal formalities are followed, witnesses are  heard from and cross-examined, and hard evidence is reviewed. Here  there were no hearings in the House. The evidence presented was mostly  video montages and news reports. We even had the unusual spectacle of  voting to call witnesses for the first time as the trial was ending  only to immediately reverse course and call none. Given the seriousness  of the situation, I think we should expect better when the House  exercises its constitutional duty of impeachment.   This issue involves complicated legal questions. In our legal system,  though, it is very difficult for speech to rise to the level of  incitement. ``Incitement'' is a legal term of art. Usually it takes  place in the context of incitement to violence. Incitement, in our  legal system, doesn't mean ``encouraging'' violence or ``advocating''  violence or even ``espousing'' violence. It means intentionally causing  likely violence. Because the Article of Impeachment uses the word  ``incitement,'' I need to evaluate President Trump's actions under the  rubrics of the law of incitement, which were set out in the Supreme  Court case of Brandenburg v. Ohio. In that case the Court held that  incitement required speech that, first, encourages ``imminent lawless  action'' and, second, ``is likely to incite or produce such action.''  In other words, in order to succeed, the House managers must have shown  that President Trump's speech was intended to direct the crowd to  assault the Capitol and that his language was also likely to have that  effect.   As I said before, what happened on January 6 was tragic. We can't let  it happen again. But the House managers have not sufficiently  demonstrated that President Trump's speech incited it. While I will  have more to say about President Trump's conduct, the fact is that he  said this: ``I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to  the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices  heard.'' That speech is not an incitement to immanent lawless action as  established in the case law. I wish the crowd would have listened to  him.   Just because President Trump did not meet the definition of inciting  insurrection does not mean that I think he behaved well.   To be clear, I wanted President Trump to win in November. I gave over  30 speeches on his behalf in Iowa the week before the election. He,  like any politician, is entitled to seek redress in the courts to  resolve election disputes. President Trump did just that, and there's  nothing wrong with it. I supported the exercise of this right in the  hopes that allowing the election challenge process to play out would  remove all doubt about the outcome. The reality is, he lost. He brought  over 60 lawsuits and lost all but 1 of them. He was not able to  challenge enough votes to overcome President Biden's significant  margins in key States. I wish it would have stopped there.   It didn't. President Trump continued to argue that the election had  been stolen even though the courts didn't back up his claims. He  belittled and harassed elected officials across the country to get his  way. He encouraged his own, loyal Vice President, Mike Pence, to take  extraordinary and unconstitutional actions during the electoral college  count. My vote in this impeachment does nothing to excuse or justify  those actions. There's no doubt in my mind that President Trump's  language was extreme, aggressive, and irresponsible.   Unfortunately, others share the blame in polluting our political  discourse with inflammatory and divisive language. As President Trump's  attorneys showed, whatever we heard from President Trump, we had been  hearing from Democrats for years. National Democrats, up to and  including President Biden and Vice President Harris, have become  regular purveyors of speech dismissing and even condoning violence.  It's not surprising that when they talk about taking the ``fight'' to  ``the streets'' organizations like antifa actually take to the streets  of our cities with shields and bats and fists, destroying lives and  livelihoods.   Yes, I think President Trump should have accepted President Biden's  victory when it became clear he won. I think Secretary Clinton should  have done the same thing in 2016. But as recently as 2019, she  questioned the legitimacy of Trump's election, saying ``[Trump] knows  he's an illegitimate president. I believe he understands that the many  varying tactics they used, from voter suppression and voter purging to  hacking to the false stories . . . there were just a bunch of different  reasons why the election turned out like it did.''   If there's one lesson I hope we all learn from not only last year but  the last few years, it's that we all need to tone down the rhetoric.  Whether it's the destructive riots we saw last summer or the assault on  the Capitol, too many people think that politics really is just war by  another name. To far too many people, our democracy isn't free people  coming together to make life better for our communities. It's a street  fight.   We don't need to agree on everything. In fact, part of what makes our  democracy great is that we don't agree on everything. But we do need to  resolve these differences with debate and  [[Page S926]]  with elections, not with violence. Whether the violence comes from the  left or the right, it's wrong. The same goes for speech that claims to  define enemies by political views or affiliations.   We're all Americans, always trying to form a more perfect union. We  have more in common than what divides us. It's high time those of us  who have been elected to serve lead by example. We can take the high  road. We can tone down the rhetoric. We can be respectful even when we  disagree strongly. If we don't, we'll be betraying the trust that the  American people have placed in us, and we'll endanger the democracy and  the freedom that so many of us have worked to preserve.   These are difficult issues I have considered over the past week, but  in the end, I am confident in what I think is the correct position. We  do not have the authority to try a private citizen like former  President Trump. Even if we did, he should have been accorded the  protections of due process of law in his trial. And even if we assume  he has been, the House managers still did not prove that he committed  incitement to insurrection, the specific crime of which he stands  accused. This does not excuse President Trump's conduct on and around  January 6 of this year, it satisfies my oath as a U.S. Senator in this  Court of Impeachment. I therefore voted to acquit.
