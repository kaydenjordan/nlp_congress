 Madam Speaker, I speak to honor the life of Trooper Joseph  Bullock, whose watch ended on the morning of February 5, 2020, when  fatally shot in the line of duty.   Trooper Bullock's life was devoted to protecting those he had never  met, in the Air Force and the Florida Highway Patrol for 19 years, and  he paid dearly that others would be safe.   There are no words or actions that can repay the debt we each owe  heroes like Trooper Bullock. It would be fruitless for me to attempt  words to remove grief from his family or fellow troopers.   I can only offer from our Nation the most ardent thanks for sharing  him as a protector and pray to our Father in Heaven that every thought  of him is a cherished memory and pride that he was a man who laid down  his life for others.                            ____________________
