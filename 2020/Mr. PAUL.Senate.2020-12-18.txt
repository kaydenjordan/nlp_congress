 Mr. President, the Federal Government brought in $3.3  trillion in revenue last year and spent $6.6 trillion for a record- setting $3.3 trillion deficit. If you are looking for more COVID  bailout money, we don't have any. The coffers are bare. We have no  rainy day fund. We have no savings account. Congress has spent all of  the money. Congress spent all of the money a long time ago.   The economic damage from the pandemic is not the reason for this  runaway spending. This has gone on for decades. Today's money is gone,  so Congress is spending tomorrow's money. When you look at a graph of  our projected spending, you see a big spike this year. The spike is a  mountain of money doled out to pay for the economic ruin of the  government mandates.   When we talk about spending tomorrow's money, this is not just money  we will need next month; this is money we will need in a decade--money  we will need in one, two, and three generations from now. For national  defense. For infrastructure. This is money that your children and  grandchildren will pay back with interest, and it is going up by more  than a trillion dollars every year.   Instead of enjoying the same wealth and opportunity that we have  enjoyed in this country, our children will be stuck paying our bills-- with interest. Every taxpaying American already owes $136,754 today,  and they are staring at a red-ink projection into the future. We are  $27 trillion in total debt today. How do we expect a child to have  economic opportunity when crushing debt is their inheritance from  Congress?   The numbers are mind-boggling. It is hard to conceive of a billion  dollars, much less a trillion dollars. How big is a billion? Well, a  billion seconds ago was 1988 and Reagan was still President. A billion  minutes ago, Jesus walked the shore of the Sea of Galilee. A billion  hours ago, man still lived in caves. But a billion dollars ago--as  spent by the Federal Government--that was just 80 minutes ago. That is  right, the Federal Government spends a billion dollars every 80  minutes.   All of this should be setting off alarm bells, but the only alarm  bells in Congress are sounding the alarm for more spending, more debt.  No cuts. No offsets. No pay-fors. No prioritization. Just debt. Spend  all the money and leave the future to figure itself out. Our budget  deficit for 2020 was $3.3 trillion, and we are projected to have a  deficit of nearly $2 trillion in 2021. And that was before any  additional spending on another round of coronavirus bailout money.   By refusing to acknowledge the debt crisis, we are only hastening the  day of economic reckoning. Total debt was 55 percent of GDP 20 years  ago; today it is 128 percent. The World Bank estimates there is a  tipping point of debt to GDP at about 77 percent. Every percentage  point after that costs about one-tenth of 1 percent of economic growth.  We are at 128 percent, which means Congress's continued borrowing is  costing the U.S. economy about 8 percent growth each year.   We are borrowing and worsening this debt crisis, in part, because too  many Governors and mayors have imposed heavyhanded restrictions that  crush businesses. The pandemic itself was disruptive, but Congress is  being asked to help perpetuate lockdowns and shutdowns through bailouts  and debt. Every bailout dollar printed and passed out to Governors only  allows these tin pot dictators to perpetuate the lockdowns. Their rules  are arbitrary, and Governors and mayors across the country are picking  winners and losers. Businesses, some that have been in families for  generations, are being wiped out because they are not not allowed to  offer their services. Restaurants have to close for indoor dining, but  then they are told they can stay open at limited capacity, but then  they are told they have to close again, but then they are told that  they can reopen but bars have to close. Confusing doesn't explain the  half of it.   Bars are told they can only serve alcohol if people are sitting and  not standing and only if they have heavy foods on their menus.  Restaurants are told they can serve outdoors, then have that permission  revoked after they have sunk time and money converting their restaurant  to outdoor service. But a caterer can still serve outdoors.   Businesses are told they have to close at an arbitrary time  determined by government officials, as though the virus only comes out  late at night. A business in one Zip Code can be open but one in the  adjoining Zip Code has to close, as if the virus can't cross an  imaginary line.   Airlines are allowed to fly but hotels have to limit their occupancy,  so you may not have anywhere to stay when you get there.   Mom-and-pop stores and specialty stores are forced to close, but big  box competitors are allowed to stay open because they have a grocery  aisle. But then other States roped off random sections of stores. How  is any business expected to survive that kind of regulation?   Meanwhile, many schools remain closed despite overwhelming evidence  showing kids can safely learn in-person with basic precautions, which  means parents can't go to work, which has forced many parents to leave  their jobs to take care of home-bound kids. Now they have no income  because the government forced them to leave their jobs to take care of  their kids, and many kids are struggling with an improvised virtual  school.   The need for help is real. I hear it every day from Kentuckians and  across the country. But it is clear that government has worsened the  economic damage and acted as the biggest obstacle to economic recovery.   There is no free money to get us out of this situation. In fact,  there is no more money at all. The answer is not printing up and  distributing ``free money'' to everyone. The answer is immediately  opening the economy. We can choose to let our economies open, with  guidance and precautions but not obstruction. Let people rebuild their  livelihoods. Reopen our schools so kids can learn and parents can go  back to working and earning a living. Congress should do away with  automatic spending increases and scrutinize where in our budget we can  find savings to pay for the pressing needs arising from the pandemic.  This is what I prefer and what I have proposed. Or Congress can follow  the status quo: Congress can continue to borrow from our kids--the same  ones whom we have locked out of schools. Congress can keep enabling the  shutting down of business by force, spend all of today's money and all  of tomorrow's money. Then good luck figuring out how to pay for all of  this massive debt.   It doesn't have to be this way. This debt crisis is a preventable  crisis. It is not too late to change our course. Cut unnecessary  spending, eliminate waste, stop fighting a $50 billion per year forever  war in Afghanistan. Make the hard decisions now. We can't keep  pretending that more debt is a sustainable policy course. Leadership is  not passing on the problem to someone who can't protest, leadership is  making the  [[Page S7711]]  hard choices now. That is what we have to do. I will oppose this new  debt, and I will continue to sound the alarm until we change our course  here in Congress.                            ____________________
