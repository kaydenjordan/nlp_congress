 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 130th  anniversary of Bar Harbor Bank & Trust. Based in Bar Harbor, ME, Bar  Harbor Bank & Trust now has 14 branches in Maine and 35 branches in New  Hampshire and Vermont. Known for supporting and understanding the  unique people, organizations, and culture of northern New England, Bar  Harbor Bank & Trust has not only achieved a strong reputation for  providing quality service, but it has also cultivated employees who are  dedicated to bettering their communities.   Since its founding in 1887, Bar Harbor Bank & Trust has fostered the  personal and professional growth of its employees while serving its  customers with the highest level of care and concern. Over the years,  Bar Harbor Bank & Trust has expanded to New Hampshire-based  subsidiaries: McCrillis & Elredge Insurance, Inc., and Charter Trust  Company. It recently acquired Lake Sunapee Bank to make it one of the  largest community banks in New England. It been recognized as a leading  bank nationwide and ranked among the best places to work in ME.   Bar Harbor Bank & Trust has demonstrated a commitment to supporting  the communities it serves. Each year, its employees volunteer thousands  of hours to local community organizations. This commitment is sustained  by their volunteer pay program that allows employees to get paid time  off for volunteering each month to local causes they are passionate  about. Furthermore, it allows them to contribute money from their  paychecks to the Bank's Community Commitment program each month, and  with every donation matched by the bank, the program donates over  thousands of dollars annually to local nonprofit organizations,  including Maine Veteran's Project, Girls and Boys State, Knox County  Homeless Coalition, and dozens more.   In addition to volunteerism, Bar Harbor bank & Trust employees  actively  [[Page S4760]]  participate in many community fundraisers, such as the Annual Hancock  Relay for Life for the American Cancer Society. The bank also hosts an  annual charity golf tournament that raises money for a local  organization. This year, the tournament raised money that was donated  to the Acadia Family Center to sponsor a year's worth of treatment for  two individuals battling substance abuse. Additionally, Bar Harbor Bank  & Trust employees teach local children lessons about saving money  through the ABA's Teach Children to Save Day and explain how to use  credit wisely to teenagers in the community. In 2016 alone, this bank  provided over 450 children with lessons in savings education.   I wish to join the communities all around Maine, New Hampshire, and  Vermont in congratulating Bar Harbor Bank & Trust for this remarkable  achievement on its 130th anniversary. I look forward to following its  continued growth and service, and I applaud the bank for its dedication  to its employees, customers, and local communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Maine Lobster  Festival on its 70th anniversary. On this date, the people of Maine  celebrate our rich history in the valuable lobster trade, as well as  the continuing commitment by our coastal communities to support and  perpetuate our great maritime heritage.   Since 1947, The Maine Lobster Festival has provided the people of  Maine and tourists with exciting events, entertainment, and Maine  seafood. The festival emerged out of a community-based effort at  reviving summer activities that Camden, ME, established prior to World  War II. A small group of citizens and summer visitors came together to  revel in their coastal marine community. Their small gathering, which  lost money in its first year, moved to Rockland the following year and  immediately became an annual staple of the coastal area's summer  schedule, creating the Maine Lobster Festival to operate as a nonprofit  corporation that is responsible for the festival to this day.   This nearly weeklong engagement in August is attended by both  internationally recognized as well as local musicians and entertainers,  who fill the concert stage with enthralling performances. A midway  provides excitement for children of all ages. King Neptune and his  court attend the event every year and a highlight is the crowning of  the Maine Sea Goddess. The festival also boasts a wide range of Maine  artistry, from craftsmen to painters, as well as one of the region's  largest and most popular parades. In addition, there is often a U.S.  Navy ship that offers unique tour opportunities to festival-goers. As  the highlight, there are fresh lobster dinners prepared in the world's  largest lobster cooker for the thousands of hungry attendees. While you  may no longer be able to get ``all the lobster you can eat for $1,''  the festival promises to have more than enough lobster to go around.   Year-in and year-out, the combined effort of more than a thousand  volunteers generously donate their time makes the festival possible.  Volunteers are committed to improving and showcasing midcoast Maine  communities to the thousands of festival-goers that come from different  parts of Maine, from across the country and around the world. Not only  do they donate their time and effort, but they also donate all profits  of the festival to Maine communities to provide needed support to local  institutions such as food pantries, community service groups, emergency  services, and college scholarships.   The Maine Lobster Festival is recognized nationwide as one of the  best events in the country, and this distinction could not be bestowed  on a more deserving enterprise. I wish to join the greater Rockland  community, as well as the State of Maine, in congratulating the Maine  Lobster Festival on its 70th year of being an historic and cherished  Maine institution.                            ____________________
