 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just have to say, here we go again. This is the third time in 2  months that the Democrat leadership has put this divisive and  irresponsible debate on the House floor.   I have to ask, Madam Speaker, what are we doing here today on this  War Powers Resolution again?   Our constituents are concerned about the impact of coronavirus on  American lives and the United States economy, not partisan posturing.  In fact, the WHO just declared that the coronavirus is now a pandemic.   Madam Speaker, that is what we should be focused on here today.   This political War Powers Resolution is based on a false premise. It  orders the President to terminate hostilities against Iran. The problem  is, for the other side, we are not engaged in hostilities in Iran.   I asked Secretary Pompeo that very question on February 28, 8 weeks  after the Soleimani strike, before our Committee on Foreign Affairs:  Are we engaged in hostilities against Iran? His response was: ``We are  not.''   Our military commander in the Middle East agrees. General McKenzie  was asked yesterday at the Armed Services Committee if we are engaged  in hostilities against Iran or Iranian forces. He said, as Secretary  Pompeo said: ``No, we are not.''   I am a strong supporter of our Article I powers, as I know the  chairman is as well. If we were to launch strikes in Iran, I believe  that the President would need to come before this body to ask for a new  authorization.   But that, Madam Speaker, is not what we are facing. This text  completely ignores the remarkable restraint that the President has  shown over the past few months. He has used force only when necessary  to protect American lives.   I was with the President at the White House when he was deciding how  to respond to Iran's shooting down of our drone. He would have been  justified, I believe, in taking out launch sites, but he decided to  deescalate instead. He was very clear, saying: ``I do not want to go to  war with Iran.''   The January 2 strike on Qasem Soleimani inside Iraq, not Iran, was  not an escalation by the United States. It was an appropriate response  to his deadly targeting of Americans and diplomats in Iraq.   Soleimani has the blood of hundreds of Americans on his hands. Most  recently, he organized an escalating series of attacks in Iraq, an  escalating series of these attacks which killed an American, wounded  multiple U.S. servicemen, and involved the siege of our Embassy, an  attack on our Embassy in Baghdad.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Milley, said the  administration would have been ``culpably negligent'' had they not  acted to take him out.   The strike on Soleimani in Iraq was totally justified as self-defense  under the President's Article II constitutional powers.   Jeh Johnson, President Obama's general counsel at the Department of  Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security, a person I have great,  tremendous respect for and who I worked very closely with when I was  chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, in his words, he stated  that Soleimani ``was a lawful military objective, and  [[Page H1618]]  the President, under his constitutional authority as Commander in  Chief, had ample domestic legal authority to take him out without an  additional congressional authorization.''   This is the man in the Obama administration who approved the  airstrikes against the terrorists.   More importantly, the Soleimani strike was a success. Let me quote  from a recent Washington Post article, where they said: The  Revolutionary Guard ``now finds itself on the back foot, a notable  change after successfully projecting its power in the Middle East over  recent years.''   The Quds Force--Quds, meaning Jerusalem--that is their ultimate  objective, to annihilate the State of Israel. ``The Quds Force has been  significantly deterred from retaliating further against the United  States.''   But the Democrats cannot admit anything good can come from this  President, and that has consequences. In my judgment, we are wasting  precious legislative days and setting a terrible precedent of abusing  War Powers procedures.   This will be the fifth time that this Congress, and in this Congress,  that we are considering a War Powers Resolution directing the President  to withdraw U.S. forces from wars we are not actually fighting--three  on Iran and two on Yemen.   Iran and its proxies are watching right now, as we spin our wheels.  What they see, Madam Speaker, unfortunately, is not a united America,  but a divided America that does not fully support the ability of our  Commander in Chief to adequately respond to threats against Americans.   Now is not the time to tie our Commander in Chief's hands. Now is the  time to support our troops and to support our diplomats.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who  served in the United States Army and fought in Operation Iraqi Freedom.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Waltz), a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and the first  Green Beret elected to Congress.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Riggleman), who served in the United  States Air Force for over a decade and is a veteran of Operation Allied  Force and Enduring Freedom.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, there was reference that the taking out of Soleimani  was an assassination. I just want to remind this body of Jeh Johnson's  words, President Obama's general counsel at the Department of Defense,  Secretary of Homeland Security, who I have tremendous respect for. He  signed off on airstrikes under the Obama administration, stating that  Soleimani was a lawful military objective, and the President, under his  Constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, had ample domestic  legal authority to take him out without additional congressional  authorization. I think that really puts this matter to rest.   But let me also say that the chairman and I are very bipartisan. We  respect this committee. We respect the integrity of this committee. We  both see the world very much in the same way. I know the chairman is  not a supporter of Soleimani. I believe the chairman believes, as I do,  that the world is safer without Mr. Soleimani in it.   The chairman and I are very staunchly pro-Israel, and are for Israel,  and very much against the actions of the Ayatollah in Iran. So I don't  question the chairman whatsoever.   In fact, I take great pride in the fact that the chairman and I work  very well together. When we disagree--and sometimes we do--we agree to  disagree, and we do so with civility, which I think has been lost at  times in this body, in this town. And so I want to start with that.   I will say that all the hearings I have had, and briefings prove that  Soleimani was a terrorist who actively engaged in a campaign of  violence against Americans and our interests. And after not one, two,  but three times debating this issue on the floor, I think we about said  all we can say.   I think we can all agree he was a brutal terrorist and that the world  is better off without him.                                time  1500    But I have to question, why now are we debating this? Our country is  facing a public health emergency.   Madam Speaker, as I stated, the World Health Organization just  announced in the time of this debate that the coronavirus is now a  pandemic.   As of today, there are more than 121,000 reported cases of  coronavirus worldwide, including over 1,000 right here in the United  States. And while the CDC maintains the likelihood of a person catching  the disease is low, the fallout from the fear caused by COVID-19 is  real and is causing real damage.   Just 2 days ago, people were watching as their 401(k)s and retirement  funds were disappearing and Wall Street saw the biggest drop in more  than a decade. I know in my district, the city of Austin suffered a  significant economic blow with the cancellation of South by Southwest,  an event the chairman and I were actually scheduled to speak at  regarding how we were the committee that works together and doesn't  give in to toxic partisan politics.   Last year, this conference in my hometown brought more than $350  million to Austin, making it the most profitable event for the city's  hospitality industry. More communities are facing economic fallout, as  well. And the fear is only rising as we continue to see more stories.   Several Members of Congress themselves, our colleagues, are currently  self-quarantining after potentially being exposed to the virus, yet we  are talking about this resolution today.   I would just close by saying, I was back in my district over the  weekend talking to my constituents. They were really not concerned  about the War Powers Resolution. Their number one concern right now is:  My God, is my child going to get coronavirus? Am I going to get  coronavirus? When is it going to impact my backyard, my neighbors? They  want to be safe, and they want Congress to do something.   I am hopeful, Madam Speaker--I know they are in negotiations right  now between the leadership of our two parties that we can come  together, just as we did last week, in passing a $7.8 billion  supplemental to address this crisis--that we can come together as  Republicans and Democrats to do good things for the American people and  to protect the American people and to make them safe.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers), a member of the  Armed Services Committee and the lead Republican of the Homeland  Security Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I believe I have said about everything I can say on this issue, so I  won't take up more time of Congress, other than to say we are not at  war with Iran. If we were, I would be the first one to say Congress has  a responsibility to act. If Soleimani was taken out in Iran, I would be  the first to say we need an Authorization for Use of Military Force.   Congress does have the power to declare war under the Constitution,  and many colleagues on my side of the aisle agree with that concept,  but it is just not factually what is happening on the ground today in  Iran. If that day happens, we are fully prepared to have this  discussion. This is what I would call a premature argument to make.   And I would say, with respect to updating the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs, I  have had several meetings with Members on both sides of the aisle, many  of whom were not here when those were passed by Congress in 2001 and  2002, who also agree that we should be working to modernize these  Authorizations for Use of Military Force.   I think there is that consensus, Madam Speaker, here today. I would  encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and I know  Chairman Engel is also supportive of working together--to try to  modernize these Authorizations for Use of Military Force.   But that is not the situation on the ground today, and I cannot  support this resolution simply for the fact it is based on a false  premise. It will tie the hands of our Commander in Chief to respond in  self-defense to Americans, our diplomats serving over there very  bravely, and our American soldiers who are over there very bravely--it  ties his hands to defend from an attack launched by Iran.   And lastly, I say, Mr. Soleimani was not a good man. He was an evil  mastermind of terror. For two decades he killed Americans. He brought  the Russians into Syria. They slaughtered tens of thousands of innocent  people in Syria. He is responsible for so much blood on his hands.   I would close by saying--and I do think there is consensus on this  issue, as well--that the world is indeed a better place without this  mastermind of terror, the greatest mastermind since bin Laden was  removed from the face of this Earth.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    I am in its current form.    Madam Speaker, here we are, once again, debating war  powers when the simple fact is we are not engaged in hostilities  against Iran.   Why are we wasting precious floor time when all the American people  really care about today is coronavirus? Today the WHO declared it a  pandemic. That is the biggest threat to our Nation today.   So, why are my colleagues launching more partisan political attacks  against this President for taking justified military action to protect  Americans against one of the world's most dangerous terrorists?   That is why my motion states that Soleimani was a terrorist and that  the world is safer without him, just like the world was safer when  President Obama ordered the strike on bin Laden when Republicans and  Democrats came together to praise his decision. President Obama  conducted thousands of unauthorized strikes in Libya unrelated to  protecting Americans, and at that time Leader Pelosi said that she was  satisfied he had the authority for those strikes.   Soleimani was a mastermind of terror in the Middle East for two  decades, and that is why President Obama designated him as a terrorist.   Soleimani funded, trained, and equipped Iran's terrorist proxies in  Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Afghanistan.   Soleimani is the one who convinced Russia to fight for Assad.   Tens of thousands of innocent people in Syria are dead today, victims  of war crimes, because of Soleimani.   Soleimani played a key role in the crackdown of protesters in Iraq  that killed hundreds of Iraqis.   Most importantly, Madam Speaker, he has the blood of over 600  American soldiers on his hands.   Under Soleimani's command, Iran tried to assassinate the Saudi  Ambassador to the United States in a Washington, D.C., restaurant less  than 4 miles from where we are standing today.   The danger he posed to the United States was not just a thing of the  past. He was directing a campaign of terror and violence against us in  Iraq, which killed one American and injured four other servicemen.   He orchestrated the attack on our Embassy in Baghdad.   Look at this picture. This was not simply a brush fire, Madam  Speaker. They stormed and attacked our Embassy under Soleimani's  orders.   What more evidence do we need than this?   Soleimani was not done after his attack on our Embassy. He wasn't on  a vacation when he went to meet with his top lieutenants in Damascus,  Lebanon, and Baghdad. Secretary Pompeo testified to our committee that  Soleimani was in the region actively plotting to kill Americans. He was  going to report back to Tehran, to the Ayatollah, to plan future  attacks.   What if our President had done nothing and our Embassy was attacked  again like in 1979 with diplomats taken hostage? What if the President  did nothing? What if more United States troops were killed? What then  would the other side of the aisle be saying?   Madam Speaker, the enemies of our country are watching this debate  right now, and they need to know darn well that, if you kill or injure  Americans, you will pay the price.   Like President Reagan, I am a firm believer in peace through  strength. When we show strength like we did with this necessary strike,  our enemies back down.   So, Madam Speaker, I call upon my colleagues to drop their  partisanship, to stand as Americans as we did when President Obama  struck bin Laden, and to support this simple fact that the world is a  better place without Soleimani.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H1639]]    A recorded vote was ordered.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
