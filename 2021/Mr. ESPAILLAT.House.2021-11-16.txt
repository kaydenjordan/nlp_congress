 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 26 incredibly  talented Latina women in the field of literature that I had the  pleasure of meeting this morning.   These women are a huge part of the Latin American Women Writers  Project. They represent the best in our community, the leaders that  stand tall today to inspire our youth and our entire community.   Their efforts to ensure inclusion and representation in journalism,  creative writing, and storytelling, and sharing these ideas with us  here today, are commendable. They are laying the groundwork, Mr.  Speaker, to uplift and inspire the next generation of Latina writers.   I hope that the discussion we had today will continue onward  throughout our communities and across this great Nation and that their  work will continue to inspire many in our communities, particularly the  next generation.   They have used their voices to share their stories with our families.  Mr. Speaker, I welcome them.                            ____________________
