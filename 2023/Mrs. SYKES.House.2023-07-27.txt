 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Larry Terkel from  Hudson as Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week.   Larry recently competed at the National Senior Games in Pittsburgh,  bringing home an impressive seven gold medals. Held every 2 years, the  National Senior Games brings athletes over the age of 50 from around  the country to compete in all sports.   At the age of 76, Mr. Terkel won individual gold medals in the 50-  and 100-yard freestyle, the 50- and 100-yard breaststroke, and the 50- yard butterfly. He also won two gold medals in the 4-by-50 mixed medley  relay and the 4-by-50 mixed freestyle relay.   While expanding our community's longstanding legacy as the birthplace  of champions this year, he also continues to hold the nationwide  records for the 50- and 100-yard freestyle at the Senior Games and is a  U.S. Masters Swimming national champion.   When he is not in the pool, Mr. Terkel is a professor at Kent State  University and a YouTube yoga sensation. Mr. Terkel is proof that no  matter your age, your physical condition can be optimal, and you should  never count anyone out.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Larry Terkel on earning seven gold  medals and representing Ohio's 13th Congressional District. He has made  us all proud.                            ____________________
