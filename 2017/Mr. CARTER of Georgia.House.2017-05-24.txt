 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Memorial Day on May 29, 2017.  On this day, Americans across our Nation pay respects to and honor  members of the U.S. Armed Forces who have sacrificed their lives  defending the freedoms that we so gratefully enjoy.   The decision to leave families and friends, travel to a land that is  utterly unfamiliar, and risk their lives protecting the lives of others  is among the most selfless acts one can make.   Roughly 1.5 million Americans are currently serving in one of the  five branches of the Armed Forces. Of these Americans, nearly 90,000  are assigned to one of Georgia's numerous military bases which are  scattered throughout our great State.   Georgia's First Congressional District that I have the honor and  privilege of representing is particularly important to our Nation's  Armed Forces as it includes Fort Stewart Army Base, Hunter Army  Airfield, Kings Bay Naval Base, and Moody Air Force Base.   The service provided by our Nation's armed services is invaluable.  Throughout our history, millions have paid the ultimate price for  freedom--they have given their lives in order to save ours. I ask that  you please keep these brave men and women in your prayers, not only on  Memorial Day but every day.   It is an honor to represent a State and a district with such a strong  tie to our Nation's defense. I ask that you pray for our troops, and I  ask that you pray for our Nation. God bless each and every one of you  as we observe this great Memorial Day. God bless America.                                time  1830
