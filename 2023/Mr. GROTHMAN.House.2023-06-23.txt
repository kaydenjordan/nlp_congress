 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I point out that every month  in this country, if you include the people who come over here kind of  administratively, we hit new records of people who I think are here  illegally. That is not going down if you compare month after month.   In any event, currently the Biden administration is encouraging our  embassies abroad to fly the so-called pride flag on our embassies,  including the Vatican. This is completely inappropriate, and the Biden  administration should immediately stop this policy.   America is a blessed Nation that has, I think, been the light of the  world. Rather than sending a message to the world that America stands  for and is great because of its freedoms guaranteed under our  Constitution and the bravery, faith, purity, and respect for the law of  its people, it sends the message that America stands for the LGBT  sexual agenda.   Leaving aside the absurdity that any sexually related flag should  stand with Old Glory--how ridiculous--this is not the message we want  to send to the countries around the world. It is also an insult to the  hundreds of millions of Americans who oppose this agenda as well as the  hundreds of thousands who made our country great and would be appalled  by this.   President Biden, please take down this flag.
