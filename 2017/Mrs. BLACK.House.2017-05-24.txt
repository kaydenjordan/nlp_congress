 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent from the House  chamber for votes Wednesday, May 24. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 277, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 278, and  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 282.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION    Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, the man who has served as a father figure  to me for the past twenty years has taken a turn for the worse in his  battle against cancer and his health is rapidly deteriorating. As such,  I will be returning home and will miss votes today, Wednesday, May 24,  and for the balance of the week. Had I been present, I would have  voted: ``yea'' on rollcall No. 274, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 275,  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 276, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 277, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 278, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 279, ``nay'' on rollcall No.  280, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 281, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 282.                            ____________________
