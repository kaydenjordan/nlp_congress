 Dr. Hill, are you aware of any evidence to       support the allegations against Vice President Biden?        Dr. HILL. I am not, no.         And, in fact, Mr. Holmes, the former       prosecutor general of Ukraine who Vice President Biden       encouraged to fire was actually corrupt; is that right?         And was not pursuing corruption investigations       and prosecutions; right?         And, in fact, removing that prosecutor general       was part of the United States' anticorruption policy; isn't       that correct?         And in fact, when Vice President Biden acted       to remove the former corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine, did he do       so as part of official United States policy?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Official U.S. policy that was       endorsed and was the policy of a number of other       international stakeholders, other countries, other monetary       institutions, and financial institutions.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Similarly, when asked if there was any  factual basis to support the allegations about Biden, George Kent  replied, ``None whatsoever.''   Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams also confirmed that they  are not aware of any credible evidence to support the notion that Vice  President Biden did anything wrong. Ambassador Volker testified that  the Biden allegations were not credible and that Biden ``respects his  duties of higher office.''    Now, as I mentioned, there was also a concrete reason that the U.S.  Government wanted Shokin removed. As David Holmes, a senior official at  the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine testified, by the time that Shokin was  finally removed in 2016, there were strong concerns that Shokin was  himself corrupt and not investigating potential corruption in the  country. In fact, part of the concern was that Shokin was not  investigating Burisma. Under Shokin, the investigation into the owner  of Burisma for earlier conduct had stalled and was dormant. That was  part of the reason why the United States and other countries wanted to  remove Shokin.   Because of this, and as confirmed by witness testimony we will hear  shortly, calling for Shokin's replacement would actually increase the  chances that Burisma would be investigated. In other words, Shokin was  corrupt and not investigating allegations that Burisma was corrupt, and  so Vice President Biden calling for Shokin's removal and advocating for  his replacement would actually increase chances of Burisma's  investigation.   Ambassador Yovanovitch made this point during her testimony. Let's  listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          And, in fact, if he would help to remove a       corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor general who was not prosecuting       enough corruption, that would increase the chances that       corrupt companies in Ukraine would be investigated; isn't       that right?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. One would think so.         And that would include Burisma; right?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Yes.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. President Trump and his allies have  tried to justify President Trump's withholding of military aid and a  White House meeting unless Ukraine announced the investigations he  wanted by saying it is the same thing the Vice President did when he  called for Ukraine to remove its corrupt prosecutor. It is not the same  thing. As you just heard, Vice President Biden followed official U.S.  policy. He went through official channels to remove the prosecutor that  was corrupt, and he did it with the support of our allies. That is the  exact opposite of what President Trump did. He pushed Ukraine for an  investigation that has no basis, that no one agreed with, that was not  at all U.S. policy, and that only benefited him.   George Kent addressed this very point during his testimony. Let's  listen.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          And so, even though President Trump was saying       repeatedly that there is no quid pro quo, Ambassador Sondland       relayed to you that the facts of the matter were that the       White House meeting and the security assistance were       conditioned on the announcement of these investigations. Is       that your understanding?        Ambassador TAYLOR. That's my understanding.         Now, you referenced a television interview and       a desire for President Trump to put Zelensky in a public box,       which you also have in quotes. Was that in your notes?        Ambassador TAYLOR. It was in my notes.         And what did you understand that to mean, to       put Zelensky in a public box?        Ambassador TAYLOR. I understood that to mean that President       Trump, through Ambassador Sondland, was asking for President       Zelensky to very publicly commit to these investigations,       that it was not sufficient to do this in private, that this       needed to be a very public statement.    The fact that the President only wanted a public announcement and not  the investigations to actually be conducted demonstrates that his  desire for investigations was simply and solely to boost his reelection  efforts.  [[Page S500]]    No. 2, turning to the second reason, President Trump's agents who  helped to carry out this scheme confirmed that his desire for Ukraine  to announce the investigations was solely for his personal political  benefit.   As we will explain in more detail in a few minutes, President Trump  never expressed any interest in U.S. anti-corruption policy toward  Ukraine, nor did he care about Ukraine's war against Russia. He only  expressed interest in one thing: investigating his political opponent.  This was unequivocally confirmed by the testimony of David Holmes, the  senior official at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. The day after the July 25  call, Holmes overheard a conversation between President Trump and  Ambassador Sondland, who was in Kyiv. The only topic they discussed  related to Ukraine was as to the investigations.   Here is his testimony:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Now, Mr. Morrison, shortly after you heard the       July 25th call, you testified that you alerted the NSC legal       advisor, John Eisenberg, pretty much right away. Is that       right?  [[Page S503]]              And you indicated in your opening statement,       or at least from your deposition, that you went to Mr.       Eisenberg out of concern over the potential political fallout       if the call record became public and not because you thought       it was illegal. Is that right?         But you would agree, right, that asking a       foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival       was inappropriate, would you not?         Now, you said you also reported this incident       to the NSC lawyers; is that right?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Correct.         What was their response?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. John Eisenberg said that he--he took       notes while I was talking, and he said that he would look       into it.         Why did you report this meeting and this       conversation to the NSC lawyers?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Because it was inappropriate. And,       following the meeting, I had a short conversation--following       the post-meeting meeting, in the Ward Room. I had a short       conversation with Ambassador--correction--Dr. Hill. And we       discussed the idea of needing to report this.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. In fact, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman reported  concerns twice, and Mr. Morrison did so multiple times as well.   They, of course, weren't the only ones. As this slide shows, Dr. Hill  reported her concerns to the NSC legal advisor. Mr. Kent reported his  concerns about the State Department's failure to respond to the House's  document request. The lawyers were awfully busy.   And why did President Trump's own officials--not so-called Never  Trumpers, not Democrats or Republicans, but career public servants-- report this conduct in real time? Because they knew it was wrong.   Dr. Hill said: ``It was improper, and it was inappropriate, and we  said that in the time, in real time.''   Lieutenant Colonel Vindman said: ``[The July 25] call was wrong'' and  he had a ``duty to report it.''   Ambassador Taylor said: ``Holding up of security assistance . . . for  no good policy reason, no good substantive reason, no good national  security reason, is wrong.''   Mr. Morrison admitted that he reported the July 25 call ``pretty much  right away'' and ``recommended to them that we restrict access to the  package.''   And Ms. Williams said: ``[The July 25 call] struck me as unusual and  inappropriate,'' and ``more political in nature.''   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The consensus is clear. The President's demand  for political investigations was improper, inappropriate, and wrong,  and again confirms that the requested investigations were not about  anything except Donald Trump's political gains.   Let's go to the seventh reason why you know President Trump put  himself first. American officials weren't the only ones who recognized  the political nature of these requests. Ukrainian officials did, too.  That brings us the seventh reason we know that this was against our  national interests. Ukrainian officials themselves expressed concern  that these corrupt investigations would drag them into U.S. domestic  politics.   For example, in mid-July, Ambassador Taylor texted Sondland and  Taylor and explained President Zelensky's reluctance to become a pawn  in U.S. politics. Ambassador Taylor said: ``Gordon, one thing Kurt and  I talked about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk's point''--he is a top  adviser to President Zelensky--``Sasha Danyliuk's point that President  Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely  as an instrument in Washington domestic reelection politics.''   So here you have Sasha Danyliuk, one of the top advisers to President  Zelensky affirming that his President wants to be taken seriously. It  is pretty extraordinary when a foreign leader has to communicate to  this country that they want him to take him seriously and not just as  some kind of a political pawn for political purposes. An ally dependent  on us for military support, economic support, and diplomatic support  has to say: Please take us seriously. But this is what the Ukrainians  are saying. They understood this wasn't American policy--as much as we  do--and they didn't want to be used as a pawn.   Ambassador Taylor explained his text during his testimony: ``The  whole thrust of this irregular channel was to get these investigations,  which Danyliuk and presumably Zelensky were resisting because they  didn't want to be seen to be interfering but also to be a pawn.''   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This is an important point, too. It wasn't just  that they didn't want to be seen as getting into politics, because if  they did and it looked like they were getting on the side of Donald  Trump, that would hurt their support with Democrats, and if it looked  like they were getting involved with the other side, it would hurt them  with the President. There was no benefit to Ukraine to be dragged into  this. There was no benefit to Ukraine by this, but they also didn't  want to be viewed as a pawn.   President Zelensky has his own electorate. He is a new leader. He is  a former comedian, and he wants to be taken seriously. He needs to be  taken seriously, because if the United States isn't going to take him  seriously, you can darn well bet Vladimir Putin will not take him  seriously.   So the perception--not just that there is a rift, that he can't get  military aid or it is in doubt or in question, but the impression--that  he is nothing more than a pawn, you could see how problematic that was  for President Zelensky. In other words, Ukrainian officials understood,  just as our officials understood, just as all those folks you saw-- Morrison, Vindman, Hill, and others, all the people who had to go to  the lawyers, all the people who listened to that call and understood-- that this was just wrong.   Morrison goes on to say that he is no legal expert and can't really  opine on the legality of what happened on this call, but they all knew  it was wrong. They also knew that it was damaging to bipartisan  support. They knew it was damaging to our national security. But here  we see. It wasn't just our people. It was the Ukrainians who also  understood this was a pure political errand they were being asked to  perform.   That is no way to treat an ally at war.   Now, it wasn't just the testimony of U.S. officials on this. We know  this directly from the Ukrainians. Indeed, we know this directly from  President Zelensky himself, who said: ``I am sorry, but I don't want to  be involved to democratic, open elections--elections of the USA.''   Here is Zelensky saying: ``I don't want to be involved.'' He  shouldn't be involved. He shouldn't be involved in our elections. That  is not his job, and he knows that, and it is a tragic fact that the  world's oldest democracy has to be told by this struggling democracy:  This isn't what you are supposed to do. But that is what is happening.   Let's go to the eighth reason why you can know that President Trump  put himself first, and that is because there is no serious dispute that  the White House tried to bury the call record. They tried to bury the  call record. Although President Trump has repeatedly insisted that his  July conversation with President Zelensky ``was perfect,'' the White  House apparently believed otherwise. Their own lawyers apparently  believed otherwise.   Following a head-of-state call, the President issues a summary or  readout to lock in any commitments made by the foreign leader and  publicly reinforce the core elements of the President's message.  However, no public readout was posted on the White House website  following the July 25 call. I wonder why that was.   The White House instead provided reporters with a short, incomplete  summary that, of course, omitted the major elements of the  conversation.   The short summary said:         Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke by telephone with       President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to congratulate him       on his recent election. President Trump and President       Zelenskyy discussed ways to strengthen the relationship       between the United States and Ukraine, including energy and       economic cooperation. Both leaders also expressed that they       look forward to the opportunity to meet.   [[Page S504]]     That was it. Now, I don't know about you, but that does not seem like  an accurate summary of that call. As you can see, that summary did not  mention President Trump's mention of a debunked conspiracy theory about  the 2016 election promoted by Russian President Putin. The summary did  not mention President Trump's demand that Ukraine announce an  investigation into his domestic political rival, former Vice President  Biden. The summary did not mention that President Trump praised a  corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor, who to this day continues to feed false  claims to the President through Rudy Giuliani.   If the call was ``perfect,'' if these investigations were legitimate  foreign policy, if the White House had nothing to hide, then ask  yourselves: Why did the White House's readout omit any mention of the  investigations? Why not publicly confirm that Ukraine had been asked by  the President to pursue them?   Why? Because it would have exposed the President's corruption.   Sanitizing the call readout wasn't the only step taken to cover up  the President's wrongdoing. The White House Counsel's office also took  irregular efforts to hide the call record away on a secure server used  to store highly classified information. National Security Council  Senior Director Tim Morrison, whom you saw video clips on, testified  that he requested that access to the electronic file of the call record  be restricted so that it would not be leaked.   Mr. Morrison said the call record did not meet the requirements to be  placed on the highly classified system, and Mr. Eisenberg later claimed  the call record had been placed on the highly classified system ``by  mistake.''   I am sure it was a very innocent mistake. However, mistake or no  mistake, it remained on that system until at least the third week of  September 2019. So that mistake continued from July all the way through  September.   Why were they trying to hide what the President did? This was U.S.  policy and they were proud of it. If they were really interested in  corruption, if this was about corruption, if this had nothing to do  with the President's reelection campaign, if Biden was merely an  interesting coincidence, why did they bury the record? Why did they  hide the record? Why did they put the record on a system meant for  highly classified information, which the folks in here on the  Intelligence Committee and many others can tell you is usually used for  things like covert action operations--the most sensitive secrets?   Well, this was a very sensitive political secret. This was a covert  action of a different kind. This was a corrupt action and it was  hidden, and they knew it was, and that is why they hid it. Innocent  people don't behave that way.   Let's go to the ninth reason that you know President Trump put  himself first. The clearest reason that we can tell that all that  President Trump cared about was the investigations is that President  Trump confirmed his desire for these investigations in his statements  to his agents and when this scheme was discovered to the American  people.   The very day after he solicited foreign interference to help him  cheat in the 2020 election, President Trump spoke with Gordon Sondland,  who was in Ukraine. President Trump had only one question for  Ambassador Sondland: ``So, he's going to do the investigation?''   Here is David Holmes recounting the call between President Trump and  Sondland:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Fair to say that a president of Ukraine that       is so dependent on the United States would do just about       anything within his power to please the president of the       United States if he could?        Amb. YOVANOVITCH. If he could. I'm sure there are limits,       and I understand there were a lot of discussions in the       Ukrainian government about all of this, but yeah, we are an       important relationship on the security side and on the       political side. And so, the president of Ukraine, one of the       most important functions that individual has is to make sure       the relationship with the U.S. is rock solid.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. But it isn't just the relationship itself. It  was a public meeting in the White House that would show U.S. support  for Ukraine.   A meeting with the President of the United States in the Oval Office  is one of the most forceful diplomatic signals of support that the  United States can send.  [[Page S512]]    Veteran diplomat George Kent testified to this.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Holmes then said that he heard President Trump       ask, quote, ``is he,'' meaning Zelensky, ``going to do the       investigation?'' To which you replied, ``he's going to do       it.'' And then you added that President Zelensky will do       anything that you, meaning President Trump, ask him to. Do       you recall that?        Ambassador SONDLAND. I probably said something to that       effect because I remember the meeting--the President--or       President Zelensky was very--``solicitous'' is not a good       word. He was just very willing to work with the United States       and was being very amicable. And so putting it in Trump speak       by saying he loves your ass, he'll do whatever you want,       meant that he would really work with us on a whole host of       issues.         He was not only willing. He was very eager,       right?        Ambassador SONDLAND. That's fair.         Because Ukraine depends on the United States       as its most significant ally. Isn't that correct?        Ambassador SONDLAND. One of its most, absolutely.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In other words, any request President Trump  made to Ukraine would be difficult to refuse.   So when President Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, as  well as the wild conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, those were  absolutely interpreted by President Zelensky and his staff as a demand.   And that is where the White House meeting enters into the equation.  When Ukraine did not immediately cave to Rudy Giuliani in the spring  and announce the phony investigations, President Trump ratcheted up the  pressure. As leverage, he chose the White House meeting he dangled  during his April 21 call, precisely because President Trump knew how  important the meeting was to Ukraine.   Following their visit to Kyiv for the new Ukrainian leader's  inauguration, Ambassador Sondland, Ambassador Volker, and Secretary  Perry met with President Trump, and each of them encouraged the  President to schedule the meeting. Here is what Ambassador Sondland had  to say.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Amb. SONDLAND. We advised the president of the strategic       importance of Ukraine and the value of strengthening the       relationship with President Zelensky. To support this       reformer, we asked the White House for two things. First, a       working phone call between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, and       second, a working oval office visit. In our view, both were       vital to cementing the US-Ukraine relationship, demonstrating       support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression and       advancing broader US foreign policy interests.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. So even though this meeting was critical to  both Ukraine and America, President Trump ignored all of his policy  advisers and expressed reluctance to meet with the new Ukrainian  President. He refused to schedule an actual date.   He claimed that Ukraine ``tried to take me down'' in 2016 and  directed that three U.S. officials ``talk to Rudy.'' And even though on  May 29 the President signed a letter reiterating his earlier invitation  for President Zelensky to visit the White House, he still did not  specify a date.   But then President Trump went further. He met with Ukraine's  adversary, Ukraine's enemy, our enemy. President Trump met with Russia.   This didn't go unnoticed. Ukrainian officials became concerned when  President Trump scheduled that face-to-face meeting with Vladimir Putin  at the G20 summit in Japan on June 28.   Mr. Holmes testified on this particular point and the troubling  signal that meeting sent to our friend, to our ally, Ukraine.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          But the sequence certainly makes sense, right?        Amb. SONDLAND. Yeah, it does.         You talked to President Trump.        Amb. SONDLAND. Yeah.         You told Kurt Volker to call you. You left a       message for Kurt Volker. Kurt Volker sent this text message       to  [[Page S515]]       Andriy Yermak to prepare President Zelensky, and then       President Trump had a phone call where President Zelensky       spoke very similar to what was in this text message. Right?        Amb. SONDLAND. Right.         And you would agree that the message in this,       that is expressed here is that President Zelensky needs to       convince Trump that he will do the investigations in order to       nail down the date for a visit to Washington, DC. Is that       correct?        Ambassador SONDLAND. That's correct.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Indeed, on the July 25 call when President  Trump asked for a favor, President Zelensky was ready with the magic  words. He said:         I also wanted to thank you for your invitation to visit the       United States, specifically Washington DC. On the other hand,       I want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the       case and will work on the investigation.    This for that.   ``Read the transcript,'' President Trump says. We have read the  transcript, and it is damning evidence of a corrupt quid pro quo.   The evidence against Donald Trump is hiding in plain sight. During  our presentation, we walked through the serious issues presented in the  plain reading of the July 25 call, but now you can see the entire  content of how this corrupt parade of horribles unfolded.   The quid pro quo was discussed in text messages, emails, voicemails,  calls, and meetings amongst top administration officials and top  Ukrainian officials. Indeed, President Trump's message was delivered to  either President Zelensky or his top aides on four different occasions  in the month of July--four different occasions: on July 2, in Toronto;  on July 10, at the White House; on July 19, during a call between  Zelensky and Ambassador Sondland; and then on July 25, before the call  with the two leaders.   Before that fateful call on July 25, President Zelensky understood  exactly what needed to be done--a quid pro quo.   The evidence of President Trump's grave misconduct does not end with  that July 25 call. From that point onward, President Zelensky was on  notice that it was President Trump himself who demanded those two phony  political investigations.   After the July 25 call, the Ukrainians followed up with President  Trump's direction and began to coordinate with Rudolph Giuliani, the  President's political bagman. Acting on the President's orders, U.S.  diplomats, including Ambassador Sondland and Ambassador Volker, worked  with Mr. Giuliani to continue pressuring Ukraine to announce the phony  investigations that President Trump sought in exchange for that Oval  Office meeting. This is corruption and abuse of power in its purest  form.   Over the next 2 weeks, Mr. Giuliani directed Ambassadors Sondland and  Volker to negotiate a public statement for President Zelensky  announcing the investigations that President Trump corruptly demanded.  Here is how Ambassador Sondland described this August timeframe.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. Mr. Giuliani conveyed to Secretary       Perry, Ambassador Volker and others that President Trump       wanted a public statement from President Zelensky committing       to investigations of Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr.       Giuliani expressed those requests directly to the Ukrainians       and Mr. Giuliani also expressed those requests directly to       us. We all understood that these prerequisites for the White       House call and the White House meeting reflected President       Trump's desires and requirements.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent  described the pursuit of President Trump's corrupt demands as  ``infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine.'' Here is his full testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          And it does not mention Burisma or the 2016       election interference, correct?        Ambassador VOLKER. It does not.         And you testified in your deposition that you       and Ambassador Sondland and Mayor Giuliani had a conversation       about this draft after you received it. Is that right?        Ambassador VOLKER. That is correct.         And Mr. Giuliani said that if the statement       did not include Burisma and 2016 election, it would not have       any credibility. Is that right?        Ambassador VOLKER. That's correct.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Giuliani, acting on behalf of President  Trump, made clear that the statement from the Ukrainians had to target  Vice President Biden--for reasons outlined earlier today--and it had to  mention the conspiracy theory about Ukraine interfering in the 2016  election.   After Mr. Giuliani conveyed this on the telephone call, Ambassadors  Volker and Sondland texted Mr. Yermak and requested a call to convey  that message. Ambassador Volker says: ``Hi Andrey--we spoke with Rudy.  When is good to call you?'' And Ambassador Sondland makes clear the  urgency, texting: ``Important. Do you have 5 minutes?''   Now, Ambassador Volker made clear to Mr. Yermak that the statement  needed the two key items Mr. Giuliani required for the President.   Here is Ambassador Volker's testimony to that effect.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Amb. VOLKER. Hi, Andre. Good talking. Following is text       with insert at the end for the two key items. We will work on       official request.         And then you will see the highlighted portion       of the next text. The other is identical to your previous one       and then it just adds including the . . . Including Burisma       and the 2016 elections. Is that right?        Amb. VOLKER: That is correct.         And that was what Mr. Giuliani insisted on       adding to the statement?        Amb. VOLKER. That's what he said will be necessary for that       to be credible.         And the Ukrainians ultimately did not issue       the statement. Is that right?        Amb. VOLKER. That is correct.         And President Zelensky ultimately did not get       the Oval Office meeting either, did he?        Amb. VOLKER. Not yet.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. President Zelensky is still waiting for that  Oval Office meeting.   Ronald Reagan, in a speech that he delivered in 1987 at the foot of  the Berlin Wall, in the midst of the Cold War, said to the world:         East and West do not mistrust each other because we are       armed. We are armed because we mistrust each other. And our       differences are not about weapons. It's about liberty.    The Trump-Ukraine scandal is certainly about weapons. It is about the  unlawful withholding of $391 million in security aid. It is about a  withheld, sought-after Oval Office meeting. It is about trying to cheat  in the 2020 election. It is about corrupting our democracy. It is about  undermining America's national security. It is about a stunning abuse  of power. It is about obstruction of Congress. It is about the need for  us here in this great Chamber to have a fair trial with witnesses and  evidence. It is about a corrupt quid pro quo.   Perhaps, above all, it is about liberty, because in America, for all  of us, what keeps us free from tyranny is the sacred principle that in  this great country no one is above the law.   Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, President's  counsel, we have reviewed the mountain of evidence that proves the  President's official act in his scheme: the corrupt bargain of a White  House meeting in exchange for Ukraine announcing sham political  investigations.   You heard from each relevant witness with firsthand knowledge of the  President's corrupt scheme--Sondland, Taylor, Volker, Hill, and  Vindman--that there was a corrupt deal: an Oval Office meeting for  investigations--quid pro quo, this for that.   You also saw inescapable documentary proof that clearly proves a  corrupt quid pro quo. The evidence is consistent, corroborated. It  comes in many forms, from many individuals who are lifelong public  servants with no motivation to lie. In short, the evidence is  overwhelming.   Given how much we have gone through, let's review some of those  career public servants' testimony, who state clearly that they too  believed it was a quid pro quo--a this for that--because it is really  powerful to hear directly from them.   Let's watch Ambassador Taylor.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Amb. TAYLOR. By mid-July, it was becoming clear to me that       the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the       investigations of Burisma, and alleged Ukrainian interference       and the 2016 U.S. elections. It was also clear that this       condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had       come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. It was clear that these were conditions  driven by irregular policies. We know this too because Ambassador  Sondland said so at the July 10 meeting. Dr. Fiona Hill described the  scene in Ambassador Bolton's office, where the quid pro quo was made  clear.   Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. Ukrainian Mr. Danylyuk starts to ask about a       White House meeting, and Ambassador Bolton was trying to       parry this back. Although he's the National Security Advisor,       he's not in charge of scheduling the meeting. We have input       recommending the meetings, and this goes through a whole       process. It's not Ambassador Bolton's role to start pulling       out the schedule and start saying, ``Right, well, we're going       to look and see if this Tuesday in this month is going to       work with us.'' And he does not as a matter of course like to       discuss the details of these meetings, he likes to leave them       to, you know, the appropriate staff for this. So, this was       already going to be an uncomfortable issue.        As Ambassador Bolton was trying to move that part of the       discussion away, I think he was going to try to deflect it       onto another wrap-up topic, Ambassador Sondland leaned in       basically to say, ``Well, we have an agreement that there       will be a meeting, and the  [[Page S517]]       specific investigations are put underway.'' And that's when I       saw Ambassador Bolton stiffen. I was sitting behind him in       the chair, and I saw him sit back slightly like this. He'd       been more moving forward, like I am, to the table. And, for       me, that was an unmistakable body language, and it caught my       attention. And then he looked up to the clock and, you know,       at his watch, or at his wrist in any case. Again, I am       sitting behind him . . . and basically said, ``Well, you       know, it's been really great to see you. I'm afraid I've got       another--another meeting.''    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. ``Ambassador Bolton stiffened''--quite a  description. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's testimony is consistent with  Dr. Hill's recollection of the July 10 meeting, and that it was made  clear that the deal for the White House meeting was investigations.    Let's watch Lieutenant Colonel Vindman   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          I want to move now to that July 10th meeting       that you referenced, Colonel Vindman. What exactly did       Ambassador Sondland say when the Ukrainian officials raised       the idea of a White House meeting?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. As I recall, he referred to specific       investigations that the Ukrainians would have to deliver in       order to get these meetings.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, firsthand  knowledge--they would have to deliver in order to get these meetings.   It was also clear that this wasn't about general investigations about  corruption. This wasn't about corruption at all. Ambassador Sondland  directed everyone--including the Ukrainian officials--to reconvene in  the Ward Room, where he discussed the arrangement he had reached with  Mr. Mulvaney in more detail. He made clear that it was about specific  investigations that would benefit President Trump personally.   Here is Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testifying, where he explains that  Ambassador Sondland referred to the Bidens, Burisma, and the 2016  election, which had nothing to do with national security policy.   Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Were the investigations, the specific       investigations that Ambassador Sondland referenced in the       larger meeting, also discussed in the Ward Room meeting?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. They were.         And what did Ambassador Sondland say?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Ambassador Sondland referred to       investigations into the Bidens, Burisma, and 2016.         How did you respond, if at all?        Lt. Col. VINDMAN. I said that this request to conduct these       meetings was inappropriate--these investigations was       inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security       policy.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. ``Nothing to do with national security  policy''--that about some sums it up. Doesn't it? It has nothing to do  with national security policy. President Trump's scheme was for his  personal interest, not national security. And his testimony, once  again, is corroborated.   Dr. Hill joined the Ward Room conversation later and also recalled  the discussion of investigations and a White House meeting, and that  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman said: ``This is inappropriate. We're the  National Security Council; we can't be involved in this.''   Here is her testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. And so when I came in, Gordon Sondland was       basically saying, well, look, we have a deal here that there       will be a meeting. I have a deal here with Chief of Staff       Mulvaney. There will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up       or announce these investigations into 2016 in Burisma.        And I cut it off immediately there. Because by this point,       having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over again on the       television and all of the issues that he was asserting, by       this point it was clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens,       because Giuliani was laying it out there. I could see why       Colonel Vindman was alarmed. And he said: ``This is       inappropriate. We're the National Security Council; we can't       be involved in this.''    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. And what's more, as Ambassador Sondland  told us, everyone was in the loop--meaning, it became clear that  President Trump was directing this.   Dr. Hill, who at one point confronted Gordon Sondland over this  arrangement, further reached the conclusion that he was acting on the  President's orders and coordinating with other senior officials. He had  made this clear: he was briefing the President on all this.   Here is Dr. Hill's testimony. Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. So, I was upset with him that he wasn't fully       telling us about all of the meetings that he was having. And       he said to me: ``But I'm briefing the president. I'm briefing       Chief of Staff Mulvaney. I'm briefing Secretary Pompeo and       I've talked to Ambassador Bolton. Who else do I have to deal       with?''        And the point is we have a robust interagency process that       deals with Ukraine. It includes Mr. Holmes, it includes       Ambassador Taylor as, the Charge in Ukraine, it includes a       whole load of other people. But it struck me when yesterday,       when you put up on the screen Ambassador Sondland's emails       and who was on these emails and he said, these [are] the       people who need to know, that he was absolutely right.       Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand,       and we were being involved in national security foreign       policy. And those two things had just divulged.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The evidence is very clear: The White  House meeting would only be scheduled if Ukraine announced the  investigations that everyone, including the Ukrainians, understood to  be purely political efforts to benefit the President. The only way to  come to a different conclusion is to ignore the evidence.   One additional way you can tell that this conduct is truly corrupt,  and not U.S. foreign policy as usual, is that these officials--these  lifetime, career public servants--didn't just testify about this in  impeachment proceedings. They contemporaneously reported this conduct  in realtime.   Their reactions illustrate that this was not the kind of thing that  both parties do when they have the White House. This was something  different, something corrupt, something ``insidious,'' to use  Ambassador Sondland's characterization in later testimony.   The officials who instinctively recoiled from the corrupt deal that  Sondland blurted out were distinguished patriotic public servants.   Let's go through some specific examples of that evidence.   After the July 10 meeting we just talked about, where Ambassador  Sondland made clear the agreement that the White House meetings were  conditioned on the investigations, Dr. Hill consulted with Ambassador  Bolton and told him what she had heard. Ambassador Bolton gave her, as  she put it, a ``very specific instruction'' to report this conduct in  realtime, and she did.   Here is her testimony. Let's watch.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. The specific instruction was that I had to go to       the lawyers, to John Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the       National Security Council, to basically say, you tell       Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told me, that I am not part of       this whatever drug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are       cooking up.         What did you understand him to mean by the       drug deal Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up?        Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations for a meeting.         Did you go speak to the lawyers?        Dr. HILL. I certainly did.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Again, investigations for a meeting, the  quid pro quo.   Consistent with Dr. Hill's recounting, after both the July 10 meeting  and the July 25 call, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman reported what he had  learned through the lawyers.   Here he is discussing that later interaction. Let's see it.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          What did you understand it to mean when--that       Zelensky had concerns about being an instrument in Washington       domestic reelection politics?        Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk understood that these       investigations were pursuant to Mr. Giuliani's request to       develop information, to find information about Burisma and       the Bidens. This was very well known in public. Mr. Giuliani       made this point clear in several instances in the beginning--      in the springtime. And Mr. Danyliuk was aware that that was a       problem.         And would you agree that, because President       Zelensky is worried about this, they understood, at least,       that there was some pressure for them to pursue these       investigations? Is that fair?        Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk indicated that President       Zelensky certainly understood it, that he did not want to get       involved in these type of activities.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. As the slide shows, on July 21,  Ambassador Taylor relayed the same message to Ambassadors Volker and  Sondland, making clear that ``President Zelensky is sensitive about  Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in  Washington domestic politics.''   But Ambassador Sondland did not back down. Instead, Ambassador  Sondland reinforced the importance that President Zelensky reassure  President Trump of his commitment to investigations. He said:  ``Absolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the  relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the  alternative.'' The ``pretext'' that Ambassador Sondland referred to was  President Trump's requirement that Ukraine announce investigations that  would benefit him personally and politically. He wanted help in  cheating.   It wasn't just Ambassador Taylor. Deputy Assistant Secretary George  Kent, too, testified that Ukraine was ``very uncomfortable'' when the  issue of investigations was raised during the negotiations of the  statement in August of 2019.   As the slide shows, Mr. Kent said:         I had a conversation with Charge Taylor in which he . . .       indicated that Special Representative Volker had been       engaging Andriy Yermak; that the President and his private       attorney Rudy Giuliani were interested in the initiation of       investigations and that Yermak was very uncomfortable when       this was raised with him, and suggested that if that were the       case, if that were really the position of the United States,       it should be done officially and put in writing . . . And I       told Bill Taylor, that's wrong, and we shouldn't be doing       that as a matter of U.S. policy.    When asked, ``What did he say?'' Mr. Kent said, ``He said he agreed  with me.''   What is also important to note here is why. Ukraine made this clear.  If the United States was asking them for investigations, especially  investigations that made them uncomfortable, they should be done  ``officially'' and ``put in writing.''   Mr. Kent's testimony shows that. He said:         Yermak was very uncomfortable when this was raised with       him, and suggested that if that were the case, if that were       really the position of the United States, it should be done       officially and put in writing.    And this wasn't the only time. On August 13, Mr. Yermak asked  Ambassador Volker ``whether any requests had ever been made by the U.S.  to investigate election interference in 2016.''   Now, this makes sense. Normally, if something is actually about  official U.S. policy, the President would go through official U.S.  channels, but, as we have seen here, he didn't. His personal attorney  made this--this wasn't about foreign policy; it was something that  would benefit President Trump personally.   The administration officials made this clear too. There was  undisputed testimony that the investigations were not part of U.S.  policy. In fact, they diverged with the U.S. national security and our  Nation's values. The Department of Justice has made this crystal clear  in public statements. There has never been an official asked officially  to do any of these investigations. And that is how we know this is so  very wrong.   Even Ukraine, a struggling, new country, knew this was wrong, and  they stood up to President Trump and said no. Yermak--remember, he was  Zelensky's chief aide--was basically saying: You want an investigation?  Please send us a formal request from DOJ. Show us you are willing to  stand behind the legitimacy of what you are asking. But Ambassador  Volker was unable to provide that information. And that is why--even  though the White House meeting was so critical to Ukraine, even though  Ukraine needed it so desperately--they still wouldn't make the  statement with key additions: President Trump's political  investigations, which were solely to help his reelection and had  nothing to do with foreign policy.   President Zelensky tried in different ways to resist the pressure of  becoming  [[Page S519]]  a ``pawn'' in U.S. politics. Even though the Oval Office meeting was  important, Zelensky repeatedly tried to find a way around committing to  the investigations that President Trump demanded--or at the very least,  schedule it before taking any official action. This is what you saw in  the negotiation over the statement in August, and this is why even  President Trump's second official act--withholding the White House  meeting--was not enough to make Ukraine do his dirty work.   Senators, we are coming to the end of a section of the presentation  regarding the withholding of the White House meeting. So I want to just  quickly remind us one last time about the central points that we have  covered.   President Trump exercised his official power when he withheld an Oval  Office meeting that was critical to Ukraine, and he did this for only  one reason and one reason only: President Trump conditioned that Oval  Office meeting on Ukraine's announcing investigations that would help  him politically. This had nothing to do with official U.S. policy.  President Trump directed U.S. officials who were supposed to work for  the American people to work, instead, with his personal agent, Rudy  Giuliani, and focus only on his personal political interests.   Acting on behalf of the President and with the President's full  knowledge, Mr. Giuliani worked with those U.S. officials to carry out  the President's scheme. They pressured the Ukrainian Government to act  as a personal opposition research firm for President Trump. They tried  to use a foreign government to dig up dirt on his client's rival,  former Vice President Biden, an American citizen--all so President  Trump could win his election. They made clear that Ukraine would not  get the official U.S. Government support it so desperately needed-- support that the President's national security team conveyed was  necessary to advance our own national security objectives--unless  President Zelensky announced the sham investigations.   Remember that an abuse of power occurs when a President corruptly  exercises official power to obtain a personal benefit in a way that  ignores or injures the national interest.   Senators, that is exactly what happened here. By withholding a White  House meeting, President Trump used official power to corruptly  pressure Ukraine. Indeed, the entire quid pro quo--the ``this for  that''--the entire campaign to use the Oval Office meeting as some kind  of asset for the President's reelection campaign--was corrupt. U.S.  officials knew this. Ukrainians knew this too. I think, deep down, we  all know it, and I think the American people know it.   Senators, I ask you this one question: Is that not an abuse of power?  Was it OK? If it is not an abuse of power, then what is? Is it OK to  withhold official acts from a foreign country until that foreign  country assists in your reelection effort?   If any other public official did that, he or she would be held  accountable. I know, if one of us did that, we would be held  accountable. The only way to hold this President accountable is right  here in this trial. Otherwise, you would be telling Ukraine and the  world that it is OK for the President to use our Oval Office and this  country's prestige and power for himself instead of for the American  people.   If we allow this gross abuse of power to continue, this President  will have free rein to abuse his control of U.S. foreign policy for  personal interests and so would any other future President. Then this  President and all Presidents become above the law. A President could  take the powers of the greatest office in this land and use those  powers not for the country, not for the American people but for him or  herself.   I ask you to make sure this does not happen because, in this country,  no one--no one--is above the law.   (The above statement is spoken in Spanish.)   I now yield to Mrs. Demings.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess
