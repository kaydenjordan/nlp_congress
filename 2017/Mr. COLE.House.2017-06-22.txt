 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 396 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 396         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 2842) to provide for the conduct of       demonstration projects to test the effectiveness of       subsidized employment for TANF recipients. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways       and Means now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to       consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment       under the five-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       115-22. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be       considered as read. All points of order against that       amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived. No       amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any       Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any       amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill       or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made in       order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of June 22, 2017, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules, as though       under clause 1 of rule XV, relating to the bill (H.R. 2353)       to reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical       Education Act of 2006.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule for consideration of a very important measure. The  resolution provides for consideration of H.R. 2842, Accelerating  Individuals into the Workforce Act.                                time  1230    The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2842 is a commonsense proposal to help transition  welfare recipients into steady, paying jobs. Moving welfare recipients  into work is a central goal of TANF, the Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families program. This bipartisan bill would incentivize employers to  hire TANF recipients and help subsidize these new employees' salaries  for up to a year to allow them to transition into the workforce.   The policy idea behind H.R. 2842 is simple: under this bill, States  can establish partnerships with employers to hire recipients of TANF  dollars. Through these partnerships, employers would receive a subsidy  of up to 50 percent of the wage for a TANF recipient while the other 50  percent would be paid by the employer.   Beneficiaries would have to meet three requirements: they must be a  TANF recipient, they must be unemployed, and they must have an income  of 20 percent or less of the Federal poverty level. H.R. 2842 will  direct our resources to the neediest individuals and families to help  them accelerate these welfare recipients back into the workforce.   Mr. Speaker, President Ronald Reagan once noted: ``We should measure  welfare's success by how many people leave welfare, not by how many  people are added.''   The legislation under consideration in today's rule is a fulfillment  of that promise. Under H.R. 2842, State and local governments will be  able to better utilize their TANF dollars to help move individuals into  paying work and eventually help them transition out of the welfare  system altogether.   Helping people get back to work is a great deal for the individuals  who will be helped under this program, for the employers, for the  economy, and for the American people. This bill is, at its core, about  helping unemployed Americans get back to work.   Mr. Speaker, we are a nation filled with hardworking people, and I  have seen over and over again how badly many of the unemployed want to  return to work. Many, if not most, recipients of TANF are in the  program not because they want to be, but because they have been forced  to be by circumstance. These unemployed Americans want nothing more  than to return to the dignity of the workforce as quickly as they are  able to do so. This bill will help remove barriers to employment and  will incentivize employers to hire current TANF recipients.   Workers re-entering the workforce is a good thing for society. Not  only will workers who receive jobs under this program be taken off of  welfare rolls, thus ensuring the continued success of that program, but  these new workers will be better able to contribute to better lives for  themselves, for their families, and for their communities.   Here in Washington, we too often describe policy solutions as being  ``commonsense'' or ``win-win,'' but in this case it is absolutely true.  H.R. 2842 is a commonsense solution and is a win-win for everyone  involved: the workers, the employers, the community, and the country.   That is why this legislation will receive a substantial bipartisan  vote tomorrow. Whatever their differences, Republicans and Democrats  alike want to put unemployed people back to work. This bill will  actually succeed in doing that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by agreeing with my good friend on many  of the points that he made. I was particularly struck by the point he  made about the low participation rate in the labor force. That has been  a problem that has been with us, quite frankly, for, as he pointed out,  several decades, and it is one that has gotten worse.   That is attributable in large part to another point that my friend  made, effectively the thing around here we call the skills gap. We have  literally millions of jobs available in this country, and employers are  ready to hire people but they simply don't have the training.   I couldn't agree more with my good friend that on-the-job training is  sometimes the best training. You actually acquire the skill that you  need to be successful, and the situation of this legislation will  actually, again, offset the cost of that to the employer and, by the  way, not add any cost to the taxpayer.   That is something we ought to talk about as well. We are just taking  money that we would have been spending anyway, and we are spending it a  lot more productively.   Now, my friend is right. This is a new program. This is a new  approach. So trying it out for a year, spending $100 million--a lot of  money--but obviously we would spend more this way if we would know this  would be successful. But I can't help but think it will be successful.   It is important to note that this bill is actually, again,  exceptionally bipartisan. I was struck, as I hope my friend was,  yesterday when we were in Rules Committee considering this legislation.  We are used to seeing the members of the Ways and Means Committee come  up and sort of fight in front of us. Instead, they actually came up arm  in arm with a bipartisan proposal that they had agreed to that, again,  is an excellent, excellent work.   It is exactly the way that Congress should work, quite frankly: find  common ground and advance commonsense solutions that make life better  for the American people. In this case, at least, I think we have  succeeded in doing that.   It is also important to note that the rule authorizes the  consideration of H.R. 2353, the so-called Perkins grant program. The  Perkins grant is something we are pretty familiar with in Oklahoma.  This is Federal money that moves into career tech systems that helps  actually, again, workers acquire the necessary skills to be productive,  quite often, again, working with the employer who has already got the  jobs available. We then train the worker at a career tech system partly  funded with Federal dollars, and that person is assured the job the day  they walk out.   I suspect that bill, like this bill, when it finally reaches the  floor will also have substantial bipartisan support. I want to pledge  to my good friend that we are going to continue to work together on  things like this. I don't think anybody disagrees about putting  Americans back to work. Workers would rather be at work than, frankly,  just receiving government assistance and not able to go work. So this  bill does that.    I want to urge support of the rule and, again, the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Decades of experience tell us that the most effective antipoverty  program is a job, and this bill helps low-income Americans earn success  through the dignity of work.   States actually, as my good friends on the other side know, spend  very little of their TANF funding on moving people into jobs. Today,  half of all TANF recipients are neither working nor preparing for work.  This bill ensures that money only goes to those who are working,  providing individuals with paychecks in lieu of benefit checks, a key  tenet in welfare reform.   This pilot only provides funding for one fiscal year, repurposing  money that has already been appropriated and, frankly, using it in a  better way than it was originally appropriated to achieve.   The bill requires that States report on outcome measures and provide  high-quality evaluations so that Congress can make appropriate  decisions after we have actually seen the results yielded by the  program.   And finally, as we have been pointing out, but I think around here it  is always worth pointing out multiple times, where actually CBO  estimates the bill has no cost. So we are actually doing something good  without increasing expenditures for the taxpayers, and, indeed, we are  probably in the process of creating new taxpayers, people who can  contribute to the wealth and the activity and the prosperity of the  country; and people, honestly, who want to contribute to the wealth and  the activity; and employers who want to provide people with an  opportunity to improve themselves and become more productive.   So it is a good bill all the way around, and, again, I will be urging  the passage of the rule and the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have been having such a wonderful bipartisan moment  here. My good friend from Oregon, and appropriately, wants to change  the tenor a little bit.   Let me begin by actually congratulating my good friend from Oregon  because he is a serious legislator and does serious things, and I am  probably going to find myself on the same side with him on the issue of  air traffic controllers where I think his points have been very well  made.   On this particular piece of legislation, I must admit, I have not had  the opportunity. I don't sit on my friend's committee to actually read  it, but I suspect the committee hasn't picked it up and dealt with it  either.   And just from a process standpoint, I think the appropriate thing to  do would be for the committee to actually review it. It could be  amended in committee, as indeed this bill was, and then we would have  the opportunity to consider it on the floor. But to bring it to the  floor immediately, to me, is premature, legislatively.   I also want to take issue, on the record, with my friends of the  President of the United States in terms of job creation. I suspect  President Trump, in his private life, has created more jobs than just  about anybody in the Congress of the United States, and I think he has  laid forward some incredibly important proposals to continue and build  on his personal record, now that he is President of the United States.   One of those proposals, as my friends are surely aware, because I  think they largely agree with it, is to enhance the apprenticeship  program announcement he made recently. Another one that my friends may  not be quite so much in agreement with, he has laid out his principles  for tax reform.   The greatest engine for job growth is never going to be the Federal  Government. It is going to always be the private sector. And if we  could, as the President has suggested, cut corporate tax rates,  incentivize the return of profit, something where perhaps we can work  together, that are stranded overseas, bring them back here and invest  in America, I think we would create a lot more jobs a lot more quickly  and in a lot more sustainable fashion than we would do through  additional public spending.   Finally, I think we ought to give the President a little bit of  credit for emphasizing and bringing home American jobs, something that  actually began once he was President-elect. We saw it in Indiana with  Carrier air-conditioning. We have seen it in other cases where he has  promoted the sale of American arms in the Middle East where we have got  substantial things.   So I think this is a President who actually gets up each and every  day and thinks profoundly about what can we do to create an overall  ecosystem, an environment, if you will, that will incentivize private  investment, private employment, American jobs, and bringing American  companies back to this country.   I think he is actually off to an exceptionally good start in those  areas, and I look forward to working with him on that. I suspect we  will see a tax proposal on this floor in the not-too-distant future-- our friends on Ways and Means are working on it now--that will mirror  many of the principles that the President laid out in his initial draft  discussion of what he thinks we ought to do.   And that one change, changing the Tax Code, I think, will do more  than  [[Page H5064]]  all the programs that we would work on, many of them worthy programs,  many of them things, I think, where the Federal Government does have a  role.   I will agree with my friend from Florida, I am disturbed about some  of the cuts in training programs. I have seen those programs work and  work well, and I suspect the President will find out, as other  Presidents have found out--we used to routinely praise President  Obama's budget on the floor. It never got very many votes. I don't  think it ever got any Democratic votes--that, you know, Presidents  propose, as they should, that is their prerogative, they run the  executive branch, but, at the end of the day, it is Congress that makes  the final funding decisions.   I happen to know a little bit about those programs because they come  through my subcommittee on appropriations, and I want to assure my  friends they are not going to disappear. And we may have to make some  tough choices, as you always have to do, in appropriated dollars, but  on many of the programs that I know my friend cares about and has  championed in his distinguished career, they are going to be protected,  and we are going to try and work in a bipartisan fashion in those areas  and keep those things going.   But, at the end of the day, I think the President's record on job  creation will be outstanding, and I think the actions that he has taken  in the opening part of his administration are a testament to how  seriously he takes the challenge of making sure that every American has  a decent job, a job that pays a good wage, a job that will provide for  his or her family, and a job that will give them an opportunity to live  a life of dignity and prosperity, something we want every American to  have a chance at.   So with that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by addressing a couple of points that my  friend made. There will be places we agree; there will be places we  disagree. I think too often around here we talk about how nothing gets  done when this has actually been an extraordinarily productive period  in terms of passing legislation. We are going to have differences on  some of that legislation, there is no question. There is a reason why  God created a Democratic Party and a Republican Party, and it probably  wasn't to always agree all the time, but it was to challenge one  another and try to work together when they could or define alternative  paths when they felt they must, and let the American people make the  decision.   Fortunately, we are blessed to live in a country where they get to  make that decision on a regular basis like clockwork. They have been  making some decisions recently. I think the President has had a pretty  good run in special elections. We are pretty pleased with the decisions  they have been making. But at some point they will change their mind-- they always do--and they will decide somebody else has a better way.   I think in the interim we ought to stress occasionally so the  American people know when we do work together. I actually was home  after we managed to pass healthcare through this particular body, and  that bill moved through multiple committees, had multiple amendments,  lots of negotiation. Obviously it is in the Senate now. I think that  process will start over there. But the day before we passed it,  actually, we came together in a really quite remarkable way. We passed  an omnibus spending bill of over $1 trillion. That bill had worked  through the Appropriations Committee of each House, 12 different bills  put together to fund the Federal Government. That particular bill gave  us the largest increase in defense spending in about a decade, the  largest increase in border security money in about a decade. It gave us  a substantial increase in money at the National Institutes of Health  and at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, areas that  Democrats and Republicans alike have been working together on and feel  very strongly about.   That bill also broke the one-to-one relationship--pretty artificial  relationship, in my view--that President Obama had laid down that, if  you increase defense spending, you have to automatically increase  domestic spending whether you need to or not or whether you can afford  to or not.  [[Page H5065]]  Frankly, that bill actually passed with a majority of my friends on the  Democratic side in both the House and the Senate and a majority of  Republicans in the House and the Senate voting for the same bill and  Donald Trump signing the bill.    Now, when I go home and I explain that to people, they look at me  with a blank stare. It is like: What? That really happened? One  trillion dollars with all those different elements in there and a  majority of Democrats voted for it and a majority of Republicans voted  for it and Donald Trump signed it?   I say: Yeah.   They are amazed. They have never heard about it. They have never seen  it. I think that is because sometimes we present a false narrative of  constant conflict. There is certainly plenty of conflict here. Look, I  have some sympathy with the minority. Having been in the minority  myself, you always feel shut out. But this is an occasion--this  legislation, and, frankly, that spending bill--when my friends  certainly weren't shut out. They participated, and they participated  vigorously, and they contributed in the process.   I am with my friend. We need to do more of that. As a matter of fact,  I think you will see it is happening right now. If you go to the  Defense Committee, they are working on their authorization bill. That  committee is the most bipartisan committee probably in Congress. Every  time they report something out on an authorization--I think they have  63 or 64 members, something like that--the vote is always like 60 to 3.  They have clearly put aside their partisan differences to work  together.   In this bill, we have done exactly the same thing. So while we are  going to have some points where we disagree, we are going to have some  opportunities to agree and come together. And I pledge to my friend I  will continue to work with him to try and see that we find more of  them.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all of the Members,  obviously, to support the rule, but I am sure my good friends on the  other side probably won't accept the invitation. That is okay. This is  a process vote and they have got other matters they want on the floor,  and I certainly understand that they will be opposing our rule and  trying to offer an alternative.   But when the matter counts, when the actual legislation reaches the  floor, I think H.R. 2842 will draw broad bipartisan support. This House  is taking steps to help workers leave welfare rolls and return to the  workforce. Under this bill, employers will be incentivized to hire TANF  recipients and will help bring the unemployed up into the workforce and  the economy.   This bill is a commonsense bipartisan solution that will benefit  everyone: the workers, the employers, the community, the economy, and  the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle for their work on this important piece of legislation. I think if  we can get it through this House and we get it through the Senate, I am  sure that Mr. Trump will be more than happy to sign it.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An amendment to H. Res. 396 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2510) to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to       authorize appropriations for State water pollution control       revolving funds, and for other purposes. The first reading of       the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.       After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion       of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee       shall rise and report the bill to the House with such       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except       one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the       Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to       no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day       the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of       business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the       Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec.4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2510.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
