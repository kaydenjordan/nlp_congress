 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 8 minutes prior to the rollcall vote.    Madam President, the Senate will soon vote on a  Congressional Review Act resolution of disapproval to overturn the  Biden administration's unfair student loan schemes. These schemes  transfer the burden of $400 billion in Federal student loans from those  who willingly took on that debt to American taxpayers who never went to  college and have already fulfilled their commitment to pay back their  loans.   The resolution would also end the pause on student loan payments  which, by August, will cost taxpayers almost $200 billion. President  Biden has extended this pause 6 times for a total of 31 months, far  beyond the original justification of the ongoing pandemic.   Make no mistake, these reckless student loan schemes do not forgive  debt. They transfer the burden from those  [[Page S1817]]  who willingly took out the loans to go to college to make more money  when they graduated to Americans who never attended college or who  already paid back their loans.   These policies are as unfair as they are responsible. Where is the  forgiveness for the guy who didn't go to college but is working to pay  off the loan on the truck he takes to work? What about the woman who  paid off her student loans but now struggles to afford her mortgage? Is  the administration providing them relief? No. Instead, the  administration would not only have them pay their bills but the bills  of those who decided to go to college to make more money.   President Biden's plan does nothing to address the problems that  created the debt in the first place. It doesn't hold colleges or  universities accountable for rising costs.   According to the college board, in the last 30 years, tuitions and  fees have jumped at private nonprofit colleges by 80 percent. Public 4- year institutions have jumped 124 percent.   According to the Center for Responsible Federal Budget, if the  student loan transfer goes into effect, students and taxpayers would be  back in the same situation in 5 years. In 5 years, we will be right  back where we are now because we are not reforming that which got us  here. And total debt will again reach $1.7 trillion.   What is the plan for 5 years from now? The scheme also does not  ensure that students are prepared for life after college. It creates a  terrible moral hazard that signals to students that Federal student  loans are not real commitments. It tells colleges that no matter how  high they raise their prices or how low the quality of education they  provide, the Federal Government will cover the tab, courtesy of the  American taxpayer.   This is not leadership. We cannot spend our way out of the problem of  ever-increasing costs of higher education. For Americans who cannot  afford their debt or who want a proactive approach for paying off their  loan commitments, Congress has already authorized 31 different active  programs that help or forgive student loans. That is 31 different  programs already in place to help forgive or offset student loans. They  range from total forgiveness for teachers to loan cancellations for law  enforcement officers, military, early childhood educators, and social  workers, to name a few.   There is also repayment for high-demand fields where education is  specialized and the need is a public good. For example, through the  Department of Health and Human Services, a variety of different  healthcare providers, including therapists, behavioral health  providers, and those needed to help our children as we face this mental  health crisis, are eligible for loan repayment.   In addition, there are five different programs already to keep  payments low compared to a person's income and which cap the total time  for repayment.   The mass transfer of debt, though, under this reckless student loan  scheme forgets that these existing programs were set up to target  limited taxpayer resources, to benefit those using their degrees to  serve, and to fill broader public needs or who demonstrate that they  themselves have a personal individual need.   Our resolution prevents average Americans--87 percent of whom do not  have student loans--from being stuck with a policy that the  administration is doing not to be fair to all but, rather, to favor the  few.   Our resolution also protects the rule of law, which President Biden  must know he is violating. During Supreme Court arguments on the  legality of student loan forgiveness in February, Justice Roberts  clearly indicated that if $400 billion was to be spent on student loan  cancellation, it would require congressional approval. That has not  been given.   This is a clear example of this administration attempting to subvert  Congress for what appears to be purely political purposes. It sets a  wildly dangerous precedent if left unchecked.   President Biden, Secretary Cardona, come to the table. There are real  problems in the student loan system and Federal financing of higher  education. Let's fix them legally through a bipartisan, lasting  solution.   I will close by encouraging all my colleagues to join me in voting to  pass this Congressional Review Act resolution to prevent these  unconstitutional student debt forgiveness schemes. It is unfair to the  hundreds of millions of Americans who will bear the burden of paying  off hundreds of billions of dollars of someone else's student debt.                            ____________________     I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 45.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
