 Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor today to  ask for unanimous consent on this bipartisan resolution expressing  solidarity with the people of Cuba. This resolution passed out of the  Foreign Relations Committee by a voice vote, with overwhelming  bipartisan support.   I want to thank the senior Senator from Florida for his partnership  on this resolution, which has the support of Senators Durbin, Kaine;  Senator Risch, the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee;  as well as many others on both sides of the aisle.   In passing this resolution today, the U.S. Senate can send a powerful  message about the truly historic events occurring in Cuba in recent  weeks.   On July 11, in an unprecedented wave of demonstrations across the  island, the Cuban people peacefully took to the streets and raised  their voices to call for freedom and an end to tyranny. We saw the  courage of the Cuban people. Images of Cubans chanting ``abajo la  dictadura,'' which means ``down with the dictatorship,'' and singing  ``Patria y Vida,'' or ``Fatherland and Life,'' spread around the globe.  Yet the Diaz-Canel regime responded with an authoritarian crackdown and  violent repression out of fear of losing its iron grip over the Cuban  people.   The regime cut the internet to stop the Cuban people from accessing  social media--a tool they were bravely using to open the eyes of the  world. Who does that? Only a country that fears its people shuts down  the internet. But it was too late. The truth went viral.   The regime has arrested more than 700 people, and most remain  incommunicado. Dozens more are already being subjected to summary  trials, without access to legal defense or even a veneer of due  process. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the U.N. High  Commissioner for Human Rights have all spoken out against the Cuban  regime's campaign of oppression.   President Biden rightfully and repeatedly denounced the regime's  actions and has announced two rounds of Global Magnitsky sanctions on  human rights abusers. The President has brought together allies of  Cuban freedom both at home and abroad. On Friday, the President  convened a meeting of Cuban-American leaders to discuss this crisis and  hear our suggestions on how to best support the pro-democracy efforts  underway in Cuba.   Last week, Secretary of State Blinken led a coalition of 20 countries  in a joint statement to express international solidarity with the Cuban  people and their rights to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly,  freedom to determine their own future.   While important steps are being taken, more needs to be done. The  Cuban people, in this unprecedented hour of uncertainty and need,  cannot afford anything less than our full support.   With this resolution, the Senate will add its voice to the ongoing  efforts and reinforce U.S. solidarity with the Cuban people and their  efforts to restore democracy and human rights in their country. It is  the same resolution that is also being offered in the House of  Representatives on the same bipartisan basis.   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 111, S. Res. 310; further, that  the committee-reported substitute amendment to the resolution be agreed  to; the resolution, as amended, be agreed to; the preamble be agreed  to; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table.   Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to consider the resolution (S. Res.  310) expressing solidarity with Cuban citizens demonstrating peacefully  for fundamental freedoms, condemning the Cuban regime's acts of  repression, and calling for the immediate release of arbitrarily  detained Cuban citizens, which had been reported from the Committee on  Foreign Relations, with an amendment to strike all after the resolving  clause and insert the part printed in italic, as follows                                S. Res. 310         Whereas, on July 11, 2021, thousands of Cuban citizens took       to the streets to peacefully protest and to call for respect       for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the end       of the dictatorship in Cuba;        Whereas the demonstrations were the largest protests       witnessed on the island in 25 years, with courageous Cuban       men, women, and youth taking to the streets in at least 50       different cities and towns across every province to affirm a       deep aspiration for democratic change and to denounce the       regime's corruption;        Whereas the nationwide protests represent the full       diversity of Cuban society, with demonstrators proudly       proclaiming ``Patria y Vida!'' (Homeland and Life!) and       calling for ``libertad'' (liberty);        Whereas the demonstrations in Cuba follow months of severe       shortages of food and basic medicine, frequent power outages,       record high rates of transmission of COVID-19, and the Cuban       regime's ineffective response, in addition to the Cuban       regime's continued repression and arbitrary imprisonment of       citizens, peaceful activists, and artists;        Whereas, despite the authoritarian regime's blocking of       internet service to prevent the spread of information about       the demonstrations, Cubans witnessed examples of their       compatriots demanding change in their country and       courageously joined the growing protests;        Whereas, despite the peaceful nature of the demonstrations,       Miguel Diaz-Canel incited violence among Cubans and       encouraged his supporters to attack peaceful protestors,       declaring in a televised address, ``the order to fight has       been given--into the streets'' and pledged his supporters'       lives: ``Over our dead bodies. We are prepared to do       anything'';        Whereas Diaz-Canel has sought to delegitimize peaceful       protesters, crudely stating they constitute a small group of       ``vulgar criminals'' that are ``paid'' to be disruptive;        Whereas Diaz-Canel sought to blame the endemic problems       causing so much human suffering by the Cuban people on       outside forces instead of on the Cuban regime's long-standing       corruption, mismanagement, and theft of public resources;        Whereas the Cuban regime's domestic security apparatus,       including military and police, were recorded on video       violently repressing peaceful Cuban citizens, including by       using live ammunition and attacking journalists;        Whereas numerous reports indicate deaths of and injuries to       Cuban protestors at the hands of the regime's security       forces, including instances of police firing live ammunition       into crowds and at least one documented police beating that       led to a civilian death;        Whereas independent Cuban civil society groups have       reported that hundreds of individuals have been arrested,       detained, or are missing;        Whereas defying regime repression, continued internet       shutdowns, and illegal searches of the homes of activists and       protestors, Cuban men, women, and youth continued to       peacefully protest throughout the island on  [[Page S5700]]       Monday, July 12, using social media to organize themselves       and document acts of regime repression;        Whereas international human rights groups, including Human       Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the United Nations       Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the       Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, have long       condemned the Cuban regime for violating human rights and       fundamental freedoms; and        Whereas for years the Cuban regime has exported its       authoritarian methods to Venezuela, sending intelligence       personnel to assist Venezuelan security forces as they       repressed similar peaceful protests calling for democratic       change: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, [That the Senate--        [(1) expresses its strong solidarity with the people of       Cuba in their desire to live in a free and democratic country       with uncensored access to information, justice, and economic       prosperity;        [(2) condemns the violence ordered by Miguel Diaz-Canel       against peaceful protesters as violations of internationally       recognized human rights that does nothing to address Cuba's       challenges;        [(3) calls on Cuban forces--        [(A) to respect the Cuban people's exercise of freedom of       assembly, freedom of expression, and other universal human       rights;        [(B) to refrain from restricting internet access and       connectivity in the country; and        [(C) to permit Cuban citizens to freely communicate on       digital platforms, as is their fundamental right;        [(4) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of       all arbitrarily detained Cuban citizens and all Cuban       political prisoners;        [(5) calls on members of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed       Forces, the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, and Cuba's       National Revolutionary Police Force to refrain from violently       repressing peaceful protesters and committing other human       rights violations; and        [(6) urges democratic governments and legislatures in       Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean--        [(A) to pledge their support for freedom and democracy in       Cuba; and        [(B) to speak out against the repression of demonstrators       in Cuba.]       That the Senate--        (1) expresses its strong solidarity with the people of Cuba       in their desire to live in a free and democratic country with       uncensored access to information, justice, and economic       prosperity;        (2) condemns the violence ordered by Miguel Diaz-Canel       against peaceful protesters as violations of internationally       recognized human rights that does nothing to address Cuba's       challenges;        (3) calls on Cuban forces--        (A) to respect the Cuban people's exercise of freedom of       assembly, freedom of expression, and other universal human       rights;        (B) to refrain from restricting internet access and       connectivity in the country; and        (C) to permit Cuban citizens to freely communicate on       digital platforms, as is their fundamental right;        (4) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of       all arbitrarily detained Cuban citizens and all Cuban       political prisoners;        (5) calls on members of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed       Forces, the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, and Cuba's       National Revolutionary Police Force to refrain from violently       repressing peaceful protesters and committing other human       rights violations;        (6) urges foreign governments, including authoritarian       regimes, to halt the provision of technology, equipment, and       other forms of assistance that are increasing the capability       of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, the Cuban Ministry       of the Interior, and Cuba's National Revolutionary Police       Force to violently repress peaceful protestors, curtail       freedom of expression through censorship of the internet, and       commit other human rights abuses; and        (7) urges democratic governments and legislatures in       Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean--        (A) to pledge their support for freedom and democracy in       Cuba; and        (B) to speak out against the repression of demonstrators in       Cuba.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I totally  agree that the Castro regime and its prodigy is a communist-socialist  dictatorship in tyranny. Before the Senator was ever in this  institution or involved with the issue, for 30 years, I have been  saying exactly that.   The Senator, however, knows that in order to accept an amendment to a  resolution that has been hotlined in both caucuses, this process could  not move forward. I cannot simply accept the amendment. I would have to  go through the whole process. And the fact of the matter is, I think  there is a fierce urgency of now. This resolution already has the  approval of 99 Senators, and if the Senator were to insist on his  amendment, the junior Senator from Florida would be the only one  standing in its way.   This bipartisan resolution is cosponsored by 19 Senators. The  initiative is co-led by Senator Rubio, the senior Senator from Florida,  the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere  affairs. It is sponsored by Senator Risch, the ranking member of the  full Foreign Relations Committee. It is supported by Senators Cruz and  Romney and Hagerty, all of them leading Republican voices on the  Foreign Relations Committee. With this strong Republican backing, the  Foreign Relations Committee passed this resolution last Wednesday on a  voice vote, with overwhelming bipartisan support.   Now, intervening, we have had this infrastructure bill, and so we are  here trying to get this finally done. We have an opportunity to act  today and send a powerful, bipartisan message in support of the Cuban  people and condemn the regime's brutal repression.   Now, I personally agree with the sentiment of the junior Senator from  Florida, but that reality is the reality that  [[Page S5701]]  has existed. We are talking about the reality today of trying to send a  bipartisan, bicameral message.   This resolution already condemns its present Cuban dictator, Miguel  Diaz-Canel, by name for his direct role in ordering a violent crackdown  against the Cuban people. It also documents the massive wave of arrests  in Cuba. It denounces in plain language the regime's brutal violence  and its use of summary trials to arbitrarily sentence protesters who  have no access to a lawyer.   So let me be clear. I have led U.S. and international efforts to  oppose Cuba's communist dictatorship for 30 years in the Congress,  including my role in helping create the Cuban Democracy Act and  drafting the LIBERTAD Act. No one in Congress has a longer or more  unwavering track record than I do when it comes to condemning the Cuban  regime. But this resolution is a strong rebuke of the regime's recent  actions, and it also achieves the bipartisan opportunity we need for  Senate approval.   There comes a time when we have to put actions over words. Today, the  Senate has a chance to act. We should not delay another hour in passing  this resolution, and because that is exactly what would happen, I have  to object to the Senator's amendment.    Mr. President, I appreciate that the Senator from  Florida, while I share his sentiments, did not press forward on  insisting on the amendment, which would have delayed this, and most  importantly, I think the Cuban people are the ones who are going to  thank him as well.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
