 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7734) to amend title 31, United States Code, to require the  timely production of reports to Congress under the Bank Secrecy Act,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7734         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Timely Delivery of Bank       Secrecy Act Reports Act''.       SEC. 2. TIMELY PRODUCTION OF BANK SECRECY ACT REPORTS TO                     CONGRESS.         Section 5319 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``The Secretary of the Treasury'' and       inserting the following:        ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) Timely Production of Reports to Congress.--        ``(1) Production by the secretary.--Upon the request of the       congressional committees or subcommittees of appropriate       jurisdiction for any report filed under this subchapter, the       Secretary of the Treasury shall deliver the requested report       to the committee or subcommittee not later than 30 days after       such request is made.        ``(2) Production by a financial institution pursuant to a       subpoena.--Upon subpoena by the congressional committees or       subcommittees of appropriate jurisdiction, a financial       institution shall deliver a report filed under this       subchapter by the financial institution, and any information       on which such report is based, to the committee or       subcommittee not later than the return date specified for       such report in the subpoena.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, suspicious activity reports and other materials,  collectively known as ``BSA reports,'' are held by Treasury's Financial  Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, and can be critical to  congressional investigations. For example, this committee has requested  documents related to our ongoing investigation into the flow of illicit  funds from the former Soviet states into the United States.   There is a long history of cooperation on the proper exchange of  these records, but in response to a recent Treasury-initiated reversal  of decades-long practice, I have found it necessary to introduce this  bill, H.R. 7734.   Unfortunately, Treasury has severely restricted congressional access  to suspicious activity reports, or SARs, by requiring congressional  staff to review all material in a reading room, prohibiting the copying  of materials, and restricting information collection to notetaking  alone. These limitations are not placed upon the Federal, State, and  local agencies that have been granted access to review SARs.   Treasury has no statutory basis for imposing restrictions on  congressional authority to obtain SARs. Neither legislative language,  statutory provision, nor case law prohibits government personnel or the  financial institutions from providing these materials to Congress.   I am very concerned that these restrictions and similar alternatives  offered by Treasury will severely impede effective congressional  oversight and investigations. In response to my committee's recent  request to review SARs related to the flow of illicit funds from former  Soviet states into the United States, FinCEN has informed the committee  that it is withholding thousands of pages of responsive documents  containing technical, detailed information about multiple transactions  involving numerous parties. Given the restrictions imposed by Treasury,  it is not possible for my staff to effectively capture and analyze  needed information in such complex documents. It will be even more  difficult for Members to review such materials.   Treasury's refusal to produce the documents in the manner requested  has severely obstructed the committee's investigation of this important  matter. To ensure that Congress can conduct effective oversight moving  forward, I have introduced this bill, and I am pleased to say that it  passed our committee on a bipartisan basis.   H.R. 7734 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to deliver BSA  reports to a congressional committee or subcommittee of appropriate  jurisdiction within 30 days of its request for such documents. The bill  further requires a financial institution to deliver BSA reports by the  return date specified in a subpoena issued by a committee or  subcommittee of appropriate jurisdiction.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that Congress can  obtain access to BSA reports without cumbersome restrictions and can do  so in a timely manner to support its investigatory work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Treasury's refusal to give Congress reasonable access to SARs is  severely impeding our ability to effectively make use of the materials  to conduct investigations.   Treasury has no statutory basis for imposing such restrictions and  has offered no rationale for changing the current practice, which has  been in place for over 20 years.   H.R. 7734 clarifies the existing statutory authority of Congress and  ensures that Congress continues to obtain timely access to BSA reports  without restrictions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7733) to amend the Community Development Banking and  Financial Institutions Act of 1994 to reauthorize and improve the  community development financial institutions bond guarantee program,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7733         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``CDFI Bond Guarantee Program       Improvement Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that the authority to guarantee       bonds under section 114A of the Community Development Banking       and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4713a)       (commonly referred to as the ``CDFI Bond Guarantee Program'')       provides community development financial institutions with a       sustainable source of long-term capital and furthers the       mission of the Community Development Financial Institutions       Fund (established under section 104(a) of such Act (12 U.S.C.       4703(a)) to increase economic opportunity and promote       community development investments for underserved populations       and distressed communities in the United States.       SEC. 3. GUARANTEES FOR BONDS AND NOTES ISSUED FOR COMMUNITY                     OR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES.         Section 114A of the Community Development Banking and       Financial Institutions Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4713a) is       amended--        (1) in subsection (c)(2), by striking ``, multiplied by an       amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of issued       notes or bonds'';        (2) in subsection (e)(2)(B), by striking ``$100,000,000''       and inserting ``$25,000,000''; and        (3) in subsection (k), by striking ``September 30, 2014''       and inserting ``the date that is 4 years after the date of       enactment of the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program Improvement Act       of 2022''.       SEC. 4. REPORT ON THE CDFI BOND GUARANTEE PROGRAM.         Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act, and not later than 3 years after such date of enactment,       the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue a report to the       Committee on Financial Services of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and       Urban Affairs of the Senate on the effectiveness of the CDFI       bond guarantee program established under section 114A of the       Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act       of 1994 (12 U.S.C. 4713a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 7733, the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program  Improvement Act, led by Representative Cleaver, who also is the chair  of the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development, and Insurance.   The CDFI Fund's Bond Guarantee Program provides CDFIs with federally  guaranteed, long-term, low-cost capital to support existing and new  economic development projects in their communities.   Unfortunately, small-sized CDFIs currently have difficulty applying  for this financing directly because the current $100 million minimum  financing amount is much higher than the amount many small CDFIs are  seeking. As a result, some CDFIs can only access the program by  applying with larger CDFIs.   This bill would lower the minimum threshold for a bond issuance from  $100 million to $25 million, giving smaller CDFIs a fairer shot at  being able to access this program. This will help expand financing and  investments to support small businesses, healthcare facilities, and  affordable housing.   This bill builds upon the work I led last Congress to provide CDFIs  with $12 billion in equity and grant funding. In particular, that  legislation, which has already distributed $1.25 billion to CDFIs,  represented the largest public investment in CDFIs ever.   Mr. Cleaver's bill complements those efforts by helping smaller CDFIs  better access private dollars to further their efforts to serve low- income and underserved communities.   While the Bond Guarantee Program's authorization ended in 2014,  Congress has extended it on a year-by-year basis in annual  appropriations bills. This bill would extend the program for 4 years,  creating longer-term certainty. The bill also includes studies to  examine areas where the program can be strengthened.  [[Page H7128]]    Furthermore, this bill is a House companion to a bipartisan bill in  the Senate, S. 3441, introduced by Senators Tina Smith and Mike Rounds.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that more CDFIs  have access to long-term financing through the Bond Guarantee Program  so they continue to spur economic development in communities across the  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Cleaver).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 7733 is supported by a number of groups, including the CDFI  Coalition, Credit Union National Association, Independent Community  Bankers of America, National Association of Federally-Insured Credit  Unions, National Community Reinvestment Coalition, and Opportunity  Finance Network.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4586) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with  respect to risk-based examinations of Nationally Recognized Statistical  Rating Organizations, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4586         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Risk-Based Credit       Examination Act''.       SEC. 2. CONDUCT OF RISK-BASED EXAMINATIONS OF NATIONALLY                     RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS.         Section 15E(p)(3)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934       (15 U.S.C. 78o-7(p)(3)(B)) is amended in the matter preceding       clause (i), by inserting ``, as appropriate,'' after ``Each       examination under subparagraph (A) shall include''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and include extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4586, sponsored by Mrs. Wagner, to help  the Securities and Exchange Commission robustly oversee the credit  rating agencies through more prudent annual examinations.   Mrs. Wagner's proposal ensures that the SEC continues its annual  examinations of all credit rating agencies but can now focus their  examinations on the aspects of the rating agencies that pose the  greatest risk to investors in our capital markets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 4586, sponsored  by Mrs. Wagner, to help the Securities and Exchange Commission robustly  oversee the credit rating agencies through more prudent annual  examinations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Members to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 310) to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal,  collectively, to Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. Christopher Stevens,  and Sean Smith, in recognition of their contributions to the Nation, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 310         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) On September 11, 2012, the United States consulate, and       its personnel in Benghazi, Libya, were attacked by militants.        (2) Four Americans were killed in the attack, including       Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty,       and Tyrone Woods.        (3) Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were former Navy SEALs       who served as security personnel in Libya. As the attack       unfolded, they bravely attempted to defend American property       and protect United States diplomatic personnel. In so doing,       they selflessly sacrificed their own lives.        (4) Glen Doherty was a Navy SEAL for 12 years and served in       Iraq and Afghanistan. He attained the rank of Petty Officer       First Class and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation       Medal. After leaving the Navy, Glen Doherty worked with the       Department of State to protect American diplomats.        (5) Tyrone Woods served for 20 years as a Navy SEAL       including tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq he led       multiple raids and reconnaissance missions and earned the       Bronze Star. After retiring from the Navy as a Senior Chief       Petty Officer, Tyrone Woods worked with the Department of       State to protect American diplomats.        (6) J. Christopher Stevens served for 21 years in the U.S.       Foreign Service. He was serving as U.S. Ambassador to Libya       and previously served twice in the country, as both Special       Representative to the Libyan Transitional National Council       and as the Deputy Chief of Mission. Earlier in his life, he       also served as a Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in       Morocco.        (7) Sean Smith served for 6 years in the U.S. Air Force. He       attained the rank of Staff Sergeant and was awarded the Air       Force Commendation Medal. After leaving the Air Force, Sean       Smith served for 10 years in the State Department on various       assignments, which took him to places such as Baghdad,       Brussels, Pretoria, and The Hague.        (8) As their careers attest, all four men served their       country honorably.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the posthumous award,       on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold medal of       appropriate design collectively in commemoration of Glen       Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. Christopher Stevens, and Sean       Smith, in recognition of their contributions to the Nation.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'')       shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices,       and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary. The       Secretary is authorized to create designs for the medal that,       if the Secretary deems it appropriate, include images of, and       inscriptions of the names of, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J.       Christopher Stevens, and Sean Smith.        (c) Central Intelligence Agency Museum.--        (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal       under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the       Central Intelligence Agency Museum, where it shall be       displayed as appropriate and made available for research.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Central Intelligence Agency Museum should make the gold       medal received under paragraph (1) available for display       elsewhere, particularly at other appropriate locations       associated with Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. Christopher       Stevens, and Sean Smith.       SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of       the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2, at a price       sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor,       materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.       SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.         (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this       Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title       31, United States Code.        (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of       title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this       Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.       SEC. 5.

SEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and include extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 310 to posthumously  award the Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to Glen Doherty,  Tyrone Woods, J. Christopher Stevens, and Sean Smith, in recognition of  their contributions to the Nation.   I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) for his  unwavering dedication to ensuring Congress  [[Page H7130]]  honors the memories of the four brave individuals who served our  country bravely for 59 collective years in public service.   The Congressional Gold Medal is an award bestowed by the United  States Congress, and it is the highest representation of national  gratitude for exemplary achievements and contributions by individuals  or institutions.   The four individuals honored today, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J.  Christopher Stevens, and Sean Smith, exemplified what it means to live  a life of service. Mr. Doherty, Mr. Woods, and Mr. Smith were decorated  servicemembers, known for their bravery and dedication to protecting  the American diplomats with whom they served. Ambassador Stevens was a  lifelong public servant and diplomat, deeply invested in promoting  peace and security throughout the world.                                time  1745    As we come upon the 10-year anniversary of their tragic deaths, we,  as a Nation mourn the loss of these shining examples of our shared  American values. And to their loved ones, who carry their memories with  them today and always, we offer our sincerest condolences and profound  gratitude with their tireless efforts to preserve their legacy.   This bill would present the Congressional Gold Medal to the four  brave men who protected and served their country honorably and died in  service of their country. I cannot think of any who are more deserving  of this great honor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. Lynch, as well as the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast) for their tireless efforts to ensure that these four  individuals receive the recognition that they clearly deserve. We must  strive to recognize these brave and honorable members of our country  who have committed their lives to protecting it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5128) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to expand  access to capital for rural-area small businesses, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 5128         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Access to Capital       for Rural Job Creators Act''.       SEC. 2. ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR RURAL-AREA SMALL BUSINESSES.         Section 4(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78d(j)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (4)(C), by inserting ``rural-area small       businesses,'' after ``women-owned small businesses,''; and        (2) in paragraph (6)(B)(iii), by inserting ``rural-area       small businesses,'' after ``women-owned small businesses,''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5128, the Expanding Access to  Capital for Rural Job Creators Act, introduced by Representative Axne.   While small businesses in the big cities may enjoy easier access to  capital to grow their businesses, hire and support their employees, and  serve their communities, the businesses in rural America often  struggle. Rural America's job growth is half the rate than that of big  cities, and rural America's poverty rate is also higher than that of  the big cities, even though it has dropped under President Biden's  leadership and as a result of this Congress' work.   Congresswoman Axne's bill would require SEC's small business advocate  to report to Congress particular challenges that rural businesses face  in accessing our capital markets.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank Mrs. Axne for her work on this important issue and for always  working on behalf of the rural businesses and communities in her  district. Congresswoman Axne's bill directs the SEC's Small Business  Advocate to similarly focus on the challenges rural small businesses  face.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7981) to require qualifying smoke alarms in certain  federally assisted housing, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7981         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. FIRE SAFETY EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban       Development shall, not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, complete a national educational       campaign that educates the general public about health and       safety requirements in housing and how to properly use safety       features in housing, including self-closing doors, smoke       alarms, and carbon monoxide detectors.        (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary of Housing and Urban       Development to carry out this section, $2,000,000 for fiscal       year 2024.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Representative Dean for introducing H.R. 7981, the Public and  Federally Assisted Housing Fire Safety Act of 2022, in response to the  devastating apartment fire that occurred in a Philadelphia public  housing unit, where 12 people died, including 9 children.   The subsequent investigation into this tragedy, found that the  majority of the smoke alarms in the home were inoperable, as they had  either been removed from the walls or had no batteries inside.   With proper fire safety tools in place, these deaths could have been  prevented. A 2021 study from the National Fire Protection Agency found  that nearly three out of five home fire deaths are caused by fires in  properties with no smoke alarms present, or smoke alarms that failed to  operate. Functional smoke alarms can reduce the number of home fire  deaths.   To help prevent similar tragedies like the one in Philadelphia from  occurring, H.R. 7981 would require the installation of either tamper- resistant or hardwired smoke alarms in federally assisted housing,  better ensuring families have adequate warning when a fire occurs.   Additionally, this bill will help ensure families across America  better understand and properly use fire safety features in their homes  through a national education campaign led by HUD.   I commend Representative Dean for her work on this very important  issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7981 is a commonsense bill that will save countless  lives by improving the quality and reliability of smoke alarms in  public and federally assisted housing. It is no wonder why the bill was  passed out of our committee with bipartisan support and is being  supported by the fire safety community, as well as affordable housing  advocates.   I thank Representative Dean for this bill, and I, again, urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 7981.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1842) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint  commemorative coins in recognition of the Bicentennial of Harriet  Tubman's birth.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1842         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Harriet Tubman Bicentennial       Commemorative Coin Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Harriet Tubman was a formerly enslaved abolitionist who       guided about 70 people from slavery to freedom in 10 years.        (2) Born in March 1822, Tubman was a notable abolitionist       who not only freed herself, but also freed others from       slavery.        (3) Harriet Ross Tubman, born Araminta ``Minty'' Ross, was       born enslaved on the plantation of Anthony Thompson in       Dorchester County, Maryland.        (4) With the help of the Underground Railroad network, in       the fall of 1849, Tubman escaped from Poplar Neck in Caroline       County, Maryland, heading north to freedom in Pennsylvania.        (5) With the passing of the Fugitive Slave Act as part of       the Compromise of 1850, the operations to help enslaved       persons escape became dangerous and she risked her life to       rescue them from slavery.        (6) Despite passage of the Compromise of 1850 and the       Fugitive Slave Act, Tubman continued her work, escorting her       refugees to Canada instead.        (7) It was during the 1850s that Tubman made 13 trips back       to Maryland, guiding approximately 70 enslaved persons to the       North, including family members, and providing instruction to       about 70 more who found their way to freedom on their own.        (8) Regardless of the arduous process of helping fugitive       enslaved persons escape through the Underground Railroad, not       a single person was recaptured under Tubman's supervision.        (9) During 1859, Tubman aided abolitionist John Brown by       recruiting supporters for his raid on Harper's Ferry, a       planned insurrection against slaveholders in Virginia and       Maryland.        (10) In the beginning of the Civil War, Tubman served as a       spy, cook, and nurse in South Carolina and Florida.        (11) Tubman also recruited newly freed African-American men       to join regiments of African-American soldiers called United       States Colored Troops.        (12) In recognition of her abilities, Tubman served as an       army scout and spy for Major General David Hunter and Colonel       James Montgomery. Harriet Tubman was inducted into the       Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame.        (13) Tubman distinguished herself as the first woman to       lead an armed expedition in the Civil War, the Combahee River       Raid, resulting in more than 700 enslaved persons in South       Carolina being freed.        (14) After the Civil War, Tubman frequently sheltered and       fed newly freed enslaved persons at her home on South Street       in Auburn, New York, which she purchased from Secretary of       State William Henry Seward, even though she had little money       herself. She found a means to an end by working as a       domestic, selling produce from her garden, taking in       donations of food, loans from friends, and raising pigs on       her farm.        (15) Tubman became active in the women's movement as early       as 1860. She attended meetings and gave speeches in her home       State of New York, as well as in Boston and Washington, D.C.        (16) Tubman was an avid advocate for African-American women       and their civil rights. In 1896, she was invited as a speaker       at the first meeting of the National Association of Colored       Women in Washington, D.C.        (17) Although living in financial insecurity, Tubman       transferred a 25-acre parcel of land to the African Methodist       Episcopal Zion Church in 1903, which eventually became The       Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged and Indigent Negroes. At the       time, few social services existed for elderly and ill people       of color.        (18) Escaping slavery, risking everything to save her       family and friends, aiding enslaved persons in escape from       slavery, leading a military raid, championing the cause of       women's suffrage, advocating for civil rights and access to       health care, Harriet Tubman is an individual that has       performed achievements that have had profound impacts on       history and culture in the United States.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 1842, the  Harriet Tubman Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.   I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) for his tireless  efforts to ensure that Congress celebrates and upholds Harriet Tubman's  legacy of passionate advocacy for civil rights, women's suffrage, and  the liberation of enslaved persons.   Historians value coins and currencies as an important form of visual  storytelling. This is because the objects and, more importantly, the  people depicted on a currency reflects the values and the narratives  that a society tells about itself. As such, I cannot think of an  individual who more perfectly embodies American values of seeking  justice, protecting freedom, and enduring personal sacrifices in the  pursuit of a more perfect Union than Harriet Tubman.   Born enslaved in March 1822 on the plantation of Anthony Thompson in  Dorchester County, Maryland, Harriet Ross Tubman, also known as  Araminta ``Minty'' Ross, was a notable abolitionist, who not only freed  herself but also others from slavery.   After freeing herself in the fall of 1849 with the help of the  Underground Railroad network, Tubman devoted herself to the arduous and  life-threatening process of freeing other enslaved persons. Throughout  the 1850s, Tubman made 13 trips back to Maryland, guiding approximately  70 enslaved persons to the north, including family members, and  providing instruction to about 70 more who found their way to freedom  on their own.   During the Civil War, Tubman served as a spy, cook, and a nurse in  South Carolina and Florida. She also recruited newly freed African- American men to join regiments of African-American soldiers called  United States Colored Troops and served herself as an Army scout and  spy for Union leaders Major General David Hunter and Colonel James  Montgomery. For her invaluable service, Tubman was inducted into the  Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame.   After the Civil War, Tubman continued her legacy of activism and care  for the community, often sheltering and providing for newly freed,  formerly enslaved persons in her home on South Street in Auburn, New  York.   Ms. Tubman was also an ardent supporter of women's suffrage, civil  rights, and access to healthcare, and would attend meetings and give  speeches in support of these rights in Boston, New York City, and  Washington, D.C.   This bipartisan bill championed by Representative Meeks and  Representative Katko would provide tangible support to the National  Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the  Harriet Tubman Home, Incorporated, in Auburn, New York, to advance  their shared mission of sharing Harriet Tubman's legacy and continuance  to advance her vision of a more just and equitable America.   This bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to produce  noncirculating commemorative coins for purchase bearing Harriet  Tubman's image and depicting her legacy as an abolitionist.   I thank Representatives Meeks and Katko for introducing this historic  bill, and I urge Members to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2100     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time until my  colleague yields back.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlemen from New York, Mr. Meeks and Mr.  Katko, for their hard work on this bill. I thank the gentlewoman from  Nevada, Senator Rosen, and the gentleman from Ohio, Senator Portman,  for leading the Senate companion version of this bill.   Who we choose to honor on our currency says a lot about who we are  and what we value as a society. This bill is an opportunity for us to  declare to ourselves and to our prosperity that we are a society who  values courage in the face of oppression, and liberty and justice for  all, not just for the lucky few.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to declare themselves as  supporters of these shared American values by supporting this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6528) to require owners of covered federally assisted rental  dwelling units to install temperature sensors in such units, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6528         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  this legislation and include extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Torres for introducing H.R.  6528, the Housing Temperature Safety Act of 2022, in response to the  tragic apartment fire that occurred in his district in the Bronx.  Seventeen people died in that fire, including eight children, while  dozens more were injured. Sadly, this tragedy was entirely preventable  and even foreseeable.   The Twin Parks North West apartment building was home to 120  families, including 91 families who were assisted through the housing  choice voucher program. Because of heating and ventilation issues in  the building, too often families found themselves shivering in their  apartments, forcing them to take matters into their own hands by  purchasing space heaters, which were deemed to be the cause of this  tragic fire.   To address this issue, and to better hold housing providers  accountable to ensuring their apartments are meeting temperature  requirements, H.R. 6528 would create a pilot program to install and  study the efficacy of temperature sensors in federally assisted  housing.                                time  2110    As the tragedy in the Bronx proved, inadequate heating and cooling in  federally assisted units is a danger to our communities. This bill  provides a key step towards researching and improving tools to better  ensure families' homes are both safe and warm.   I thank Representative Torres for his leadership on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6528, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Torres).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6528 is an important step forward in holding  housing providers accountable to better protect the health and safety  of families receiving Federal housing assistance.   What happened in the Bronx is a tragedy that was wholly preventable.  While more must be done to prevent similar tragedies, I am glad that we  are providing new solutions to improve fire safety in Federal housing.   I thank Representative Torres for this bill.   Madam Speaker, I, again, urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 6528, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4590) to require the Federal banking regulators to jointly  conduct a study and develop a strategic plan to address challenges  faced by proposed depository institutions seeking de novo depository  institution charters; and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4590         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(c) Public Involvement.--When conducting the study and       developing the strategic plan required by this Act, the       Federal banking regulators shall invite comments and other       feedback from the public to inform the study and strategic       plan.        (d) Definitions.--In this Act:        (1) Depository institution.--The term ``depository       institution'' has the meaning given in section 3 of the       Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and includes a ``Federal       credit union'' and a ``State credit union'' as such terms are       defined, respectively, under section 101 of the Federal       Credit Union Act.        (2) Community development financial institution.--The term       ``community development financial institution'' has the       meaning given in section 103 of the Riegle Community       Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994.

(2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1)       shall take effect on September 30, 2022.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 4590, the Promoting New and Diverse  Depository Institutions Act, sponsored by Representative Jake  Auchincloss, the vice chair of the Financial Services Committee.   Since the 1980s, we have seen steady consolidation in the number of  U.S. depository institutions from having roughly 33,000 banks and  credit unions in 1980 to less than 10,000 today. Over the last decade,  we have also seen a reduction of 3,300 branches by the four largest  banks leaving behind banking deserts where residents lack access to a  nearby branch for basic banking services.   I have also been troubled by the recent decline of roughly one-third  of all minority depository institutions, also known as MDIs, and more  than half of Black-owned banks since the 2008 financial crisis.   In December 2020, I was pleased to work with Ranking Member McHenry  and Senators Brown, Crapo, and Warner to reach a bipartisan deal to  provide $12 billion in capital investments and grants to shore up and  strengthen existing MDIs as well as community development financial  institutions, better known as CDFIs.   But I am still concerned that very few depository institutions,  especially MDIs, have been newly chartered in recent years while  banking deserts continue to grow. This bill would help address this  concern by requiring regulators to study this problem, request feedback  from the public, and develop a strategic plan so they can take steps to  encourage the creation of new banks and credit unions, including MDIs  and CDFIs.   H.R. 4590 also requires regulators to share with Congress any  legislative recommendations to further promote the creation of new  depository institutions, again, including MDIs and CDFIs.   So I thank Vice Chair Auchincloss for his work on this bill which  received bipartisan support in our committee.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4590, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2120     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  [[Page H7152]]  Massachusetts (Mr. Auchincloss), who is also the vice chair of the  Financial Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 4590 is supported by a wide range of stakeholders, including  California & Nevada Credit Union Leagues, Community Development Bankers  Association, Inclusiv, Independent Community Bankers Association, and  many others.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4227) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  revise the definition of a qualifying investment, for purposes of the  exemption from registration for venture capital fund advisers under the  Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to include an equity security issued  by a qualifying portfolio company and to include an investment in  another venture capital fund, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4227         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Developing and Empowering       our Aspiring Leaders Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         Not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on       the date of the enactment of this Act, if the Securities and       Exchange Commission determines the revisions would facilitate       capital formation without compromising investor protection,       the Commission shall--        (1) revise the definition of a qualifying investment under       paragraph (c) of section 275.203(l)-1 of title 17, Code of       Federal Regulations, to include an equity security issued by       a qualifying portfolio company, whether acquired directly       from the company or in a secondary acquisition; and        (2) revise paragraph (a) of such section to require, as a       condition of a private fund qualifying as a venture capital       fund under such paragraph, that the qualifying investments of       the private fund are predominantly qualifying investments       that were acquired directly from a qualifying portfolio       company.  [[Page H7153]]     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I support H.R. 4227, the Developing and Empowering Our Aspiring  Leaders Act of 2021, introduced by Mr. Hollingsworth. This bill would  authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, to revise its  rules on venture capital investment regulations to allow investments  acquired through secondary transactions or investments in other venture  capital funds to be considered as qualifying investments for venture  capital funds.   Importantly, the SEC would only be required to revise its rules if it  finds that the revision would facilitate capital formation without  reducing investor protections.   I want to ensure startups and small businesses have access to  capital, but as this bill stipulates, access to capital should not come  at the expense of investor protections. This bill strikes the right  balance, and I so urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2130     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I support H.R. 4227 and urge its passage as it correctly balances the  need to provide access to capital for startups and other businesses  with the need to protect investors. I note that a similar version of  this bill previously passed this Chamber by a wide bipartisan vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1057) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins  in commemoration of the National World War II Memorial in Washington,  DC, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1057         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Greatest Generation       Commemorative Coin Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The National World War II Memorial was dedicated in       Washington, DC, on May 29, 2004, and is located on the east       end of the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall, opposite the       Lincoln Memorial and west of the Washington Monument.        (2) The dedication of the National World War II Memorial       was the culmination of a 17-year effort that started on       December 10, 1987 when the World War II Memorial Act was       first introduced in the House of Representatives, and was       authorized by an Act of Congress signed into law on May 25,       1993. Construction began September 4, 2001, after several       years of fundraising and public hearings.        (3) Opening to the public on April 29, 2004, the World War       II Memorial is the first national memorial dedicated to all       who served during World War II and acknowledges the       commitment and achievement of the entire Nation.        (4) The Memorial honors the more than 16,000,000 who served       in the Armed Forces of the United States during World War II,       the more than 400,000 who died, and the millions who       supported the war effort from home.        (5) It is a monument to the spirit, sacrifice, and       commitment of the American people to the common defense of       the Nation and to the broader causes of peace and freedom       from tyranny throughout the world.        (6) Today, the Memorial is a top destination for millions       of annual visitors from all over the country and the world.       For many young visitors, their visit to the Memorial is a       first glimpse to a grateful Nation's remembrance of the       sacrifices made by the World War II generation.        (7) For World War II veterans, the Memorial is a special       destination, a rendezvous point, and a gathering place for       reunions and commemoration programs.        (8) The Friends of the National World War II Memorial play       a vital role in the preservation and maintenance of the       National World War II Memorial as a treasure for the American       people, while helping to facilitate key commemorative and       educational programs  [[Page H7154]]       at the Memorial to pay tribute to America's ``Greatest       Generation'' and their efforts to preserve liberty for       generations to come.        (9) The National World War II Memorial stands as an       important symbol of America's national unity, a timeless       reminder of the moral strength and power that flows when free       people are at once united and bonded together in a common and       just cause for liberty.

The Secretary of the Treasury may issue       guidance to carry out this subsection.       SEC. 8. FINANCIAL ASSURANCES.         The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary       to ensure that--        (1) minting and issuing coins under this Act will not       result in any net cost to the United States Government; and        (2) no funds, including applicable surcharges, shall be       disbursed to any recipient designated in section 7 until the       total cost of designing and issuing all of the coins       authorized by this Act (including labor, materials, dies, use       of machinery, overhead expenses, marketing, and shipping) is       recovered by the United States Treasury, consistent with       sections 5112(m) and 5134(f) of title 31, United States Code.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material thereon.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1057, which would  require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration of  the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.   The National World War II Memorial is located on the east end of the  reflecting pool on The National Mall. The process for the dedication of  the National World War II Memorial started in 1987, and it was a 17- year effort until the memorial was finally opened to the public in  2004.   It is the first national memorial dedicated to all who served in  World War II and acknowledges the commitment and achievement of the  entire Nation. The memorial today is a top destination for millions of  annual visits from all over the country and the world.   The more than 16 million people who served in the Armed Forces, the  more than 400,000 who died, and the millions who supported the war  effort from home are all honored with this memorial. It commemorates  the spirit, sacrifice, and commitment of the American people to the  common defense of the Nation and to the broader causes of peace and  freedom from tyranny throughout the world.   It acts as a symbol of national unity, and it is a timeless reminder  of the moral strength and power that flows when free people are at once  united and bonded together in a common and just cause for liberty.   This bill, sponsored by Representative Kaptur, would provide tangible  support to the World War II Memorial by directing the Secretary of the  Treasury to produce commemorative coins in recognition of everything  that the memorial represents.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I thank Congresswoman Kaptur for her work to guarantee that the  stories and values the World War II Memorial represents continue to  circulate throughout the Nation. Madam Speaker and Members, each  evening that I am in Washington, D.C. when I leave the Capitol to go  home, I pass this memorial, and I think about Marcy Kaptur.   I think about the first time that I learned and understood she  created this. This was her legislation, and so it absolutely continues  her vision, her foresight, and her love for the sacrifices that have  been made by so many by establishing this World War II Memorial and  everything that it represents.   I am so grateful that I am able here this evening to show my support  and to thank her for what she has done in creating that memorial.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
