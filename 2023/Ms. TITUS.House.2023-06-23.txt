 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 40 brave Nevada  Bureau of Land Management wildland firefighters who have selflessly  offered their support to battle the raging fires in Canada.   Mr. Speaker, I include their names in the Record.         Anderson, Truett, Southern Nevada District; Arroyo, Omar,       Carson City District Office; Atwater, Trevor, Carson City       District Office; Brunjes, Bailey C, Southern Nevada District;       Chatham, William A, Carson City District Office; Daniels,       Aaron Lee, Carson City District Office; De Raedt, Nick Peter,       Carson City District Office; Drake, Lauryn Emily, Carson City       District Office; Duenas, Kevin Gerardo, Carson City District       Office; Engdahl, Alyssa Grace, Carson City District Office;       Esh, Heidi, Carson City District Office.

Rodriguez, Roberto, Carson City District Office;       Satterfield, Nathan Robert, Carson City District Office;       Shoemaker, Don, Carson City District Office; St Cyr, Andrew       T, Carson City District Office; Stephenson, Karl Joseph,       Battle Mountain District; Tartaglia, Vincenzio Cesidio,       Carson City District Office; Wadsworth, Justin Allen, Carson       City  [[Page H3133]]       District Office; Wagner, Lane Nicholas, Carson City District       Office; Williams, Joshua David, Carson City District Office;       Whipple, Tyler Jeffrey, Southern Nevada District.     When smoke covered Washington, D.C., and New York for  hundreds of miles recently, people across the East Coast witnessed the  impact of the devastating wildfires Canada is currently experiencing.   To date, the United States has deployed more than 600 firefighters  and support personnel to respond to these wildfires in Canada,  including our Silver State Interagency Hotshot Crew.   Nearly every major wildfire in the U.S. relies on response from  Federal wildland firefighters and the services their specialized crews  provide, but right now they are paid significantly less than their  counterparts at State and local agencies.   I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the Nevada Federal  firefighters, the Hotshots, who are on the front lines. I urge support  for a needed increase in their base salaries. It is the least we can do  for their service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
