 Madam Speaker, I'm pretty angry.   I'm angry with you, the Speaker of the House. I'm angry with Chairman  Adam Schiff. I'm angry with the Chairman Jerry Nadler.   I'm angry they're putting the country through this.   They've bastardized the tool of impeachment and are attempting to use  it to overturn the votes of 63 million people.   In just a few short hours, our president will be the first president  in history to be impeached by just one single political party.   Every person who is responsible for getting us to this point should  be held accountable.
