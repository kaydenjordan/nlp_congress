 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome Chaplain Major Troy  Bates to the U.S. House of Representatives.   He currently serves as the garrison family life chaplain at West  Point. He was direct commissioned into the Army Chaplain Corps in  August of 2009 as a reserve chaplain for the 478th Civil Affairs  Battalion.   Chaplain Bates has provided spiritual support for our troops in  harm's way in six combat deployments. He first deployed as the  battalion chaplain from the 25th Infantry Division to Afghanistan. He  then became a member of the 10th Special Forces Group, my old group.  Chaplain Bates deployed twice to Afghanistan with the Special Forces  Group and once to Africa. He then joined the XVIII Airborne Corps and  deployed again to Iraq, and then became a JSOC chaplain and deployed to  a classified location.   He has had an extensive education, including attending many military  schools, and winning numerous awards, leading off with the Bronze Star.   Especially interesting and meaningful to me, he has the U.S.,  British, Canadian, Italian, and German Jump Wings, as well as the  Combat Action Badge.   His education includes an associate of arts from the Pacific Coast  Baptist Bible College, a bachelor of science from Baptist Bible  College, a master of arts from Liberty University, a master of divinity  in religion from Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary, and a master of  arts in counseling from Webster University.   He is joined by his wife today, Duchess. They have five children,  three of whom serve in the military today. I thank Chaplain Major Troy  Bates for not only his service but his legacy and his family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. The Golden  State is turning into a Soviet state. California's attempt to ban gas  vehicles is yet another step toward Marxism.   It is no wonder people are fleeing California in droves, as their  State attempts to partner with Biden's radical EPA by handcuffing  customers with requirements to purchase electric vehicles.   The Biden administration is weaponizing Federal agencies to pursue  his radical Green New Deal agenda, while saddling Americans with the  costs involved.   Limiting consumer choice is a veiled attempt to force Marxist  principles down the throats of consumers. Support of this bill pushes  back against radical ideals and promotes the opportunity for free  markets to prevail.
