 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it has been one of the big,  unfortunate ironies of the past several years: Many of the same  individuals and institutions on the political left that have spent the  years 2017 through 2020 yelling about the importance of norms and  institutions have themselves not hesitated to undermine our  institutions when they are unhappy with a given outcome.   Just as an example, the newly elected incoming leader of the House  Democrats is a past election denier who baselessly said the 2016  election was ``illegitimate'' and suggested that we had a ``fake''  President. He has also mounted reckless attacks on our independent  judiciary and said that Justices he didn't like have ``zero  legitimacy.''   Unfortunately, when it comes to attacking our independent judiciary,  the Democrats' new leader isn't an outlier; he is a representative  sample. In the last few years, we have seen my counterpart, the Senate  Democratic leader, threaten sitting Justices by name over on the  Supreme Court steps; we have seen President Biden and Attorney General  Garland refuse to enforce Federal law and put a stop to illegal  harassment campaigns at the homes of Justices; and we have seen  coordinated efforts by Democrats and the media to use smear campaigns  to personally punish Justices whose legal reasoning they don't like.   The latest target has been Justice Alito, whose great offense was  overruling a deeply flawed precedent that prominent liberal legal  scholars, including even the late Justice Ginsburg herself, long  acknowledged was badly written and poorly reasoned.   I am confident the smear campaigns and baseless fishing expeditions  will keep groping around, and I am just as confident that Justices  Alito, Thomas, and the entire Court will continue to ignore the noise  and the smears and practice judicial independence.   We also see growing evidence that the attacks on members of the legal  profession who dare to upset the activist left are actually not limited  to judges and other public officials. Private citizens are not safe.  Earlier this week, a longtime female partner at a major law firm  explained in an op-ed how she was forced out of the firm after she  dared--dared--to enter into a ``safe space for women'' and share her  own personal views on the Dobbs ruling. As she tells it, simply being a  woman who agreed with the five-Justice majority of the Supreme Court  was a fireable offense. Some of her colleagues claimed that merely  hearing her express a dissenting view caused them to ``[lose] their  ability to breathe.''   This past summer, two wildly successful appellate litigators,  including a former U.S. Solicitor General, were  [[Page S6921]]  drummed out of another prominent firm because they won a Supreme Court  victory for the Second Amendment. In their telling, they were basically  told to either abandon their pro-Second Amendment clients or hand in  their badges.   Meanwhile, intellectual freedom and the competition of ideas have  also been slipping away in the legal academy. Multiple circuit judges  are so disturbed by the anti-free speech trends in elite law schools  that they are starting to decline to hire clerks from otherwise  prestigious schools that are hostile to nonliberal views.   Just last night, two such judges participated in a Yale Law School  panel titled--listen to this--``Is Free Speech Dead on Campus?'' ``Is  Free Speech Dead on Campus?''   And of course, the left's rapidly growing appetite for censorship is  not limited to the legal realm. Earlier this week, in a truly bizarre  and disturbing moment, the White House Press Secretary said the Biden  administration is--listen to this--``keeping an eye on'' the social  media company Twitter, which was recently purchased by an owner who  doesn't happen to be a liberal.   The antidote to all this toxic nonsense is renewed appreciation for  the deeply American principle of free speech and open debate. No one in  my lifetime has understood the importance of free speech and the  competition of ideas better than the recently departed Judge Laurence  Silberman. Larry was a legal genius and a patriot, whose rich and  varied career culminated on the DC Circuit, where many came to view him  as the single most important jurist in American history who never sat  on the Supreme Court.   The last major address Judge Silberman gave before his death was a  powerful and important speech on free speech, which he delivered at  Dartmouth in September. He explained how un-American and dangerous it  is to enter an era where ``some political speech is attacked as if it  were blasphemy drawn from the colonial period when witches were burned  at the stake.''   I will have more to say on this subject soon. But for now, I ask  unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the published text of  Judge Silberman's final speech, in full, at the conclusion of my  remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From Dartmouth University, Sept. 20, 2022]             Free Speech Is the Most Fundamental American Value                         (By Laurence H. Silberman)         This is a Constitution Day talk. So I will address one of       today's most contentious constitutional subjects--the First       Amendment's protection of free speech. As I noted in a recent       opinion, the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech is       not just a legal doctrine. It represents the most fundamental       value in American democracy. A national commitment to       uninhibited political speech is a crucial aspect of our       country's culture. It is the penumbra around the First       Amendment, which, by itself, only prohibits government       control of speech. Unless all American institutions are       committed to free political speech, I fear the strain on the       First Amendment's guarantees will become unbearable.        Those seeking to suppress free speech sometimes think that       provocative, even extreme and obnoxious, political speech is       dangerously divisive. It should be suppressed. I think that       is profoundly wrong. I think it is the very opposite.       Toleration of all versions of political speech is the crucial       unifying factor in our country.        Some years ago, I was ambassador to Yugoslavia, a communist       country where freedom of political speech did not exist. I       had a small fund with which I could send promising young       intellectuals to the United States in the summer. Yugoslavia,       then a country of six separate ethnicities, was threatened by       centrifugal ethnic forces (which ultimately resulted in six       separate nationalities). The government sought to squelch       talk that threatened Yugoslav unity.        One intellectual that I sent to the United States came back       and expressed wonderment that our country--composed as it is       of the descendants of an enormous number of nationalities--      could nevertheless enjoy such a uniform commitment to shared       values. I explained that we swore allegiance not to a       sovereign nor a blood grouping, but rather to a legal       document--the Constitution. And nothing in that legal       document was more important than the First Amendment.       Protection of the speech of fellow Americans, even the most       provocative and unpleasant, reflects a fundamental tolerance       for all Americans.        I was often obliged to explain the First Amendment to the       Yugoslavs who demanded that I restrain the New York Times's       criticism of their government. Their eyes would glaze over       during my First Amendment lectures; they didn't believe me       until I pointed out that if our government could influence       the New York Times a Republican administration would have       every incentive to do so. That finally got across.       Interestingly, even allied democratic governments that       generally--but only generally--supported free speech were       mystified by the strength of our First Amendment.        To be sure, I recently wrote an opinion seeking the       overturning of New York Times v. Sullivan, a case that       benefits the press. That case, by constitutionalizing       American libel law, made it nearly impossible to sue media       for certain inaccurate personal attacks on public figures.       Some have suggested my position reflects less than vigorous       support for the First Amendment. On the contrary, I oppose       New York Times v. Sullivan because it was wholly illegitimate       policy making by the Supreme Court.        A guarantee of free press does not mean special       immunization from accountability when the press libels a       person. A free press is not necessarily an all-powerful       press. The Supreme Court in Sullivan was concerned,       legitimately, about problems created by excessive libel       actions against newspapers supporting the struggle for civil       rights, but that could have been handled with legislation. It       was illegitimate for the Supreme Court to literally make up       constitutional law to deal with the problem. Its decision was       contrary to text and history, and it created new problems for       society in the form of media that can spread false rumors and       sling unfounded accusations directed at public figures       without consequence.        The history of the First Amendment is fascinating. The       phrase ``freedom of speech'' first appeared in the Anglo-      American tradition in the English Bill of Rights written in       1689. It only protected the expression of members of       Parliament. This was so because, in the English tradition,       Parliament, not the general population, was the source of       sovereignty. Our Founders extended that right to all       citizens, because here the people rule as sovereign.        As many of you know, the First Amendment was drafted by one       of the most extraordinary of our original political leaders--      James Madison. His primary focus was freedom of the press,       which was included in the constitutions of virtually all the       colonies; whereas the phrase ``freedom of speech'' only       existed in one of those. But if one thinks about it, which       clearly Madison did, freedom of speech was a necessary       corollary of freedom of the press. It followed apodictically,       if you protect words that appear in the press, you couldn't       suppress those words uttered verbally.        There are virtually no cases in the first half of the 19th       century involving the First Amendment's freedom of speech. As       you might know, the First Amendment did not apply to the       states until after the Civil War, when the 14th amendment's       Due Process Clause was seen to incorporate the First       Amendment.        The first case that I could find considering the First       Amendment's free speech clause as applied to the states was       Patterson v. Colorado in 1907. It included a dissent by one       of our greatest justices, John Marshall Harlan. He was the       man who dissented in Plessy v. Ferguson from the odious view       that racial segregation, although separate could nevertheless       be equal.        Patterson involved a state judge who held a litigant in       contempt for criticizing the judge's opinion. The majority       upheld the contempt finding. Harlan disagreed. He said: ``I       cannot assent to that view if it be meant that the       legislature may impair or abridge the rights of a free press       and of free speech whenever it thinks that the public welfare       requires that to be done. The public welfare cannot override       constitutional privileges.'' He concluded that ``the       privileges of free speech and of a free press--belonging to       every citizen of the United States--constitute essential       parts of every man's liberty.''        Not surprisingly, the constitutional protection of free       speech from government action has been most strained when we       faced national security threats. First were the notorious       Alien and Sedition acts growing out of the three-corner       tension between the United States, Great Britain, and France.       But the statutes were abandoned before the Supreme Court had       an opportunity to rule on them.        Perhaps most astonishing is the degree of Lincoln's       tolerance of free speech even during the bloody Civil War. He       did strain the First Amendment on occasion, but given the       threat to the nation, it is amazing how tolerant Lincoln was       of fierce criticism. For instance, he announced that the       arrest of Vallandingham, a southern sympathizer, was wrong if       that arrest was based purely on Vallandingham's criticism of       Lincoln. In instructions to his general in dealing with       Northern civilians aiding Confederate guerrillas, Lincoln       explicitly directed Gen. Ewing to only arrest individuals or       suppress assemblies or newspapers if they were working       ``palpable injury to the Military'' and that ``in no other       case will you interfere with the expression of opinion in any       form.''        Then, we have the 20th century's wartime pressures on the       First Amendment. Some of the most celebrated First Amendment       opinions, Abrams, Gitlow, Whitney were the result of       challenges to laws passed to suppress wartime protests.       Perhaps the most problematic was the McCarthy era, which my       class  [[Page S6922]]       of 1957 experienced at the time we entered Dartmouth. The       notorious senator from Wisconsin was able to intimidate       politicians, academics and Hollywood writers in his wide-      ranging and, in many cases, wholly unjustified pursuit of       alleged communist sympathizers.        Turning to the present, I am convinced we are faced today       with a worse threat to free speech than during that earlier       time. Indeed, now some political speech is attacked as if it       were blasphemy drawn from the colonial period when witches       were burned at the stake. Threats against political speakers       are not simply levied by unscrupulous politicians, they come       also from young people influenced by academics--ironically       the prime targets of the McCarthy era. Certain controversial       subjects are placed out of bounds.        I am shocked at the recent challenges to free speech in our       academic institutions--particularly the Ivy League. For       example, recently at Yale Law School, students attempted to       stop, then drown out, a public dialogue between a       conservative and a liberal lawyer. They were both supporting       untrammeled political speech. The administration's response       was to vaguely gesture at the importance of free speech but       also to celebrate ``respect and inclusion''--whatever that       means. The dean sent a letter calling the behavior       ``unacceptable,'' but she did not so much as issue a slap on       the wrist to the students who were hostile to free speech.        And at Princeton, Prof. Joshua Katz was stripped of his       tenure and fired after challenging the university's orthodox       view on race. He was terminated ostensibly based on the       disputed details of a consensual relationship he had with a       student 15 years ago--for which he had already been       disciplined. This was only after he criticized a Princeton       faculty letter that demanded preferential treatment both for       minority faculty and a black student organization. Does       anyone believe that Katz would have been fired if instead he       gave a speech in support of a black student organization?        Similarly, at Harvard, Prof. Roland Fryer, one of the most       gifted economists in the country--who happens to be black--      has been suspended for two years for allegations that he made       inappropriate comments. His supposed crime was telling       raunchy jokes. But Fryer's real crime was his work       empirically demonstrating that police do not kill blacks at a       higher rate than other races, and that black students excel       when faced with high expectations--challenges to the current       shibboleths on race.        Amy Wax, professor at Penn Law School, was recently       punished because she unwisely--indeed somewhat cruelly--      described her experience over many years regarding black       student performance in her class. She therefore touched on       the mismatch theory popularized by Richard Sander and Stuart       Taylor. They wrote a book by that name and have filed an       amicus brief in the Harvard case before the Supreme Court.        They contend that in an effort to achieve soft quotas,       elite schools artificially admit less qualified minorities       thereby injuring the very students supposedly benefitted. In       other words, in a less competitive school those students       might do much better. I emphasize that, as a judge, I take no       position on the mismatch theory. But I predict you will see       reference to it in the forthcoming Supreme Court opinion.        To be sure, it is unseemly for any serving professor to       suggest that minority students are less qualified. (That       proposition is more readily expressed openly by emeritus       professors no longer teaching, like Alan Dershowitz at       Harvard Law School and Stanley Goldfarb at Penn Medical       School.) In furtherance of Amy Wax's tendency to offend       minority groups, she recently attacked Asian-Americans in the       most unflattering terms. I gagged when I read her remarks,       but free speech is free speech.        Even Dartmouth, to my distress, has engaged in smothering       provocative speech. In January, the college cancelled an       event with Andy Ngo, a controversial conservative journalist.       His speech was forced online based on unspecified information       from the Hanover Police Department. Apparently, Dartmouth has       been evasive about the ``credible threats'' it received. It       has provided shifting rationales for its decision.        The College Republicans have also been charged $3,600 for       an event which did not actually take place. Indeed, I think       it is inappropriate for the college to ever charge       organizations for the protection their speech requires. That       policy simply accentuates the power of those who would       discourage free speech.        If the Dartmouth administration had the backbone to       discipline students who shouted down speakers or to arrest       nonstudents for disrupting events, the deterrent effect would       obviate the need for imposing security expenses.        Regardless of the situation, the college aligned itself       with those who wish to silence speech by cancelling the       event. It should be recalled that, in Terminiello, the       Supreme Court squarely rejected the so-called heckler's-veto       rationale for suppressing speech. The court held that speech       cannot be punished merely because it could cause unrest       amongst potential listeners.        A common thread of these incidents at Yale, Princeton,       Harvard, U Penn and Dartmouth is that university authorities,       in discouraging unfashionable speech, do not do so       explicitly. Rather, they perform an ``Ivy League Two Step.''       First, they pay lip service towards the value of free speech.       Then they use alternative reasons as a pretext to shut down       ``objectionable'' speech. That, in some ways, is more       dangerous than a frontal attack.        Even assuming that there are some circumstances in which       speech can be legitimately restrained, we have seen that       schools have been inclined to dissemble in their       justifications for suppressing speech.        It is for that reason, when universities take action to       limit free speech, they have a solemn responsibility to be       absolutely honest and transparent in why they are doing so--      they must, as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, ``turn square       corners'' when demanding such accommodations. So far, our Ivy       League schools have demonstrated a pattern of suppression       that should upset all friends of freedom of speech.        I hope that Dartmouth's new president, Sian Leah Beilock,       will have the steel in her spine that is needed to take this       responsibility seriously and stand up for free speech when it       becomes difficult. Her recent statements are encouraging. But       when the chips are down, many university presidents have       folded.        Admittedly, one of the most serious questions the country       faces is how to achieve racial equality. Does it mean equal       opportunity or equal results? Is progress for African-      Americans, for instance, held back because of residual racism       or because of other aspects of the black experience? Views       about achieving racial equality that are uttered in good       faith are repressed--even shut down as ``racist''--if they       vary from certain orthodoxies.        As a result, the charge of ``racism,'' not unlike       McCarthy's frequent cry of ``communism,'' has been drained of       much of its meaning. Similarly, debates over issues relating       to sex education and sexual identity--issues about which many       hold sharply divergent views, sometimes based on religious       differences--are ruled unacceptable.        Those repressive forces come from the left side of our       political spectrum, but I can think of examples coming from       the opposite political pole. For instance, although it is       certainly reasonable for parents to argue about the       curriculum of public schools, it is intolerant to seek to ban       library books on critical race theory, at least at the high       school level.        By the same token, efforts to prevent persons such as Linda       Sarsour from speaking on college campuses in support of BDS       (boycott, divestment and sanctions) directed against Israel       are equally intolerant. As a onetime special envoy in the       Middle East I regard BDS and Sarsour's views as particularly       obnoxious, but I deplore the effort of Jewish groups to       prevent her from speaking at universities.        My class at Dartmouth entered in the fall of 1953. The       previous spring Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke at commencement.       He implicitly attacked Joe McCarthy and McCarthyism,       admonishing students: ``Don't join the book burners.''        Consider the context of Eisenhower's speech: we were in the       midst of a Cold War with the Soviet Union, over 50,000       American men had been killed in Korea, and there were indeed       prominent pro-communist traitors in our own government, as       well as in allied governments. Nevertheless, speaking       extemporaneously, Eisenhower courageously said, ``How will we       defeat communism unless we know what it is and what it       teaches and why does it have such an appeal to men, why are       so many people swearing allegiance to it? . . . And we have       got to fight it with something better, not try to conceal the       thinking of our own people.''        And this is the part I love: ``They are part of America.       And even if they think ideas that are contrary to ours, their       right to say them, their right to record them, and their       right to have them at places where they are accessible to       others is unquestioned, or it isn't America.''        Because McCarthy was a Republican, it was important that       Republicans--most notably Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and then       Eisenhower himself--were the ones to speak out and put an end       to his reign of intolerance. I hope you Dartmouth students--      on both sides of the political spectrum--will stand up for       freedom of expression. It is not a partisan issue. It is, as       I have tried to explain, fundamental to American democracy.        To be sure, you may have to draw upon ``the granite of New       Hampshire, in your muscles and your brains'' to withstand the       immense pressure to bow to conformity. But I expect nothing       less.    Madam President, on another matter, we begin to reach  [[Page S6923]]  the period every 2 years when the Senate begins our process of honoring  and bidding farewell to our distinguished colleagues who are soon  leaving our ranks. Seeing friends off is hardly a task to look forward  to, but it is made more tolerable when I get to boast about and  embarrass our talented colleagues one last time before they head for  the exits.   I will begin today with one of only two current Senators who were  around when I arrived as a freshman in 1985. By then, of course, Pat  Leahy had already made history.   When Pat was first elected in 1974, he was the first non-Republican  to represent Vermont in the Senate since 1856. And now, after eight  terms, he will depart having made history all over again as his State's  longest serving Senator by a comfortable margin.   Of course, it is the dash in between the dates that matters the most,  and to say that Pat Leahy has made the most of his time in Washington  would be truly an understatement.   Pat first developed his habit for lifelong learning growing up around  the printing press of his family's newspaper in Montpelier. But I  suspect our friend never hit the books as hard as he did after he found  out that the girl for whom he had fallen head over heels, Marcelle,  spoke not English but French at home. The way Pat tells it, he ``wanted  to know what [Marcelle's] parents were saying about [him].'' So the  studies began.   Here in the Senate, that same energy and curiosity led Pat to collect  enough policy passions for an entire congressional delegation--from  dairy farming to privacy, to landmine mitigation.   Pat and I got a chance to work closely together during our long  tenures switching off and on as chairmen and ranking members of the  State and Foreign Ops Subcommittee on Appropriations. As often as the  majority changed hands during our time, Pat and I made a point of  working as partners. He always knew the right time to break up tense  negotiations with a stemwinder of an old Irish joke.   We rolled up our sleeves and bonded over our shared commitment to  extending American influence and promoting our interests using soft  power, everywhere from East Asia to the former Soviet Union.   And like good appropriators, we also bonded over a firm mutual  conviction that our true opponent was never each other. It was the  House.   Our time leading the subcommittee together saw a major landmine  removal effort deservedly come to bear the name of its champion: the  Leahy War Victims Fund. And Pat lent equal support to one of my passion  projects: our work on behalf of the pro-democracy movement in Burma.   All of this work was accompanied by great humor. One time, after an  election that turned out well for my side, Pat showed up at our next  hearing having found a unique way to show grace in defeat. Here is what  happened. He showed up with a yard sign from a campaign of some local  candidate where he lived that read, ``McConnell for Chairman,'' and  remarked that, apparently, the voters of his neighborhood had gotten  their wish.   Even just measuring by local votes cast, Pat's colossal Senate legacy  put the name ``Leahy'' right up there with fellow titans like Kennedy,  Stevens, and Inouye. But Pat's legendary service to the people of  Vermont has been more than a vote tally. Over eight terms, he has made  a point of becoming not just a familiar name but a friendly face and a  committed servant to his neighbors.   And it certainly didn't come easy. The way I have heard the story,  Pat's first Senate victory came after he wisely dispatched his darling  French-speaking emissary, Marcelle, into the Francophone enclaves of  Vermont's ``northeast kingdom.''   Of course, we know Marcelle is much more than a natural campaigner.  She is an accomplished nurse and a treasured member of the Senate's  family in her own right.   So I know I speak for so many colleagues, past and present, in saying  the Senate will miss our distinguished President pro tempore. But we  know that Pat and Marcelle have more than earned some extra free time  to spend in their beautiful home State, with their kids--Kevin, Alicia,  and Mark--and their five grandkids, and with the many neighbors who are  grateful--so grateful--for a lifetime of outstanding service.
