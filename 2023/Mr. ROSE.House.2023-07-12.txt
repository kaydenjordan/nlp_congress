 Madam Speaker, since taking the majority in the House in  January, Republicans have been consistently holding hearings to conduct  oversight and demand accountability of the Biden administration when it  comes to the humanitarian crisis at our southern border.   For years now, sensible Republicans have done everything they can to  offer solutions to this humanitarian crisis in an effort to halt  illegal immigration but have been met with opposition by those on the  other side of the aisle that prefer the open-border policies of this  President and his administration.   Unfortunately, despite these repeated attempts to bring this  administration to the table to enact sensible immigration reform, which  the American people support, President Biden has done the opposite.   In fact, in President Biden's first 100 days in office, he took 94  executive actions on immigration, perhaps none as costly as halting the  construction of the southern border wall. He also ended the remain in  Mexico program, which had proven to be a successful deterrent at the  border.   Now, the good people at the Customs and Border Protection, who are  working hard under strenuous circumstances to protect our borders, have  seized over 17,000 pounds of fentanyl in fiscal year 2023, including a  [[Page H3213]]  14 percent increase in the month of April alone, compared to the prior  month.                                time  1015    In addition to these alarming figures, so far in fiscal year 2023, 96  people were stopped while attempting to cross the southern border whose  names could be found on the terrorist watch list. To put this into  perspective, during the entire last fiscal year, there were only 98  arrests, and that was more than in fiscal years 2017 through 2021  combined.   Madam Speaker, it is clear to the American people that President  Biden's Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security is directly  responsible for this abhorrent failure. That is why, much to my regret,  I have no choice but to continue my call for impeaching Secretary  Mayorkas, with the hope that the Biden administration will go ahead and  replace him with someone willing to actually take on the task of  securing our border. At the very least, the appropriate House  committees must begin considering and debating impeachment articles.   Madam Speaker, one of the most rewarding opportunities I am afforded  as a Member of Congress is getting to welcome new citizens who have  recently been naturalized into the United States. I repeatedly take the  time to point out the perseverance and dedication it takes to become a  U.S. citizen the legal and right way. It goes without saying: These  folks will forever be able to hold their heads high, knowing that they  respected our laws even before they became a citizen of this great  country.   I will also add that because of my familiarity with this process and  seeing what so many have to endure to come here legally, I have one  more reason out of many to fight against illegal immigration. That is  why I will continuously demand the Biden administration and Secretary  Mayorkas uphold our immigration laws, and I will engage in House  Republicans' oversight efforts until the American people can be  confident the administration is following the laws that govern  immigration in this country.   Madam Speaker, I ask all Members of Congress to join me in demanding  accountability from President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are following through on our  commitment to hold government accountable. Whether it be passing the  REINS Act or the Separation of Powers Restoration Act or compelling  many Biden administration officials to testify for the first time in  over a year, the American people can see we are hard at work.   There is still work to do. Since the President took office, he has  finalized 644 new regulations, which come with a $376 billion price tag  that negatively impacts our economy and requires more than 230 million  additional hours of paperwork.   Instead of burdening our job creators, House Republicans want to get  government out of their way through legislation like the CHOICE  Arrangement Act. We are also working to get government out of our  kitchens, which is why we passed the Save Our Gas Stoves Act.   This administration has never met a regulation it didn't like, but  rest assured, the House will continue reining in the Biden  administration's executive overreach.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my three amendments to  the Fiscal Year 2024 NDAA that are included in en bloc No. 4.   My first amendment adds as a sense of Congress that the MQ-9 Reaper  drone should be utilized to the greatest extent possible in the Indo- Pacific. I am proud to represent the 118th Wing of the Tennessee  National Guard, which operates the MQ-9. With investments, the MQ-9  drone has the potential to provide many more years of service to this  country.   My second amendment highlights the importance of our service branches  coordinating as closely as possible in the Indo-Pacific in order to  meet the challenges of the region.   Finally, my last amendment in en bloc No. 4 would prohibit the  Department of Defense's Office of Strategic Capital from investing or  facilitating investments in Chinese-owned firms.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting my  amendments.   Mr. Chairman, I also rise in support of amendment No. 71, submitted  by Representative Byron Donalds of Florida. Amendment No. 71  incorporates the text of H.R. 1009, the National Strategy to Utilize  Microreactors for Natural Disaster Response Efforts Act.   Microreactors are a game-changing technology. These relatively small  nuclear reactors have the potential to provide clean energy in a  variety of circumstances. One possibility is to utilize microreactors  to replace diesel generators during natural disaster response efforts.   Amendment No. 71 directs the President to develop a national strategy  to utilize microreactors to assist with natural disaster response  efforts. Replacing diesel generators with clean microreactors during  disaster response efforts will be much better for the environment. I  hope that by passing this amendment, we will be closer to that goal.   Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support greater investment in  microreactor technology, and I urge adoption of this amendment.
