 Mr. Speaker, I am happy to come to the floor this  afternoon to support House Resolution 658, the combined rule providing  for consideration of H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324.   H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, sponsored  by the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), is commonsense legislation.  The bill would publicize assets associated with Iran's Government and  military leadership. It would require a report to Congress on the  assets that these leaders control, how they were acquired, and how each  and every one of these Iranian leaders uses them.   The American people, the American businesses, and the international  community deserve to know who controls money and assets in Iran.   I am also proud to be the sponsor of H.R. 4324, the Strengthening  Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act. My legislation would improve  congressional oversight of any financing that the Treasury authorizes  for aircraft sales to Iran.   Every 6 months, the Treasury would need to certify to us that finance  authorizations would not benefit an Iranian person who is transporting  items for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nor  providing transportation for sanctioned entities.                                time  1300    Treasury would also have to certify to us that these authorizations  don't pose a significant money laundering or terrorism finance risk to  the U.S. financial system.   If the Treasury Department cannot make this certification, the  Department must tell us why, and it must explain to Congress the course  of action it intends to take.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this rule, and I urge them to  support H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324.    Mr. Speaker, it is truly a privilege to speak in  support of my bill, H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's  Access to Finance Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4324 will improve congressional oversight of any  financing that Treasury authorizes for aircraft sales to Iran.   Every 6 months, Treasury would need to certify to us that finance  authorizations would not benefit an Iranian person who is transporting  items for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction nor  providing transportation for sanctioned entities. Treasury would also  have to certify to us that those authorizations don't pose a  significant money laundering or terrorism finance risk to the U.S.  financial system, and that any banks engaging in this business have  appropriate due diligence procedures in place. If the Treasury  Department cannot make this certification, the Department must tell us  why, and it must explain to Congress the course of action it intends to  take.   I note that my bill was reported out of the Financial Services  Committee last month by a vote of 38-21, with five of my Democratic  colleagues voting in its favor.                                time  1745    Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will label this  bill as a simple attempt to dismantle the Obama administration's Iran  nuclear deal. We have already heard it.   Mr. Speaker, this debate is not about U.S. commitments under the  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. It is not about  reimposing nuclear sanctions. It is not about prohibiting these  aircraft sales or the financing of these sales.   What this legislation is about is providing Congress with information  on the implications of these deals so that we can better understand  their impact on the integrity of our financial system.   I would like to take a step back and discuss how we got to this point  and why this legislation is necessary. As most of you know, under the  JCPOA, the Obama administration committed the United States to license  the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran. In addition to providing  licenses for aircraft sales, the licenses also allowed for banks to  engage in the financing of these aircraft.   All of this was permitted, despite the fact that Iran remained  classified as a jurisdiction to primary money laundering concern by the  Treasury Department and as the world's foremost state sponsor of terror  by the State Department.   Let us be abundantly clear on the facts. It was the Obama Treasury  Department that highlighted the role that Iran and Iranian aircraft  played in the destabilizing activity across the Middle East and in  supporting the atrocities committed by the rogue Assad regime in Syria.   On September 9, 2012, David S. Cohen, the Treasury Undersecretary for  Terrorism and Financial Intelligence under President Obama, released  the following statement:   ``The identification of Iranian aircraft also further highlights  Iran's ongoing effort to support the Assad regime's weapons of mass  destruction programs and crackdown against the Syrian people.''   This quote followed the Treasury Department's announcement to impose  sanctions against entities that support the Assad regime in Syria.   So quoting from the same September 9, 2012, Treasury statement: ``As  a result of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act,  foreign financial institutions that knowingly engage in significant  transactions with . . . Iran Air, Mahan Air, or Yas Air, including any  of 117 aircraft operated by these airlines, risk losing access to the  U.S. banking system.''   Mr. Speaker, this week I received a memo from the National Iranian  American Council urging members to oppose my bill. This is the same  council that opposes President Trump's travel ban, which was recently  upheld by a Supreme Court decision of 7-2, and the same organization  that took concern with new sanctions imposed on Iran's support for  Hezbollah.   This memo and the pro-Iran principles that it represents could not be  a better endorsement for the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access  to Finance Act.   I would ask this to my colleagues on both sides: At what point did we  relegate ourselves to negotiating with those who wish us harm? At what  point did we prioritize the interest of a rogue government that paints  their bombs with sayings like ``Death to Israel'' and ``Death to  America''? When did that happen?  [[Page H9884]]    There are simply two sides to this issue. You can either protect the  interests of the United States, her citizens, and the U.S. financial  institutions, or you can make important the wishes of the Ayatollah and  his revolutionary guard.   Which side do you choose to be on? That is the question.   I represent the red, white, and blue.    My commitment to the safety and well-being of these  United States is unwavering.   I urge my colleagues to do the same: support the red, white, and  blue, and support H.R. 4324.
