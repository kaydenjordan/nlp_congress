 Mr. President, while other colleagues are joining us to  speak on behalf of the Cortez Masto language, I wanted to thank the  Senator from Nevada for her legislation and just emphasize how  important this is to people all through the United States, including my  State. It happens to be a border State, but even in Seattle, providers  are worrying about a chilling effect.   I was wondering if the Senator from Nevada--while our colleagues have  been talking about how this impacts individuals, people seeking  healthcare in other States, what is happening now with the chilling  effect to providers and their anxiety over people pursuing them for  seeing patients from States in which Roe v. Wade is not fully  protected?    I want to thank the Senator from Nevada. We were joined  by the American Medical Association that also expressed this concern.  They are speaking on behalf of the providers that want to provide  reproductive choice in States that pass this law, and they are  concerned. We need to get this legislation passed.   I thank the Senator from Nevada.
