 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from El Paso.   I very much appreciate, always, the story and the passion that you  have for that great community and look at the leadership that comes out  of there. I certainly know in your work for veterans your name will be  added to that list. The passion, the willingness to solve problems, the  willingness to find and make the tough choices to fulfill this Nation's  commitment to our veterans is something I am just proud to serve  alongside you.   I would echo the gentleman's comments, having the opportunity today  to witness the swearing in of Dr. David Shulkin as our next VA  Secretary, being there with Vice President Pence along with Senators  Isakson and Tester on the Senate side and Dr. Roe, of whom you spoke  very accurately, Mr. O'Rourke--a true gentleman, an impassioned  advocate for veterans, and a no-nonsense legislator, exactly what we  need.                                time  1930    You just have to watch the sense of can-do spirit up there and see  Dr. Shulkin and his family--with young children--and the sacrifice that  goes into public service. This is a gentleman who could make far more  money and probably have a lot less headaches if he would continue to  serve in the private sector. He chose not to do that for all the right  reasons.   I think it probably brings us to the message that Mr. O'Rourke is  delivering. This is something that unites this country more than  anything else: the care and service to our veterans.   It doesn't matter your political persuasion, it doesn't matter where  you fall on the spectrum, it doesn't matter what you necessarily think  of the wars or the conflicts that we are engaged in, but the care for  those veterans is something that my folks in Mankato, Minnesota, your  folks in El Paso, folks in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Seattle, and  every small town in between want us to get right. They want us to use  the data to deliver the benefits that were earned. They want us to get  it right to show that this Nation's commitment is not something that is  fleeting or comes and goes. I think most people understand this is a  complex issue.   Again, I was reading recently--to put this into perspective--when  they make this promise, when they raise their hand to serve this  Nation, they are in it for the long haul. The Veterans Benefits  Administration is still paying out $73 a month to the daughter of a  Civil War veteran. 152 two years after the end of that conflict, this  Nation still needs to keep its commitment.   So, when you go to war, it comes with a long tail attached to it.  That long tail attached is doing what President Lincoln asked us to do:  care for those who bore the battle, their widow, and their orphan.   I think it is within that spirit that I would encourage our  constituents, Mr. Speaker, to take an eye and look at what is happening  with veterans' issues. When they don't believe anything can work, and  they believe everything up here is a fight and that we couldn't agree  it is Tuesday today, that is simply not the case. We have good, smart  people working for solutions to difficult problems who are in the best  interest of this Nation, the best interest of our veterans, and the  best interest of taxpayers.   I would encourage people not to make rash generalizations. When  people say, Oh, nothing works in the VA, that is not true. Many things  work in the VA, and many things work very well. But when they don't,  that is an abject failure. When one veteran is left behind or a  situation like Phoenix arises, no, that is not good enough, and we can  do better.   But we have an attitude that we don't need to keep this commitment to  the VA, that we don't need to do that, or somehow that we are not  already using our resources in the private sector. The gentleman, I am  sure, will talk about it, but last year, 31 percent of all healthcare  needs were delivered in the private sector in fee-for-service.   When that makes sense, when it is most efficient, when it is most  convenient for the veteran, we should deliver that, but with an  understanding the VA has a core mission to do research into extremity  injuries or things that would not happen, outside of industrial  accidents or war. The VA needs to be there. The VA needs to be there to  train physicians. The VA needs to be there to make sure we keep that  accountability, instead of telling a veteran: You are just on your on.  Good luck getting your care.   It is in that spirit that I, too, am hopeful. I think it needs to be  said to our constituents, Mr. Speaker, and it goes through  administration after administration, whether you like the  administration or not, the commitment to veterans has to be there.   They have got some of it right; they have got some of it wrong. I  think there is a responsibility that, in the first choice of this  administration in dealing with veterans, I believe they might have  picked the one person in this country best suited to do the job for  veterans. That says a lot.   I think it is important to stress that point, understanding that that  Secretary can't do it alone. Congress writes the laws. This House  authorizes the money to make that happen. We have oversight  responsibility, and we have partners in our veterans service  organizations who are there to help, whether it be the American Legion,  whether it be the VFW, the DAV, the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.  These are all folks out there who want to keep that commitment to want  to help.   The gentleman spoke true, and he spoke true from the heart that, at  that one time, people may not have seen service on the VA Committee as  something as a prize position. The folks who have found themselves  there are committed to this, above everything. They are committed to it  above party. They are committed above their own personal advancement.  On both sides of the aisle, there is a camaraderie that is rarely seen  in the press, that is rarely seen by the general public about getting  this right.   I think there is much that can be restored. If anything, I oftentimes  say how we conduct ourselves in this people's House of Representatives  must be a direct reflection on the sacrifice that gives us the right to  self govern.   Those who paid the ultimate sacrifice were doing it so that citizens  could elect their Representatives to debate the issues of the day in a  free and open democracy. So just the exercise tonight of having the  opportunity and the privilege to share a little of the floor was given  to us at great sacrifice. We need to conduct ourselves in a bipartisan,  results-oriented manner that honors that commitment.   I thank the gentleman from El Paso and look forward to his leadership  as our ranking member on subcommittees that are coming up on issues  that will affect employees at the VA and delivery of care. I know they  are in good hands. As I say it again, I love the stories of El Paso  from such an impassioned son of El Paso. I think your constituents  should be proud you are there.   Mr. O'ROURKE. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota and the ranking  member of the full committee of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee  for being here tonight and talking about not just our challenges, but  some of the hope and opportunity that we have ahead with this new  Secretary for the VA, this new leadership on the committee, and this  renewed commitment from this Congress and this country to do the right  thing by her veterans.   I am so glad, Mr. Speaker, that he mentioned the necessity to ensure  the long-time health and viability of the VA. There has been some talk  about privatizing the VA and of just essentially asking our veterans to  go find their own doctors and their own medical providers in the  communities in which they live, no longer having the VA as the core of  the delivery of care that they have depended on for so long.   I think it is important that Secretary Shulkin, in his confirmation  [[Page H1178]]  hearing, said that he would never be part of privatizing the VA, at  least not on his watch, at least not during his tenure.   While there are opportunities to capitalize on care in the community,  as the ranking member said, only at the VA will we have doctors,  nurses, providers, and frontline staff, many of whom are, by the way,  themselves veterans who have uniquely cared for other veterans, know  the signs to look for when we are trying to reduce veteran suicide,  know specifically how to treat post-traumatic stress disorder,  traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, traumatic amputations-- the kinds of conditions that don't typically occur in the civilian  population and that we don't see at our general private-public  hospitals, but are unique to the VA and unique to military medicine,  where we uniquely will ensure that our veterans and military retirees  get world-class care from those who are uniquely trained to deliver  that to ensure the best outcomes.   While we should never shy from the shortcomings or the challenges  within the VA--and there are plenty of them--I think it is really  important to reiterate how often we are successful in seeing veterans  whose care depends upon a doctor or a provider at the VA who leaves  that appointment grateful for the time that they were able to spend  there, grateful for the care they received, and grateful for the fact  that there is a VA.   This last week, on Friday--it was a few days early--we took some  Valentine's Day cards made by elementary school students at LBJ  Elementary in El Paso to veterans at the VA. I was joined by Colonel  Mike Amaral, the new permanent director of the El Paso VA, formerly  chief of staff at William Beaumont Army Medical Center.   We shook hands with veterans, shook hands with frontline staff, shook  hands with nurses and providers at the VA, thanking them for their  service, wishing them an early happy Valentine's Day. To each veteran  either coming in or leaving the VA, I asked them what their experience  was like in either making an appointment, if they were on their way in,  or how their appointment went when they were on their way out.   As the ranking member knows, the veterans who we represent are never  shy about sharing the truth and the facts of their experience with the  VA. We hear the good, we hear the bad, we hear the ugly.   At the El Paso VA on Friday, for every veteran who had been seen by a  doctor, the story was a positive one. For every veteran going in to see  a doctor, the story was a positive one. It doesn't mean that every  single veteran's story in El Paso is positive. Let's acknowledge that  some appointments are dropped. Sometimes the phone isn't answered.  Sometimes an appointment is made and the doctor is not there to see the  veteran.   All of those circumstances are unacceptable. I know Colonel Amaral  feels the way I do. I know Secretary Shulkin feels the way I do. I know  every single Member of Congress feels the way I do. But let's remember  that the vast majority of veterans are able to be seen, are getting  great health care at the VA, and, for the most part, when they are  referred to care in the community when a doctor is unavailable at the  VA, when a psychiatrist is not able to see that veteran for a  behavioral health appointment and referred to a provider in the  community, most of those right now are working well. Not perfectly, not  all the time.   There is work before us that we must do, and it is critically  important, but I am making the point that the VA needs to maintain the  core of delivery of care to our veterans. We can add to that core the  providers in our communities, public hospitals, private hospitals,  clinics, doctors, those who want to step up at not great profit to  themselves. The rates that they are reimbursed are just at or less than  Medicare, but they do it because they want to do their part to continue  to serve this country, to serve veterans who stood up, put their lives  on the line, and ensured that we have the United States that we are so  grateful for today.   So I think that is a positive situation on which we can build with  the right team here in Congress, at our local VAs, and with our new  Secretary.   I will tell you a story about Secretary Shulkin. Shortly after he was  named Under Secretary of Veterans Health Administration, I brought to  his attention the suicide crisis that we have in El Paso among El Paso  veterans, in Texas, and in the United States, where we now know that  today, by VA's latest estimate, 20 veterans are taking their own lives.  The old estimate was 22. It was based on incomplete data. All 50  States' basis for the new numbers shows us that we are at 20. That is  too many. It is unacceptable. It has to become our number one priority.  Unless it is, we won't reduce that number, we won't save more lives, we  won't prevent more preventable deaths.   I shared with Dr. Shulkin that, after hearing from veteran after  veteran after veteran, while generally their care received in the VA  was excellent--when they were there, they were treated like a king or a  queen--too often, when they were seeking a behavioral health  appointment, mental health care appointment, maybe related to post- traumatic disorder, maybe a Vietnam-era veteran who had successfully  bottled his trauma, experiences for 40, 45, 50 years who was now coming  to terms when he reached certain crossroads in his life with that  trauma and needed to speak to someone, too often they were not able to  get in to see somebody at the VA.    So we conducted a scientific, objective, third-party survey of  veterans in El Paso, and we found--with a margin of error less than 4  percent, so this is pretty conclusive--that more than a third of  veterans in our community could not get in to see a mental health care  provider when, at that time, the prescribed 2 weeks, not within 30  days, not within a year. Just not ever.   We know for a fact that care delayed becomes care denied. It leads to  terrible outcomes. At a minimum, unnecessary suffering for that  veteran; at worst, preventable deaths. Veterans taking their own lives.   So I brought this issue to Dr. Shulkin's attention. I told him this  community had rallied around our veterans in El Paso, Texas, and that  the VA providers there, the public hospital, University Medical Center;  Del Sol Hospital; Providence Hospital; Mentis Neurological  Rehabilitation Center, another private facility; all of these folks  wanted to come together to see if they could fill the gap in care and  coverage that the VA was unable to meet.   But we needed some leadership from the VA. We needed them to take a  chance on a model that had never been tried before. We wanted Dr.  Shulkin and the VHA to get behind a pilot program in El Paso that would  allow us to take some of these matters into our own hands, where,  despite the best intentions and significantly increased funding from  the VA in El Paso, we still weren't able to see veterans who  desperately need care.   Dr. Shulkin reviewed the proposal with us, made some suggested  changes, and within 4 months of having been sworn in as Under Secretary  of VHA, he was able to help us get this pilot program approved,  underway, with a collaboration with Texas Tech University Health  Sciences Center in El Paso, after finding that the best performing VAs  in the country are associated with academic teaching institutions.   He made that partnership with Texas Tech possible. He made referring  care out into the community where we didn't have the doctors in the VA  possible. He ensured that at the VA we continue to concentrate on those  areas of excellence--on service and combat-connected disabilities and  conditions that we don't see in the general population that, more than  anything else, makes the case for the VA: for strengthening the VA, for  ensuring that it is not there just today, but forever.   As long as we have a country, we should have a VA that performs at  the high levels in those areas where veterans need it most--post- traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, traumatic  amputation, military sexual trauma--those conditions that are unique to  service and to combat.                                time  1945    So I am really encouraged that we have him now as the Secretary of  the full VA. I am really encouraged that we have the leadership like  Mr. Walz and Dr. Roe in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs in the  House. I am really  [[Page H1179]]  encouraged by the leadership that we see on the Senate side, and I have  got to tell you--and I am sure that Mr. Walz would agree with me--we  have leadership out in every single community in this country, from the  Veterans of Foreign Wars, from the Vietnam Veterans of America, from  the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, from the Disabled  American Veterans, from the Paralyzed Veterans of America, from every  single veterans service organization, too many to mention in the time  that I have allotted today, who put the pressure, provide the  solutions, make trips up to Washington, D.C., as they will this next  week, to ensure that they are holding us accountable for the terrific  responsibility that we have before us, and that we perform against that  responsibility and that we perform against the goals that we have set-- very ambitious, but achievable goals--for this country and every single  veteran who has served who lives in this country who we have a sacred  obligation to today.   I am encouraged that this committee, this Congress, this country  works on a bipartisan--or let's just say a nonpartisan--basis to get  that work done. We are introducing two bills tomorrow, for example,  both with Republican cosponsors. The first bill is the Veteran  Prescription Continuity Act with Representative Mike Coffman from  Colorado and Representative Walter Jones from North Carolina. That  bill, if made into law, will ensure that veterans who were dependent on  the care provided in part through prescriptions prescribed while they  were Active Duty servicemembers at a military treatment facility are  still able to receive those prescriptions as veterans. A lot of folks  don't know this, but we don't have a unified formulary between DOD and  VA. Some veterans, some prescriptions get dropped along the way. Here  is a no-brainer, quick bipartisan fix to that part of the problem.   The other bill is the Mental Health Care Provider Retention Act, also  introduced with Walter Jones from North Carolina. This ensures at a  time of crisis when it comes to veteran suicide that if you are an  Active Duty servicemember and you are receiving good treatment at a  military treatment facility for post-traumatic stress disorder, for  example, or other mental health issues, that if the VA cannot continue  that care because we don't have enough psychiatrists or psychologists-- we are 45,000 clinical positions short in the VA today--if you are  getting good care in the Department of Defense military treatment  facility and there is not that care for you on the VA side as you  transition out and separate in a given community like El Paso, that you  will be able to continue to receive quality mental health care  treatment at that military treatment facility.   Again, this isn't going to solve every access problem. It is not  going to, in itself, reduce or solve the suicide crisis we have amongst  veterans, but it is a commonsense, bipartisan approach that makes  things a little bit better, that ensures that we have more access for  more veterans and begin to take more steps toward reducing veteran  suicide.   Mr. Speaker, I am very encouraged today by the opportunities before  us, by the leadership that is ready to take on that work, and with the  opportunity I have to join these leaders to ensure that we fulfill  every commitment that we have to every veteran in America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
