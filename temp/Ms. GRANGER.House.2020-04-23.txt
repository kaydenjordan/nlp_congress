 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of the Paycheck Protection Program and the  Health Care Enhancement Act, which provides nearly $500 billion for  economic recovery and public health efforts in response to the  coronavirus pandemic.   The cornerstone of this legislation is the support for small  businesses through the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program. These PPP  loans, which can be completely forgiven, are essential for small  businesses to continue paying their employees and cover operating  costs.   To illustrate how crucial this loan has been to the 30 million small  businesses in this country, the SBA supported more loans in the first  14 days of the PPP than it did in the last 14 years. In total, more  than $340 billion has been provided to more than 1.6 million American  small businesses.   An additional $60 billion is provided in this bill for another key  source of assistance for small business: economic injury disaster loans  and grants. Borrowers can get loans at low interest rates and then  repay them over a long period of time, up to 30 years.   This legislation also provides $100 billion for critical healthcare  initiatives. These funds will support our heroes on the front lines and  allow us to deploy more tests so we know where the virus is having the  most impact. With this information, we can begin safely reopening our  communities and restarting our economy.   While it took much too long to get this bill to the floor today, I  want to thank my colleagues for coming together to deliver results for  the American people whose health and livelihoods depend on it.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting on this measure to continue  supporting our Nation's small businesses, their hardworking employees,  and our critical healthcare workers.
