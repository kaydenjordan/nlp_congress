 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the implementation of the  harmful DeVos/Trump borrower defense regulation.   Instead of working on behalf of students, Secretary DeVos is  enriching predatory for-profit colleges that leave students with  crushing debt. Instead of creating a streamlined process to help  defrauded borrowers access relief and move forward with their lives,  this administration has given dishonest schools new tools they can use  to keep taking advantage of students.   In my district in 2016, the courts found that the Minnesota School of  Business and Globe University engaged in consumer fraud and purposely  deceived more than 1,000 Minnesota students who were systematically  misled to believe that they would obtain a degree and credits that were  essentially meaningless, losing not only $33.8 million, but also their  time and countless opportunities.   It is the government's duty to look out for those victimized students  and to make sure they don't continue to suffer at the hands of the  greedy institutions that took advantage of them.   Secretary DeVos should be ashamed of herself for failing to uphold  that duty and for once again putting profit over people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution.
