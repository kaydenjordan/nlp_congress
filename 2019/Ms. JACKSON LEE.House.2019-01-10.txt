 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this special order  to speak against the devastating cuts being proposed for the Farm  Bill's Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program (SNAP).   The $20.5 billion cuts would remove 2 million Americans from the food  assistance program, and 210,000 children would lose access to free  school meals.   The House Democrats' bill, is virtually identical to legislation that  has already passed the Senate on a 92-6 vote, will reopen these  agencies and stop some the worst impacts of the Trump Shutdown on  families, businesses, and communities.   It provides $23.235 billion in discretionary funding, $225 million  above the FY2018 enacted level. In addition, it provides the latest  estimates for mandatory programs required by law--including the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Child Nutrition Programs.  It will ensure that the Department of Agriculture and the FDA are both  able to operate through September 30.   This bill rejects President Trump's proposed budget cuts to  agriculture, rural development, and conservation programs. It includes  funding for rural broadband that President Trump had proposed  eliminating.   Finally, the bill rejects President Trump's proposed elimination of  Food for Peace and the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education  and Child Nutrition Program, both which provide lifesaving food  assistance overseas.   For one in six Americans hunger is real and far too many people  assume that problems with hunger are isolated in small pockets of the  country. That is not the case--hunger is persistent and the impacts  real for millions of people who struggle to find enough to eat.   According to Feeding America:   In 2016, 46.2 million people were in poverty, 1.1 million people are  food insecure in the Houston area, 2.4 million rural households face  hunger;   Three-quarters of the counties with the highest rates of food  insecurity are in rural areas;   86% of the counties with the highest rates of child food insecurity  are rural;   In 2017, there were 39.7 million people in poverty.   There are 3.7 million Texans at risk of losing Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits if the Trump Shutdown does not end.   The more important statistic is how many other Americans will have  their local grocery store put at risk of closing or having reduced  supplies of groceries to serve their customers because of the economic  chaos that will ensue if SNAP benefits across the nation are ended due  to the shutdown.   Most Americans have no idea how SNAP, Women, Infants and Children's  (WIC) Food and Nutrition Service and other federal food subsidy  programs contribute to the affordability of food found in grocery  stores.   For grocers, convenience stores and other food retailers, the  suspension of funding for the food-stamp program, or SNAP, comes at a  time when they cannot afford to lose sales.   Over 3,500 grocery and convenience stores operate on a 1% profit  margin, with the proposed cuts to the SNAP program, these stores will  experience a large decrease in profit.   There is no feasible way to absorb any kind of decrease in sales.   The abrupt end of SNAP, WIC and other Federal food subsidy program  funding that is spent at local grocers would be devastating to all  large grocery store chains.   In 2016, more than 52% of SNAP dollars, or $33 billion, were redeemed  at big-box stores such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp., up from 47% in  2015, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.   Big retailers routinely notice a bump in sales around the time states  disperse SNAP money to recipients each month.   Walmart generates roughly $13 billion in annual sales from SNAP  transactions, accounting for around 18% of the money spent through the  program nationwide.   Some retailers serve regions where more than one-third of shoppers  buy groceries with food stamps, without this money most of these stores  will not be able to maintain the diverse food choices that are usually  available to their consumers.   The retailer with the highest risk of lost sales is Walmart which  receives roughly 56% of its food sales.   Dollar General, gets about 5 percent of its sales from SNAP benefits  and their traffic slowed tremendously during the last government  shutdown, they can't afford the same outcome this year.   President Trump has previously demonstrated a hostility towards the  SNAP program in his proposal that retailers pay a fee for authorization  to accept food stamps.   The government's overall SNAP spending declines when the economy  improves and fewer people rely on the program and this means that  grocery store customers are instead using funds from employment or  other sources instead.   A government shutdown will have a depressing effect on grocery store  sales and compounding this will be a cut in SNAP and WIC funds.   Government low wage workers will be seeking SNAP and WIC assistance  as they work to cope with not being paid.   Dean said cutting benefits when people's financial situations are not  improving could mean they use money they otherwise would have spent on  needs like clothing or even medicine to make up for the gaps in their  food budget. So there's still an impact to the overall economy, she  said.   A report by the USDA in 2010 also said that boosting SNAP benefits  during economic downturns starts a ``multiplier process'' in  transactions and consumption. It found that boosting SNAP expenditures  by $1 billion was estimated to increase economic activity by $1.79  billion.   Unfortunately, benefits cannot be increased as a direct consequence  of the shutdown.   SNAP offers nutrition assistance to millions of low income  individuals and families. SNAP is the largest program in the American  domestic hunger safety net.   If the Trump Shutdown extends for weeks or months, the damage to the  food economy may not be easily repaired.   The Child Nutrition Programs, including School Lunch, School  Breakfast, Child and Adult Care Feeding, Summer Food Service and  Special Milk will continue operations into February according to the  Department of Agriculture.   We cannot afford to create food deserts and greater hunger in our  country.   While prices for agricultural products are not expected to be  significantly altered in the short term, an extended shutdown coupled  with ongoing trade tensions could impact the ability for farmers to  operate in the domestic and international marketplace.   The following USDA activities have been shut down during the  government funding lapse:  [[Page H397]]    Provision of new rural development loans and grants for housing,  community facilities, utilities and businesses.   All recreation sites across the U.S. National Forest System, unless  they are operated by external parties under a recreational special use  permit.   New timber sales.   Most forest fuels reduction activities in and around communities.   National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) statistics, World  Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report, and other agricultural  economic and statistical reports and projections. Investigation of  packers and stockyards related to fraudulent and anti-competitive  activities.   Assistance for the control of most plant and animal pests and  diseases unless funded by cooperators or other non-appropriated  sources.   Research facilities except for the care for animals, plants and  associated infrastructure to preserve agricultural research. Provision  of new grants or processing of payments for existing grants to support  research, education, and extension.   ERS Commodity Outlook Reports, Data Products, research reports, staff  analysis, and projections. The ERS public website has been taken  offline.   Most departmental management, administrative and oversight functions,  including civil rights, human resources, financial management, audit,  investigative, legal and information technology activities.   Mandatory Audits (Financial Statements, FISMA, and potentially  Improper Payments) will be suspended and may not be completed and  released on the date mandated by law.   Farm loans and some farm payments (including direct payments, market  assistance loans, market facilitation payments for those producers who  have not certified production, and disaster assistance programs).   The Agriculture Industry has been harmed by the tariff battles that  President Trump started and continues to wage.   Funding was put in the Farm Bill that passed in December to offer  some relief that will not come until the shutdown ends.   I ask my Colleagues to join me in voting for the passage of this  bill.   President Trump needs to end this shutdown now.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 267, the  ``Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019,'' which funds the Department  of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development  and ensure that people living in housing supported by HUD are not  evicted as a result of the government shutdown proudly engineered by  the President of the United States.   I am pleased to co-sponsor and support this bill because it is the  right thing to do.   Because of the Trump Shutdown, some of the most important activities  funded in the Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and  Related Agencies have ground to a halt.   In addition to concerns over possible evictions and severe slowdowns  with Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, the shutdown has also  led to other serious impacts.   For example, the health and safety of renters have been put at risk  because HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center is not conducting  inspections in assisted housing units which are critical to ensure  decent, safe, and sanitary housing.   Because of the shutdown, the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration has suspended data analysis and investigations into  motor vehicle manufacturing defects which means that recalls of  automotive defects will not occur.   The FAA training academy in Oklahoma City is closed, slowing the  training of new air traffic controllers, despite shortages of qualified  staff nationwide.   Additionally, the issuance of FAA airmen certificates that are  required for the crew of international carriers that transit through  the U.S. has been suspended--the issuance of airmen certificates which  are mandatory for becoming a student, private, or commercial pilot;  flight engineer, navigator, or attendant; or other aviation-related  professions.   These are among the many reasons I strongly support H.R. 267, which  is virtually identical to legislation that has already passed the  Senate on a 92-6 vote.   This legislation will reopen the Departments of Transportation and  Housing and Urban Development and stop some the worst impacts of the  Trump Shutdown on families, businesses, and communities.   The bill provides $71.4 billion in discretionary funding, $23.3  billion above the President's budget request and $1.1 billion above the  FY2018 enacted level.   The total includes more than $17 billion in funding for new  infrastructure projects, in addition to $49 billion for infrastructure  from dedicated fuel and aviation taxes.   And the bill rejects the President's deep cuts to Public and Indian  Housing and Community Planning and Development.   The bill also rejects President Trump's proposed elimination of the  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), the HOME Investment  Partnerships Program, and the Choice Neighborhood Initiative.   Mr. Speaker, it is well that we take stock of the human toll caused  by the Trump Shutdown, which is now entering its third week.   420,000 federal employees are working without pay.   Frontline federal employees, including law enforcement and public  safety personnel, have been working without pay since December 22,  including 14,000 FBI agents, 54,000 Customs and Border Protection  agents, 6,000 Forest Service firefighters.   400,000 Federal Employees have been furloughed.   In addition to the federal employees working without pay, hardworking  federal employees at agencies like the Department of Transportation,  the Department of Commerce, and NASA have been furloughed without pay,  plunging them and their families into uncertainty.   The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has stopped processing loans  and mortgage approvals, putting families trying to buy a new home or  refinance an FHA-insured mortgage into financial limbo.   IRS Customer Service Halted, Tax Return Processing Jeopardized.   Walk-in taxpayer assistance centers and all taxpayer customer  service, which serves approximately 2.5 million citizens monthly, is  unavailable during the shutdown.   Electronic and paper tax returns submitted by taxpayers will not be  processed, leading to backlogs that will potentially delay tax refunds.   The Food and Drug Administration cannot accept any regulatory  submissions and cannot support many routine regulatory and compliance  activities.   This includes some medical product, animal drug, and most food- related activities.   The FDA also cannot conduct routine establishment inspections, which  could prevent the finding and correction of violations, especially for  food safety.   A shutdown beyond January would cause the Food and Nutrition Service  to reduce benefits by about 40 percent to almost 40 million  [[Page H428]]  individuals and families across the country who are dependent on the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).   The Small Business Administration has completely halted its role in  the federal contracting process, interfering with projects government  wide.   The SBA has also stopped approving loan assistance and guarantee  applications from commercial banks and small businesses, blocking  access to federally-assisted loans for many small businesses.   Businesses across the country have lost access to the Department of  Homeland Security's E-Verify program, which is intended to allow  business owners to comply with federal law and determine the  immigration status of employees they hire.   Most services provided by the Federal Trade Commission are suspended  under the shutdown, including the National Do Not Call Registry (for  consumers and telemarketers), consumer complaint systems, and identity  theft reporting--as well as law enforcement access to FTC's consumer  complaints.   In addition, the FTC has suspended most investigations and litigation  under the shutdown.   The Department of Justice's civil litigation efforts against bad  actors have stopped, and payments to crime victims have been put on  hold.   Training for Department of Justice employees, even for those still  working despite the shutdown, is canceled.   Department of Justice programs to train state and local law  enforcement officers and officials have also been canceled.   All services for visitors to National Park Service sites--such as  visitors' centers, interpretative programs, and restrooms--have been  suspended.   Many Parks are overflowing with uncollected garbage, while curtailed  law enforcement staffing is putting visitors' safety at risk.   In addition, the Smithsonian Institution and the National Gallery of  Art have closed.   The Environmental Protection Agency has halted inspections at  drinking water systems, hazardous waste management and chemical  facilities.   The men and women who have been furloughed because of this  manufactured crisis are not responsible for the Trump Shutdown.   The dedicated men and women of the federal civilian workforce, like  those who serve in the Armed Forces, have not spent their professional  lives fomenting ethnic hatred and xenophobia, or imagining a national  security crisis on the southern border.   Instead, these loyal and committed public servants are motivated by  their paramount interest in serving the American public without fear or  favor and, for the last four days, without any guarantee that they  would be compensated for their labor.   And yet, they gladly and willingly serve, some risking their lives to  keep us safe.   Others stand watch monitoring weather systems and providing  information necessary to protect the public from hurricanes and  tornadoes and wildfires or conducting research to find cures for  disease or that will yield technological innovations or help us mark  and measure the far reaches of space.   Others work to secure the borders and homeland, ensure the safety of  our food and water, serve our seniors and children, provide training  and support for those looking for work, and protecting our environment  and keeping watch over our treasures--our national parks and monuments,  including this magnificent Capitol where the people have sent us to  their business.   Mr. Speaker, the men and women of the federal workforce do the  people's business. They serve everyone equally. They do not single out  some persons to serve and ignore others. They do not cherry-pick.   We should follow their example. And the best way to do that is for  the House and Senate to pass this and the remaining appropriations  bills by veto-proof margins and send them to President for signature  and to vote to override should the President unwisely elect to veto the  bill.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 267.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 115 the  ``Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices  Act,'' which directs the State Department to establish a policy on  location-tracking consumer devices at U.S. diplomatic and consular  facilities around the world and requires employees to be briefed on the  policies and procedures during routine security briefings.   H.R. 115 also requires the Secretary of State to coordinate with  heads of any other agencies whose employees are deployed to or  stationed at U.S. facilities in formulating this policy.   I support this legislation because, among other things, with the  enactment of this act, the Secretary of State shall establish a policy  on the use of location-tracking devices, including GPS-enabled devices,  at United States facilities, both at home and abroad.   This act clarifies that U.S. employees will be kept updated and  notified about the use of location-tracking consumer devices both on  and off the premises of U.S. diplomatic and consular facilities.   The State Department is the critical go between when dealing with  international affairs and foreign policy issues, and this act will  expand their duties by protecting the privacy rights of Diplomats and  resident employees in this new age of technology.   Location-tracking information can be stored within a device or  transmitted to an outside server, both storing the data, and giving  real time location of said device.   Mr. Speaker, in this day and age, most smart phone users have  location-tracking apps open on their device at all times; an estimated  90 percent of smart phone owners in 2015 use location-based services,  and have them on a all times.   For example, weather apps, which an estimated 65 percent of adults  share their location with and check daily, require the users' location  to provide accurate weather information.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  115 and upholding the importance of the privacy of our employees in  consular and diplomatic facilities, and ensuring that all persons  involved are aware and educated about the upholding policies.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 133, the  ``United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act'' that promotes  economic partnership and cooperation between the United States and  Mexico.   The ``United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act'' strategy  predominantly focuses on academic, business and medical exchanges.   The United States and Mexico have benefitted from a bilateral,  mutually beneficial partnership focused on advancing the economic  interests of both countries.   In March 2011, the United States launched the ``100,000 Strong in the  Americas Initiative'', which increased educational exchanges between  the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere region.   The 100,000 United States students are studying in other countries in  the Western Hemisphere region and 100,000 non-United States students  from the region are studying in the United States per year by 2020.   The ``United States-Mexico Economic Partnership Act'' would expand  the educational and professional exchange programs with Mexico,  including through the framework of the 100,000 Strong in the Americas  Initiative.   In the 18th Congressional District of Texas, the Houston Independent  School District is educating nearly 3,500 immigrant students in their  first year in American school systems.   The state's largest district of Texas has more than 11,000 immigrant  students who have been in America for three years or less.   Rene Sanchez, the principal of Cesar E. Chavez High School located in  the 18th district and the son of Mexican immigrants made statements to  incoming high schoolers.   ``Many of you were not in Houston last year, were not in the United  States, yet we're holding you to the same standards as students . . .  living in the United States all their lives,'' said Rene Sanchez.   High school students like Sophia Martinez, an 18-year-old senior from  Mexico have been in Houston for nearly two years and speak near- fluently but stumble over the essay section.   For these students and reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 133.     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 192, the  ``Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership Act,'' which will help to  establish an interagency program to assist countries in North and West  Africa to improve immediate and long-term capabilities to counter  terrorist threats, and for other purposes.   This bill launched in 2005, is a partnership to cooperate with  countries in the Sahel and Maghreb regions of Africa on their immediate  and longterm capabilities to address and prevent the spread of violent  extremism.   Extremist movements, such as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko  Haram, the Islamic State of West Africa, and other affiliated groups,  have killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians, displaced  populations, destabilized local and national governments, and  [[Page H434]]  caused mass human suffering in the affected communities.   As Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State are being driven out of the Middle  East, Africa is becoming the new battleground for their terror attacks.   According to the Environmental System Research Institute, in the last  four years, terrorist attacks have killed 31,600 people in 4,455  attacks in Africa.   Boko Haram alone caused more than 8,000 fatalities across Nigeria,  Cameroon, Chad and Niger.   Boko Haram have taken control of the former commercial town of Baga  near the border with Chad, which caused the displacement of hundreds of  people.   Armed groups and violent Islamist terrorist organizations exploit  vulnerable and marginalized communities suffering from poverty, lack of  economic opportunity (particularly among youth populations), and weak  governance.   Youth populations are more likely to join an expanding terrorist  network in West and Central Africa, which make the region more likely  to be hit by a severe violent attack.   Al-Qaeda and ISIS recruited in Tunisia 6,500 youth volunteers.   On Oct. 4, 2017, militants affiliated with ISIS ambushed a team of  U.S. troops in Niger, killing four soldiers and wounding two.   On October 6, 2017, a terrorist attack killed more than 300 people,  injured nearly 400 and leveled an entire block in Mogadishu, Somalia.   That is why it is important that we vote today to implement the  following recommendations from the report:   To establish an interagency program to assist countries in North and  West Africa to improve immediate and long-term capabilities to counter  terrorist threats, and for other purposes.   This is in the national security interest of the United States to  combat the spread of radical Islamist extremism and build partner  countries' capacity to combat these threats in Africa.   H.R. 192 follows the recommendation from the report and ensures that  the U. S,Congress can assist its partner countries to:   Address critical security, political, economic, and humanitarian  challenges in these regions of Africa, a coordinated, interagency  approach is needed to appropriately allocate resources, share  responsibility, de-conflict programs, and maximize the effectiveness of  United States defense, diplomatic, and development capabilities.   H.R. 192 is a step in the right direction because it will help to  establish an interagency program to assist countries in the Sahel and  Maghreb regions of Africa on their immediate and long-term capabilities  to address and prevent the spread of violent extremism.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important  legislation.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 221,  the ``Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act.''   H.R. 221 amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to  allow the monitoring and combatting of Anti-Semitism globally.   H.R. 221 requires that the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti- Semitism be a presidentially-appointed and Senate confirmed position.   This position holds the rank of Ambassador and will report directly  to the Secretary of State.   H.R. 221 requires the President nominate a Special Envoy no later  than 90 days after the bill's enactment and no more than 120 days after  the position becomes vacant.   Since the passing of the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004,  Congress has found that in many foreign countries acts of anti-Semitism  have been frequent, threats to Jewish communities and their  institutions have proliferated, and in some countries these attacks  have increased in frequency, scope, violence, and lethality.   The Kantor Center, a research department at Tel Aviv University  focused on the interdisciplinary research of European Jewry from the  end of World War II to the present day, recorded 327 worldwide major  incidents of violence, vandalism, and desecration in 2017.   This number, 327, does not represent all incidents, only the major  incidents--arson, weapon and weaponless attacks, serious threats,  vandalism, and desecration.   Targets of these attacks include people, synagogues, community  centers and schools, cemeteries and memorial sites, and private  property.   There has also been an increase in harassment and abuse, both in  person and digitally.   Anti-Semitic attacks are human rights violations and they need to be  treated that way.   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  221 which establishes a Special Envoy that will serve, not only as the  primary advisor to the Government, but will also coordinate efforts  relating to monitoring and combating anti-Semitism showing the United  States' commitment to human rights worldwide.     Mr. Speaker, to the White House: Sign the bill and  open up the government.   Today, the President is in my home State, impossible for him to see  the entire border on the southern border and to realize that work has  been done for almost two decades on barriers, and that is why only 12  known or alleged terrorists have crossed that border as compared to the  unfenced northern border, which was where the 2000 terrorists coming  across the border as the century turned occurred.   Tomorrow, there will be faithful Federal employees who will not get  their money, many in Texas: 9,000 Treasury employees are stationed in  Texas, 5,700 Homeland Security; the airports in my district, with  51,000 screeners, may miss their first paychecks; and Johnson Space  Center--hardworking Americans.   This is no time for one's ego or one's preference of what type of  barrier. It is a time for those of us who care about border security,  Democrats who give billions of dollars, including $1.3 billion that we  gave in this budget and $1.6 billion.   Open the government and pay these people their checks.   I look forward to meeting with Federal employees. Call my office. We  want to give you as much help as we can.   Open the government. That is what should be done.   Mr. Speaker, because this President insists on an immoral and  ineffective border wall, he has shut down the government and said he  would be proud to do it.   This is a presidential temper tantrum.   The President clearly does not realize what he asking, and the impact  this has on Americans throughout the nation.   In my homestate, I know that the consequences are real--mortgages and  rent are not paid, car payments are not being made, spring tuition  checks are not being paid, supplemental nutrition assistance.   Texas has 35,694 employees in agencies without appropriations.   With its vast size, Texas accounts for at least a few thousand  workers in nearly every major federal agency.   Nearly 9,000 Treasury Department employees are stationed there, along  with about 5,700 Homeland Security employees and 4,300 in the  Department of Transportation.   Smaller agencies with particularly high concentrations of Texas-based  employees include NASA and the Small Business Administration.   The impact to the city of Houston is not insignificant.   Houston is the nation's fourth largest city, and the shutdown is  affecting us acutely.   To get to and from my district, I am proud to fly through George Bush  international airport, in Houston.   I am proud to say that this airport is in my district, and these  brave Americans who are on the front lines of protecting America, are  working without pay.   TSA agents are considered essential employees and must report to work  even though they aren't getting paid during the shutdown.   Screening areas at Bush and Hobby have not been impacted, but it's a  different story in Dallas and New York.   At DFW, there has reportedly been a 200% to 300% increase in TSA  agents calling out sick since the shutdown began.   Travelers waited in nearly hour-long security lines at New York's  LaGuardia Airport on Monday.  [[Page H441]]    The TSA worries lines may get even longer if more screeners call out  sick.   Tomorrow could be a tipping point when 51,000 screeners may miss  their first paychecks.   TSA agents are considered essential employees and must report to work  even though they aren't getting paid during the shutdown.   Houston is also home to one of the greatest aeronautical institutions  all the world--the Johnson Space Center.   There are more than 16,000 NASA employees still out of work as the  federal government shutdown.   The partial government shutdown impacts 800,000 of the 2.1 million  federal workers nationwide, including 16,700 NASA employees, which  accounts for 96 percent of the workforce.   Although most of NASA's employees will be furloughed, those  responsible for keeping people and property safe are exempted from the  shutdown.   For example, International Space Station operations will continue:  about 200 of the 3,055 federal employees at Johnson Space Center in  Houston will continue working primarily to keep the three astronauts  aboard the space station alive.   But that is only the beginning of the problem.   Houston citizens are unable to seek temporary private sector work  because such jobs require permission, and the people who process those  requests have been furloughed.   Federally funded housing programs are in jeopardy as the shutdown  stretches on.   For example, rural home loans financed by the USDA are not an option.   Texans who were affected by Hurricane Harvey are still waiting for  federal aid, and the shutdown won't make it any easier to get that aid.   Harris County is putting a hold on Harvey recovery projects that  relied in part on federal money.   The Treasury Department's loss of funding means some Texas wineries  and breweries can't get federal approval of labels allowing their  products to be sold across state lines.   Federal employees are required to work throughout the shutdown  without pay, like corrections officers and Border Patrol agents.   Agencies such as the national parks, NASA and some IRS employees have  been sent home or furloughed in Houston, Texas.   There are any number of cascading effects--Local restaurants are  feeling the impact as well; federal employees who frequent nearby  eateries for meals are no longer eating out.   Federal courts are grinding to a halt and national parks are  shuttered.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the  distinguished Congresswoman from California, for her leadership and her  amazing journey here to the United States House of Representatives. It  is clearly because of life stories like hers that we will be more  effective in representing all of the American people, so I thank her  for leading the Congressional Progressive Caucus this evening and  really speaking to our colleagues and, yes, the American people.   I know that the number 20 has many meanings. For 3-year-olds and 4- year-olds and 5-year-olds, you give them 20 pennies for their piggy  bank and you can see their sparkling eyes, just really happy.   You can count down 20 days till your vacation. It is reasonable. You  can get ready, get new clothes and new suitcases.   You may be able to count down if you are suffering from an illness  and the doctor says that in 20 days things will be looking up.   But in this instance, I am standing alongside of this sign, ``20  Days,'' because it represents pain and frustration. It certainly  represents a sadness that is truly unnecessary, for we will approach  the longest shutdown of the Federal Government, the longest abuse of  power that the United States of America has ever seen.   Just a few weeks ago, we saw the President of the United States  indicate that he will take ownership of a shutdown. I think it is  important to take note of the fact that this is a policy dispute, a  simple policy dispute that is not catastrophic.   In the meantime, we have dangerous conditions in the Nation's parks,  national historic sites, and we have a shut door for the Nation's  schoolchildren at our museums.   Individuals who are seeking mortgages, first-time buyers, young  couples, retirees, have been stopped in their tracks.   Those brave men and women, including firefighters under the  Department of the Interior who fought those terrible fires in  California, will not be paid tomorrow.   My colleagues and friends in Texas, as a border State resident, will  not be paid tomorrow: border Patrol, Customs and Border Protection, the  brave men and women that I visited with working in the Nation's  airports and in my airport, the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in  Houston, Texas.   Mortgages and rent not paid, car payments not being paid, spring  tuition checks not being paid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance not  being paid. So much is riding on the fact that these individuals are  working without pay because of, simply, a temper tantrum.   Now, I want information. I was down at the border just a couple of  weeks ago. I go all the time. I served on the Border Security Committee  on Homeland Security. I helped write a bipartisan Homeland Security  border security bill.   When the Border Patrol was a small agency, we poured millions of  dollars, post-9/11, to build up their personnel, give them laptops,  night goggles, jeeps. I went to the border at night, in the dark of  night. I saw their work. I know what they need. I know that they have  their views.   Many have said: I don't care what kind of barrier it is; a concrete  wall will not work, but we need a combination of things.   And so what the Commander-in-Chief will see at the border that will  warrant the shutting down of government, the make-believe national  crisis, I hope--and I wanted him to visit the patrol stations, the  Border Patrol stations where hopeless families and children are there,  some suffering, as little Felipe was, because the conditions are not  there for welcoming women and children seeking asylum through the  normal legal process, of which some would be granted and some will be  directed to go home. That is the American way.   But yet 35,694 employees are not getting a paycheck in Texas because  of this tragic condition.   So I say to the commonsense people, the Democratic majority that  voted on legislation that could have simply gone to the other body,  been placed on the calendar for the Senate, voted on, and  [[Page H452]]  sent to the desk of the President of the United States, I would say:  Mr. President, sign the bill and open the government.   Policy changes are not warranted for a shutdown. Fifty-one thousand  TSA agents missing their paychecks is not defendable, and the 800,000  total employees, 16,000 NASA employees who were furloughed, and the  impact on the fourth largest city in the Nation, rural home loans  financed by the USDA, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, Hurricane Harvey Federal aid.   I heard the pain of a Member whose Pacific Island, which he  represents as a Delegate, has just suffered a massive typhoon. We need  disaster aid for them.   The good news is that the Democratic leadership is doing our job. We  are on the floor every day passing the bill to open the government--let  me say it again--to open the government.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude on these two points:   I always believe that it is important to be truthful in one's  statement. Any of us in public service should give the best evidence of  the truth that we can.   Those of us who have served in the last 2 to 3 to 4 or 5 years have  seen the pain of our constituents and the pain of Members of Congress  who come from districts where the enormity of the opioid crisis has  taken whole families. We know that there are 100-plus people dying  every day from opioid abuse.   For those of us who come from inner-city communities, that was  yesteryear's crack and cocaine that didn't get the attention that we  are getting now. But I am not selfish. I am glad, as a nation, we  recognize the literal destroying of a human being and family.   So we have invested money in treatment. We have looked at the  criminal justice system, and we will look even more to not penalize  those who are addicted. We are trying to eliminate access to meth and  some of the most poisonous drugs, now kush, and many others.   But it is shameful to use the pain of these families and to create a  false narrative that I put up a wall and I will heal Johnny Smith way  up in New England from his opioid disease.   Drugs, we have a war that we must finish, fight and finish. We must  get people off of drugs. We must cure them. We must treat them as if  they are sick.   But I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, no wall is going to stop the  epidemic. We must engage in diplomacy and the frustration and the  poverty in South and Central America.   By the way, I have introduced a bill that says if we have a wall,  concrete wall, then, as was promised by this administration, Mexico  should pay for it.   But we must engage with the South and Central American countries, and  any drugs that want to get into this country, you can be assured they  will be coming in underground, in tunnels, well-lit tunnels, well-known  pathways and legal points of entry.   How do I know? I have been at the border when a bust has been made  and seen the car open and the most unique places where millions of  dollars of drugs were hidden.   Thank you to the canine team that is so effective.   None of this was spoken about. The narrative was not true. The White  House is not presenting to the American people what really is a  national emergency. Opioid is, but the way it must be dealt with is  increased access to healthcare and not the continued undermining of the  Affordable Care Act.   So, finally, we have heard the President call and scream that he will  declare a national emergency.   I think it is important, as it is for the Members of this great body,  this great Nation, to know that we have a Constitution where Article I  is the Congress and Article II is the Executive, and nowhere in those  two articles does it say that the Congress has to be told what to do by  the administration--nowhere. An independent body must stand for what  the American people need. So there are statutes that govern the  emergency declaration.   I will give it to you straight: There are two statutes that require  either that there be a declaration of war--I have not heard that--or  else a proper formal declaration of national emergency. They don't  dictate exactly what the conditions are. It is all about process and  transparency.   If, for example, the President would want to declare this a national  emergency, he would have to frame it, and he would have to determine  what that means. Do we want to use the Armed Forces? What kind of  national emergency is it?   And do you realize that national emergency means taking money from so  many vital programs? Just like the $5.7 billion wall that, for some  reason, the supporters or people listening to this narrative of the  wall, they must think that we have a hidden treasure somewhere that we  will just go in and dig down in the pot and get $5.7 billion.   You take $5.7 billion, and you will take it out of the United States  military. You will take it out of the Coast Guard. You will take it out  of education. You will take it out of healthcare. You will take it out  of the environment. You will take it out of international diplomacy.  You will take it out of those suffering from HIV/AIDS. You will take it  out of the starving people around the world. That is where the money  will come from.   So I hope that there will be a pathway where this body of Congress  works to send the bills to the President's desk. I hope that we don't  go 2 or 3 more days past this day tomorrow, when no checks will come to  thousands of Americans, and get this government open.   If the President thinks he can declare a national emergency and that  is the only narrative he wants to use, we will do our job. He will do  his job, but we should have, as our number one job, to open this  government now and to provide the good, hardworking Americans who serve  us in the Federal Government and those who are impacted by them to be  able to get a check, to be able to do the things that this great Nation  has allowed them to do; for we stumble, we do not realize that, in the  Declaration of Independence, it indicated that we were all created  equal, with certain unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   I take that to heart, what this country stands for, and we have got  to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.    Mr. Speaker, will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I was just on the floor, but I could not leave the floor  without reminding us that our constituents have names.   So I wanted Edith to know how concerned I am about her, and to say  that when I spoke about the 20 days and the 20 pennies, all of that is,  if you will, things that are static, but a human being who has to deal  with life's ups and downs is real.   Edith Banda--recently returned from a reservist deployment in the  Middle East--is among thousands of people in the Houston area feeling  the impact of the government shutdown.   Edith has not worked her Federal job in downtown Houston, which is  where my congressional office is, since the shutdown 17 days ago.   Making matters worse, she and dozens of others in Houston are unable  to seek private sector work, because such jobs require permission, and  the people who process these requests have been furloughed; just like  some are trying to get unemployment, and some of the documentation they  need are with people who are furloughed.   Edith has been selling her personal possessions to make ends meet,  but she said another couple of weeks of no work would be crushing.   Now, I know our Speaker has indicated that we are working very hard  here to get access to credit through credit unions and no-interest  loans. We have letters that they can send.   I want to personally say that my office is open. 713-655-0050 is my  local office. My staff, get ready, in case we can be of help to you  down in Houston to be able to see what we can do about your  circumstances.   Finally, I just want to say that Carol has been a Federal employee  for over 25 years. She is waiting to find out when she will be allowed  to return to work. She has been furloughed.   After reflecting on her two daughters enrolled in college and her  fears of no longer being able to help them with their education  expenses, she wrote about how the Trump shutdown was hurting her. And  like many employees, she has a mortgage, credit card payments, Federal  student loans, and she is trying to be a mother.   And I would just say this as I close, that she has got to deal with  late fees, interest rate hikes and damage to her credit score, and so  she is one of those individuals.   I just want to say that the metaphor, the narrative, again, of so  many people having gates to their homes, and to use that when these  people are pouring out their life savings, they are pouring their heart  out, they are in distress, I have a very diverse district, and I can  assure you I can travel around and see very few gated communities of  all economic levels. And they love their family. They have a door, but  they are moving around the community.   This is a great Nation. That is a poor example, that we have gated  communities because we love the people that are in or not, because we  don't like the people who are out.   It is because you have a dislike for the people who are out. That  must be your lack of understanding of all of our humanity, because for  those of us at Homeland Security who have been to the northern border  as well, there is not one fence there and not one person that wants a  fence. And we know what happened in 2000 when a person came across to  do harm to the United States.   We can find a better solution. Let's stop using the narrative,  because I think many Americans live in circumstances where they see  their neighbors, they interact with their neighbors, and they don't  have locked gates and walls. Some do. That is their choice. But that is  not the definition of who we are.   So I want to say to Edith and to Carol and others, Democrats are here  working as hard as we can. Congresswoman Porter is working as hard as  she can. And we will be back on the floor again tomorrow.   I am just hoping that the Senate, the other body, can take up our  bills. Once they do that, it is very clear that they can go right to  the President. If it sits for 10 days, it is law.   I feel that if it is vetoed, I really feel that the good people of  this House and Senate will override it and get these people back where  they need to be.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding so I could tell  Edith and Carol's story.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to join my colleagues in discussing the  Trump Shutdown and its devastating impact on the financial security of  federal families and contractors.   As the Trump Shutdown enters its third week, the effects of President  Trump and Republicans' reckless decision to shutter the government over  a wasteful and unnecessary border wall are obvious.   Frontline federal employees, including law enforcement and public  safety personnel, have been working without pay since December 22.   This includes around 14,000 FBI agents, 54,000 Customs and Border  Protection agents, 47,000 Transportation Security Officers and 6,000  Forest Service firefighters.   TSA employees received their last paycheck on December 28, giving  them money that would typically last through the next pay period but  which will now have to stretch much further.   The shutdown has already forced some employees to look for new jobs  or take on extra work, and the pressure is immense for employees and  families with no other source of income.   This also includes 3,200 Secret Service agents who risk their lives  every single day to protect President Trump and his family.   In addition to the federal employees working without pay, hardworking  federal employees at agencies like the Department of Justice, the  Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Agriculture, and  NASA have been furloughed without pay, plunging them and their families  into uncertainty.   These are real American families that are being put through an  unwarranted and unnecessary shutdown and are suffering because of it.   With many federal employees being furloughed, and those deemed  essential being expected to work without pay American families are now  stuck wondering how they are going to get by without an income,  especially since things like rent, groceries, and general day-to-day  living costs still need to be paid whether the government is fully  functional or not.   The Trump Shutdown will end when the President comes to his senses.  [[Page H454]]    Not only are Americans struggling to pay for their day-to-day  expenses but veterans and military families are suffering as well.   If the shutdown lasts for more than two or three weeks, the  Department of Veterans Affairs has said that it may not have enough  money to pay disability claims and pension payments.   That could affect approximately 3.6 million veterans.   For military families, although their pay has continued, the military  is suffering in other areas.   For example, changes of station for military personnel will be  delayed, medical offerings could be scaled back, and facility and  weapons maintenance could be suspended.   Additionally, military commissaries (base grocery stores) have shut  down and military families are being forced to shop elsewhere.   According to the Defense Commissary Agency, military families  generally save more than 30 percent on average at the commissaries.   Shopping off the base can be pricey, especially for military families  living in cities with a high cost of living.   Edith Banda who recently returned from a reservist deployment in the  Middle East is among thousands of people in the Houston area feeling  the impact of the government shutdown.   Edith has not worked her federal job in downtown Houston since the  shutdown 17 days ago.   Making matters worse, she and dozens of others in Houston are unable  to seek temporary private sector work because such jobs require  permission, and the people who process those requests have been  furloughed.   Edith has begun selling her personal possessions to make ends meet,  but she said another couple of weeks of no work would be crushing.   There are so many other issues that we could tackle with the money  Trump wants to spend on the wall.   With an increase of $265 million the Department of Justice could hire  2,000 new police officers and make steps towards making many  communities a safer place.   With increase of $99 million the Office of National Drug Control  Policy could support community-level efforts to address substance abuse  programs in nearly 730 additional communities.   Economic Development Administration with an increase of $200 million  could create or preserve 31,000 jobs for our hardworking Americans.   Small Business Administration grants with an additional $20 million  could support dozens more Women's Business and Veterans Outreach  Centers providing business training, counseling and outreach to 47,000  additional US veterans and women.   These are the changes that American citizens deserve.   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that the President ends this government  shutdown and end the unwarranted suffering of American families across  the nation.   Carol with the Bureau of Land Management wrote to me sharing her  frustrations and anxiety over the Trump Shutdown.   Carol has been a federal employee for over 25 years. She is waiting  to find out when she will be allowed to return to work. Carol is one of  800,000 federal government employees living with constant worry and  angst. Hearing that President Trump is willing to keep her and many  others furloughed for years has her questioning her career choice.   After reflecting on her two daughters enrolled in college and her  fears of no longer being able to help them with their education  expenses did she write about how Trump's Shutdown will hurt her.   She, like many other federal employees, has a mortgage, has credit  card payments, has federal student loans. The places where she would  look for assistance are closed, leaving her to attempt to navigate and  negotiate late fees, interest rate hikes, and damage to her credit  score that inevitable missed payments will create.   Carol is just one of the 800,000 federal government employees who  will not be receiving a paycheck tomorrow.   The President should be ashamed.   Prior to Trump's election the nation heard about his history of  refusing to pay contractors for work they had completed. The United  States Federal Government does not and will not conduct business in  this way. The United State Government pays its workers.
