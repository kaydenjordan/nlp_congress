 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I have been waiting for this day for quite a while.  Whenever I go back to my district, I talk to my staff back there. Again  and again, we hear stories that they want something done with the VA;  they want something done with the IRS. It can't get done. They are  behind.   It is time for people to get back to work. When I think of my  district, I think the vast majority of people, their work schedule  never changed even in the teeth of the epidemic.   Obviously, in Wisconsin, there are a lot of cheese factories in my  district. Man, I would go home every night and there would be people  there at 11 p.m., 12 a.m., 2 a.m. All of a sudden, we hear how horrible  it is for Federal employees to have to go in.   In the current situation, what it tells you is--and this is true of  many other programs, as well--the government works for the benefit of  the government not the benefit of the people.                                time  1445    That is why people on that side of the aisle are trying so hard, so  desperately hard today, not to have people come in.   I talk to a lot of employers all over my district. There were times  that any given number of their employees worked from home, but they  know it is not the same thing. Why in the world the government should  be operating on a separate schedule, I don't know.   I will give you an example. The National Personnel Records Center is  an egregious example. The NPRC is a large warehouse containing paper  records of military members from before World War I to the 1990s.  Veterans need access to these records in order to receive VA  healthcare, disability pay, and home loans.   Despite these records existing in paper form only, the NPRC still  decided to have its employees work remotely, a perfect example of the  employees' interests put ahead of the  [[Page H605]]  public's interest. This time, the public is veterans.   You can't copy paper records from a warehouse if no one is there to  pull the records to make copies to satisfy the request.   These employees were paid, but since they were not at the NPRC, they  were unable to fulfill their duties, and veterans were forced to wait  to receive their benefits.   The SHOW UP Act will require these Federal agencies to return to pre- COVID levels of telework.    By the way, I don't bring this up back home. We are  talking about it today, but I think it is such an insult to all the  people back home, many of which are whole factories that never took any  time off, to be told that they have to wait for the Federal Government  because their people are, I mean, my goodness, still at home almost 3  years after this thing.   Do you know any private businesses that are still having their people  stay at home?    Mr. Speaker, as I go about my district, I like to meet  with the average Wisconsinite to see what is on their mind. It is so  much more illuminating than hanging around Washington and meeting with  lobbyists.   Whether I stop in convenience stores or food stores, which I do  between my meetings, inevitably the talk turns to abuse of the EBT  card. I hear stories again and again of people selling EBT cards for 50  cents on the dollar, which apparently means that some people don't need  them. Another complaint is some clerks are able to look at the card, or  it turns up on the receipt how much money they have left on the card,  and there may be thousands of dollars there, which is also a problem.   I thought: What can we do to prevent some of this abuse? We have  introduced a bill called ID for EBT Card, in which a person's  photograph would have to appear on the card.   When I speak to the clerks in my convenience stores, they unanimously  believe that this would be a good idea and be a step toward fighting  the fraud and abuse in this program.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that this week things  have--the quality of intellectual thought in this country has declined  to the degree that we have to bring a resolution to the floor  condemning socialism, but that is the way it is.   Recently, polls have shown among young people, about half have a  positive view of socialism. Now, of course these are young people whose  opinions are largely gathered not by personal experience but by what  their schoolteachers tell them or what they see on television, so that  may be part of the problem, and hopefully, they will grow their way out  of it.   Nevertheless, I do feel it necessary to make some statements as to  why socialism is an inferior way to govern and is completely  incompatible with people who want to live in a free society.   The first thing you need to know about socialism, of course, it leads  to material goods which are not as good as those under a free market  system. A lot of that means because the government controls everything,  you don't have an opportunity to have competition. The poor restaurant,  the poor manufacturer is never forced out of business, never forced to  improve, and as a result it means a poorer society. A lot of times the  material goods by themselves is one of the reasons throughout history  you see people leave the Marxist, socialist sort of society and flee  towards the free market system.   Cubans leaving to come to the United States. When I visit the  southern border, the Border Patrol always talks about the Cubans. There  are a lot of Cuban doctors coming here--wealthy by Cuban standards--but  still they can become much more wealthy in the U.S.   In the old days of the Cold War, people left from East Germany to  West Germany, from North Vietnam to South Vietnam to get to a country  in which there are more goods and more quality. But I always feel it is  a little bit wrong to overly focus on the fact that the free market  inevitably means much better material wealth.   It also deals with the freedom to do anything else. When you have a  socialist society, the government in a pure  [[Page H620]]  socialist society employs everybody. And even in a partially socialist  society, a much higher percentage of people wind up working for the  government and have to work for the government.   Like all Republicans, in my political career, again and again, I have  had people come up to me and tell me things privately that they can't  say publicly because they work for the government.   Schoolteachers who come up to me and give a Republican perspective on  things or things they may disagree with that the school board is doing.  But because they work for the government, they can only talk to me  quietly like they were in the Soviet Union or Communist China.   When I was in Wisconsin and we changed the laws to give more  flexibility on how we deal with public employees about 12 years ago--it  was under Governor Walker--all Republicans knew public employees who  quietly sided with Governor Walker, but because they worked for the  government, the little socialist part of America, they couldn't openly  side with Governor Walker. They had to quietly whisper like we were in  a Communist country.   That is what happens when you have too many people working for the  government.   The Department of Natural Resources is another example of that.  Again, people are coming and saying they are doing things wrong, but  they dare not say so publicly because they work for the government.   Of course, in addition to employees who work for the DNR or work for  the university, it is not just political beliefs that they may have to  hide in the intolerance area of a very liberal political entity--I am  thinking about Dane County, which is where Madison, Wisconsin is-- people, again, where the government is so big, they are forced not only  to hide their political beliefs, they may have to hide their religious  beliefs because they are afraid that when it comes to promotions, when  it comes to hiring, when it comes to firing, it could affect them  negatively because such a high percentage of jobs come with the  government.   It is not just that. In a pure socialist society, because there is a  shortage of goods, the ability to purchase goods can also be dependent  on toeing the party line. We know that in Russia, or previously Cuba,  the ability to purchase things is dependent on toeing the party line.  You can work all you want but unless you are a member of the party or  toe the party line, you can't get the quality of goods that are there.  That is inevitably something that happens when the government becomes  so powerful.   Other perks are restricted if you don't toe the party line, things  like travel in a socialist state. Over time, you begin to have  restrictions and maybe the opportunities to travel abroad are only  given to people who have displayed fealty to the state.   One of the things I am told to look out for in Cuba is--Cuba, of  course, being an island nation--you would expect to have lots of boats  all around the island for people to go and fish, people just to take  advantage of the Caribbean. But in fact, there are very few boats  because Cuba is a socialist country and they are afraid people would  use those boats to leave the country. That is another trait that you  have in advanced socialism.   Other things they may stamp down on you for, they restrict your free  speech because they don't want anybody saying anything that might be  something the government disagrees with.   If you look at Communist China, even though to a degree they have a  free market, the huge government, because they are afraid of any  dissent, anybody telling the truth, cracks down on churches. It seems  hard to believe that you cannot openly talk about Christianity, openly  talk about Christ in China, but I am afraid you can't.   You hear about Falun Gong in China saying things that maybe aren't  approved by the government and therefore people crack down on that  organization as well.   In any event, when young people say they are for socialism or if you  have any children or grandchildren out there who say there is  socialism, point out to them the inevitable lack of freedom that comes  with it, that a high number of people have to work for the government.  And if you have to work for the government, they can promote you or  hire you or fire you based upon political beliefs, based upon religious  beliefs.   In a free market system, there are really an almost unlimited number  of people you can work with. There are so many different businesses in  the free market system. If you don't like to work for someone else, you  can always start your own business. That is something that you can't do  under socialism, or they want to make it very difficult.   So I am glad that the United States Congress, at least later this  week or early next week, is going to go on record saying that we don't  like socialism. It should be completely unnecessary. And the fact that  so many young people think socialism might be okay is really a damning  indictment of the educational, both K-12 and university, system in this  country.
