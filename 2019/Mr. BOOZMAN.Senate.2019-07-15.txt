 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize  Vermalene Smith for her outstanding commitment to supporting our  military, our veterans, their families, and her community.   Born in Leachville, AR, Vermalene attended various schools in  northeast Arkansas before furthering her education at Memphis State  University where she earned her bachelor's degree in accounting and  minored in business management. She utilized her acquired skills in a  successful accounting career, as well as a decorated career in real  estate. The combination of knowledge and community involvement she  possessed prepared her for the role she took with former U.S. Senator  Tim Hutchinson as senior coordinator for the State of Arkansas. She  also went on to serve Lieutenant Governor Win Rockefeller as his  financial director and volunteered for the Craighead County Veterans  Service Office before becoming the county's full-time veterans service  officer in 2009.   In this role, Vermalene plans, organizes, and directs the activities  of the County Veterans Service office. From preparing claims for  veterans to personally counseling them and their dependents, she has  maintained her devotion to fighting for those who fought for us at home  and abroad. She has been instrumental in conducting the annual military  ball, an event that attracts hundreds of participants including  veterans, servicemembers, civic leaders, and local JROTC cadets and  their guests and has also played an important role in the Welcome Home  Vietnam Veterans event. Vermalene serves as an inspiration and example  to us all and has had a positive impact on countless lives through her  diligent efforts and advocacy.   In addition to all of her work for veterans, Vermalene has  exemplified what it means to be a good steward of her community. Some  of her many roles have included Cub Scout leader, Sunday school  teacher, and president of the parent teachers association. She also  founded the Northeast Arkansas Republican Women and Northeast Arkansas  Veterans Action Clergy organizations. Her involvement continues to  impress as she served as chairman of the Craighead County Republican  Party and 1st congressional District secretary. Her dedication has  enhanced her community immensely and earned her many prestigious honors  along the way.   Her numerous awards include Business of Professional Women's Club  Woman of the Year, Million Dollar Producer, and the Frank Lady  Leadership Award. It comes as no surprise that she also received the  Customer Service Award from American Legion Post 53 located in West  Memphis, AR, and American Legion District 5, which includes the  majority of northeast Arkansas.   Vermalene has spent her career working to advance the needs of  veterans and improve Arkansas. Our State is a better place because of  her. I wish Vermalene well as she begins her well-deserved  retirement.                            ____________________
