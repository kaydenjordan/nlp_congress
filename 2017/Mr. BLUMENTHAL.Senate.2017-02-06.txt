 Mr. President, I am honored to follow my great  colleague and a champion of education and consumer rights, Senator  Durbin of Illinois, and to address this body and, most particularly,  the Presiding Officer, who has contributed so much himself to the cause  of education. We know, better than anyone, how important the Federal  commitment to quality education is--not just a C or D education but  excellence in education.   The American people deserve a Secretary of Education who embodies and  exemplifies that commitment to excellence. Unfortunately, the nominee  before us, Betsy DeVos, fails on every  [[Page S798]]  count to meet that standard. So I am here today to voice my continuing  concern about this nomination, which is antithetical to the very  mission of the Department she has been selected to lead.   She is unquestionably unqualified, unknowledgeable, unprepared for  this job. She is unfit to run the Department of Education. As hard and  as unkind as that verdict sounds, we have an obligation to speak truth  here and speak that truth to power, even when it is the President of  the United States, even when it is a job as critically important as  Secretary of Education--especially when it is as important as this job.   She is wealthy. She is a billionaire. She has committed her career to  pushing for private school vouchers and unregulated charter schools.  Having reviewed her full record, including her confirmation hearing and  her responses and lack of responses to followup questions that my  colleagues sent to her, I respectfully say to my colleagues: We should  not approve this person.   She has committed her career to pushing for private school vouchers  and unregulated charter schools, not to the public education our  students deserve. The incoming Secretary of Education will face a  myriad of challenging and constantly evolving problems that will demand  a high level of leadership and guidance, from soaring student debt to  faltering school and student achievement scores across the country, to  the pervasive school violence and bullying that threatens so many of  our students, to unscrupulous for-profit schools, profiteering off  students and veterans.   Clearly, the problems, these problems and others, require a Secretary  who will not just rubberstamp or approve the policies of special  interests or delegate systematic problems to private schools.   The Secretary of Education is responsible for overseeing a budget of  Federal spending over $36 billion--that is K-12 education funding--and  $150 billion in higher education funding each year. In addition, there  is a portfolio of more than $1.2 trillion in outstanding Federal loans.  That is the largest consumer debt in this country other than mortgage  loans.   The leader of this Department is responsible for determining policies  that affect our neighborhood public schools. She is responsible, if she  is confirmed, for enforcing key protections under a number of civil  rights laws designed to ensure every child access to education. This  job requires a singular level of intellect and energy, preparation,  devotion to the welfare of students, parents, and, yes, educators and  teachers. Our educators and teachers are the real heroes of our  educational system. Our public schoolteachers are second to none in the  world for their commitment to opening businesses, creating dreams, and  enabling students to achieve those dreams, and those dreams will be in  peril if Betsy DeVos is our Secretary of Education because she has  demonstrated her disrespect for the enterprise of public education.   From implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act, improving education  quality, protecting Pell Grant Programs, and reducing pervasive student  debt in higher education, to policing the epidemic of campus sexual  assault and protecting students' civil rights at schools across the  country, clearly our Nation's chief education executive needs to be  immensely qualified--not just questionably qualified--but  unchallengeably prepared and well versed in these complicated issues.   The fact is, Mrs. DeVos has no relevant experience as a teacher or as  a leader of a public school. She has said that neither she nor her  children have ever received a student loan or a Pell grant. She has no  direct experience with our public education system that would enable  her to lead it.   In addition to her lack of knowledge of higher education public  schools, she has demonstrated a profound animosity, an antipathy to  them. She has spent her career systematically privatizing and  dismantling public schools instead of working to build them and improve  them.   For decades, Mrs. DeVos spent millions of her fortune advocating for  the diversion of public money to unacceptable private schools and  unaccountable private schools, especially in her home State of  Michigan. Mrs. DeVos helped to design an ineffective charter school  system with little accountability for results in Detroit. However, the  systems that she helped to design and promote actually siphoned money  from Michigan's already underfunded public school system and caused  achievement rates there to drastically plummet.   Despite her rhetoric, school privatization schemes are plagued with  severe problems. They often strip students with disabilities and their  families of their rights under the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act. This point underscores a fundamental theme for Mrs.  DeVos's record, indicating how she would pose a threat--in fact, an  unprecedented danger to students' civil rights across the board.   When asked during her confirmation hearing about the IDEA, Mrs. DeVos  admitted that she was ``confused'' and thought that States were best  positioned to enforce the Federal law. That answer exposed not only her  lack of knowledge but her lack of caring. Someone who cares about  students with disabilities would have known that this landmark  education law depends on Federal enforcement for its effect, and she,  as Education Secretary, would be the one to do that enforcement.   Before the passage of the 1975 law that later became the IDEA, when  decisions about students with disabilities were left to the States,  only one in five students with disabilities received an education. Does  she believe that we ought to go back to a time when States were able to  openly discriminate against students with disabilities, that States  should be again delegated that responsibility, which they failed to  enforce effectively?   Whatever her answer, clearly her blatant disregard for the IDEA  threatens students with disabilities and already underfunded disability  programs.   Mrs. DeVos also threatens students' rights and campus safety under  title IX, including rights that are designed to protect students  against campus sexual assault and other violence. This issue has  concerned me. I have held roundtables around the State of Connecticut  and have submitted a measured bill that would help address this problem  at the college level. But Mrs. DeVos has advocated for legislation that  would actually increase the difficulty for victims of sexual assault to  receive support.   During her hearing, Mrs. DeVos told Senator Casey, my colleague, that  she could not commit to continuing the Obama administration's title IX  guidance that requires schools to have procedures in place to  investigate and address instances of campus sexual assault or risk  losing Federal funding. That title IX commitment is at the core of the  Federal responsibility to protect students against sexual assault. We  can agree or disagree on the detail, but this blatant disregard for  title IX responsibilities goes to the essence of her commitment to  education in this Nation and to protecting students against the scourge  of sexual assault, which we know is all too pervasive still on many of  our campuses.   Even worse, according to tax records, Mrs. DeVos has spent millions  of dollars funding ultraconservative organizations that promote anti- choice, anti-Muslim, and anti-LGBT policies like conversion therapy. I  never would have thought that I would be on the floor of the Senate  considering a candidate who supported anti-LGBT policies or anti-choice  or anti-Muslim policies. They don't belong in our schools. They  certainly should not be supported by our Nation's Secretary of  Education.   On the issue of for-profit education, again, it is a source of great  concern because it has given rise to so many abusive tactics directed  often against our veterans. During her Senate hearing, Mrs. DeVos did  little to allay my concerns about her record as a school choice  advocate and political donor, averse to protection against the abuses  of for-profit.   We know there are for-profit schools and colleges that do great work.  They contribute vitally, but unfortunately, for-profits also have been  plagued by abuses that need to be fought and overcome.   Mrs. DeVos successfully lobbied to expand even failing schools in  Michigan and to protect those for-profits from scrutiny and oversight.  This record of enabling for-profits and her own self-dealing in a for- profit preschool herself does not bode well--that  [[Page S799]]  is an understatement--for the hundreds of thousands of students who  have been neglected, deceived, and scammed in recent years by predatory  for-profit college institutions like Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech.  They left in their wake, when they collapsed and failed those students,  a myriad of tragic stories, tragedies not just for the loss of money  but for the loss of future opportunities, and that is far from the kind  of record that we want replicated under our next Secretary of  Education.   In fact, during her hearing, Senator Murray asked Mrs. DeVos about 17  specific bad actor for-profit higher education institutions, including  Corinthian and ITT. They have been accused of using exotic dancers to  recruit students, falsifying job placement rates, or stealing Federal  financial aid. Mrs. DeVos would not confirm whether she believes that  those practices and misuse of taxpayer funds at any of those 17 schools  are, in fact, unacceptable. She simply would not respond definitively  to that question.   The Secretary of Education is responsible for policies that could  either lift or exacerbate the crushing burden of student debt at those  for-profit schools. She is the one who could alleviate that burden, yet  she refused to commit to protecting any current student loan repayment  options or benefits or even helping severely disabled borrowers receive  loan discharges that they qualify for.   She refused to commit to protecting the Pell grant, the Public  Service Loan Forgiveness Program, or maintaining the existing  transparency information on the college scorecard or Federal student  aid data center.   Mrs. DeVos refused to commit to keep private banks out of the student  loan system or ensure that taxpayers do not subsidize career education  programs that consistently leave students with unaffordable mounds of  debt, without meaningful prospects in the job market.   Her record and her responses to Senate questioning reveal that  putting her in charge of the Department of Education would be akin to  putting the fox in charge of the henhouse. I realize that analogy is  overused, particularly in this town, where there are so many instances  of it. But her lack of appropriate, definitive responses are as telling  and compelling as her answers about her commitment to protecting,  rather than endangering, the individuals and institutions that will be  her mission if this body confirms her.   As a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have a  special interest in protecting our Nation's servicemembers and veterans  from insidious and pernicious predatory for-profit colleges. It is a  paramount concern. It ought to be a paramount concern for our Nation  because all too often, veterans are victims of these predatory for- profit colleges who lure them even while they are still in the  military. They lure them with promises and images that create  expectations never to be fulfilled, and so many veterans emerge from  these colleges with mounds of debt but no degree.   Yet Mrs. DeVos refused to say whether she understands that Veterans  Affairs and Department of Defense student loan and assistance programs  are even federally funded or whether she would commit to closing the  90-10 loophole that has enabled colleges to aggressively market and  mislead many vets.   We have all spoken on the floor about the need to close that  loophole. It is the plain vanilla solution that should be a matter of  consensus, yet Mrs. DeVos refused to commit on that issue.   She has earned a failing grade for lack of study, complete lack of  diligence in preparing for her testimony and to lead in higher  education programs. Her commitment to protect students and veterans  from massive debt, low-quality education standards and accountability,  or pernicious for-profit companies and leaders deserves a failing grade  as well.   I will not support a nominee who fails to agree that predatory  practices, exploitation of taxpayers, and deception of students have no  place in our education system.   While Mrs. DeVos evaded questions about bringing accountability to  schools, she also refused to commit to keeping guns out of schools.  When asked by my colleague Chris Murphy whether guns have any place in  or around schools, Mrs. DeVos gave the following reply: ``I would  imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from  potential grizzlies.''   That statement has given a lot of amusement to a lot of people around  the country, but it deals with such an intensely serious subject, that  it is really no laughing matter. All of us who went through the tragedy  and grief experienced by those families and loved ones who lost  children in Sandy Hook, CT, and saw the strength and courage of the  Newtown community cannot regard with anything but contempt that answer.   When she was further pressured whether she would support a plan from  President Trump to ban gun-free school zones, Mrs. DeVos revealed that  she would support ``whatever the President does.''   In some ways, that answer is as repugnant as the remark about  grizzlies, saying she would follow whatever the President does, without  leading and providing vision and intellectual tools that are necessary  for the President to act, is an abdication of responsibility.   These answers are woefully unacceptable.   We recently observed the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook  Elementary School shooting. We still remember the 20 beautiful children  and 6 exceptional educators who were brutally murdered in Newtown.   The day of the Sandy Hook shooting was the most heartbreaking day of  all my years in public service. According to Everytown for Gun Safety,  there have been at least 210 school shootings since Sandy Hook. Words  cannot capture the sense of grief and outrage we must feel in the face  of continued gun violence around the country--in our schools, malls,  clubs, churches, public venues, and private homes. This scourge of gun  violence must be combated, and yet Mrs. DeVos has indicated she is  impervious to the emotional force of the tragedies arising from gun  violence.   I want to share a passage from a column written by my friend Erica  Lafferty, the daughter of Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung. Dawn was the heroic  principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School murdered at the massacre that  day as she desperately attempted to save her students and staff.         My mom spent her life preparing to take care of students.       She earned a degree in education. She spent years in a       classroom, teaching special education for kindergartners and       middle-schoolers. By the time she became a principal of Sandy       Hook, she knew exactly what elementary schools should be--a       happy place for kids where they could learn and grow in a       safe environment.        To claim that she should have done more to take care of her       kids is an insult to all that she did, and to the lengths to       which so many teachers go to ensure a good and safe learning       environment.        That Mrs. DeVos thinks ``bears'' when asked about guns in       schools proves just how little she has considered the       important role of the Education Secretary in keeping students       and faculty safe.        It is insulting to tell teachers that they should add       ``sharpshooter'' to their job descriptions. It is absurd to       teach students to duck and cover in active shooter drills       rather than demanding our legislators do the responsible       thing and make it more difficult for dangerous people to get       their hands on firearms.    That is what Betsy DeVos should have said in her hearing when she was  asked about gun violence in our schools. That is the sense of outrage  that should have come from her spontaneously, and it should be the  leadership that she should provide.   There is nothing more important than keeping our children safe from  anyone who would do them harm, particularly in a school, which should  be the safest place in the world, and that means that our Secretary of  Education must provide leadership, courage, and strength to stand up to  an administration that fails in its responsibility on the issue of gun  violence.   The families of Sandy Hook asked us to honor their children and  family members with action, to make America safer and to make our  schools safer. I cannot support a nominee who fails to prioritize the  basic safety of students in our schools or take the scourge of gun  violence seriously. I cannot support Betsy DeVos because she fails to  demonstrate basic caring--put aside her lack of knowledge--but a basic  caring about the fate of students who may be in danger of gun violence  and equally in danger of failing to achieve the American dream.  [[Page S800]]    Her responsibility is beyond being a bureaucrat or a placeholder in a  Federal organization chart. She has a public trust, even as a nominee,  to show America the importance of public education. Her career is about  demeaning and detracting from public schools. Her testimony at the  Senate hearing betrayed a lack of preparing that would disqualify  students in schools from a passing grade.   I have received numerous correspondence, letters, and emails about  this nomination. In fact, 14,000 letters from teachers, concerned  parents, and citizens expressing outrage at the threat that Mrs. DeVos  poses to public education, disability rights, and student success. For  a small State like Connecticut, 14,000 emails and letters is  unprecedented. It is an outpouring, an uproar that is certainly  unprecedented in my time in the U.S. Senate and in the memory of staff  who work here. These letters come from teachers, students, parents,  really everyone affected by public education.   I want to close by saluting them and most especially the teachers and  parents who are so committed to their students.   Erin, a third grade teacher from Connecticut captured this fear in  her letter to my office:         I write this to you as a teacher in despair. After a decade       and a half of public service as a teacher, I fear that our       basic precepts of our obligation to educate ALL children has       come into question.        I am fearful of what lies ahead for my students if someone       like Mrs. DeVos is in charge of our Department of Education.       Her lack of experience in public education, her desire to       separate and sort our children by their income, academic       ability and socioeconomic status, her blatant disregard for       students with special needs and our obligations to these       students under IDEA--strike panic in the education community.        One of the best things about being a public school teacher       is the challenge and privilege to work with all kinds of       students with all kinds of abilities and needs. I have the       honor to work in a school that is rooted in the inclusion of       all students.        More than 15% of the students in my school have special       needs. We are so proud to provide this group with the       services that are specialized just for them to meet their       academic, social and emotional needs.        You see, our work here is not merely about proficiency, it       is indeed about growth. We are tasked to help our children       grow to their own individual potential--not just meet a       mandated standard.        When I think of some of the beautiful and important       achievements that my students make, they are often not about       a score on a proficiency test. I think of the autistic       student in my class that is working to be able to communicate       his wants and need to others.        When he can play a board game with a peer, that is growth.        My classroom reflects the tapestry of our American society.       I have students of all abilities and needs and we have built       a caring classroom community that allows for us all to grow       each day.        I have been highly trained to work with ALL students. I       assure that my student's Individualized Education Program       goals under the law are being provided for. I seek out and       provide resources. I advocate. I accommodate educational       programs to meet each child's unique learning needs. I       encourage.        I celebrate the milestones and yes, the growth.        The public education system as we know it ensures a free       and equitable education for all students--regardless of their       academic needs, their socioeconomic status, their race,       religion or parental involvement.        Please continue your efforts to convince your fellow       Senators that Mrs. DeVos will be a reprehensible choice for       our Department of Education.    Jen, another teacher in Connecticut shared a similar message with me  in her letter to my office:         I am a teacher in esteemed Fairfield County, Connecticut--      but don't let the package fool you. My section of Fairfield       County, my very public middle School in Danbury, Connecticut       has hosted over 37 nationalities at one time under one roof.        You see, our public schools are a mirror. Our schools       reflect the world as it exists outside our doors. We open       them and the world pours in. This is how it works. We offer       influence. We set expectations. We administer tests and       benchmarks and are tied to terms like ``proficiency'' and       ``growth''. Within this academic framework, cultures clash.       It's inevitable. Differences abound. And yet, in this sphere       of gaps and spaces, we bridge to one another.        We reach because we have to; there is no option. We see       differences and we've learned the inherent power in them. We       develop minds of course--but we also develop tolerant       citizens who can thrive in a multi-cultural and diverse       society.        Vouchers and school choice, as Mrs. DeVos champions,       present as an antithesis to these core democratic       philosophies.        What is showcased as an opportunity for growth is a thin       veil for layered discriminatory practices.        Vouchers decrease the potential of many to the potential of       few. Vouchers are a cousin to segregation, if not a sibling--      and the consideration of DeVos as secretary undermines, with       longevity, the very fabric of a United Nation.        I was asked to share personal stories and I can--I've seen       it all in fifteen years: kids who experience unprecedented       success and kids who break your heart in two with the       devastation forced upon them. We can't ever know who will       triumph, it is impossible to know--we can only keep the       playing field as fair and accessible as possible to all.    Deborah, a fourth grade teacher from Connecticut, was frustrated with  the conflicts of interest surrounding Mrs. DeVos in her letter to my  office:         Mrs. DeVos has a very clear conflict of interest on many       levels. Financially, she wants to maintain the $5-25 million       dollar investment she has in Neurocore, a biotech company       which deals with attention deficit disorder. Her investment       in Windquest Group, which backs Neurocare, is a company       focused on ``a science and brain-based program that targets       children is clearly a conflict. She has presented a clear       history of donating to and investing in companies or       organizations which affect students.        As a teacher in a Title I public school, it is essential       that the Secretary of Education is equipped to deal with the       issues we deal with every day. In my class I routinely deal       with issues of poverty, homelessness, underfed students who       count on free or reduced meals and extra food sent home       weekly for the weekend. Their parents normally work two or       three jobs to try to pay the bills. If a student is hungry,       they are concerned with where their next meal is coming from,       not which genre I'm teaching. This is not a business, it's       personal for every student we teach. If students are held to       standards which are not realistic, supported, funded, or       understood by the federal government then the ability to       achieve & thrive as a society will cease to exist.    Finally, Nancy, a 26 year veteran of teaching and Danbury, CT, 2016  Teacher of the Year, shared anecdotes of her experiences teaching  special education students. Here is a passage from her letter:         Please do not approve a person who has no experience with       public education and has no clear understanding about student       need or how students learn. This is an extremely important       job. We should not take it lightly and just let anyone take       that title. Mrs. DeVos' plan for our children will       disenfranchise the poor, the disabled and quite honestly,       every child in America. Her inaccurate, incomplete and poor       answers to questions posed to her by Congress as well as her       track record in Michigan where she worked to destroy public       education, serve as evidence that she is not qualified for       the job. She bought her way to this appointment with huge       donations to those who would vote for her. She does not       understand that education is not a for-profit business; it is       an investment in our most important resource and the future       of this country--our children. Betsy DeVos is not the right       person to lead education in the United States of America.    I will finish by saying that I firmly believe we owe our students  high standards, just as we demand of them high performance, but that  requires of us a commitment that Betsy DeVos has failed to make. It is  a commitment to invest more resources in public education, to give back  and give more to our public schools.   After observing her testimony, I am convinced she lacks that  leadership ability or requisite record to serve as the steward of  public education and to hold that trust that our country desperately  and urgently needs now, not at some point in the future. That  commitment is necessary now because every day, every month, every year  is a lifetime in a student's education. So I will vote against her  confirmation today, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to do the same.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I am honored to follow my  distinguished colleague from Vermont who has led the Judiciary  Committee with such vision and courage over so many years, and whom I  respect as a former prosecutor, as I am, as well as a litigator and a  conscience of the Senate.   I am deeply concerned that our Nation is careening toward a  constitutional crisis, a legal nightmare that will test the  independence of the judiciary and require the utmost resolve and  integrity from everyone involved in the justice system and from the  Congress, because only the Congress may provide the kind of check on  the ongoing assault against our court system.   President Trump repeatedly has tried to put himself above the law,  and in just a few weeks has moved from scorning conflict-of-interest  and disclosure principles to promulgating destructive, discriminatory  Executive orders, and openly attacking the judiciary. His personal  invectives and insults are unprecedented for the President of the  United States against the judiciary. Without respect for the rule of  law and the court system, democracy fails. No Cabinet member has more  responsibility to ensure that the justice system is given this  necessary respect and trust than the Attorney General of the United  States. The sweeping authority in this position impacts the lives and  livelihoods of everyday Americans, implicating everything from our  immigration system to law enforcement, to civil rights, national  security, capital punishment, sentencing, and the U.S. Supreme Court.   This job is one I know well. Like some of my colleagues, I served as  U.S. attorney in the Department of Justice as the chief Federal  prosecutor for Connecticut, for several years, reporting to the U.S.  Attorney General, and, then, for several years afterward, as a private  litigator, and, then, for 20 years as attorney general of the State of  Connecticut. I fought alongside, and sometimes against, the U.S.  Attorney General and the armies of lawyers at his disposal. In fact,  the Attorney General commands thousands of lawyers who embody his power  to speak on behalf of the United States. His job is to protect the  public from criminal offenders and to convict the guilty, but also to  protect the innocent who may be wrongly accused and to assure that  justice is done.   In fact, as Justice Jackson said about the role of the U.S. Attorney  General, which he filled, he is to seek justice, not just win cases. I  know how powerful this position can be and how crucial the Attorney  General is not as the appointee of a politician but as a servant of  justice.   In discharging this sacred obligation, the Attorney General must  always remain independent, not just in reality but in appearance. His  decisions must supersede partisan politics. In most cases, there is, in  fact, no recourse from his decision without political interference,  which would be improper. He is not just another government lawyer. He  is not just another Cabinet position. He is the Nation's lawyer. He is  the people's lawyer. He must be the Nation's legal conscience.   This job requires a singular level of intellect and integrity, and a  nonpartisan, but passionate devotion to the rule of law.   Over the past week, as our Nation's courts did their job and sorted  through the implications of the President's hasty, ill-conceived, and  illegal Executive orders, President Trump called into question the very  integrity of our judicial system. Not only did he label U.S. District  Court Judge Robart a ``so-called judge,'' but he also suggested that  the American people should blame him and our ``court system'' if  something should happen as a result of the court's blocking his  Executive order.   In this anticipatory blame, the bluster and bullying are  inappropriate and un-Presidential, and I believe they threaten harm to  our democracy as well as the judicial system.   The comments were deeply disturbing to all of us who believe in the  integrity of the judicial system--including the American Bar  Association, which said through Linda Klein, its president, that  ``personal attacks on judges are attacks on our Constitution,'' and  ``the independence of the judiciary is not up for negotiation . . .  independence from party politics, independence from Congress, and  independence from the president of the United States himself.''   Ms. Klein called upon all lawyers to defend the rule of law in light  of these attacks on the Constitution. I echo this call proudly today,  the importance of which cannot be overstated. Nowhere is that job more  significant than the Department of Justice and the Attorney General of  the United States as head of that Department. The agency is tasked with  seeking and achieving justice, not with carrying out the President's  agenda as a priority.   That does not mean lawyers at the Department of Justice who are  currently defending the orders in court are acting improperly or  wrongly. What it means is, the country needs an independent justice  system staffed by people who are ready to stand up and speak out to a  President whose orders may contravene constitutional law.   We saw this principle in action last week. We saw what it really  means to serve at the Department of Justice and represent not the  President but the American people, the Constitution, and the rule of  law. Former Acting Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General Sally  Yates took a stand based on moral and legal principle, and I thank Ms.  Yates for her courage and strength in that action. Holding herself to  the highest traditions of the Department of Justice, Ms. Yates said  that in her judgment these orders cannot be defended, that the rule of  law and morality is more important than the politics of the moment and  the impulsive edicts of a ruler who apparently fails to uphold the law.  Her actions raised the question of whether the next Attorney General  will have the same courage and strength.   Ms. Yates demonstrated genuine grit and grace in standing strong for  the rule of law. Her actions are in the long, proud tradition of the  Department. Not since Watergate has an Attorney General or Acting  Attorney General been fired for acting in accordance with their  conscience and the rule of law. Unfortunately, President Trump  threatens to return us to that era. He has made his intentions clear:  The Department of Justice will not be an independent authority acting  on behalf of the American people. Instead, it will be just another  enabler of the President's ongoing efforts to substitute his whims and  wishes for legal and ethical responsibilities.   I believe the President's orders are misguided and illegal. The  courts will rule in days. His orders are wrong, in no small part,  because they threaten to take away one of the primary reasons why ours  is the greatest country in the history of the world--the country that  my father, a refugee from Nazi Germany, sought in 1935. He arrived here  at 17 years old with not much more than the shirt on his back, speaking  [[Page S840]]  little English, knowing just about no one. This country gave him the  chance to succeed.   I think about how sad and ashamed he would be if he saw the actions  taken by this President: orders to ban people from coming into this  country because of their religion; prioritizing one religion against  another and raising fears that do damage to our core constitutional  principles.   Barring refugees like children who are harmed in other lands seeking  to come to this country deprives us of the great talents, gifts, and  energy that have helped to shape and build this country because we are  truly stronger as a result of our diversity. We are a nation of  immigrants. Our strength comes from the talents, energy, and vibrancy  of these individuals who come to this country as children with their  parents.   This order makes us less safe because it provides a recruiting tool  to extremists like ISIS. We are at war with ISIS, and we must win that  war. It frays trust between law enforcement and Muslim communities, but  it also weakens us in a deeper moral sense. It is wrong. It is morally  wrong. It is wrong for this great country, devoted and founded on the  ideals welcoming people seeking that beacon of hope, opportunity, and  protection.   The rule of law protects us from these moral harms, but the rule of  law depends on people. Fortunately, even as we have seen the harms of  these past few days play out in real time, we have also seen people who  are willing to stand strong against them. People have gone to the  streets in marches and rallies in the New Haven Green and in front of  our State capitol in Connecticut, and all across our State, saying it  is not only wrong, but they will rally against this wrong.   All of these points are simply to say that the position of Attorney  General is so important because he must stand strong as well for the  rule of law. He must be able to speak truth to power. He must have the  courage and strength to say to the President of the United States: This  order is unconstitutional, not just unwise and unwarranted but illegal.    I have, unfortunately, reached the conclusion that Senator Sessions  cannot be counted on to play that role, to defend the rule of law, to  be a champion of civil rights and civil liberties, not to just follow  the law but to lead in this challenge that faces our country as never  before because our rights and liberties are now threatened as never  before. He must be a vigorous advocate, not a passive follower of the  law.   Senator Sessions showed this point to me through his testimony at his  hearing and his subsequent responses. While he must be ready to say no  to the President, what we saw demonstrated so vividly is that Senator  Sessions' record and testimony indicates he is unwilling or unready to  perform his core tasks.   President Trump's vast business holdings present an unprecedented  threat of conflict of interest. Yet the President has not only refused  to divest himself, he has mocked the idea that he should. Should  conflicts arise, the Attorney General must be willing to maintain  impartiality, including appointing a special counsel or prosecutor if  necessary. There are so many scenarios requiring this step. Yet when I  asked Senator Sessions about enforcement of cases against illegal  conflicts of interest involving the President and his family--such as  violations of the emoluments clause or the STOCK Act--he equivocated.  When I asked him about appointing a special counsel to investigate  criminal wrongdoing at Deutsche Bank, owed more than $300 million by  President Donald Trump, he equivocated. When I asked him about the  investigation of Russian hacking, he equivocated. His answers to  questions I submitted to him in writing were no better. Those answers  give me no confidence that he will be an independent, nonpolitical  enforcer against conflicts of interest and official self-enrichment  that the Nation needs. At a moment when the incoming administration  faces ethical and legal controversies that are unprecedented in scope  and scale, Senator Sessions has simply given us no confidence that he  will appoint an independent counsel or demonstrate the independence  that is necessary.   His record over many years and his recent testimony fail to  demonstrate the core commitments and convictions necessary to be our  next Attorney General. He has failed to show how he can be that legal  conscience, that unmistakable, unshakable, ethical voice independent  from the White House. He has failed to prove that he will be a champion  of constitutional rights. Indeed, his career demonstrates an antipathy  and hostility to the very rights and liberties that the Nation's chief  law enforcement officer must always promote proactively, as well as  defend.   Focus for a moment, shall we, on some of the rights that affect women  and their privacy. Women comprise more than half the population, but  unfortunately our society and our laws have too frequently prevented  them from achieving the equality that every American should enjoy. Over  the course of his career, Senator Sessions has opposed key legislation  that protects and further enhances women's rights. As a Senator, that  trend was worrying. As Attorney General of the United States, it must  be disqualifying.   In 1973, the Supreme Court recognized a vital constitutional right of  privacy for women. It is a right that is both basic and fundamental,  now enshrined in five decades of precedent, that women have the freedom  to choose what medical procedures they will undergo to make private  health care decisions and personal reproductive rights decisions  without interference from the government.   As we all know, declaring abortion illegal solves no problem. Laws  against abortion do not stop them from happening, it simply stops them  from happening in a safe, legal manner. Laws that restrict abortion  force women to put their own lives at peril rather than enjoying full  freedom. Yet Senator Sessions' congressional record and hearing show  that he is inherently opposed to providing women with the ability to  make those preeminently private health care decisions.   He has gone on record stating he believes Roe v. Wade was  constitutionally unsound and wrongly decided. He voted against an  amendment that expressed constitutional support for the underlying  Supreme Court decision. Most troubling, he supported a constitutional  amendment to ban abortion with only a few inadequate exceptions. It is  no surprise that he has been supported by extremist groups like  Operation Rescue. As Attorney General of the United States, Senator  Sessions would be tasked with protecting the very women whose rights he  has criticized.   Far too many women seeking to exercise their constitutional rights  are already faced with violence and harassment outside of health  clinics. I know only too well the kind of intimidation and fear- inspired actions that can take place because as attorney general of my  State, I enforce the statute to protect those clinics.   Those women look to the Department of Justice to enforce the Federal  law that prohibits interference with people seeking to access these  clinics, and it keeps them safe. There is a very real concern about  whether these women will receive the same protection under Senator  Sessions' tenure. With limited resources across the Department of  Justice, decisions must be made by the Attorney General in setting  priorities for enforcement.   Senator Sessions' past positions and stances make clear that the  protection of women's rights is far from a priority for him. He told me  at the hearing that he would ``enforce the law.'' But when important  constitutional rights are under threat, American women need more than  someone who will simply follow or enforce the law. They need a champion  and so do all of our civil rights and civil liberties and voting rights  and other key freedoms.   I am disturbed as well by Senator Sessions' vote against  reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. He has stated that he  does not oppose the principle or some of the provisions of the law, and  I take him at his word, but the circumstances behind his vote are no  less disturbing. We must recognize that our Nation's tribal communities  face epidemics of both domestic and sexual violence. Studies show that  almost three out of five Native American women have been assaulted and  that one-third of all Native American women are raped during their  lifetime.   The VAWA Reauthorization of 2013, the Violence Against Women Act,  that  [[Page S841]]  he voted against included significant new language that closed a  glaring loophole in the jurisdictional requirements of this basic law.  The bill guaranteed and granted tribal communities power over non- Indian defendants who commit domestic violence against Native Americans  in Indian Country. Before the reauthorization act, tribal courts lacked  jurisdiction to prosecute these horrific crimes and often the assaulter  would escape prosecution entirely.   During his confirmation hearing, Senator Sessions told us that he had  ``a big concern'' about that jurisdictional provision in the  reauthorization act. He was concerned that the law would leave non- Native Americans open to prosecution under tribal law, despite  safeguards in the bill that were clear and unequivocal. The large gaps  that the original law left were apparently acceptable to him.   Additionally, the VAWA reauthorization included a nondiscrimination  clause. This provision protects members of the LGBT community from  discrimination in housing and employment, schools, and other areas of  civil rights cases.   Senator Sessions also took this issue with the nondiscrimination  provisions in the reauthorization act, including the protection for  LGBT individuals. He took issue with those provisions.   I am concerned, also, by several other votes that Senator Sessions  took in 2004. He voted against extending Federal unemployment benefits  to people who leave their jobs as a result of being victims of domestic  or sexual assault.   In 2009, he voted against an amendment which would have strengthened  the rights of victims of wage discrimination, contributing to the  roadblocks and hurdles that women encounter while facing issues of  inequality.   As recently as March of 2015, Senator Sessions voted against the  Paycheck Fairness Act, a vote he has taken multiple times before. These  bills sought to strengthen women's rights and opportunities in the  workplace.   In 2017, our world is one where women still struggle to obtain the  same pay levels as men in the workplace for the same work. This kind of  discrimination is un-American and really an embarrassment to our  Nation.   Senator Sessions' voting record consistently shows his opposition to  this kind of key legislation designed to protect women from oppression  and discrimination and protect women's autonomy and choice, and I  cannot support an Attorney General with this record.   Speaking on the floor some time ago, I added other details as to the  reasons why I have opposed Senator Sessions. I see colleagues on the  floor right now so I will end here with this point. Over the past  weeks, I have received an outpouring of outrage from throughout my  State of Connecticut, more than 4,500 letters from Connecticut  residents opposing this nomination because they recognize the need, the  desperate imperative for a true champion of civil rights and liberties,  constitutional freedoms in this office facing the threat that is more  real and urgent than ever before in our history.   Just hours ago, I received a million signatures on a petition from  civil rights groups. They are contained magically on a thumb drive that  is so easy to display, even if the signatures are not readily visible,  but these million brave and steadfast individuals and the organizations  that represent them. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and  Liberties, other groups that have proudly and actively worked on this  cause are to be thanked, as are the advocates throughout the country  who have galvanized public opinion, raised awareness, and shown what  democracy looks like.   This is what democracy looks like. This is what America looks like.  This is what Connecticut looks like--people rallying and rising up  against an unconstitutional immigration ban, against a set of nominees  that fail to reflect and serve America against an Attorney General  nominee, in particular, who cannot be relied upon to actively and  aggressively, vigorously, and vigilantly protect our constitutional  rights and liberties. We need a champion of those rights and liberties.   I regretfully oppose Jeff Sessions as our next Attorney General  because we cannot count on him to do so, and I urge my colleagues to  join in this opposition.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
