 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4673, the Ensuring  Veterans' Smooth Transition, or EVEST Act.   This bill would require VA to automatically enroll every eligible  separating servicemember into the VA healthcare system. As a veteran, I  know firsthand that the transition from military to civilian life can  be hard. One of the goals is to remove barriers to care for veterans,  whether they left the military decades ago or just last week.   I believe the intention of the EVEST Act is to further that goal by  connecting more at-risk servicemembers with the VA as they leave the  service. I support the intention. I know many other Members do as well,  which is why I expect the bill to pass the House, and probably on a  bipartisan basis.   However, as the ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I  have a different perspective on this bill than many of my colleagues. I  have taken a long, hard look at this legislation, and what I have seen  is a bill that may be well intended but has several potential problems.   To start with, the EVEST Act enrolls separating servicemembers into  the VA healthcare system without their knowledge or consent. Only after  they have been enrolled does the bill require VA to inform the veterans  of their enrollment, the status of their enrollment, and how to opt out  by disenrolling themselves.   We shouldn't be signing veterans up for a government program they  aren't asking for and may never need without at least letting them know  first. And  [[Page H261]]  we shouldn't be telling them that if they don't like it, they can  figure out how to disenroll themselves. That is backwards.   Veterans deserve better than that. Veterans also deserve better than  a bill that has been rushed through Congress without due diligence.  There has never been a single hearing on the EVEST Act in this  Congress.   You may hear the chairman say that there has been a hearing on this  bill last Congress. That is true. But last Congress and this Congress  are very different. We had a different administration last Congress; we  had a different VA Secretary last Congress. I believe more than 70  Members are new this Congress. More than half of the membership of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee is new as well. And, regardless, VA did not  provide testimony at the hearing last Congress.   We have no idea if VA can implement the bill without disrupting  service to the veterans already in the VA health system, further  burdening VA's already overworked staff, or increasing the strain on  VA's already overfull facilities. Every Member of the House hears from  veterans in our districts who are waiting too long for care they need,  stuck in crowded VA facilities, and being treated by VA staff who are  struggling and overwhelmed. I am concerned that this bill could make  each of those things worse.   I am not the only one who thinks so. Last week, right before this  bill was considered by the Rules Committee, the Biden administration  issued a Statement of Administration Policy on the EVEST Act. The  statement reads, ``There may be challenges implementing this bill as  drafted, and the administration looks forward to working with Congress.  . . .'' In other words, even the President recognizes that this bill  needs more work.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration  Policy.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 1836--Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021--Rep. Levin, D-                     California, and nine cosponsors     H.R. 4673--Ensuring Veterans' Smooth Transition (EVEST) Act--Rep.                            Takano, D-California         The Biden-Harris Administration supports efforts that       ensure veterans receive timely access to high-quality       benefits and services that they have earned.        The Administration supports H.R. 1836, which would expand       eligibility criteria for certain education benefits. Current       law defines the term ``active duty'' as those individuals who       are on full-time duty in the active military service of the       United States, including full-time training duty, annual       training duty, and attendance, while in the active military       service, at a school designated as a service school by law or       by the Secretary of the military department concerned. H.R.       1836 would expand eligibility criteria to include those       training in full-time National Guard duty, which includes the       National Guard, the Army National Guard, and the Air National       Guard, as well as those same members when performing active       duty.        The Administration supports the EVEST Act's goal of       seamless enrollment in health care coverage. As currently       written, H.R. 4673 would require the Department of Veterans       Affairs (VA) to automatically enroll new veterans into VA       health care, and notify veterans of their enrollment and       instructions on how to un-enroll, if desired. There may be       challenges implementing this bill as drafted, and the       Administration looks forward to working with Congress on how       best to operationalize its objective.     Mr. Speaker, to be clear, the Veterans' Affairs Committee  had numerous opportunities in the last year to do that work that I had  just discussed, and I don't know why the chairman chose not to. I have  heard him say over the last week that it is okay we didn't have a  hearing on the EVEST Act in this Congress because the bill has been in  the public domain.   Now, I am not sure what that statement really means because there  have been almost 400 bills introduced in this Congress that have been  referred to the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I guess that each of those  are in the public domain. But I don't think any of them are ready for a  vote here on the House floor.   It is not too much to ask that we seek the input from stakeholders  before voting on a bill to become law. That is actually the least we  can do. I don't think our constituents sent us here to do anything less  than that.   During last week's Rules Committee, Congresswoman Torres, a member of  Chairman Takano's own party, seemed to agree with me by lamenting the  lack of process this bill has received this Congress. With all due  respect to the Congresswoman, I doubt that we agree on much, but we do  agree on this, though. Having this bill go through a much more robust  process this Congress could have resulted in a much better product for  our veterans.                                time  0930    Finally, I want to note that the bill will also cost taxpayers $3.1  billion in new discretionary spending. Not a penny of that $3.1 billion  is offset.   Implementing this bill will certainly require additional funding  above the nearly $100 billion already appropriated for the VA  healthcare system.   We cannot keep saddling our children and grandchildren with billions  of dollars more debt. We have to do better than this.   Mr. Speaker, I reiterate that I understand why my colleagues will  likely vote for this bill. I wish I could vote for this bill, as well.   Leaving the military was not easy. It can leave new veterans feeling  adrift and alone. I have been there. But that is why I supported  efforts during the Trump administration to improve the Transition  Assistance Program and increase the VA's outreach to separating  servicemembers during their first year out of uniform.   I want separating servicemembers who need additional support to be  able to get it and the help they need in a seamless manner. And I am  not at all confident that this bill will accomplish that goal without  harming services to other veterans and adding to the national debt. As  a result, I must oppose this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In response to the EVEST Act has been in the public domain, I think  it is very important to note, as I mentioned earlier, the last Congress  is not the same as this Congress. We have more than 70 Members who are  new Members of Congress, half of the Veterans' Affairs Committee is  new, we have a different President, and we have a different secretary.   Introducing a bill is not the same as conducting a hearing. You can't  get input from the stakeholders. You can't engage in meaningful debate  in the public domain. This reflects zero input from the VA, meaning we  have no idea whether it is flexible, whether it is workable, whether it  is disruptive to the VA system. We don't know.   And even the Biden administration agrees that more work is needed  before this bill should become law.   And the previous speaker, Mr. Speaker, spoke about the person that  didn't know what was available to them through the VA. If you were my  age as a veteran it is true that you could not know because you got a  quick class and the TAP program. And I have mentioned on this floor  before that that is a tap on the back and see you later.   But today's TAP program is a course that you take, and you are bound  to understand separation from your active service and what VA benefits  are available to you.   And not only that, the Trump administration in 2018 put an  administrative order out that you are then contacted after separation  at 90, 180, and 360 days out to be notified of what benefits are  available to you in the VA. We are doing that.   This instead enrolls members without their consent, and then they are  enrolled. And the only option they have is to be notified later how  maybe they can get out of being enrolled.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In my debate and the things that I brought up here today, I never  said that VSOs didn't have input. I did say the VA did not come to the  committee, and we did not have the proper hearings. If the VA is in  support of this bill, I would request that the VA send the  documentation saying how they are in support of this bill. Their input  would be vitally important.   Whether it is a Republican or Democrat administration, the VA is  vitally important to make sure they provide services to our  constituents and to our veterans.   No one on this floor cares more about veterans than the people who  serve on this committee--I can guarantee you that--whether it is the  chairman or myself.   But we have to make sure what we are providing does what it is we are  trying to do. It was mentioned earlier that they believe that this  would help reduce suicide among transitioning servicemembers. I care  deeply about this. This is something that both I and the chairman have  worked on and will continue to work on.   The majority of veterans who die of suicide have not had meaningful  engagement with the VA. They may have been enrolled in the VA, but they  haven't gotten the VA care that they need.   This bill would add names of eligible separating servicemembers from  the VA and put them on the rolls, but it doesn't do the outreach that  is necessary to possibly prevent them from that ultimate decision to  end their lives.   Those are the type of things we are working on and will continue to  work on. This is not the answer to that. There are a lot of other  concerns that I have expressed and will continue to express.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned that the Committee on Veterans' Affairs did  not do our job on this bill. We did not consider this bill in a  legislative hearing. We did not seek input from stakeholders or the VA.  We did not make certain that automatically enrolling newly separated  servicemembers into the VA healthcare system would not impede access  for existing employees or cause funding crises. And those things are  very, very real.   Even the Biden OMB has admitted that there are going to be challenges  with implementing this bill. If you look at the numbers--and I am going  to add this into what should be mentioned--19.1 million veterans is  what we have; 9 million veterans are enrolled; 7 million have used  access to the VA. If we start and do it this way without letting  veterans make decisions on their own, it can overwhelm the VA. That is  what has been mentioned by OMB.   Veterans are already facing tough challenges. So is the VA health  system that they can go to. But we don't need to add any more to their  plates without at least hearing how it is going to affect the services  that are already being provided to our veterans.   That is why, just so you know, I am offering a motion to recommit  this morning. My motion to recommit, if adopted, would send this bill  back to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs to consider an amendment to  H.R. 4673 that would delay implementation until 30 days after the VA  has certified that it can implement, without disruption, services to  veterans or requiring additional funds.   Mr. Speaker, I don't see how those who support this bill, despite its  problems and the Biden administration's recognition that it may cause  challenges, can object to this amendment. The very least we can do for  the millions of veterans who are already enrolled in VA care and  counting on VA services is to ensure--before this bill goes into  effect--that it won't cause undue harm to them. I have already drafted  an amendment that would accomplish that goal.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my motion to  recommit, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the four en bloc amendments are offered by Congressman  Delgado, Congresswoman Hayes, and Congresswoman Tlaib. I thank them for  their work. I remain opposed to the underlying bill, and I explained  why in detail over the last debate.   One of the reasons I was opposed to it is because the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs did not do our job before bringing this bill to the  floor. We did not hold hearings on the bill or seek input from  stakeholders. And importantly, we did not get assurance from the VA  that the bill could be implemented without negative impact to services.   In fact, shortly before this bill hit the Rules Committee, the Biden  administration did release the statement that we talked about earlier.  That statement, remember, says that there are challenges in  implementing this bill.   Now, I wish we could have done that work in the VA Committee before  considering the bill on the floor. If there are challenges, we need to  know about them, and we need to be able to address them to make sure  that no veteran is harmed by this bill.   Nevertheless, here we are. These en bloc amendments will help get  some of the information we should have gotten before passing the bill.  They will help us stay informed on how the bill is working and the  impact it is having on veterans and on the VA healthcare system after  the fact.   For example, one of Congressman Delgado's amendments would require  GAO to study the best methods for VA to notify newly separated  servicemembers of their enrollment status. His second amendment would  require VA to consider texting newly separated servicemembers to inform  them of their enrollment status and their ability to disenroll. If a  veteran chooses to disenroll, Congresswoman Hayes' amendment would  require VA to provide them with information on how to enroll at a later  date if they change their mind down the line.   Finally, Congresswoman Tlaib's amendment would require VA to report  to Congress on the implementation of this bill not later than 1 year  after enactment. That would allow us to course-correct, as needed, if  the bill is causing problems at least 1 year out.   Now, I feel like a broken record, but this is information we should  have had already. Nevertheless, it is better late than never. That is  why I will be in support of that amendment alongside the amendments for  Delgado and Hayes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Escobar's amendment would expand automatic  enrollment to servicemembers who left the military 90 days before this  bill is enacted. There are already many existing mechanisms for  separating servicemembers to connect with the VA if that is something  they need and want.   As I explained during the general debate, I have a number of serious  concerns with the underlying bill. The Biden administration agrees that  there are challenges. I think that is an understatement. Regardless, we  should not be further complicating an already difficult implementation  by expanding it even more.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
