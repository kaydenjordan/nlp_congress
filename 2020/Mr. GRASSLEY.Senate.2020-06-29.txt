 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, in June of last year, I held an  Oversight Committee hearing about foreign threats to taxpayer-funded  research. My goal is to ensure that government is doing its job to  detect and deter these threats.   Since COVID, America's greatest minds have been working hard to  develop a vaccine. Their research will impact the health of Americans  and the world.   According to the FBI, China has targeted our COVID research to  potentially steal our work product. Our government and private sector  must guard and fight back against these malicious attacks by the  Chinese Communist Government. The health of our people and the world  depend on it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, the past few months have resulted in  some dramatic changes in our daily lives. We all know that is because  of the virus pandemic, but for America's farmers and the 86,000 Iowa  family farms, there were still crops to be planted, fields to be  fertilized, and livestock to care for, regardless of the virus  pandemic.   These family farms take great satisfaction in the fact that they are  part of the most affordable, abundant, and safest supply of food of any  country in the world. They are also proud to help fuel the country,  knowing that almost every gallon of gas consumed in the United States  is blended with renewable fuels.   Family farmers have a lot to be proud of. As one of two farmers  serving in the U.S. Senate, I can speak to that because I am one.   One of the most enjoyable aspects of my job is the opportunity to  speak with farmers across the State during my annual 99 county  meetings. Being able to hear from them directly and to use my position  on the Senate Agriculture Committee to work on their issues is an honor  and a privilege that I don't take lightly.   At my meetings, farmers will introduce themselves by telling me how  many generations of their families have made their living on the same  land that they now operate--third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation  farmers using the same soil and oftentimes the same tools and barns as  generations before them.   In fact, the Iowa Department of Agriculture Century Farm database  shows that out of these 86,000 family farmers in Iowa, there are 20,060  farms in our State that have been in the same family for more than 100  years. Even more impressive, out of that 86,000 family farmers, we have  a classification called the Heritage Farm database showing 1,360 farms  that have been in the same family for 150 years.   Farming isn't just a profession. It isn't just a hobby or a personal  passion. Farming is how many Iowans leave their mark in our world.   The legacy of many Iowa families is built and created around life at  that farm. Every farmer intends to leave their land to their children  better than when they found it when it was entrusted to them for their  care in the first place. Farmers live by that creed, and it is  reflected by the fact that Iowa is a global leader in sustainable  farming practices.   Through farm bill programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the  Federal Government has proven it can successfully partner with farmers  to enhance conservation practices.   At the State level, Governor Reynolds and Iowa Agriculture Secretary  Naig are leading the charge to implement the Iowa Nutrient Reduction  Strategy--our way of cleaning up the rivers and helping the Gulf of  Mexico to not be as dead as it is so often. This includes techniques  like no-till, cover crops, and wetland restoration to improve soil  health and enhance water quality.   Researchers at Iowa State University continue to develop new  conservation techniques, like adding tall grass prairie strips to  fields and modeling when to best apply fertilizer.   Iowa farmers have embraced voluntary stewardship investments and  practices that allow them to stay productive and to be profitable-- maybe not so profitable now when corn is at less than $3 a bushel, as  an example, but overall time profitability. They do this while also  ensuring their land can be productive for years to come, for when it is  time to give their children a chance to take over the farm.   So while the Federal Government has shown an ability to partner with  Iowa farmers, there are also times when the Federal Government has  overstepped its authority and attempted to regulate private landowners  with one-size-fits-all solutions.   For example, in 2010, the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation  Service--it goes by NRCS in most States--determined that an Illinois  farmer by the name of Kurt Wilke and his family could not maintain and  farm their land. This was in 2010. It is now 2020. We might have a  resolution of this, finally. The USDA claimed the land contained  wetlands, despite documentation to the contrary.   In early 2011, Mr. Wilke started making improvements to his drainage  tile system on that farm. That is when the NRCS got involved. For him,  it was a terrible life for the next several years. They told him to  stop the work; in other words, stop improving your land through the  drainage tile system. They warned him that he was putting farm program  payments at risk.   Earlier this month, after nearly a decade of court battles with the  NRCS--Farmer Wilke was fighting the NRCS in court battles--a  determination by the Director of the USDA's National Appeals Division  reprimanded this NRCS agency for overstepping its bounds. Can you  imagine stepping in to say that a farmer can't farm his farm?   The USDA stepped in because they had failed to obey their own rules.  The appeals division favored Mr. Wilke. This protracted court battle  should have been avoided.   In regard to that, I am going to read, and then I am going to ask  unanimous consent to print in the Record the Iowa Farm Bureau  Federation newspaper called the Spokesman.   This started in 2010. So, in 2020, this finally ends, where one  division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, called the National  Appeals Division, because of their decision, Mr. Wilke will have an  opportunity to be reimbursed for tens of thousands of dollars in legal  fees incurred while fighting for fair treatment.   I ask unanimous consent to print this article in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [June 17, 2020]   USDA Appeals Division Admonishes NRCS for not Following Its Own Rules         A battle over a farmer's right to use and care for his own       land is one step closer to being resolved. A determination by       the director of USDA's National Appeals Division admonishes       the Natural Resources Conservation Service for failing to       obey its own rules. The ruling favors an Illinois farmer who       battled NRCS for more than a decade. The decision is a       welcome signal that concerns from across the countryside       about NRCS conservation compliance are being heard.        In 2010, the NRCS determined that Illinois farmer Kurt       Wilke and his family could not maintain and farm their land,       claiming it contained wetlands, despite documentation to the       contrary. An administrative judge ruled against the NRCS, but       the agency repeatedly filed the same findings, forcing Wilke       to fight the issue in court four times over more than a       decade. Each time, an administrative judge ruled in Wilke's       favor.  [[Page S3639]]       Wilke's case is not unique. In 2019, the American Farm Bureau       Federation called on USDA to ensure fair treatment of farmers       and ranchers by NRCS, highlighting Kurt Wilke's case and       others. AFBF called for due process in enforcement of       conservation and a transparent decision-making and appeals       process.        AFBF welcomes the NAD director's decision, which clears the       way for Wilke to be reimbursed for tens of thousands of       dollars in legal fees incurred while fighting for fair       treatment. The NAD director found that the NRCS ignored its       own standards in determining what constitutes a wetland,       stating, ``NRCS's decision to disregard evidence affected the       accuracy of its calculation.'' The ruling continues,       ``Because NAD determined that, NRCS's scopes and effect       analysis did not follow federal regulations or established       procedures, NRCS cannot now argue that it did so.''        American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall said, ``This       decision about a decade old case sends a strong message to       NRCS that the government must play by its own rules and treat       farmers and ranchers fairly. We understand the importance of       following environmental rules, but we expect fair enforcement       of those rules. We hope this marks the end of NRCS ignoring       facts and procedures. We look forward to conservation being a       partnership between NRCS and farmers.''        The NAD director's decision follows a unanimous ruling by       the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in USDA v.       Boucher, which sternly rebuked NRCS conservation program       enforcement in 2019. In the court's words, ``USDA repeatedly       failed to follow applicable law and agency standards. It       disregarded compelling evidence showing that the acreage in       question never qualified as wetlands that could have been       converted illegally into croplands. And the agency has kept       shifting its explanations for treating the acreage as       converted wetlands. The USDA's treatment of the Bouchers'       acreage as converted wetlands easily qualifies as arbitrary,       capricious, and an abuse of discretion.''     He finally gets justice, but just think of the life of  Mr. Wilke for the 10 years that the U.S. Department of Agriculture and  that agency said he could not farm his land the way he wanted to and  put in the tile system the way he wanted to. Sometimes maybe their  opinion is justified, but you can see how they overstepped their bounds  and how it hurt this farmer.   I want to give you another example of government overreach. It was  the Obama-era regulation called waters of the United States. Most  people know that as WOTUS. The 2015 WOTUS rule was a dramatic expansion  of the authority that Congress provided to the Environmental Protection  Agency to regulate the navigable waters of the United States. Remember  navigable waters? It is supposed to be the definition of--as far as the  big boats can go up a river. That is Federal regulation. Beyond that,  it is State regulation, but not for that previous administration and  WOTUS. They were going to regulate the road ditches, as an example.   In fact, the Obama-era rule would have claimed jurisdiction to  require Federal permission to do any number of activities, not just in  or near Iowa rivers and streams but on 97 percent of Iowa's land.   To clear up a common confusion, this rule wasn't about regulating  discharge of pollution into the waterways, which is important and is  done through other parts of the Clean Water Act. What this whole WOTUS  rule was about was requiring Federal redtape for routine land use  decisions with little or no environmental benefit. It was a power grab,  pure and simple.   One week ago today, the Trump administration's WOTUS rule went into  effect. This rule balances the need to protect our navigable rivers  while also protecting the private property rights of businesses,  homeowners, and, of course, family farms. This is a major  accomplishment, and I congratulate President Trump and Administrator  Wheeler on getting this rule over the finish line.   I hope people remember 4 months from now--particularly people who are  farmers--what WOTUS would have done for you if it had been kept in  place. You maybe would have had to get a permit from the government to  do normal farming operations. Now you don't have to. You never have had  to in 150, 160 years in Iowa.   For the time being, these two examples of government overreach have  been resolved. However, the U.S. Congress and the executive branch must  continue to advocate for fairness and common sense when passing  legislation or regulations that will impact private land owners.   Farmers understand the importance of environmental rules, and farmers  will follow those rules. However, we must demand fair enforcement of  those rules so that they don't disadvantage family farmers like Mr.  Wilkie of Illinois was disadvantaged for 10 years fighting the  bureaucracy. However, we must demand fair enforcement of these rules so  that they don't disadvantage anybody, for that matter.   The virus pandemic that we are in has demonstrated the importance of  supporting farmers and ensuring that we have a stable, safe, and  affordable food supply for our country. Through natural disasters,  through droughts, through pests, through pandemics, America's families  are still farming. Let's make sure that the Federal Government doesn't  get in their way so that they can pass along their legacy and their  farm to future generations.   I yield the floor.
