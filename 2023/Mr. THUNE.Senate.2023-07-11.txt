 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Supreme Court finished up its term  recently by releasing several decisions that did not result in the  Democrats' preferred outcomes. The hysteria was instant and,  unfortunately, predictable.   ``Disappointing and cruel,'' the Senate Democratic leader chastised  one decision.   ``Unacceptable and indefensible'' said another Democratic Senator.   ``Horrifying'' was another response from a Democratic Senator.   Then there was the President of the United States who said:         This is not a normal court.    Not a normal court--never mind the fact that this Court, like others  before it, is composed of nine Justices duly nominated and confirmed in  accordance with the Constitution, sitting and interpreting the law.  Apparently, the fact that this Court has issued decisions Democrats  disagree with makes this ``not a normal court.''   Well, here is the list of thoroughly unradical decisions that have so  horrified members of the Democratic party: The Court ruled that  universities cannot make admissions decisions based upon the color of  someone's skin. The Court ruled that the President does not have the  right to create a massive student loan forgiveness program without  clear authority from Congress. The Court ruled that the First Amendment  does actually protect Americans from being forced by the Government to  speak messages with which they disagree.   These are the rulings that Members of the Democratic party consider  ``cruel and indefensible.''   Continuing with the theme of Democratic hysteria, the Democratic  leader said on Sunday that the Supreme Court had achieved ``dangerous''  and ``regressive'' policies ``completely at odds with what the vast  majority of Americans want.''   Now, I am not sure he has that quite right. I know the recent  decisions are at odds with what the Democratic party wants, but the  vast majority of Americans do not seem to be at odds with the Court's  decisions. Take the Court's decision in favor of the First Amendment.  It turns out that more Americans support that decision than oppose it.  The same goes for the Court's student loan decision.   Public opinion is decidedly in favor of the Court's decision ruling  that the Constitution does not allow universities to make admissions  decisions on the basis of race. One poll found that 52 percent of the  American people approve--approve--of the Court's decision, while just  32 percent disapprove. Another poll found that 59 percent of Americans  approve of the Court's decision, while just 27 percent disapprove.   It seems that the Court is a lot more in line with Americans than the  Democratic party would like to think.   Let me offer a few more statistics about this supposedly abnormal  court.  [[Page S2294]]  Let's put things in context here for just a moment.   Nearly half of the cases decided by the Supreme Court in this term  were decided unanimously--almost half. That means that all of those  ``extreme'' Republican-nominated Justices and all of the Court's  Democrat-nominated Justices were in unanimous agreement almost half the  time.   That is not all. At least one of the Court's so-called liberal  Justices was in the majority in more than 80 percent of cases. That  means that more than 80 percent of the time, at least one liberal  Justice agreed with the Court's conservatives. It kind of makes the  Supreme Court seem not very extreme. Eighty percent of the decisions  had Justices from so-called both sides--conservative and liberal sides.   Yes, there have been a handful of decisions where all of the liberal  Justices have disagreed with the majority opinion. But that is hardly  unprecedented. There have been plenty of cases in previous years where  most or all of the so-called conservative Justices have disagreed with  the majority opinion, and I don't remember Democrats having any  problems with the legitimacy of those outcomes.   Democrats' utter hysteria in the face of some pretty mainstream  Supreme Court decisions could almost be amusing, but it is not, because  Democrats' rhetoric and proposed response to a Supreme Court that  issues decisions they disagree with has crossed a line.   Now, I completely respect Democrats' right to be upset at and  disagree with Supreme Court decisions. I disagreed with quite a few  myself. But there is disagreement, and then there is attempting to  undermine a branch of our government. And Democrats are engaged in the  latter.   Over and over, Democrats' responses go beyond disagreement or outrage  at the Court's decisions and cross the line into attacking the Court's  legitimacy.   A number of Democrats have gone even further, directly or indirectly  calling for expanding the Court or otherwise altering it to create a  Court that will rule in line with where Democrats think it should be.   It is difficult to overstate just how dangerous Democrats' rhetoric  is. Democrats are not only fostering a sense of distrust about a Court  that is completely legitimate in every way--save for the fact the  Democrats don't like some of its decisions--that they are proposing so- called solutions that would permanently and completely destroy faith in  the Supreme Court as an impartial interpreter of the law.   Do Democrats seriously imagine that their proposal to ``restore  faith'' in the courts would do anything but further divide the American  public and encourage one half of the population to regard the Court as  an arm of the Democratic Party?   Do Democrats seriously think they could pack the Court with their  preferred Justices and not set off a permanent battle in which the  party in power adds or subtracts Justices to achieve what it decides is  balance?   If Democrats have their way, we will be looking at a future in which  the Supreme Court is nothing but an arm of the party in power in the  other two branches, with the number of Justices constantly changing to  achieve the governing party's preferred outcomes.   There are names for systems of government in which the party in power  controls the outcome in the courts. They are names like  ``dictatorship'' and ``despotism.'' Not getting your way at the Supreme  Court is a pretty poor reason to undermine our system of government.  But I am starting to wonder just how well Democrats understand our  system of government, given their apparent belief that the outcome  should always be in their favor. That is not the way it works in our  democratic Republic.   In our system of government, you win sometimes and you lose  sometimes. When you lose, you fight hard to gain ground and persuade  others of the rightness of your position. You do not--you do not-- attempt to rig the system so the outcome will always be in your favor.  Hopefully--hopefully--you do not set out to undermine faith in the  system by suggesting that any outcome that you don't like is not just  incorrect but illegitimate.   It is deeply disturbing that so many Democrats and Democratic leaders  are participating in this campaign to attack the legitimacy of the  Supreme Court. I hope--I truly hope--that cooler heads will prevail  before they do permanent damage to our system of government.   I yield the floor.
