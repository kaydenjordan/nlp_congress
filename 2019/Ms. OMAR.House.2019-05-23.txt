 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the  horrifying crimes against humanity that China is currently committing  against the Uighur population.   About a million Uighur Muslims have been detained in so-called  reeducation camps in China. Reports from the camps are scarce, but they  indicate that physical and psychological torture is taking place.   These are the precursors to genocide. We have the power to act.   According to reports in The Atlantic, 22 Uighur Muslims with no known  anti-American sentiments were detained at Guantanamo in late 2001 and  kept there for 12 years at the urging of the Chinese Government.   There are also known cases of Uighurs on the suspected terrorist  watch list in the United States, and it is entirely possible they were  added, unfairly, by the Chinese Government.   Reporting in The Wall Street Journal indicates that U.S. companies,  including Coca-Cola, the Gap, and Kraft Heinz, are materially  benefiting from the Uighur detention, and this must be investigated and  prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.                            ____________________
