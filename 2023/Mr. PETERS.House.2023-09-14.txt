 Mr. Speaker, my Republican colleagues like to attack  California for its forward-thinking policies to address dangerous air  pollution, especially from the transportation sector.   California has indeed been a leader in reducing air pollution for  decades because of our unique air pollution challenges. In fact, we  were the very first State to regulate tailpipe emission pollution from  vehicles.   The Federal Government followed California's lead by enacting the  first iteration of the Clean Air Act in 1970, over 10 years after  California had legislation to adopt standards for community air quality  and motor vehicle emissions.   Since California already had tailpipe emission standards on the  books, Congress drafted the Clean Air Act to accommodate their ongoing  innovation and progress in addressing air pollution from the  transportation sector, and all of this occurred under the governorship  of Ronald Reagan.    Over the years, EPA has granted California dozens of waivers for its  emission standards. That has enabled California to not only address its  significant air pollution challenges but has also cemented California  as a worldwide leader in deploying emissions reduction technologies.   Our ambitious standards in California paved the way for the invention  of the catalytic converter and the dashboard ``check engine'' lights,  in addition to the development of zero-emission vehicles.   Unfortunately, H.R. 1435 seeks to erase decades of historic progress  on addressing air pollution, driving innovation, and protecting public  health.   Frankly, the goal of this shortsighted bill is to keep us stuck in  the past and our heads in the sand while the real, tangible dangers of  climate change continue to harm our communities, our environment, and  our economy.   We should not reverse decades of California's historic leadership in  protecting public health and addressing air pollution from the  transportation sector.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1435.                                time  1445
