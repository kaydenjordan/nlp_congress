 Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I come to the  House floor today to honor my constituent, David Brown, from Shakopee,  Minnesota, who was recently awarded the Carnegie Medal for an  extraordinary act of heroism in our community.   On May 26, 2019, two men began to struggle after entering the frigid  water of the Gull River. They were trying to save their friend who was  having trouble getting back to shore due to the strong current.   Despite the risk to his own safety, David jumped into the water and  successfully brought both men back to the shore while another saved  their friend.   It is so important that this heroic act be recognized here on the  floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, and it is my honor to do  so.   Madam Speaker, I thank David for his outstanding commitment to our  community and his life-saving action.                            ____________________
