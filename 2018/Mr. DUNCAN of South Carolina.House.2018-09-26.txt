 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  Leader McCarthy's resolution recognizing that allowing illegal  immigrants the right to vote devalues the franchise and diminishes the  voting power of United States citizens.   I have been deeply concerned, seeing more and more municipalities  around the country starting to allow noncitizens and illegal immigrants  the right to vote in local elections, the most current example being  San Francisco, as they have started allowing both noncitizens and  illegal immigrants to register to vote in school board elections.   One day it is local elections; the next, it could be statewide  elections; and then, finally, the Federal elections. We can't start  down this path. But we know this is where the radical left wants to  grow their electorate.    For generations, brave men and women have fought and died in order to  protect the fundamental right of American citizens to participate in  free and fair elections. You and I can't go and vote in the elections  of other nations, nor should we.   The gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) can't vote in New Jersey or  Pennsylvania because he isn't a citizen of New Jersey or Pennsylvania.  He is a citizen of New York. Nor should he vote in those elections.   When we start granting others the sacred right reserved for U.S.  citizens, it puts our whole democratic process at risk and diminishes  the voice of the American people. We simply can't allow noncitizens and  illegal immigrants to water down the desires and visions of the  American people at the voting booth. This is dangerous, and it  disrespects the importance and value of citizenship that has been  fought for throughout our Nation's history.   Now more than ever, it is critical that we ensure only American  citizens are casting ballots to determine our children's future in this  country. The left continues to embrace deadly sanctuary cities, more  illegal immigrants at the voting booth, and open border policies that  simply do not fall in line with American values.                                time  1615    These ideas are so far out of mainstream and continue to be rejected  time and time again by the American people of this country who want  their voice to count.   This resolution is a critical step to stand up and protect our  democratic process. And while I stand here 100 percent supportive of my  good friend's resolution, I believe this is laying the groundwork for  what is to come. We have work to do.   I believe we must defund these communities that adopt policies like  noncitizen and illegal immigrant voting. These voting policies do  nothing more than foster more of the dangerous, illegal sanctuary city  policies that we have seen around the country. These sanctuary policies  promote illegal activity, undermine law enforcement, and suppress  concerns of actual U.S. citizen voters.   I encourage all Members to support the commonsense resolution to  protect the integrity of the American elections and protect the value  of U.S. citizen voting power. Let's protect the voting booth. Let's  protect the rule of law. Let's protect American values. Let's always  put America first.
