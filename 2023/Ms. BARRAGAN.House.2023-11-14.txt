 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan en  bloc, which includes my amendment to increase funding for the Research  Endowment Program at the National Institute of Minority Health and  Health Disparities.   This program has bipartisan support. Earlier this year, Democrats and  Republicans called for an increase in funding through a letter I led to  House Appropriations.   My colleague Representative Buddy Carter in the House and Senator  Cassidy in the Senate worked hard in the last Congress to pass my bill,  the John Lewis NIMHD Research Endowment Revitalization Act. It was  signed into law, but now we need to increase the funding to this  program so schools like Charles R. Drew University, Moorehouse School  of Medicine, and many others, can continue to conduct critical research  into minority health disparities. Increased funding will support  existing and new grantees.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment so we can fund research to  reduce health disparities and save lives.
