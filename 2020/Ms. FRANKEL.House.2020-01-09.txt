 Madam Speaker, I am holding in my hand a pill cutter.  Pharmacists tell me that it is one of the most popular gadgets in the  drugstore.   Why? Because many prescription drugs are so unaffordable that, at the  expense of their health, Americans are cutting their pills in half.  Even some folks who have insurance go to the counter with a  prescription and leave empty-handed because they can't afford the  copay.   That is why Democrats passed H.R. 3 that will give Medicare the power  to negotiate with drug companies, lowering the cost of the most  expensive drugs for all Americans and stopping pharmaceutical companies  from charging more for drugs that are cheaper in other countries. The  new law would also set limits on prescription drug costs for Medicare  beneficiaries while delivering them vision, dental, and hearing care.   Madam Speaker, I urge the Senate to take up and pass this lifesaving  bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as the mother of a United States Marine war  veteran, I came to Congress with the promise of never sending someone  else's child to a war that could be avoided. This War Powers Resolution  says no war with Iran without congressional approval, while still  ensuring defense if there is an imminent threat.   While we do not mourn the death of Iran's commander of terror,  Americans and our allies worry about the ramifications that will make  us less safe: the fight against ISIS has been diverted; regional  protests against the Iranian regime are now against America; Iranian  proxies have been further incited; and Iran is closer to having a  nuclear weapon.   America is not a monarchy. The decision to go to war requires debate,  deliberation, and collective judgment. That is why the law gives the  responsibility to Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution.
