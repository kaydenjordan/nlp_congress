 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for bringing this  forward. It is going to affect the weaknesses that we have found in our  trade deal.   So I rise in support of the America COMPETES Act. This includes my  bipartisan, bicameral bill, the National Critical Capabilities Defense  Act. Our bill will strengthen frayed supply chains. It will stop the  bleeding of our industrial might being shipped to foreign adversaries.   The Chinese Communist Party government climbed our back to economic  power. They are abusing that power to commit genocide, crush democratic  norms, and undermine our workers. We must stop our adversaries from  leeching off America's economic might to sow discord.   It is time to enhance supply chain visibility. We must empower trade  that does not undermine American competitors.   I want to thank Representatives DeLauro, Spartz, and Fitzpatrick for  working on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record statements of support for the  bill from the AFL-CIO, the Communications Workers of America, the  United Steelworkers, and the Alliance for American Manufacturing.                                                        AFL-CIO,                                                   January 31, 2022.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 12.5 million union       members of the AFL-CIO, I write in strong support of the       America COMPETES Act. This comprehensive legislation presents       Congress with a rare opportunity to improve the United       States' competitiveness across a broad cross-section of       industry, science, trade, and technology. We commend the       House Leadership and the committee chairs for putting       together a legislative package that will benefit millions of       working families.        The COMPETES Act includes important provisions that will       help curb China's aggressive non-market trade distortions       that have put downward pressure on U.S. production,       employment and wages. Specifically, the $52 billion in       funding for the CHIPS Act is critical to sustaining U.S.       leadership in semiconductors and addressing the current chip       shortage that continues to adversely impact production in the       automotive sector and elsewhere. In addition, the Research       and Innovation provisions in Division B will strengthen our       nation's technology and innovation infrastructure, bolster       the involvement of workers in our federal research       enterprise, expand STEM education, and protect vital research       and development.  [[Page H821]]         The trade title of COMPETES, Division K, includes       critically important fixes to the trade title that was added       at the last minute to the Senate USICA bill (see attached       Fact Sheet). These include stronger protections for workers       under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), and       restrictions in the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill in order to       maintain its historical purpose of exempting components, and       not finished products, for goods to be produced domestically.        The Ways and Means Committee also added provisions that       must be included in any competitiveness package that purports       to challenge China's increasing economic dominance. These       include renewal of robust Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA);       the Sewell-Johnson Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0; the       DeLauro-Pascrell-Spartz-Fitzpatrick National Critical       Capabilities Defense Act; and the Blumenauer Import Security       and Fairness Act that would halt China's exploitation of U.S.       de minimis policy. This section also removes harmful language       from the Senate bill that would unnecessarily tie the       administration's hands with regard to China tariffs.        Passage of the House's America COMPETES Act will provide       critical and overdue enhancements to America's global       competitive capabilities, support workers whose jobs are lost       to trade, and protect and expand the tools to fight foreign       unfair trade. The AFL-CIO stands ready to fight for these       priorities, to level the playing field against unfair trade       practices and to improve opportunities for America's hard-      working families. We urge you to support this legislation and       fight for the enactment of its provisions into law.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                      Director, Government Affairs.               Fact Sheet on Trade Provision in COMPETES Act         Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA). Unfortunately, TAA       reverted at the end of June 2021 to an insufficient program       with limited funding and coverage that does not help workers       whose jobs are outsourced to countries with which the U.S.       does not have a Free Trade Agreement, such as China. Renewing       TAA with robust funding and support is critical to American       workers and families who lose their jobs to trade.        The Sewell-Johnson Level the Playing Field Act 2.0 (similar       legislation was introduced by Senators Brown and Portman in       the Senate) is critically needed to update the rules against       unfair trade. Inclusion will update U.S. trade laws and help       ensure that the unique circumstances relating to economic       recovery from the pandemic do not limit the ability of       workers, farmers, and businesses to address the injury caused       by illegally dumped and subsidized imports.        The National Critical Capabilities Defense Act, a       bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives DeLauro,       Pascrell, Spartz and Fitzpatrick. This companion to Senate       legislation authored by Senators Casey and Cornyn creates a       new review process to protect our supply chains by screening       outbound investment and guarding against offshoring of       critical capabilities to adversaries like China and Russia.       It is a common-sense approach that finally recognizes how       important our supply chains are to our national, health and       economic security. From semiconductors to pharmaceutical       ingredients, it will provide a needed review mechanism to       advance U.S. production and employment. The approach was       recommended as part of the most recent unanimously-approved       report of the bipartisan U.S.-China Economic & Security       Review Commission.        H.R. 3975, the ``Generalized System of Preferences and       Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Modernization Act of 2021.'' This       bill would reauthorize and strengthen the Generalized System       of Preferences (GSP) program. Importantly, the bill would be       the first significant update of the labor eligibility       criteria and enforcement process since 1984, when these       standards were first included.        A Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) that allows for       exemptions of product components if they are not available in       the United States: but unlike the Senate provisions will not       expand longstanding policy by allowing tariff-free exemptions       for finished products. Historically, the MTB has been drafted       only to allow components into the U.S. tariff-free if they       were unavailable domestically but necessary for the       production of final products manufactured here.        Removal of a Senate provision that would shift more jobs       and production to China and undermine enforcement actions       designed to address that country's predatory and       protectionist practices. The Senate provisions on Section 301       would tie the President's hands in responding to unfair and       illegal foreign trade practices like intellectual property       theft. It puts new, unnecessary burdens on USTR and Customs &       Border Protection. Touted as ``oversight,'' these provisions'       purpose is to roll back China tariffs and would grease the       skids for more imports from China. It should not have been       included in legislation dealing with the competitive       challenges we face from China.        A provision to halt exploitation of ``de minimis.''       Currently, individual shipments into the U.S. are exempt from       duties and tariffs so long as they are valued below the ``de       minimis'' threshold of $800 USD. This threshold is far too       high and has allowed a new model of direct-to-consumer       imports, particularly from China, with significant negative       impact on many U.S. sectors, including textiles and apparel.       By comparison, China's de minimis is under $10 USD. Inclusion       of the Import Security and Fairness Act would prohibit goods       from countries that are both Non-Market Economies (NME) and       on the U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) Priority Watch List       (e.g. China) from avoiding tariffs and abuse of de minimis.       In addition, ``de minimis'' packages arriving from China are       not screened by CBP and may contain goods made with forced       labor, particularly from the Xinjiang region.        Elimination of troublesome 301 Digital Trade language that       would overwhelmingly benefit large digital corporations       (Google, Facebook/Meta, Uber) at the expense of countries'       right to reasonably regulate global digital platforms.                                   ____           Communications Workers of America, Government Affairs             Department,                                  Washington, DC, February 1, 2022.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Chair, House Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Earl Blumenauer,      Chair, House Subcommittee on Trade,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal and Subcommittee Chairman Blumenauer: On       behalf of the members and officers of the Communications       Workers of America, I am writing to express my gratitude for       your work in creating a strong and comprehensive trade title       in the America COMPETES Act. Because of your work and the       work of committee and member staff, working families across       the country will have the support and tools to combat unfair       trade practices once this legislation is enacted.        Included in the trade title, Division K, are critically       important fixes to the trade title in the Senate USICA bill.       The House provisions included in the trade title creates a       worker centered trade agenda while also enhancing U.S.       competitiveness. Specifically, the trade title includes:        A renewal of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) with robust       funding and support to help workers whose jobs are       outsourced;        A reauthorization of the Generalized System Preferences       (GSP) with updated labor eligibility criteria and enforcement       process to ensure that workers are protected;        The bipartisan Sewell-Johnson Level the Playing Field Act       2.0, which strengthen U.S. trade remedy laws to protect       American workers and push back against China's egregious       efforts to manipulate the global market;        The bipartisan National Critical Capabilities Defense Act,       which establishes a new review process to protect our supply       chains and guards against the offshoring of critical       capabilities so to ensure that the United States can quickly       detect supply chain vulnerabilities; and        A removal of provisions on Section 301 and 301 Digital       Trade language included in the Senate version of the bill,       ensuring tariff preferences to economically developing       countries uplift workers and countries keep their right to       regulate global digital platforms.        The Ways and Means Committee has created a trade title that       includes proactive trade enforcement and reforms which will       uplift workers and make our supply chains more resilient.       Thank you again for your work to create a comprehensive trade       title that will benefit working families for years to come.            Sincerely,                                                      Dan Mauer,                                     Director of Government Affairs,      Communications Workers of America (CWA).                                   ____                                              United Steelworkers,                                                   January 31, 2022.      Re United Steelworkers supports H.R. 4521, the America           COMPETES Act of 2022.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the United Steel, Paper       and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied       Industrial and Service Workers International Union (USW), I       write in strong support of the America COMPETES Act of 2022       (H.R. 4521). Passage of this legislation will improve the       country's manufacturing competitiveness, defend American       workers from unfair trade practices, provide them with new       skills, and bolster labor-management cooperation in the       workplace.        The comprehensive work of multiple House Committees has       created a product that will foster leadership in the global       economy, which has seen a rise in state owned enterprises,       dangerously concentrated supply chains, and an over reliance       on the People's Republic of China for critical materials.       H.R. 4521 will bolster U.S. leadership in research,       innovation, and manufacturing by including the following       items.        The Ways and Means Committee pulled together a       comprehensive trade title that sets a path to a worker       centered trade agenda. This includes pro-active trade       enforcement reforms, which USW has supported, by the       inclusion of H.R. 6121--Representative Sewell and Johnson's       trade law update, commonly known as the ``Leveling the       Playing Field Act 2.0''. This legislation will aid domestic       manufacturers and workers in their ability to defend against       illegally dumped and subsidized goods from entering the U.S.       market, and put a better check on China's ``Belt and Road       Initiative''.        The COMPETES Act also improves labor rights accountability       in a reauthorization of  [[Page H822]]       the Generalized System Preference (GSP) program, ensuring       that the tariff preferences we provide to economically       developing countries uplift workers. The legislation also       contains important bills that stops abuse of the United       States' de minimis policy, and better tracks U.S. investment       in China through the bipartisan National Critical       Capabilities Defense Act led by Representatives DeLauro,       Pascrell, Spartz, and Fitzpatrick.        In an increasingly globalized economy, job training for       workers who lost their jobs to overseas competition should be       a priority, and H.R. 4521 improves and upgrades the Trade       Adjustment Assistance program. Without this reauthorization,       workers who lose their job to Chinese competition do not have       access to comprehensive job retraining. The bill also       includes the National Apprenticeship Act of 2022.        The Energy and Commerce Committee's title will provide       significant federal resources to build more resilient supply       chains--incorporation of the bipartisan legislation led by       Representatives Blunt-Rochester, Kinzinger, and Malinowski       will reduce dependence on critical materials from China,       encourage domestic manufacturing expansion with fair       guardrails, and ensure that labor and management cooperate in       the creation of good paying union jobs. When combined with       provisions to increase the domestic solar manufacturing       supply chain, which also has strong labor protection, workers       will be better positioned to benefit from Federal aid to       manufacturers. Improving our domestic supply chain in semi-      conductors is also bolstered through the inclusion of the       CHIPS act.        Bringing labor to the table was also a priority in the       research and innovation title as the National Science       Foundation language in COMPETES will ensure the inclusion of       a worker's perspective through the participation of labor       organizations and workforce training organizations.        Ensuring that the U.S. remains a global competitor as China       continues its rise in the global economy requires labor,       management, and government to work together, uplifting each       other and guaranteeing federal investments are appropriately       deployed. The America COMPETES Act of 2022 does this, and a       vote against this bill is a vote to let our global economic       competitors, like China, win at the expense of America       workers. The USW urges you to support this legislation and       fight for the enactment of its provisions into law.            Sincerely,                                                     Thomas Conway,      International President.                                   ____                                                        Alliance for                                          American Manufacturing,                                   Washington, DC, January 31, 2022.      AAM Supports Passage of the America COMPETES Act of 2022        Dear Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: On       behalf of the Alliance for American Manufacturing (AAM)--a       partnership between some of America's leading manufacturers       and the United Steelworkers--I write in support of the       America COMPETES Act of 2022 (H.R. 4521). This bill       represents one of the most comprehensive efforts in recent       years to invest in America's industrial sector, critical       research capacities, and workers while also providing       modernized tools to level the playing field against       competitors engaged in systematic unfair trade practices. If       enacted, these policies will create jobs, strengthen supply       chains, and make our nation more competitive and better-      equipped to respond to current and future challenges.        The last two years have exposed in rather dramatic fashion       that years of flawed tax, trade, procurement, and other       policies have put the United States in a perilous position of       being overly reliant on imports for everything from personal       protective equipment (PPE) to semiconductors. To this day,       the one-two punch of gutted domestic supply chains and a       dangerous reliance on foreign production is still impacting       Americans in countless ways. We must be better prepared for       the next crisis and that requires taking bold action starting       right away.        Critical Supply Chain Resilience Program. The bill       authorizes $45 billion in federal assistance to support       supply chain resilience and manufacturing of critical goods.       At an October 14, 2021, Energy & Commerce subcommittee       hearing, AAM testified in support of this initiative because       it offers the opportunity to create a long-overdue policy       framework for supply chain security, resiliency, and       revitalization. We also cautioned that policy guardrails       should be added to ensure that this assistance can only be       used for U.S.-based investments and should utilize U.S.-      produced construction inputs. While we appreciate that some       of these concerns have already been addressed, more should be       done to ensure that tax dollars are not used to build up       production capacity offshore when domestic investment should       be the clear priority.        AAM supports adoption of the Garamendi (D-CA) amendment to       apply existing domestic content preferences for iron, steel,       manufactured products, and construction materials to federal       assistance projects funded by the Critical Supply Chain       Resilience Program.        Strategic Transformer Reserve and Resilience Program. The       bill authorizes a new program to reduce the vulnerability of       the electric grid by establishing a Strategic Transformer       Reserve. While the provision aims to ``facilitate the       domestic manufacturing'' of transformers and related critical       grid equipment, it would be improved by giving preference to       U.S.-produced components necessary for transformer       production.        AAM supports adoption of the Lamb (D-PA) amendment to add a       domestic content preference for electrical steel used in       transformer components, a critical input that is at risk due       to predatory trade practices by competitors.        Section 301 Policy. AAM applauds the House bill for       discarding the Senate's deeply flawed provision that would       undermine Section 301 tariffs applied to certain imports from       China. USICA--the Senate version of the bill--includes       language mandating that the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR)       reinstate all exemptions and exclusions to the 301 tariffs       through the end of 2022. Doing so would completely take the       fact-based review process out of USTR's hands while giving       Beijing a free pass in legislation intended to counter       China's predatory economic and trade policies.        AAM is opposed to the Murphy (D-FL) amendment to insert the       Senate's flawed anti-Section 301 provision into the House's       bill.        AAM is opposed to the Kind (D-WI)/DelBene (D-WA) amendment       to express the sense of Congress that USTR should expand       Section 301 exclusions, resulting in increased imports from       China.        Import Security and Fairness Act. The bill includes Rep.       Blumenauer's (D-OR) commonsense reforms to U.S. de minimis       policy, which is routinely exploited to evade U.S.       enforcement actions against competitors engaged in systematic       unfair trade. The bill takes aim at the worst offenders,       while also addressing loopholes used by bad actors to avoid       paying taxes, duties and fees. We strongly encourage the       adoption of these reforms while also ensuring that additional       steps are taken to monitor transshipments and increases in de       minimis volume from other countries.        Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0. The bill includes the       bipartisan, bicameral Sewell (D-AL)/Johnson (R-OH) measure to       modernize our antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD)       trade remedy laws to keep up with unfair trade tactics used       by foreign competition to seize U.S. market share. As we seek       to revitalize our industrial base and grow our economy, these       commonsense updates to our trade enforcement tools will       support domestic manufacturers and American workers facing       predatory and unfair imports.        National Critical Capabilities Defense Act. The bill       includes the bipartisan, bicameral DeLauro (D-CT)/Pascrell       (D-NJ)/Spartz (R-IN)/Fitzpatrick (R-PA) measure to establish       an outbound investment review process designed to avert the       offshoring of production capacity in critical U.S. sectors to       foreign adversaries. By creating additional visibility into       supply chains, this legislation establishes mechanisms to       ensure that our national security is not undermined by the       outsourcing of these ``national critical capabilities.'' The       provision provides necessary tools in the event that a       national security risk is identified.        The America COMPETES Act presents a valuable opportunity to       take concrete steps to strengthen domestic manufacturing,       rebuild critical supply chains, and strengthen the tools       available to counter unfair trade. Thank you for your support       of American manufacturing.            Sincerely,                                                  Scott N. Paul,                                    President, Alliance for American                                                     Manufacturing.
