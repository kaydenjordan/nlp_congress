 Mr. Speaker, in my hometown of Albany,  Georgia, four of my neighbors lost their lives due to the tornadoes and  storms that tore through our city. Many more in both Albany and the  larger region had their homes destroyed and their lives upended.   For the second time this month, our region has confronted the worst  that Mother Nature had to offer. However, I am confident that, with the  grace of God, we will continue to see the best in human nature as we  come together as a community to support each other during these very,  very trying times.   I ask that the Members of this House, the Senate, and the  administration join my colleagues from Mississippi and Georgia to  ensure that all of those impacted by these disasters are provided the  necessary resources to recover and to rebuild their lives as soon as  possible.   In this moment, though it is but a small gesture, given the magnitude  of the disaster, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence to  recognize and remember the victims of the storms and tornadoes that  struck the Southeast region of our Nation.                            ____________________
