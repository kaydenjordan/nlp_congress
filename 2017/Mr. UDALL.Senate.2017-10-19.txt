 Mr. President, this amendment calls for legislation to  fully and permanently fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program.  Senator Heinrich and I have long called for this solution. Rural  counties in New Mexico and other States across the West and across the  country have large amounts of Federal lands within their boundaries.  These counties rely on funding from the PILT Program to provide better  schools, maintain roads and bridges, and support thousands of local  jobs.   We currently fund PILT year by year. I have fought for this funding  as a member of the Appropriations Committee, but we need to do more. We  need to pass permanent funding to ensure that local communities can  count on our resources being there every year to provide basic  services. I urge support for the Udall-Heinrich amendment and yield  back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?   The Senator from Wyoming.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
