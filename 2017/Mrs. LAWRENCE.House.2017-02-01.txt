 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.J.  Res. 38. This rule is a much-needed update to existing mining  regulations. It ensures that communities that reside by mining  operations monitor water pollution levels.   I am standing here today to continue to speak up and fight for clean  water in  [[Page H842]]  America. I promised that I would stand up and make sure that never  again in America another community would be poisoned by the water. I  say to you, Mr. Speaker, that miners deserve clean water as well.   This resolution monitors drinking water sources for pollution, such  as lead and other toxic substances, and provides that information to  the public. Have we learned something from Flint, Mr. Speaker?   This rule will also help protect land and forests by ensuring that  companies restore the land and water sources that were impacted by a  precious occupation in our country, and that is mining operations.   Let's defeat this resolution that prohibits commonsense rulemaking,  protects the environment, and protects the rights of Americans to have  access to clean, safe drinking water, while also creating jobs.
