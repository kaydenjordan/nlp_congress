 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Kathie  Green, a member of my staff and a trailblazer in the field of  constituent services.   Kathie will be retiring next week after 13 years of service to  northeast Indiana and the congressional office of the Third District.  She was originally hired by former Congressman Mark Souder. She worked  for former Congressman Marlin Stutzman and has worked for me for my  entire time in Congress as well.   More than anything, Kathie has an uncommon passion for helping others  in need, and that passion was perhaps most evident during the initial  outbreak of the coronavirus last year. She made hundreds of phone calls  every week to help those who needed it most during a very difficult  time, and that is what she did for 13 years.   Today, I want to pay tribute to her for her distinguished career in  service to our district. Thank you, Kathie Green.                            ____________________
