 Mr. Speaker, every day there are more stories about the  Affordable Care Act's, or ObamaCare's, ongoing collapse.   Insurers have been dropping out of the ACA's markets for 3 years now.  It is estimated that two out of every five, or 40 percent, of all  counties in the country will have only one insurer on the exchanges,  and many markets may soon have none at all.   The House passed compromise legislation to provide the American  people, especially those in the individual market, with more  flexibility and choice and fewer Washington mandates, all while putting  Medicaid, a critical safety net program, on a sustainable path.   Critics of this legislation have responded with hyperbolic,  irresponsible rhetoric, and no solutions, other than higher taxes, more  spending, and more Washington control.   Some ACA defenders are actually calling for a single-payer system,  which would result in unbearably high taxes, even tighter grips from  Washington, and unsustainable spending. It would destroy innovation,  create scarcity, degrade quality, and drive up costs. Even the liberal  California legislator seems to have abandoned the single-payer fantasy  this week.   Instead of careening toward single payer, let's keep the promises we  made to repeal and replace ObamaCare and meet the expectations of those  who sent us here.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for kindly yielding  and allowing me to take a few minutes to have a little bit of  reflection with the American people as we head into the Fourth of July  weekend.   Mr. Speaker, despite widespread cynicism from Washington elites and  those in the media, the 115th Congress and President Trump have taken  meaningful action over the past 6 months to improve the lives of  hardworking Americans.   According to a recent analysis, this Congress has been the most  productive in the modern era. By June 8, we had passed 158 bills,  compared to the 60 bills by the 103rd Congress under Bill Clinton, 67  bills by the 107th Congress under President Bush, and 131 bills by the  111th Congress under President Obama.   President Trump has signed 39 bills into law, including 14 bills  passed under the Congressional Review Act, stopping harmful regulations  handed down by the previous administration. According to one analysis,  repealing these rules could save the economy millions of hours of  paperwork, nearly $4 billion in regulatory costs to the Federal  agencies, and an astounding $35 billion in regulatory costs for the  private sector.   We sent to the President, and he signed, legislation to bring  accountability to the Veterans Administration. And the House has acted  to stop ObamaCare's job and freedom-crushing mandates, and acted to put  a critical safety net program on a sustainable path.   The House also voted to repeal and replace Washington's Financial  Control Law, Dodd-Frank, to get capital flowing to our small businesses  and to improve choices for consumers.   The past 6 months have been a strong start, and I look forward to the  House continuing its work to advance important goals of strengthening  our economy and creating jobs.                      Celebrating Our Nation's Birthday     Mr. Speaker, every year at this time, our Nation  celebrates our birthday. It is the perfect time to reflect on the  founding of our country and the principles that made our Nation  exceptional.                                time  1800    At the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, President  Kennedy, in his inaugural address, reflected on our founding  principles.   JFK said: ``And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our  forebears fought are still at issue around the globe--the belief that  the rights of man come not from the generosity of the State, but from  the hand of God.''   President Kennedy understood the words of our Declaration of  Independence: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men  are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain  unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness.''   A little more than 100 years before President Kennedy's inauguration,  our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln, defended the Declaration and  taught all those around him, as well as future generations, how to  revere and embrace unwaveringly the sacred and transcendent truths  expressed in this monumental document.   Lincoln said in 1858: ``Now, my countrymen, if you have been taught  doctrines conflicting with the great landmarks of the Declaration of  Independence, if you have listened to suggestions which would take away  from its grandeur, and mutilate the fair symmetry of its proportions;  if you have been inclined to believe that all men are not created equal  in those inalienable rights enumerated by our chart of liberty, let me  entreat you to come back. Think nothing of me, take no thought for the  political fate of any man whomsoever, but come back to the truths that  are in the Declaration of Independence. You may do anything with me you  choose, if you will but heed these sacred principles.''   Today, Mr. Speaker, let us recommit to the principles set forth in  our Declaration, that all are endowed by your Creator with certain  unalienable rights, among them the right to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness. And let those who have admired the leaders of our  country who have reasserted these principles, from Lincoln to Kennedy,  join together and continue to fight for the protection of these God- given rights, especially the first right, ``the right to life.''   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak. I  thank the gentleman from Iowa for having extended to me this  opportunity to share these thoughts with the American people.
