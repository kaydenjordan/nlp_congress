 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in  opposing Congressman Tom Price's nomination to be the Secretary of the  Department of Health and Human Services.   Every American deserves the opportunity to have quality, affordable  health insurance coverage to help them live healthy and productive  lives. Having health care is not just critical to the freedom, dignity,  and well-being of our citizens but also to the strength of our economy.   As Governor, I worked with Democrats and Republicans in New Hampshire  to expand health insurance coverage--including coverage for substance  use disorder and behavioral health services--to tens of thousands of  Granite Staters.   We need to bring this same bipartisan approach to the Senate. We know  that there are serious challenges in our health care system that must  be fixed, and we need to work across party lines to support commonsense  improvements to move our Nation's health care system forward, not rip  health insurance coverage away from millions of Americans.   This is why I cannot support Congressman Price's nomination.  Throughout his time in office, Congressman Price has promoted policies  that would undermine the health care that so many in my State and  across our Nation depend on. Congressman Price wants to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, which would strip coverage away from millions of  Americans. Those who seek to repeal the ACA, including Congressman  Price, have not come up with a plan to replace it.   Repealing the ACA without a replacement would send insurance markets  reeling. It would be devastating for millions of people who have  coverage because of the law.   Repealing the ACA would eliminate New Hampshire's bipartisan Medicaid  expansion plan, harming our State's efforts to combat the heroin,  fentanyl, and opioid crisis. This crisis is the most pressing public  health and public safety challenge facing our State, and thousands of  Granite Staters have accessed substance misuse treatment because of  Medicaid expansion.   Just a couple of weeks ago, I met a young man named Noah at Harbor  Homes in Nashua. Noah is an active participant in the Nashua drug court  and a former enrollee in our Medicaid expansion program.   Last month, after 14 years of struggling with addiction, Noah was  celebrating 1 year sober. Because of legislation that expanded  Medicaid, passed under bipartisan leadership, Noah received health  insurance through Medicaid expansion, and he was able to quickly begin  treatment.   Noah's recovery process required medication-assisted treatment which  he would not have been able to afford had it not been covered under  Medicaid. He is now 5 months off that treatment and hasn't had an  instance of relapse.   Noah said the ACA and Medicaid expansion are ``working miracles every  single day in this recovery community.'' For Noah and so many others,  we cannot afford to set back our efforts, but that is what the repeal  of the ACA would do.   I also oppose Congressman Price because he is determined to turn back  the clock on women's access to reproductive health care. He has fought  against the woman's constitutionally protected right to make her own  health care decisions and control her own destiny. He has voted 10  times to defund Planned Parenthood, and he has voted against a  resolution to protect employees from being punished or fired by their  employers for their reproductive health decisions.   And I oppose Congressman Price because he has pushed to turn Medicare  into a voucher program, which will increase costs for seniors.  Congressman Price's views and priorities are simply at odds and out of  touch with the views and priorities of many, many Granite Staters.   Additionally, Mr. President, serious issues have been raised  throughout this nomination process regarding Congressman Price's  conflicts of interest and his potential violation of the STOCK Act,  including recent reports suggesting that he received a private discount  to purchase a health company stock while engaged in legislative efforts  that would directly affect the company's financial interests.  Congressman Price's insufficient responses concerning his stock  purchases raise the question of whether, if confirmed, he will put  corporate interests ahead of the American people. That is unacceptable.  I believe we need a health care system that works for every American,  and that is why I will vote against Congressman Price's confirmation.   I want to talk a little bit more about what Congressman Price's  confirmation would do with respect to Medicaid expansion and  particularly how it would affect the opioid crisis in New Hampshire. In  New Hampshire, we proved that Democrats and Republicans can come  together to move our health care system forward when we passed our  Bipartisan Medicaid Expansion Program. Passing and reauthorizing this  program included healthy debate, and at times some argument, but what  matters of course is what we do after our argument, after those  debates. We were able in New Hampshire to put our differences aside and  take a critical step forward to continue strengthening our families,  our businesses, and our economy. This is the approach we need to be  taking in the United States Senate.   The benefits of Medicaid expansion are clear, over 50,000 Granite  Staters are now covered in a population of 1.3 million people. We  included in Medicaid expansion coverage of substance use disorder and  behavioral health services. I have heard story after story of Granite  Staters who are in recovery, thanks to Medicaid expansion. I told  Noah's story just a few minutes ago.   At another round table I met a young woman named Ashley at the Farnum  Center in Manchester, CT. Ashley told of suffering from addiction for  over 10 years. One day she woke up to discover that her husband had  died of an overdose. She lost custody of her young daughter, but  because of Medicaid expansion, Ashley was able to get treatment. She  has been in recovery now for a little bit over a year--recovery through  medical treatment made possible by Medicaid expansion. Because she is  in recovery, she was able to get a job. Because she began working  again, she actually has now moved off Medicaid expansion onto private  health insurance. So Medicaid expansion was there when she needed it to  get healthy. Now she doesn't need it anymore, and she is participating  in the private health insurance market. By the way, she is beginning to  reestablish her relationship with her young son. That is the power of  the Affordable Care Act. That is the power of Medicaid expansion.  [[Page S1064]]    Representative Price, on the other hand, has advocated for repeal of  these very programs. Such a repeal would have such harmful impacts,  pulling the rug out from those who have coverage right now for critical  medical conditions. At his confirmation hearing, Representative Price  declined to guarantee that Americans with substance use disorders who  got on insurance through Medicaid expansion would still be covered for  these services if the Affordable Care Act is repealed under  Representative Price's leadership.   He also would not commit to continuing the requirement under the  Affordable Care Act that health insurance companies must cover  essential health benefits, including treatment for substance abuse.   Representative Price's support for the repeal of the Affordable Care  Act also requires more discussion. The Affordable Care Act has helped  families across our Nation access quality, affordable health insurance  coverage. We need to come together now and find bipartisan areas in  which we can agree to improve the law, but we should not be repealing  it. We should not be taking coverage away from millions of people. I  have joined a number of my colleagues in expressing our willingness to  work across the aisle with our colleagues to improve the law, but  unfortunately it seems our colleagues in the Senate are headed down a  path to repeal the law without a plan to replace it. Repealing the ACA  without any replacement is a recipe for upheaval and instability, a  recipe for hurting our families, small businesses, and our economic  progress. Representative Price and those who seek to repeal this law  have not agreed on any path forward other than repealing and stripping  coverage away from millions of Americans. Repealing would have major  consequences for many Granite State families and small businesses.   My office has heard from constituents about the impact the Affordable  Care Act has had on their lives. One resident from Keene, NH, wrote to  say this law has helped fulfill his goal of starting a small business.  He wrote:         I have had health insurance through the exchange under the       ACA since late 2015, when I quit my job to start up a       business. Before the ACA, I wouldn't have taken the risk to       start a business, because I have a preexisting condition and       I wouldn't have been able to get an individual       health insurance policy.    He continued:         Under the ACA, I am able to get good health insurance at an       affordable premium. Since I left my job I built up a       profitable business and expect to be in a position to hire       employees within a year or two. None of this would have been       possible without the ACA.    And he added:         If the ACA is repealed, I am concerned that I will need to       put my business on hold in order to go back to a corporate       job that I don't need, only to get the health care benefits.       The ACA has flaws, but overall it has allowed me to take an       entrepreneurial risk and start a small successful business.    It is clear that this law has truly made a difference not just for  the health of our citizens but also for our economy, and we cannot  undermine the progress we have made.   I am also deeply concerned about Representative Price's record and  his statements concerning women's health care. Representative Price has  consistently opposed women's reproductive freedom. I have always fought  to protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions and to  chart her own course, and I always will. This is not just a matter of  individual freedom, which of course is a good enough reason in its own  right to support women's reproductive choice, but it is also a matter  of economics. When women have to pay more for their health care than  men do, it puts them at a financial disadvantage.   As Governor, I restored family planning funds and pushed to restore  State funding to Planned Parenthood because I know how critical these  services are for the women and families of my State. It is unacceptable  that Washington Republicans continue to play games with women's health,  and Representative Price has been at the forefront of that effort.  Representative Price does not support a woman's constitutionally  protected right to a safe and legal abortion. He has cosponsored and  repeatedly voted for measures that would ban all medically appropriate  abortions, without exceptions for rape, incest, or to protect a woman's  health. He has voted to penalize small businesses that choose private  health plans that include abortion coverage. Additionally, he has voted  to allow employers to discriminate against employees based on their  reproductive health decisions. He voted to eliminate the Title X Family  Planning Program. He voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood.   Defunding Planned Parenthood, a critical health provider, would have  devastating effects. A recent article in the Washington Post  highlighted the impact of what can happen when legislatures attempt to  defund Planned Parenthood.   This report in the post found:         In 2011, the Texas legislature cut the two-year budget for       funding family planning from $111 million to $38 million in       an effort to defund Planned Parenthood. After these cuts, 82       Texas family planning clinics, one out of every four in the       state--closed or stopped providing family planning services.       An unintended consequence of the law was that two-thirds of       the clinics that closed were not even Planned Parenthood       clinics. Organizations that remained open, many with reduced       hours, were often unable to offer the most effective methods       of contraception, such as IUDs and contraceptive implants, to       women who wanted them. The closings and reduced hours also       limited or cut back access to primary care providers for a       significant number of women.    Women and their families deserve better than an HHS Secretary who  would disregard their constitutional right and roll back their access  to reproductive health care. They deserve better than an HHS Secretary  who appears to believe that women are neither capable nor trusted to  make their own health care decisions. I believe women should be full  and free citizens in the United States of America and can be trusted to  make their own health care decisions.   Representative Price's nomination and his confirmation would be  harmful to our seniors as well. Seniors deserve a high quality of life,  high-quality care, and access to the benefits that they have earned  throughout their life. I believe we must continue to strengthen and  protect Medicare for years to come, not undermine it. Unfortunately,  Representative Price has long sought to undermine Medicare and the  important benefits it provides to seniors. His budget proposals have  included extreme cuts to the program. He supports turning Medicare into  a voucher program. In fact, he even said he wants to voucherize  Medicare within the first 6 to 8 months of the Trump administration.  This would increase costs for seniors.   He has also repeatedly opposed allowing Medicare to negotiate drug  prices for seniors. He has argued that seniors have no drug cost  problem. Imagine that, a Health and Human Services Secretary who  believes that drug costs are not an issue for our seniors. He even said  allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for prescription drugs would be  ``a solution in search of a problem.''   I can tell Representative Price that there are certainly seniors in  New Hampshire who have found that the cost of their prescription drugs  are truly a problem, and as we talk about the need to shore up and  strengthen the Medicare Program, one of the best ways to stabilize its  finances would be to allow Medicare to negotiate for prescription drug  prices to lower those prices, lower the cost of the program, while  making the program even more affordable for our seniors.   That is not something that Representative Price has even expressed a  willingness to consider because he doesn't even acknowledge there is a  problem. Representative Price has also supported raising the Medicare  age from 65 to 67. This amounts to a devastating benefit cut for  seniors, shifting costs onto them, which is unacceptable.   Whenever I hear people suggesting raising the retirement age for  Social Security or the age for Medicare eligibility, I am reminded of  my father-in-law. My father-in-law was one of the hardest working  people I ever knew. He worked as a wholesale meat cutter, and for  anybody who has never seen what that means, it means standing on your  feet for hours at a time in a cold meat locker as large carcasses come  through, and with time pressures, the way any production facility has,  cutting those carcasses into salable product.   My father-in-law left the house before dark. He often came home,  having  [[Page S1065]]  been assigned overtime, after dark, having been standing on his feet in  the cold, doing incredibly hard, physical labor.   When it came time for him to retire, when he became eligible for  Medicare, he really couldn't have worked at that job much longer. And  the fact that he had a dignified retirement after those years of hard  work was in large part due to Medicare. Before the physical impacts of  that job slowed him down, it was our great pleasure to watch a man who  had provided for his family with such hard work know the dignity of  playing with his grandchildren, sleeping in until 7:30 or 8 in the  morning, and watching his family grow and strengthen and thrive.   That is the dignity of Medicare. It is the dignity of Social  Security. And to have a Health and Human Services Secretary who  believes we should just be raising that age, as Representative Price  does, contradicts the very notion of what it means to earn a benefit  and to know a dignified retirement.   I am proud of the progress we have made to help ensure that more  Granite Staters and Americans have the quality health care they need at  an affordable cost. There is much more work to do to move our health  care system forward and to combat the heroin opioid and fentanyl crisis  that has devastated far too many families in New Hampshire and across  our Nation. I am ready and willing to work with anyone who is serious  about making improvements to our health care system to improve  affordability and access to care, but that does not start with pulling  the rug out for millions of Americans. It does not start with rolling  back women's access to critical health care services.   Congressman Price's record demonstrates that he puts a partisan  agenda and corporate interests before the health and economic well- being of our families. The American people deserve a Secretary of  Health and Human Services who will help more Americans receive quality,  affordable health insurance coverage, not one who supports stripping it  away by repealing the Affordable Care Act without a replacement.   For these reasons, I will be voting no on Congressman Price's  nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to ask my colleagues  to join me in recognizing and congratulating Chief Alexander Scott on  his many years of remarkable service to the city of Claremont and the  State of New Hampshire. As the Claremont Police Department's chief of  police, Chief Scott has worked tirelessly to ensure the safety and  security of the Claremont community. The State of New Hampshire owes  him a debt of gratitude for his service.   Chief Scott's history with the Claremont Police Department dates back  to a summer internship in 1989 when he was a member of the corps of  cadets at Norwich University, the military college of Vermont. Shortly  after finishing his internship, Chief Scott was hired part-time as a  special officer. He finished his degree requirements early and enrolled  in the New Hampshire full time police academy during his final semester  at Norwich. Upon graduating magna cum laude from Norwich and completing  the police academy, Chief Scott started in the Claremont Police  Department's patrol division. Two years later, he transferred to the  criminal division and rose to the level of assistant department  prosecutor, igniting his passion for law.   Chief Scott left the department to attend the Franklin Pierce Law  Center. In his first year, he married his wife Kathryn, with whom he  has two daughters, Hannah and Elyse. As a lawyer, Chief Scott continued  to support his community as the assistant county attorney for Sullivan  County. He remained in that position until 2003 when he returned to the  Claremont Police Department as the chief of police, a role in which he  has served for over a decade. As chief, he has not only worked to  preserve the peace and protect the law, but he has also inspired future  generations of public servants through his professorship at River  Valley Community College and at his own alma mater, Norwich University.  Chief Scott will now retire from the police department and return to  practicing law as he joins the criminal division of the New Hampshire  Attorney General's office.   Claremont and all of New Hampshire have benefitted greatly from Chief  Scott's devotion and leadership. On behalf of my colleagues and the  U.S. Congress, I thank Chief Alexander Scott for his unceasing  commitment to protecting his community and for his continued service to  our State as he moves into his new position with the New Hampshire  Attorney General's office.                            ____________________
