 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the city of  Murray, Kentucky, home of Murray State University, for its recent  distinction as one of the top 50 safest college towns in America.  Murray is a beacon of educational excellence and is an invaluable asset  to the First Congressional District of Kentucky.   Through analysis of violent crime rates across the Nation, SafeWise,  a safety-focused consumer research firm, found that Murray exhibited  exceptionally low crime rates. This finding further highlights an  already notable community in my district.   I applaud the work Murray has done to achieve this recognition and  commend Murray State University on the collegial environment it has  developed for its more than 8,000 students. When students come to  Murray State, they not only join the academic community, but they also  become citizens of the entire Murray family.   Once again, I congratulate the residents and leaders of Murray on  this award and urge them to continue their tradition of excellence.                            ____________________
