 Madam Speaker, yesterday during the debate on guns,  Representative Jordan and a few others on the Republican side said that  the Second Amendment and the right to guns was a God-given right.   I don't know anything in the Old Testament where God spoke to guns. I  do know He spoke to Moses and gave him the Ten Commandments and said  nothing about AR-15s or guns. But He said: Thou shall not kill.   In the New Testament I don't think Jesus said anything about guns or  AR-15s, but He did say: You shall beat your swords into plowshares.   We are all created in the image of God, and I am sure God would not  like His powers, His name, and His authority used to endorse the  killing of young people through weapons that he was allegedly giving,  AR-15s. God would look askance at that type of logic.   God bless America.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, since the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut,  about 10 years ago, we have not enacted any substantive firearm  restrictions to prevent children from being slaughtered in our schools.   In fact, not since the massacre of first graders and their educators  at Sandy Hook, but in the 20 years since the shooting at Columbine, we  have not enacted any new meaningful restrictions on firearms.   We have an obligation to protect our constituents, and we have a  responsibility to keep the American people safe.   After each of these instances, we hear from our friends across the  aisle that we must address mental health. I agree. But we must prevent  those who are intent on harming themselves or others from having access  to dangerous weapons and carrying out their intent.   That is why I support this thoughtful proposal balancing public  safety and the individual's right to due process.   Let's just take the massacre in Uvalde. Should there have been a law  in place in Texas, a red flag law, perhaps the gunman could have been  stopped. There were plenty of warning signs, including the gunman with  pictures of a cat he had killed and his frequent online threats to teen  girls.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights,  and Civil Liberties, I take the due process clause seriously. In this  legislation, a court would need to make an individualized  determination, looking at specific facts before issuing an order. A  full hearing is required in 72 hours, where the party can have personal  attendance and object.   This legislation is absolutely necessary, and I urge all my  colleagues to support it. We have a moral obligation to act.   Yesterday, this body, with a bipartisan vote, adopted the Protecting  Our Kids Act, which would make meaningful updates to our Nation's gun  laws. We must go further, I believe, and reenact the assault weapons  bans.   These bills would make a meaningful difference in gun violence in the  United States and save American lives. God would not look kindly upon  the use of weapons to kill his children, as happened in Uvalde, Texas.   Our votes are not political calculations; they are obligations. We  have a duty to protect God's children.
