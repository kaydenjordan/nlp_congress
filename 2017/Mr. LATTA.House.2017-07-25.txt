 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I, too,  would like to express my sympathies to Mary and all the Regula family  on Ralph's passing.   I got to know Ralph a long time ago because my dad served here for 30  years. Dad was elected in 1958, Ralph was elected in 1972, and toward  the end of their terms that they were here together--of course, Ralph  served on for 36 years--their offices were very close to one another. I  know that in those days sometimes you had a little more time than we  seem to have today, but folks could actually go to one another's office  and sit down and chat. I know that Dad and Ralph were very good  friends.    What has been said by my other colleagues is true; Ralph worked hard.  He served his district well, he worked hard, he did his job, he served  the people of his district, and he served the people of this country.   At all times, though, he always was a gentleman. I know that for a  fact because I know that when I was younger, I always liked to be able  to come here with my dad, I was able to sit in a lot of meetings, and  Ralph was an incredible individual.   One of the things that my dad always said was that there was always a  difference in life between people who wanted to be politicians and  public servants. Dad said that it was very simple: A politician is a  person who sees how much they can take from the people they represent  for their own benefit, while public servants see how much they can give  of themselves to the people they represent. Ralph did this over and  over and over again, giving of himself.   Marcia and I do want to express our regret to Mary and all of Ralph's  family on his passing because, again, we have lost a great friend, a  great colleague, and it is tough to say goodbye.
