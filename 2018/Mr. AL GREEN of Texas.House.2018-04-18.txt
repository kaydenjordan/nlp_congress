 Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise to speak from  the well of the House of Representatives.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I would call to our attention the fact that there  is a time when we should put all politics aside. This is such an  occasion, Mr. Speaker.   I rise today to extend my condolences and sympathies to the Bush  family. I rise today, Mr. Speaker, because I want the world to know  that I have great respect for the family.   Politics aside, Mr. Speaker, Ms. Barbara Bush, the First Lady--not  currently, but in my world, once a First Lady, always a First Lady. I  rise because this First Lady demonstrated something that this country  can be proud of.   She was a person who has left a legacy of respectability as it  relates to being a First Lady of the United States of America. She  respected herself. She had standards. She had principles. She had  boundaries. There were certain things that she wouldn't do and would  not allow to be done while she was in the White House. Respectability:  she respected others which engendered respect for her.   I rise because she will be missed. I rise because she has left this  legacy of respectability.   I also rise because, as a neophyte newly elected to Congress, I  received an indication that her husband wanted to speak to me. I went  over to speak to him. I had no idea as to why he would ask for an  opportunity to visit with me, but I did visit with him. I thought it  would be a 5-minute meeting. It went much longer than 5 minutes.   He obviously was in one party and I in another. We did not know each  other, but we spoke at length. The thing that I remember as we were  bringing our meeting to closure, I remember his calling to my attention  that one of my greatest challenges in Congress would be to develop an  agenda for myself.   There are many people who will have agendas for you. The great  challenge in Congress is to develop your own agenda. So on my agenda, I  want my record to show that I stood in the well of the Congress of the  United States of America to thank the First Lady, Ms. Barbara Bush, for  her service to her family, to her country, and indeed to the world.                            ____________________
