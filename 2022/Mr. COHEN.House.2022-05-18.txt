 Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, what is the rule for having a vote not be  done by voice vote but have to go to the floor for a recorded vote? Is  it not a majority of the group necessary to have a hearing? The  majority of a quorum, it is 20 percent of the quorum, I believe.    Mr. Speaker, my understanding is the rules require 20  percent of a quorum to be present to request and have a vote be done by  the yeas and nays. Is that not accurate?    Mr. Speaker, on demand?    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2992), to direct the Attorney General to develop crisis  intervention training tools for use by first responders related to  interacting with persons who have a traumatic brain injury, another  form of acquired brain injury, or post-traumatic stress disorder, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2992         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Traumatic Brain Injury and       Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Law Enforcement Training Act''       or the ``TBI and PTSD Law Enforcement Training Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention, there were approximately 2.9 million traumatic       brain injury-related emergency department visits,       hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States in 2014.        (2) Effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) can be short-      term or long-term, and include impaired thinking or memory,       movement, vision or hearing, or emotional functioning, such       as personality changes or depression.        (3) Currently, between 3.2 million and 5.3 million persons       are living with a TBI-related disability in the United       States.        (4) About 7 or 8 percent of Americans will experience post-      traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at some point in their       lives, and about 8 million adults have PTSD during the course       of a given year.        (5) TBI and PTSD have been recognized as the signature       injuries of the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.        (6) According to the Department of Defense, 383,000 men and       women deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan sustained a brain       injury while in the line of duty between 2000 and 2018.        (7) Approximately 13.5 percent of Operations Iraqi Freedom       and Enduring Freedom veterans screen positive for PTSD,       according to the Department of Veteran Affairs.        (8) About 12 percent of Gulf War Veterans have PTSD in a       given year while about 30 percent of Vietnam Veterans have       had PTSD in their lifetime.        (9) Physical signs of TBI can include motor impairment,       dizziness or poor balance, slurred speech, impaired depth       perception, or impaired verbal memory, while physical signs       of PTSD can include agitation, irritability, hostility,       hypervigilance, self-destructive behavior, fear, severe       anxiety, or mistrust.        (10) Physical signs of TBI and PTSD often overlap with       physical signs of alcohol or drug impairment, which       complicate a first responder's ability to quickly and       effectively identify an individual's condition.       SEC. 3. CREATION OF A TBI AND PTSD TRAINING FOR FIRST                     RESPONDERS.         Part HH of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10651 et seq.) is amended--        (1) in section 2991--        (A) in subsection (h)(1)(A), by inserting before the period       at the end the following: ``, including the training       developed under section 2993''; and        (B) in subsection (o), by amending paragraph (1) to read as       follows:        ``(1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated       to the Department of Justice to carry out this section       $54,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027.'';       and        (2) by inserting after section 2992 the following new       section:       ``SEC. 2993. CREATION OF A TBI AND PTSD TRAINING FOR FIRST                     RESPONDERS.         ``(a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date       of the enactment of this section, the Attorney General,       acting through the Director of the Bureau of Justice       Assistance, in consultation with the Director of the Centers       for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant       Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, shall solicit       best practices regarding techniques to interact with persons       who have a traumatic brain injury, an acquired brain injury,       or post-traumatic stress disorder from first responder, brain       injury, veteran, and mental health organizations, health care       and mental health providers, hospital emergency departments,       and other relevant stakeholders, and shall develop crisis       intervention training tools for use by first responders (as       such term is defined in section 3025) that provide--        ``(1) information on the conditions and symptoms of a       traumatic brain injury, an acquired brain injury, and post-      traumatic stress disorder;        ``(2) techniques to interact with persons who have a       traumatic brain injury, an acquired brain injury, or post-      traumatic stress disorder; and        ``(3) information on how to recognize persons who have a       traumatic brain injury, an acquired brain injury, or post-      traumatic stress disorder.        ``(b) Use of Training Tools at Law Enforcement Mental       Health Learning Sites.--The Attorney General shall ensure       that not less than one Law Enforcement Mental Health Learning       Site designated by the Director of the Bureau of Justice       Assistance uses the training tools developed under subsection       (a).        ``(c) Police Mental Health Collaboration Toolkit.--The       Attorney General shall make the training tools developed       under subsection (a) available as part of the Police-Mental       Health Collaboration Toolkit provided by the Bureau of       Justice Assistance.''.       SEC. 4. STUDY ON FIRST RESPONDERS WITH TBI.         Not later than 24 months after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting       through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention and the Director of the National Institutes of       Health and in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and       the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall conduct a study and       submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education,       Labor and Pensions of the Senate a report on the prevalence       and incidence of concussion among first responders (as such       term is defined in section 3025 of the Omnibus Crime Control       and Safe Street Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10705)). The report       shall include data on the incidence of concussion among first       responders and recommendations for resources for first       responders who have experienced traumatic brain injury.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2992.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2992, the TBI and PTSD Law Enforcement Training  Act, is bipartisan legislation that would require the Department of  Justice to develop crisis intervention training tools for law  enforcement training agencies so that they can better equip officers to  respond to individuals with traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic  stress disorder.   This is important for the training of law enforcement officials. When  I was out of law school, my first job as attorney for the police in  Memphis, and for 3\1/2\ years I taught the police in the training  academy. This was not part of our training, and it should have been. It  was before we got woke, and now that we are woke, we should stay woke,  and teach officers about this problem and have them be able to identify  it.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between  3.2 million and 5.3 million people live with a traumatic brain injury- related disability in the United States, and approximately 7 percent of  Americans will experience such a disorder at some point in their lives.  These illnesses are especially common among veterans and  servicemembers.   Despite the prevalence of TBI and PTSD, many law enforcement  officers, and other first responders, are still not adequately trained  on how to identify these symptoms. Since many symptoms of traumatic  brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder, such as confusion,  impaired thinking, or irritability, can be mistaken for intoxication  and aggression. Law enforcement can misinterpret the behavior of some  people exhibiting those symptoms and deadly consequences could follow  for first responders and the people they encounter.   This legislation would help ensure that officers are trained to  identify those symptoms in order to respond appropriately to crisis  calls and to divert individuals toward mental healthcare and treatment  and away from the criminal justice system.   Through the Bureau of Justice Assistance, agencies have access to  training and resources from the Police Mental Health Collaboration  toolkit. H.R. 2992 would enhance the existing program to include crisis  intervention training on recognizing the signs of these illnesses and  responding to the individuals in crisis.   It requires the CDC to also study occurrences of concussion and TBI  among law enforcement officers and first responders; many of whom  suffer from this, and they need to be given treatment, if they are.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Pascrell, who is the leader of  the Law Enforcement Caucus and a strong voice for law enforcement. I  also thank Mr. Bacon and Mrs. Demings, a law enforcement chief, I  believe, and Mr. Rutherford, a sheriff, for their dedication to law  enforcement, first responders, and the citizens they serve.   This important bipartisan legislation is broadly supported by  numerous law enforcement and mental health organizations and would help  protect the lives of first responders and the people they encounter.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the honorable,  distinguished, and learned gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).     Mr. Speaker, in closing, I ask everybody to support this  important legislation for law enforcement and for mental health. Vote  ``aye''. No roll call.  [[Page H5119]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1125), condemning rising antisemitism, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1125         Whereas the Jewish-American experience is a story of faith,       fortitude, and progress and is connected to key tenets of       American identity;        Whereas generations of Jewish people have come to this       Nation fleeing oppression, discrimination, and persecution in       search of a better life for themselves and their children;        Whereas these Jewish Americans have created lives for       themselves and their families and played indispensable roles       in our Nation's civic and community life, making invaluable       contributions to our Nation through their leadership and       achievements;        Whereas, on August 21, 1790, President George Washington       sent a letter to the Hebrew Congregation of Newport, Rhode       Island, expressing that the newly formed United States would       be a Nation that ``gives to bigotry no sanction, to       persecution no assistance'' and that the Jewish people should       ``dwell in this land [and] continue to merit and enjoy the       good will of the other inhabitants . . . and there shall be       none to make him afraid.'';        Whereas we should acknowledge and celebrate the crucial       contributions that Jewish Americans have made to our       collective struggle for a more just and fair society, leading       movements for justice and equality, and working to ensure       opportunities for all;        Whereas alongside this narrative of achievement and       opportunity, there is also a history, far older than the       Nation itself, of racism, bigotry, and other forms of       prejudice manifesting in the scourge of antisemitism;        Whereas antisemitism is an insidious form of prejudice       stretching back millennia that attacks the humanity of the       Jewish people and has led to violence, destruction of lives       and communities, and genocide;        Whereas conspiracy theories that Jews are uniquely evil and       influential has led to mass killings of Jews throughout time,       including the poisonous Nazi ideology that resulted in the       murder of 6,000,000 Jews, including 1,500,000 Jewish       children, and millions of other victims of the Nazis in       Europe;        Whereas over the course of the past decade, Holocaust       distortion and denial has grown in intensity;        Whereas a 2020 survey of all 50 States in the United States       on Holocaust knowledge among Millennials and Gen Z conducted       by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany       (Claims Conference), found a clear lack of awareness of key       historical facts; 63 percent of respondents did not know that       6,000,000 Jews were murdered during the Holocaust and 36       percent thought that ``two million or fewer Jews'' were       killed;        Whereas there is a documented and dangerous rise of       antisemitism globally and in the United States, where Jews       are increasingly affected by the grotesque spread of       misinformation and lies including blame for the spread of       COVID-19, false claims including the control of the media and       the financial system, accusations of dual loyalty, and a       multitude of negative stereotypes;        Whereas the American Jewish Committee (AJC)'s 2021 State of       Antisemitism in America report, a survey of American Jews and       the general public's perceptions of antisemitism, revealed 24       percent of American Jews have been personally targeted by       antisemitism in the past 12 months, 4 in 10 American Jews       changed their behavior at least once out of fear of       antisemitism, 90 percent believe antisemitism is a problem in       the United States, and 82 percent feel it has increased in       the past 5 years;        Whereas, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation,       Jews were the target of 55 percent of all religiously       motivated hate crimes in 2020, despite accounting for no more       than 2 percent of the United States population;        Whereas the Anti-Defamation League (ADL)'s 2021 Audit of       Antisemitic Incidents in the United States recorded 2,717       acts of assault, vandalism, and harassment this past year       alone, an average of more than 7 incidents per day; a 34-      percent increase from 2020 and the highest year on record       since ADL began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979;        Whereas 525 antisemitic incidents took place at Jewish       institutions, an increase of 61 percent from data collected       in 2020;        Whereas antisemitic assaults increased by 167 percent in       2021 compared to the previous year and assaults in 2021 were       138 percent higher than the rolling 5-year average of       antisemitic assaults;        Whereas there was a substantial surge of antisemitic       incidents in the United States in May 2021, 387 incidents       were reported, a 141 percent increase in reports of       antisemitic incidents compared to May 2020; Jewish       individuals were violently attacked in major cities including       New York and Los Angeles;        Whereas the use of antisemitic language, conspiracy       theories, and hatred has increased on multiple social media       platforms--from Facebook and Instagram to Twitter and TikTok,       among others--including tropes about Jewish control and       messages praising Hitler and demonizing all Jews;        Whereas a recent example of the violent antisemitism took       place on Saturday, January 15, 2022, when, during religious       services at Congregation Beth Israel, a terrorist held  [[Page H5120]]       4 people, including a rabbi, hostage at gunpoint for 11       hours;        Whereas police departments in a number of American cities,       including New York and Los Angeles, have said that they are       stepping up patrols at synagogues and other locations       associated with the Jewish community following the hostage       situation;        Whereas there are regular acts of antisemitic vandalism       against synagogues and Jewish schools in the United States       and numerous nonlethal attacks on American Jews, leaving many       Jews feeling increasingly unsafe in public spaces and houses       of worship;        Whereas AJC's 2021 State of Antisemitism in America report       revealed 56 percent of respondents' religious institutions       increased security since the Tree of Life synagogue shooting;       and        Whereas the rise in antisemitism is part of the larger       trend of the rise of hate-filled movements that are targeting       marginalized communities here in the United States: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on elected officials, faith leaders, and civil       society leaders to use their bully pulpit to condemn and       combat any and all manifestations of antisemitism;        (2) calls on elected officials to condemn and combat any       and all denials and distortions of the Holocaust and to       promote Holocaust and antisemitism education;        (3) calls for amplifying and ensuring United States       leadership to fight global antisemitism, working with the       Department of State's Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat       Antisemitism and intensifying cooperation with international       governments and parliaments around the world;        (4) works in tandem with the cross-party Inter-      Parliamentary Task Force to Combat Online Antisemitism to       help craft thoughtful global initiatives designed to address       online antisemitism;        (5) calls on social media platforms to institute stronger       and more significant efforts to measure and address online       antisemitism while protecting free speech concerns;        (6) takes all possible steps to improve the physical       security of Jewish institutions and organizations, including       by using existing tools such as increasing funding for the       Nonprofit Security Grant Program of the Department of       Homeland Security to keep at-risk houses of worship, schools,       and community centers safe from terrorist attacks and other       forms of antisemitic violence;        (7) ensures the safety, security, and dignity of American       Jews in all aspects of their lives, including the workplace,       college and university campuses, synagogues, and at home; the       development of these measures must reflect the full diversity       of the Jewish community in its entirety; and        (8) supports the right of Americans to freely exercise       their religious beliefs and rejects all forms of terror and       hate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material H. Res. 1125.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, throughout the month of May, we recognize the struggles  and triumphs of Jewish Americans, and we honor the indispensable  contributions that the Jewish community has made to our Nation's civic  life. Sadly, we also know that anti-Semitism continues to be a menace  here at home and around the world. That is why I am pleased to support  this important resolution condemning rising anti-Semitism.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Debbie Wasserman  Schultz, for being so vigilant over the years to recognize a particular  month where we have particular appreciation of Jewish residents'  contributions to our country, and for bringing this resolution to the  floor to recognize this horrific rise in anti-Semitism.   Since our Nation's founding, Jewish Americans have served in elected  office, from local school boards to this building's hallowed halls, the  Supreme Court, and other prestigious positions. They have done so in  magnificent manners. They have made crucial contributions to the arts,  the sciences, and to our collective struggle for a more just America.  They even had a baseball pitcher, Sandy Koufax, who was better than  any.   Indeed, this resolution calls upon us to recognize the Jewish- American story, like the story of America itself, which is also marked  by bigotry and hatred. Informed by this experience of prejudice, by the  scourge of anti-Semitism, the Jewish Americans have worked so that the  opportunities they have secured are extended to others. That is part of  the Jewish religion. Part of what you do to have a good life is to help  others have that good life, too. They have led movements for social  justice, demanding civil rights, women's rights, and workers' rights.   This work is far from over. Anti-Semitism violence is on the rise.  This past weekend, we saw a deranged individual in Buffalo kill 10  African Americans and injure others. He had a hate for African  Americans, but he also said he was anti-Semitic. He learned all this  over the internet, and he learned a lot of that from rhetoric that has  sprung up in different places and political circles around this  country. It has spread, and it has influenced people to commit acts of  violence.    Mr. Speaker, for collegiality purposes, I ask to withdraw  the motion.    Mr. Speaker, for collegiality purposes, I ask  to withdraw the motion.  Mr.  Speaker, for collegiality purposes, I ask to withdraw the motion.   Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6943) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of  1968 to authorize public safety officer death benefits to officers  suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6943         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Officer       Support Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Every day, public safety officers, including police       officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and       others, work to maintain the safety, health, and well-being       of the communities they serve.        (2) This means public safety officers are routinely called       to respond to stressful and potentially traumatic situations,       often putting their own lives in danger.        (3) This work not only puts public safety officers at-risk       for experiencing harm, serious injury, and cumulative and       acute trauma, but also places them at up to 25.6 times higher       risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder when       compared to individuals without such experiences.        (4) Psychological evidence indicates that law enforcement       officers experience significant job-related stressors and       exposures that may confer increased risk for mental health       morbidities (such as post-traumatic stress disorder and       suicidal thoughts, ideation, intents, and behaviors) and       hastened mortality.        (5) Public safety officers often do not have the resources       or support they need, leaving them at higher risk for long-      term mental health consequences.        (6) Whereas, although the Department of Defense already       considers servicemember suicides to be line-of-duty deaths       and provides Federal support to eligible surviving families,       the Federal Government does not recognize public safety       officer suicides as deaths in the line of duty.        (7) In 2017, the Department of Justice approved 481 claims       under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program under       subpart 1 of part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control       and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281 et seq.), but       not one of them for the more than 240 public safety officers       who died by suicide that year.        (8) Public safety officers who have died or are disabled as       a result of suicide or post-traumatic stress disorder do not       qualify for the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program,       despite the fact that public safety officers are more likely       to die by suicide than from any other line-of-duty cause of       death.       SEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER DEATH BENEFITS FOR POST-                    TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, ACUTE STRESS                     DISORDER, OR TRAUMA AND STRESS RELATED                     DISORDERS.         (a) In General.--Section 1201 of title I of the Omnibus       Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281)       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(o) Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, Acute Stress       Disorder, or Trauma and Stress Related Disorders.--        ``(1) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(A) Mass casualty event.--The term `mass casualty event'       means an incident resulting in casualties to not fewer than 3       victims, including--        ``(i) an incident that exceeds the normal resources for       emergency response available  [[Page H5121]]       in the jurisdiction where the incident takes place; and        ``(ii) an incident that results in a sudden and timely       surge of injured individuals necessitating emergency       services.        ``(B) Mass fatality event.--The term `mass fatality event'       means an incident resulting in the fatalities of not fewer       than 3 individuals at 1 or more locations close to one       another with a common cause.        ``(C) Mass shooting.--The term `mass shooting' means a       multiple homicide incident in which not fewer than 3 victims       are killed--        ``(i) with a firearm;        ``(ii) during one event; and        ``(iii) in one or more locations in close proximity.        ``(D) Exposed.--The term `exposed' includes--        ``(i) directly experiencing or witnessing an event;

SEC. 5. GAO REPORT.         Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report that details benefits issued       pursuant to subsection (o) of section 1201 of title I of the       Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C.       10281), as added by section 3, and includes any       recommendations to improve that subsection.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Public Safety Officer Support Act of 2022 is another  bipartisan bill that would expand eligibility for public safety  officers' benefits to include stress and trauma-related injuries and  death by suicide for law enforcement officers and their families.   According to research from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration, public safety officers are 25 times more  likely to develop acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress  disorder, or other mental health conditions than the general public.  They have a tough job.   Studies have shown that law enforcement officers could experience  more traumatic events in 6 months than the average person will  experience in a lifetime.   The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, known as PSOB, provides  death and education benefits to survivors of fallen law enforcement  officers, firefighters, and other first responders, as well as  disability benefits to officers catastrophically injured in the line of  duty.   Currently, this law excludes from eligibility families of officers  who die by suicide and does not deem PTSD and other trauma-related  disorders to be line-of-duty injuries.   This limitation not only fails to recognize that mental health is  physical health, but it also prevents the Federal Government from  providing support to officers who put their safety and well-being on  the line every day for the communities they serve.  [[Page H5122]]    Former Representative Patrick Kennedy passed a bill to make mental  health and physical health parity. He worked with Senator Ted Kennedy  to get that done. Why law enforcement wasn't included was a mistake. We  are rectifying that mistake today.   The Public Safety Officer Support Act would right past wrongs and  ensure that families of police officers and first responders receive  critical financial assistance as they grieve the loss of their loved  ones.   It would also ensure that officers who are disabled as a result of  traumatic events receive the support and care that they need.   This legislation also brings this program into alignment with the  provisions of Federal military death benefits for the families of  military servicemembers who die by suicide.   The need for this worthy and overdue change is even more apparent as  we continue to grieve the tragic loss of four police officers who died  by suicide after responding to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on  January 6, 2021.   They tried to defend us; they did defend us; and they, unfortunately,  died by suicide as aftermath effects of January 6.   In addition to expanding eligibility for death and disability  benefits to officers and their families, this bill will require the GAO  to study benefits provided under the expansion.   This report will help us better understand the prevalence of  traumatic events that law enforcement officers, first responders, and  other public safety officers face and the need to further support their  mental health needs.   I thank Representatives Trone and Reschenthaler for introducing this  bipartisan legislation and for their continued support for public  safety officers serving communities across the country.   This bill is broadly supported by both mental health and law  enforcement groups, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), the sponsor of this legislation and a gentleman  aware of law enforcement's importance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig), former ace Commercial Appeal reporter and now  Congresswoman from the State of Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I want everyone to vote in favor of this  legislation and not to go to the extraordinary efforts of having to  have the yeas and nays, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H. Res. 1125.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Jewish Americans have contributed an immense amount to  our country in politics, and in justice, and all fields of science, the  arts, and the greatest left-handed pitcher of all time, Sandy Koufax.  So much has been contributed by the Jewish community, yet there has  been much anti-Semitism.   There has been anti-Semitism throughout history against Jewish  people. It is sad. And it has been rising in America and continues to  rise.   We saw the killings in Buffalo, New York, aimed at African Americans,  but the killer, in his manifesto, said he not only wanted to get rid of  and kill African Americans, but he also considered himself anti- Semitic, and indeed he was.   He fostered some crazy theory of replacement, some replacement theory  that I had not really heard about, and he claimed that Jews were in  favor of. Well, that is just malarkey.   We need to fight this anti-Semitism, and nobody more than Debbie  Wasserman Schultz, our colleague from Florida, has done more to have  folks reflect on the contributions of Jewish people during Jewish  Heritage Month, which she sponsored and passed and keeps alive, and  then the passage of this resolution to bring anti-Semitism to our  attention.   It is important that we pass this, and that we understand Jewish  American Heritage Month, which is this May, while we celebrate the  contributions of Jewish Americans and we reject hate whenever and  wherever it appears.   I thank Ms. Wasserman Schultz again--she has done so much, and she is  a leader in this area and so many others as well--for bringing this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I close and ask everybody to support this  important resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
