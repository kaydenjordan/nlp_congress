 Madam Speaker, I have had enough with the Biden Department  of Education's utterly dishonest accounting tricks. The Department of  Education's 2022 financial statement doesn't have a leg to stand on.   KPMG, an independent auditor, stated that there were material  weaknesses in the department's estimates regarding how much the Biden  administration's student loan debt relief plan would cost.   The Biden administration claims that its plan would cost $30 billion  annually over 10 years, but this is assuming that the Department of  Education has properly estimated the participation numbers. According  to KPMG, the Department has no evidence behind these numbers, and these  numbers matter a lot.   If these numbers are off by just 10 percent, then the cost of Biden's  program would rise to $400 billion according to the Congressional  Budget Office.   Folks in the Biden Education Department need to go back and learn  some math.   At worst, the department is trying to hide the true cost to taxpayers  of these debt bailout schemes. At best, the department is practicing  shoddy accounting again. Either way, this is a completely irresponsible  way to govern such a major program.   It is obvious to anyone paying attention that the department hasn't  learned anything from its past mistakes. It was assumptions like this  that got our student loan systems into this mess in the first place.   When Democrats passed the Income-Driven Repayment program, IDR, they  grossly underestimated the number of borrowers who would participate.  This, in conjunction with the student loan moratorium, has led to a  $311 billion budget deficit within the Federal student loan program.   In other words, the Federal student loan program is already costing  taxpayers a fortune, and the Biden administration's actions will make  the problem far worse.   To put salt in the wound, the Biden administration's proposed changes  to IDR will cost far more than they are letting on. While the  department claims that its changes will cost taxpayers $138 billion  over the next 10 years, a nonpartisan student loan expert has estimated  that the true cost could be $1 trillion.   Senator Everett Dirksen said: ``A billion here, a billion there, and  pretty soon you are talking real money.''   This is real taxpayer money.   Once again, the Biden administration is trying to pull the wool over  our eyes.   As chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I cannot  let this pattern of deception and mismanagement continue. I will spend  the 118th Congress doing everything in my power to hold this  administration accountable. Taxpayers deserve nothing less.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 166, I call up  joint resolution (H.J. Res. 30) providing for congressional disapproval  under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted  by the Department of Labor relating to ``Prudence and Loyalty in  Selecting Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights,'' and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and submit  extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 30, a Congressional  Review Act resolution nullifying the Biden administration's attempt to  politicize the retirement savings of Americans.   ESG investing puts the future of millions of Americans in jeopardy.  Due to Biden's reckless economic policies, too many Americans are  worried about the rising costs of living. Diverting retirement savings  to fund social justice causes will make this problem even worse. For  current retirees, the situation is especially salient.   Last year, the Biden Department of Labor published a rule allowing  retirement plan fiduciaries to consider environmental, social, and  governance, ESG, factors for making investment decisions and exercising  shareholder rights.   The rule removed commonsense protections for retirement savings  established by the Trump administration, which ensured that retirement  plan fiduciaries evaluate investments and exercise shareholder rights  based only on the financial benefits to participants and beneficiaries.  That is what retirement savers expect.   Now, thanks to Democrats, workers can be placed into ESG investment  vehicles by default. If a fiduciary finds that two investments are  equal, the fiduciary is allowed to use collateral ESG factors to break  the tie without justifying or documenting that decision.   While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that  the Biden rule is neutral, they have done a poor job of hiding the  administration's true intentions.   The Department issued the rule in response to two executive orders on  climate change and the explanation of the rule is littered with  Democrats' preferred political projects, such as labor relations,  climate change, and workforce and corporate diversity.   Further, DOL officials have repeatedly stated that they will pursue  additional actions concerning ESG and retirement plans.   The left is using ESG investment criteria as a political tool to  cudgel companies into accepting leftist policies. This is how the left  always operates. This is just the first step.  [[Page H933]]    If we let this continue, the left will use ESG investing to push  noncompliant companies out of the marketplace. This is pernicious and  it is hypocritical.   It is unacceptable to encourage fiduciaries to sacrifice the savings  of Americans to the orthodoxy of the woke left. In fact, this is  prohibited under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,  ERISA, as affirmed by the Supreme Court.   Yet, the Biden administration's rule permitting and encouraging  retirement plan fiduciaries to consider ESG when investing workers'  savings flips ERISA on its head.   By paving the way for ESG investing in employer-sponsored retirement  plans, President Biden is threatening the retirement savings of  Americans. Such a fundamental change to ERISA should be debated and  considered in Congress, not enacted through executive fiat illegally.  Americans invest to secure their future, not to fund the Green New Deal  or leftist pet projects.   Fiduciaries governed by ERISA should not be allowed to make  investments they know will not pay off. A fiduciary's most important  responsibility is to make investments that are in the financial  interests of workers and retirees.   It is time to stop this madness. That is why I support the resolution  to nullify the Biden administration's destructive retirement plan rule.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to put workers and retirees above  politics and vote for this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the originator of this CRA.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is a little ironic that our side of the aisle is being accused of  being anticapitalist and anti-free market. I would like to clarify for  the record the content of the Trump Department of Labor rule on  retirement plan ESG investing.   Under the Trump rule, if a fiduciary finds that an ESG factor is a  pecuniary or financial factor, it can be considered when investing and  exercising shareholder rights.                                time  1445    Here are a few excerpts of the Trump rule, to set the record  straight:   ``Nothing in the final rule is intended to or does prevent a  fiduciary from appropriately considering any material risk with respect  to an investment.''   Another quote: ``The ERISA fiduciary duty of prudence requires  portfolio-level attention to risk and return objectives reasonably  suited to the purpose of the account, diversification, cost  sensitivity, documentation, and ongoing monitoring.''   ``The proposal was not intended to suggest that these principles  apply other than neutrally to all investment decisions. . . . ''   To suggest that the Trump rule barred a fiduciary from appropriately  considering any factor that may be material to an investment is  blatantly false. If anything, the Trump rule was neutral as to the  prudent decisions of fiduciaries.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 30,  to stop the Biden administration from decimating the retirement savings  of millions of Americans.   ESG funds will not give retirees the secure future they need.  According to a former BlackRock senior executive, ESG funds  underperformed the broader market compared to non-ESG funds over the  last 5 years.   Retirees are already worried about the rising costs of goods and  services, not whether a company is using plastic straws in its  cafeteria.   Americans deserve to have a secure retirement. This means retirement  plans need to focus solely on workers' financial interests. That is why  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
