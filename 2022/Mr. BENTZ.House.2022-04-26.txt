 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge that last week we celebrated National Park  Week. Each April we celebrate our national parks and invite every  American  [[Page H4477]]  to get out and actually experience them.   My home State of Oregon harbors five units of the National Park  System: Crater Lake National Park, Fort Vancouver National Historic  Site, the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, Nez Perce National  Historical Park, and Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve. I  look forward to at least the next century of visitors discovering  Oregon's parks and everything Oregon has to offer.   In recent years the National Park Service has made a concerted effort  to provide a more inclusive look at American history to ensure that our  parks tell the stories of all Americans. I applaud the National Park  Service for its effort to make all Americans feel welcome and included  in our National Park System.   S. 270, the Brown v. Board of Education Historic Site Expansion Act,  adds to the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site  currently located in Topeka, Kansas, so that it would include  additional sites in South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and the  District of Columbia each as an affiliated area.   This bill will help to recognize and preserve sites associated with  the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka case, which resulted in a  landmark Supreme Court ruling that racial segregation of public schools  is unconstitutional. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the students,  parents, and lawyers whose extraordinary courage and vision led to the  dismantling of the separate but equal doctrine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of S. 270, and I look forward to its  being signed into law. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2793, a bipartisan bill  sponsored by Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, to  reauthorize the Highlands Conservation Act.   The stated purpose of the Highlands Conservation Act, which was  signed into law in 2004, is ``to recognize the importance of the water,  forest, agricultural, wildlife, recreational, and cultural resources of  the Highlands region,'' which, as was indicated, spans some 3.4 million  acres across Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, ``and  the national significance of the Highlands region to the United  States.''   Under the current authorization, the Governors of these States  identify conservation partnership projects in the region and submit a  list annually to the Secretary of the Interior, who is tasked with  working with the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a final list to  Congress for approval and funding.   H.R. 2793 would reauthorize the Highlands Conservation Act and allow  municipalities to enter into conservation agreements with the  Department of the Interior. This bill is the product of bipartisan  negotiations with the Committee on Natural Resources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3525, offered by  Representative Meng, to authorize a commission to study the potential  creation of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and  Culture.   My home State of Oregon has a proud and growing Asian-American and  Pacific-Islander population. Oregon is home to many cultural centers,  museums, gardens, and historic sites related to Asian-American and  Pacific-Islander heritage.   This commission would be tasked with preparing a report for Congress  and the President providing recommendations regarding the feasibility  of establishing and maintaining a National Museum of Asian Pacific  American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.   The commission would be required to consider several factors,  including the availability and cost of the collections to be acquired,  the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining the museum, and  the feasibility of the museum becoming part of the Smithsonian  Institution.   While I support this bill, I am concerned about the significant  financial and operational challenges that adding an additional national  museum to the Smithsonian's portfolio could pose.   Just 2 years ago, Congress authorized the establishment of the  National Museum of the American Latino and American Women's History  Museum. In addition to constructing two new museums, the Smithsonian is  facing a facilities maintenance backlog approaching $1 billion;  identified collection storage needs; a $900 million renovation of the  National Air and Space Museum expected to conclude this year; and  ongoing rehabilitation of other historic structures on the National  Mall.   I appreciate Chair Grijalva's willingness to address Republican  concerns about the Smithsonian's capacity. At markup, an amendment was  adopted to require the commission to consider the potential impact on  the Smithsonian's existing maintenance backlog and identified  construction or renovation costs for new or existing museums.   Additionally, I appreciate an amendment adopted at markup to prohibit  the use of Federal funds for the commission. These are good governance  amendments that will strengthen the commission's work and eventual  report.   I appreciate our friends on the other side of the aisle taking this  bill through regular order and working with Republicans to address our  concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared  to close.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to say how important this bill  is, in part because of the incredibly valuable folks we have in my part  of my State, including the Kitamuras, the Nagakis, the Maedas, the  Nambas, the Saitos, the Itos, the Tanakas, the Teramuras, and many  others, all of whom are absolutely wonderful parts of our community.   They are also incredibly conservative, and I am sure will be happy to  see the portions of this bill that reflect the agreement to make sure  that we are able to pay for whatever it is that we do. They are truly  deserving of this recognition.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5973, a bill sponsored by our  colleague, Representative Debbie Dingell from Michigan, to reauthorize  the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act.   Under the authorities provided by this law, the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service developed six common Great Lakes fish and wildlife  restoration goals in collaboration with State and local partners. To  date, 81 fish and wildlife restoration grant projects have been funded  through this cooperative effort.   This law has been reauthorized three times, most recently in 2016.  The bill we are considering today would extend these authorities until  2027 without increasing funding authorization.   We appreciate Congresswoman Dingell's commitment not to move this  bill until the Fish and Wildlife Service provided a mandatory report to  Congress. In late March, we finally received this report, which allowed  us to evaluate the current program and its progress toward meeting its  goals.   I commend Congresswoman Dingell for her leadership on this  legislation, and I urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time  [[Page H4483]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6023, a bipartisan bill  sponsored by  [[Page H4484]]  Representative   Jim Costa of California to reauthorize the  Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp  Reauthorization Act of 2013 and to require the U.S. Postal Service to  sell all remaining Multinational Species Conservation Fund Semipostal  Stamps.   The Multinational Species Conservation Funds Semipostal Stamp Act of  2010 first directed the Postal Service to issue this stamp to support  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Multinational Species Conservation  Fund, which provides grants, as previously outlined by the previous  speaker.   According to the Fish and Wildlife Service, stamp sales have raised  more than $5.7 million for the fund as of 2019. The authorization for  offering the stamp expired in 2017, at which point the Postal Service  suspended the sale, despite having more than 49 million printed and  unsold stamps on hand.   H.R. 6023 would direct the Postal Service to sell the remainder of  these stamps and report to Congress when all have been sold.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Costa for his leadership on this  legislation. I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6201 offered by Representative Watson Coleman would  extend the authorization for the establishment of a memorial to honor  the approximately 5,000 enslaved and free Black Revolutionary War  patriots who served as soldiers or provided civilian assistance during  the American Revolution.   In 2014, Congress authorized the National Liberty Memorial to be  established in Area 1 in Washington, D.C., which is defined by the  Commemorative Works Act as a location just off the National Mall.   Under the Commemorative Works Act, sponsoring organizations are  provided a 7-year period to construct the memorial, which unfortunately  has expired.   The subject matter of this memorial is extremely important, and I  support extending the authority for the National Mall Liberty Fund D.C.  to continue its valuable work to construct a lasting memorial in our  Nation's Capital to honor the brave enslaved and free Black  Revolutionary War patriots that fought to secure American independence.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.                                time  1600     Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4485]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6651, the Alaska Salmon  Research Task Force Act, sponsored by our late colleague, the dean of  the House, Representative Don Young of Alaska.   The day before his passing, Congressman Don Young was in our Natural  Resources Committee room discussing the need for this legislation.   Since 2018 alone, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  has issued 14 fisheries disasters determinations in Alaska. This bill  seeks scientific answers and recommendations to solve these declining  salmon runs.   Specifically, the bill would require the Secretary of Commerce, in  consultation with the Governor of Alaska, to create an Alaska Salmon  Research Task Force composed of up to 19 individuals representing  various sectors of the salmon economy and culture.   The intent of the task force is to create a coordinated salmon  research strategy, and support collaboration and coordination in salmon  conservation efforts. The task force must also produce a report and  recommendations within 1 year of convening.   If Mr. Young were here today, I am certain that he would remind us  that salmon are important to Alaskans due to their cultural, economic,  and recreational value. I urge my colleagues to honor the late dean of  the House by supporting this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 497, the American Fisheries  Advisory Committee Act, introduced by Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska.   This legislation is simple: It directs the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration to reestablish an American Fisheries  Advisory Committee for the purpose of selecting grant projects that  meet the research needs and priorities of the commercial fishing  industry.   This committee will include a board of experts, with members chosen  regionally and across all sectors of the fishing industry, and will  help provide significant input on how research grants will be focused  on fishing communities.   One goal of this bill is to keep fishing communities healthy and  viable through local collaboration. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill, which was introduced in the House our late colleague,  Representative Don Young, and commend Representative Young and Senator  Sullivan for their efforts.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 441, as amended, that  will direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through  the Indian Health Service, to convey by warranty deed and for health- related activities certain parcels of Federal land to the Tanana Tribal  Council, the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium, and the  Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.   This amended text is a compilation of three separate Indian  healthcare land transfer bills for the State of Alaska introduced by  the late Congressman Don Young. All three of these bills were favorably  reported out of the Committee on Natural Resources by unanimous consent  during this Congress.   The first land transfer directed under this act includes 10.25 acres  of land in Tanana, Alaska. In 1995, the Tanana Tribal Council assumed  responsibility for healthcare services from the Indian Health Service.  The parcel of land the Tribe is seeking title to encompasses a portion  of a former Indian Health Service hospital site. The council intends to  use the land to construct a new community wellness clinic, expand  eldercare, and develop nursing services.   The second transfer includes 10.87 acres of land that is part of the  Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital campus in Sitka, Alaska. The Southeast Alaska  Regional Health Consortium is a Native-run nonprofit health  organization that assumed responsibility for providing healthcare  services from the Indian Health Service in 1976 and currently operates  its Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital in Sitka. The consortium intends to use the  parcel to support future hospital expansion and replacement.   The third land transfer under this act includes 3.5 acres of land  that is part of the Alaska Native Medical Center campus in Anchorage.  In 1999, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium assumed  responsibility for healthcare services from the Indian Health Service,  and the consortium provides comprehensive medical services at the  Alaska Native Medical Center.   The ANTHC is the largest Native-run nonprofit health organization in  the United States, serving more than 178,000 Native Alaskans. Gaining  title to the parcels will enable the ANTHC to streamline its  operations, update and refurbish, and expand the hospital's capacity to  offer health services to patients outside of Anchorage.   Before I conclude, I will take a moment to again recognize all the  hard work Congressman Young put into serving his constituents and,  notably, his work for Native people in Alaska during his tenure in  Congress. I think it is more than appropriate that we are renaming this  legislation after the late dean of the House, further memorializing his  efforts for Native Alaskans. Mr. Young will be deeply missed by all of  us.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
