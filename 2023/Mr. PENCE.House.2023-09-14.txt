 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1435, the  Preserving Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act. I thank Congressman   John  Joyce for his leadership on this bill.   The electrification or nothing timeline of this administration is far  ahead of what is possible, practical, and affordable.   Giving California authority to dictate to the transportation industry  for almost half the Nation is just another tool this administration is  using to force EVs on the American people.   Fuel distribution for our transportation industry was built over the  course of 100 years. It is not reasonable to assume the same can be  done for an EV industry in just a few short years.   While this administration seeks to mandate and subsidize electric  vehicles at every turn, they lack any sense of a coherent plan to put  this into reality.   EV inventories are piling up on dealer lots because, simply put,  nobody is buying them. This legislation would make important strides to  protect Hoosiers' ability to choose the car that they think best fits  their families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
