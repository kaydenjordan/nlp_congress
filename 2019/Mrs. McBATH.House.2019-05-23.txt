 Madam Speaker, today I am introducing the Honoring  American Veterans in Extreme Need, or HAVEN, Act, with my colleague  Greg Steube of Florida.   Under current law, when a veteran files for bankruptcy, his or her  disability benefits from the VA or DOD count as income that is subject  to the reach of creditors; however, Social Security disability benefits  are exempt.   The HAVEN Act would amend bankruptcy law to exclude disability  benefit payments paid from the VA or DOD from that monthly income  calculation, treating it the same as Social Security disability.   Our disabled veterans earned their benefits by serving our great  Nation, and we must protect them and their families, especially during  financial hardship.   I encourage my colleagues to support our Nation's veterans and  cosponsor this bipartisan legislation.                            ____________________
