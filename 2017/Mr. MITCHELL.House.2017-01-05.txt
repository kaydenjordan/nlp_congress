 Mr. Speaker, I am proud that, in my first week as a  Representative of Michigan's 10th Congressional District, we have  passed two important pieces of legislation to stem the avalanche of  Federal regulations.   The top concern I hear from employers of all sizes across my district  is that regulation from Washington is making it harder for them to do  business. I spent my career in business, so I have firsthand knowledge  of the damage caused by excessive Federal regulations.   The Midnight Rules Act and the REINS Act will provide much-needed  regulatory relief to families and businesses alike. Both pieces of  legislation will make unelected bureaucrats accountable to Congress.   The American Dream is achievable, and, as the son of a General Motors  line worker, my life is proof of it. But that dream is only possible  when we give Americans the freedom they need to be successful and  unleash their capabilities in our economy.                            ____________________
