 Madam President, reserving the right to object, the  Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee is pressing forward with  a confirmation hearing on a Supreme Court nominee whose record has been  largely shielded from the Senate and the American public. Over 90  percent of Judge Kavanaugh's record has not been received by the Senate  and may never be. What has been delivered to the committee was  prescreened by a Republican lawyer, with no guidelines as to what we  were receiving and what we were not. It is just whatever entered his  whim. Of that small subset of prescreened documents--less than 10  percent of Judge Kavanaugh's full record--Chairman Grassley is  prohibiting large segments from being shared with the public, without  explanation.   Republicans are trying to jam through, with as little scrutiny as  possible, a lifetime appointment to the Nation's highest Court, with  the power to affect the lives of Americans for a generation. That is  why it is so important for the Senate and the public to review the  nominee's record--because healthcare, a woman's freedom to make medical  decisions, civil rights, voting rights, and marriage equality all hang  in the balance. The Republican majority is deliberately obstructing the  Senate's constitutional duty to fairly and thoroughly conduct our  advice and consent powers.   As a result, we will not consent to business as usual on the Senate  floor today. This means the Senate will adjourn for the day after my  two colleagues finish speaking.   I object.
