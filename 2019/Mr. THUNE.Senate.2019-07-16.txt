 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  complete my remarks before the vote.    Madam President, a number of my colleagues were here just  a few moments ago talking about trade and the impact of trade on  agriculture. I have been down here a lot on the floor to talk about the  ag economy in recent weeks. If you look at our economy as a whole, it  is thriving, but our Nation's farmers and ranchers are still having a  tough time, thanks to years of commodity and livestock prices that are  below production cost because of protracted trade disputes and now, on  top of that, natural disasters.   One of the most important things we can do to help our agricultural  economy is to negotiate favorable trade agreements for U.S. producers.  Our Nation's farmers and ranchers depend on trade. In my home State of  South Dakota, we export a substantial portion of the agricultural  products we produce.   Right now, though, farmers and ranchers are facing a lot of  uncertainty when it comes to trade. There are a number of outstanding  trade agreements, and farmers and ranchers are unsure what the rules of  the road are going to look like in the future. That is why I have urged  the administration to  [[Page S4846]]  wrap up negotiations on the various trade deals under consideration as  swiftly as possible.   I strongly support the administration's goal of strengthening market  access for our Nation's farmers and ranchers, and we have made real  progress in negotiations. Now it is time to push for a conclusion to  these deals and give our Nation's agricultural producers certainty  about what international markets are going to look like.   There is one deal, however, that we don't need to wait for; that is,  the United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Negotiations on  this trade agreement are finished. Mexico has already passed the  agreement, and Canada is just waiting for the United States to act. All  we need is for Speaker Pelosi to indicate her willingness to take up  this deal, and the President will formally submit the agreement to  Congress for approval.   The United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement is a big win for  our Nation's farmers and ranchers. Canada and Mexico are the No. 1 and  No. 2 export markets for American food and agricultural products. The  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will preserve and expand farmers'  access to these critical markets and give farmers certainty about what  these markets will look like long term.   I am particularly pleased with the improvements the agreement makes  for U.S. dairy producers. Dairy is an important and rapidly growing  industry in South Dakota. Drive the I-29 corridor north of Brookings,  and you can see firsthand what massive dairy expansion we have  experienced in South Dakota over the past few years.   The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will preserve U.S. dairy farmers'  role as a key dairy supplier to Mexico, and it will substantially  expand market access in Canada, where U.S. dairy sales have been  restricted.   The U.S. International Trade Commission estimates that the agreement  will boost U.S. dairy exports by more than $277 million. The agreement  will also expand market access for U.S. poultry and egg producers. It  will make it easier for U.S. producers to export wheat to Canada.   I have spent my time today talking about the agricultural industry,  but, of course, this agreement goes much further. The United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement will benefit virtually every sector of our  economy, from manufacturing to digital services to the automotive  industry. It will create 176,000 new jobs, grow our economy, and raise  wages for workers.   It is time to pass this agreement and to realize its economic  benefits. Senate Republicans are ready; we are ready to approve this  agreement once the White House submits it to Congress. We are just  waiting for Democratic leaders in the House to indicate their  willingness to take up the deal. It is time for them to do so.   Democrats' concerns have been more than addressed throughout the  negotiation process. The final trade agreement is perhaps the most  worker-friendly trade agreement the United States has ever considered.  It is a big improvement on the North American Free Trade Agreement--the  agreement under which we are currently operating--on the issues over  which Democrats have expressed concern.   If they are serious about making progress on these issues and are not  just trying to sink the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement with specious  objections, Democrats should give the President the go-ahead and take  up and pass this agreement in the near future.                      nomination of Peter joseph Phipps     I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m.  on Wednesday, July 17, the Senate vote on the resolutions of  ratification for Treaties Calendar Nos. 2, 3, and 4 as under the  previous order and that if the resolutions are agreed to, the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.

There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:39 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, July 17, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
