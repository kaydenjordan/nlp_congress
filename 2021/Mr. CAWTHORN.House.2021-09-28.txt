 Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Scheller is an  American patriot who dared to speak the truth.   He knew that a 4-minute and 45-second video could bring his storied  17-year career in the United States Marine Corps to a screeching halt,  but he did not care.   He laid it all down and spoke truth to power.   He said what every other servicemember knew in their heart was true:  The incompetence of the Biden White House cost American lives.   Their sin was unpardonable and deadly. Lieutenant Colonel Scheller  called them out, but they couldn't handle the criticism.   He was ordered to undergo mental health screening because he stood up  to incompetence. Today, right now, this very second, he sits behind  bars in my home State of North Carolina, shackled in a military brig,  while those who orchestrated Biden's incompetent Afghanistan withdrawal  walk free.   Mr. Speaker, this is a stain on our Nation's conscience. Lieutenant  Colonel Stuart Scheller must be released.                            ____________________
