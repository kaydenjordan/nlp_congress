 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address President Biden's  national security crisis and to express my support for the people of  Ukraine as they fight for their lives and their sovereignty.   An American ally is under attack, and they need our support.  Sanctioning the Russian economy is not enough. The Ukrainian Government  has requested more lethal aid for many months, and we must deliver it  without further delay. We must also end our purchases of nearly 538,000  barrels of Russian oil each day and return to where we were just a  short year ago by making America energy independent again.   After 4 years of peace and prosperity, it only took President Biden  400 days to unravel it all. President Biden's weakness on the world  stage has emboldened our enemies and created a vacuum that Vladimir  Putin is delighted to fill.   President Biden has demonstrated the inability to lead, whether it be  the botched Afghanistan withdrawal or the invasion that is happening at  our own Southern border. I can't help but think about what might come  next as Iran strives to produce nuclear weapons and China may look  toward Taiwan and mimic Russia. The world was a much safer place a  little over a year ago.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with President Zelensky and the  people of Ukraine who are courageously fighting against power-hungry  dictator Vladimir Putin.   So much tragedy and loss could have been avoided in Ukraine if we had  any real leadership in the White House. Surely evil triumphs when good  men do nothing.                    Celebrating the Life of Jim Lancaster     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of my friend,  cousin, and lifelong Tennessean, Jim Lancaster. He passed away on  February 3 after a remarkable 92 years on God's Earth.   Jim loved the Lord and cherished his family with all his heart. He  and Vondell, the love of his life, were married for 67 years. Together  they had five children, 12 grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren, and  two great-great-grandchildren. Obviously, Jim's and Vondell's loving  marriage and devotion to family led to a lot of little Lancasters  running around middle Tennessee.   Jim was a joyful role model, and so many people in his community knew  Jim in that way. He served as a leader in many local organizations  including the chamber of commerce, the Boy Scouts, and too many to name  here today. He received loads of awards for his service over the years,  but he was a humble man who wasn't in it for recognition. He just loved  serving his community and the people in it.    He also dedicated much of his life to agriculture. He graduated from  Tennessee Tech, my alma mater, with a degree in agriculture, and then  worked for the Wilson County Farm Bureau as its agency manager for over  43 years. In fact, he is now a member of the Wilson County Agricultural  Hall of Fame in recognition of his exemplary work for local farmers  throughout his distinguished career.   I was blessed to call Jim family. It is bittersweet. It is a  bittersweet moment for me now to say he is gone to be with our Lord.   Thank you, Jim Lancaster, for a life well-lived that touched so many  in such a positive way.  [[Page H1216]]                                ____________________     Madam Speaker, I was shocked when President Biden said ``we  need to secure the border'' during his State of the Union address. In  his first year in office, over 2 million illegal immigrants were  apprehended at the southern border, deportations decreased by 70  percent, and 11,000 migrants were arrested who had previous criminal  convictions.   Actions speak louder than words, and when Mr. Biden halted  construction of President Trump's border wall and attempted to reverse  the remain in Mexico policy, we knew that he didn't want to secure the  border. The Biden administration's open border policies put immense  strain on law enforcement as they work to combat the fentanyl crisis  wreaking havoc on our communities.   In fact, Cumberland County, Tennessee, Sheriff Casey Cox recently  took a trip to the southern border to gain a better understanding of  the issue after a local 18-year-old woman died of a fentanyl overdose.  Much like on my own trips to the border, Sheriff Cox observed how  understaffed and ill-prepared we are to face the crisis under the Biden  administration.   Madam Speaker, I urge the President to back up his words with action  and do what he said: secure the border.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding me time this evening.    Madam Speaker, today, I rise to remind President Biden that the State  of the Union is in crisis, more so than at any time in my lifetime.   After sitting in the House Chamber last night listening to the  President speak, I couldn't help but think about the people of  Tennessee that are struggling to make ends meet.   They are struggling due to skyrocketing inflation that has been  fueled by President Biden and congressional Democrats' insatiable  desire to recklessly spend trillions of dollars by  [[Page H1264]]  borrowing massive amounts of money from China and elsewhere, and highly  mortgaging our children's and grandchildren's and their children that  follow after them, the future for these generations. It is gutless, and  it is wrong.   Madam Speaker, the State of the Union is not strong. In fact, under  only 1 year of President Biden's leadership, migrant encounters at our  southern border have increased 96 percent. More police officers were  killed than in any year since 1995. The price of gasoline has increased  33 percent. The fentanyl that comes across our southern border has  become the leading cause of death among people aged 18 to 45, with an  American dying every 5 minutes and 15 seconds.   Afghanistan has been surrendered back to the Taliban, leaving behind  hundreds of Afghans who were aligned with us during that long struggle,  along with billions of taxpayer dollars in modern American weaponry.  Now, another American ally is under attack by out-of-control Russian  dictator Vladimir Putin.   It is time to wake up and recognize that Biden's administration and  Congressional Democrats' policies are failing the American people. In  fact, those policies have begun to do real damage to us at an ever- increasing pace.   The people of my State, Tennessee, see right through this charade and  implore the President to act now before it is too late and reverse his  policies to match the rhetoric that we heard in the State of the Union  address.
