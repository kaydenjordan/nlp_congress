 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a little while ago, the majority leader  stood on this floor to speak about the investigation into the 2016  Presidential election. He triumphantly declared ``case closed''--``case  closed.'' Wishing will not make it so.   I read the Mueller report. I read it cover to cover, every page. I  read late into the evening on the day it was released and into the next  morning. I didn't start reading by expecting to make a statement about  it, but I was shaken by the evidence that the special counsel had  gathered and by the conclusions that he drew.   The majority leader would have us believe that scrutinizing this  evidence is a matter of Democrats refusing ``to make peace with the  American people's choice.'' He wants to portray this as just an  ``outrage industrial complex'' because some people don't like that  President Trump won. Again, wishing will not make it so.   Sure, there is plenty to be outraged about in the special counsel's  report, but no one here is pitching a fit that Democrats didn't win the  election. No, what is at stake here is the Constitution of the United  States of America. Will Congress do its job and fulfill its  constitutional duty to serve as a check on the President? The answer  from the majority leader and his Republican colleagues is no--``case  closed.'' ``Case closed,'' they cry.   Instead of reading the words of the special counsel's report, they  just want to circle the wagons around this President. Instead of  protecting the Constitution, they want to protect the President. This  is a huge difference.   At the core of the Constitution is the principle that no one is above  the law, not even the President of the United States. My oath of office  is the same as Mitch McConnell's. I swore and he swore to uphold the  Constitution of the United States. Our Constitution is built on the  principle of separation of powers precisely to prevent a dictator, an  autocrat, from taking control of our government. This separation of  powers is part of the brilliance of our Constitution, and it has served  us well for centuries.   Yes, I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States,  and so did everybody in the Senate and the House, including the  majority leader. Now we must act to fulfill that oath. There is no  ``political inconvenience'' exception to the U.S. Constitution. If any  other human being in this country had done what is documented in the  Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail.   The majority leader doesn't want us to consider the mountain of  evidence against the President. That is wrong. He and his colleagues  have moved to protect the President instead of defending the  Constitution. Maybe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  confused or maybe they just didn't read the report. Well, I did, and  there  [[Page S2664]]  were some passages that stuck out to me.   Since the majority leader has pronounced his judgment here on the  Senate floor, I would like to spend some time reminding him of exactly  what this report said. Let's start with this one. Robert Mueller's  report makes clear that the President took steps to impede the Mueller  investigation and that his report, though it does not charge the  President, did not exonerate him from wrongdoing. According to Mueller:         On May 17, 2017, the Acting Attorney General for the Russia       investigation appointed a Special Counsel to conduct the       investigation and related matters. The President reacted to       news that a Special Counsel had been appointed by telling       advisors that it was ``the end of his presidency'' and       demanding that Sessions resign. Sessions submitted his       resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it.       The President told aides that the Special Counsel had       conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special Counsel       therefore could not serve. The President's advisors told him       the asserted conflicts were meritless and had already been       considered by the Department of Justice. On June 14, 2017,       the media reported that the Special Counsel's Office was       investigating whether the President had obstructed justice.       Press reports called this ``a major turning point'' in the       investigation: while Comey had told the President he was not       under investigation, following Comey's firing, the President       now was under investigation. The President reacted to this       news with a series of tweets criticizing the Department of       Justice and the Special Counsel's investigation. On June 17,       2017, the President called McGahn [who was White House       Counsel] at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney       General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of       interest and must be removed.    That ends the quote from the Mueller report. According to McGahn, the  President was extremely insistent, calling him repeatedly and not  taking no for an answer. Here is what McGahn told the special counsel-- back to the Mueller report:         On Saturday, June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn and       told him to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn was at       home and the President was at Camp David. In interviews with       this Office, McGahn recalled that the President called him at       home twice and on both occasions directed him to call       Rosenstein and say that Mueller had conflicts that precluded       him from serving as Special Counsel.        On the first call, McGahn recalled that the President said       something like, ``You gotta do this. You gotta call Rod.''       McGahn said he told the President that he would see what he       could do. McGahn was perturbed by the call and did not intend       to act on the request. He and other advisors believed the       asserted conflicts were ``silly'' and ``not real,'' and they       had previously communicated that view to the President.       McGahn also had made clear to the President that the White       House Counsel's Office should not be involved in any effort       to press the issue of conflicts. McGahn was concerned about       having any role in asking the Acting Attorney General to fire       the Special Counsel because he had grown up in the Reagan era       and wanted to be more like Judge Robert Bork and not       ``Saturday Night Massacre Bork.'' McGahn considered the       President's request to be an inflection point and he wanted       to hit the brakes.    That ends the quote from the Mueller report.   Starting again from the Mueller report:         When the President called McGahn a second time to follow up       on the order to call the Department of Justice, McGahn       recalled the President was more direct, saying something       like, ``Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and       can't be the Special Counsel.'' McGahn recalled the President       telling him ``Mueller has to go'' and ``Call me back when you       do it.'' McGahn understood the President to be saying that       the Special Counsel had to be removed by Rosenstein. To end       the conversation with the President, McGahn left the       President with the impression that McGahn would call       Rosenstein. McGahn recalled that he had already said no to       the President's request, and he was worn down. So he just       wanted to get off the phone.        McGahn recalled feeling trapped because he did not plan to       follow the President's directive, but he did not know what he       would say next time the President called. McGahn decided he       had to resign. He called his personal lawyer, and then he       called his chief of staff, Annie Donaldson, to inform her of       his decision. He then drove to the office to pack his       belongings and submit his resignation letter. Donaldson       recalled that McGahn told her the President had called and       demanded that he contact the Department of Justice and that       the President wanted him to do something that McGahn did not       want to do. McGahn told Donaldson that the President had       called at least twice and, in one of the calls, asked, ``have       you done it?'' McGahn did not tell Donaldson the specifics of       the President's request because he was consciously trying not       to involve her in the investigation, but Donaldson inferred       that the President's directive was related to the Russia       investigation. Donaldson prepared to resign along with       McGahn.        That evening, McGahn called both Priebus and Bannon and       told them that he intended to resign. McGahn recalled that,       after speaking with his attorney and given the nature of the       President's request, he decided not to share details of the       President's request with other White House staff. Priebus       recalled that McGahn said that the President had asked him to       ``do crazy shit,'' but he thought McGahn did not tell him the       specifics of the President's request because McGahn was       trying to protect Priebus from what he did not need to know.    Priebus and Bannon both urged McGahn not to quit, and McGahn  ultimately returned to work that Monday and remained in his position.  He had not told the President directly that he planned to resign, and  when they next saw each other the President did not ask McGahn whether  he had followed through with calling Rosenstein. Around the same time,  Chris Christie recalled a telephone call with the President in which  the President asked what Christie thought about the President firing  the Special Counsel. Christie advised against doing so because there  was no substantive basis for the President to fire the Special Counsel,  and because the President would lose support from Republicans in  Congress if he did so.   That is the end of that part of the Mueller report.   Now, the other President's aides ultimately refused to carry out his  orders and prepared to resign rather than do so. The President  persisted.   Mueller recounts:         Two days after directing McGahn to have the Special Counsel       removed, the President made another attempt to affect the       course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the       President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former       campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor       outside the government, and dictated a message for       Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that       Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his       recusal from the Russia investigation, that the investigation       was ``very unfair'' to the President, the President had done       nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special       Counsel and ``let [him] move forward with investigating       election meddling for future elections.'' Lewandowski said he       understood what the President wanted Sessions to do.        One month later, in another private meeting with       Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the President asked about the       status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special       Counsel's investigation to future election interference.       Lewandowski told the President that the message would be       delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President       publicly criticized Sessions in an interview with the New       York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it       clear that Sessions's job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did       not want to deliver the President's message personally, so he       asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it       to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did       not follow through.    That is the conclusion of that part of the report.   Now, President Trump also took steps to ``prevent public disclosure  of evidence'' that was related to the special counsel's investigation.   Back to the Mueller report:         In early 2018, the press reported that the President had       directed McGahn to have the special counsel removed in June       2017 and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather than       carry out the order. The President reacted to the news       stories by directing White House officials to tell McGahn to       dispute the story and to create a record stating that he had       not been ordered to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn       told those officials that the media reports were accurate in       stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the       Special Counsel removed. The President then met with McGahn       in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the       reports.    That is the end of that section.   Now, the President also tried to influence witnesses, like Michael  Flynn and Paul Manafort, while they cooperated with the special  counsel.   Back to the Mueller report:         With regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public       messages to Flynn encouraging him to stay strong and       conveying that the President still cared about him before he       began to cooperate with the government. When Flynn's       attorneys withdrew him from a joint defense agreement with       the President, signaling that Flynn was potentially       cooperating with the government, the President's personal       counsel initially reminded Flynn's counsel of the President's       warm feelings toward Flynn and said ``that still remains.''       But when Flynn's counsel reiterated that Flynn could no       longer share information under a joint defense agreement, the       President's personal counsel stated that the decision would       be interpreted as reflecting Flynn's hostility toward the       President.  [[Page S2665]]       That sequence of events could have had the potential to       affect Flynn's decision to cooperate, as well as the       extent of that cooperation.        With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the       President's actions had the potential to influence Manafort's       decision whether to cooperate with the government. The       President and his personal counsel made repeated statements       suggesting that a pardon was a possibility for Manafort,       while also making it clear that the President did not want       Manafort to ``flip''--    That is in quotes in the Mueller report--       and cooperate with the government. On June 15, 2018, the day       the judge presiding over Manafort's D.C. case was considering       whether to revoke his bail, the President said that he ``felt       badly'' for Manafort and stated, ``I think a lot of it is       very unfair.'' And when asked about a pardon for Manafort,       the President said, ``I do want to see people treated fairly.       That's what it's all about.'' Later that day, after       Manafort's bail was revoked, the President called it a       ``tough sentence'' that was ``Very unfair!'' Two days later,       the President's personal counsel stated that individuals       involved in the Special Counsel's investigation could receive       a pardon ``if, in fact, the [P]resident and his advisors . .       . come to the conclusion that you have been treated       unfairly,''--using language that paralleled how the President       had already described the treatment of Manafort.    This is Mueller's report.         Those statements, combined with the President's       commendation of Manafort for being a ``brave man'' who       ``refused to break,'' suggested that a pardon was a more       likely possibility if Manafort continued not to cooperate       with the government. And while Manafort eventually pleaded       guilty pursuant to a cooperation agreement, he was found to       have violated the agreement by lying to investigators.    That concludes that portion of the Mueller report.   Now, Mueller declined to take a position because of the existing  Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel policy that you cannot  indict a sitting President. He intended to leave the matter to  Congress. He laid the evidence out in the Mueller report, which made  clear that the President of the United States obstructed justice.   And don't just take my word for it. Just yesterday, over 600 former  Federal prosecutors wrote a letter stating that ``the conduct of  President Trump described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report  would, in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of  Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President, result in  multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.''   So I am going to read their letter because I think it is important,  and I want to make sure it is in the Record here. Here is the letter  from more than 600 former prosecutors.         We are former federal prosecutors. We served under both       Republican and Democratic administrations at different levels       of the federal system: as line attorneys, supervisors,       special prosecutors, United States attorneys, and senior       officials at the Department of Justice. The offices in which       we served were small, medium, and large; urban, suburban, and       rural; and located in all parts of our country.        Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump       described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report would,       in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of       Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President,       result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.    I just want to read that again: ``would . . . result in multiple  felony charges for obstruction of justice.''         The Mueller report describes several acts that satisfy all       of the elements for an obstruction of justice charge. Conduct       that obstructed or intended to obstruct the truth-finding       process, as to which the evidence of corrupt intent and       connection to pending proceedings is overwhelming. These       include:        The President's efforts to fire Mueller and to falsify       evidence about that effort;        The President's effort to limit the scope of Mueller's       investigation to exclude his conduct; and        The President's efforts to prevent witnesses from       cooperating with investigators probing him and his campaign.    This is under the heading in the letter ``Attempts to fire Mueller  and then create false evidence.''   Continuing with the letter:         Despite being advised by then-White House Counsel Don       McGahn that he could face legal jeopardy for doing so, Trump       directed McGahn on multiple occasions to fire Mueller or to       gin up false conflicts of interest as a pretext for getting       rid of the Special Counsel. When these acts began to come       into public view, Trump made ``repeated efforts to have       McGahn deny the story''--going so far as to tell McGahn to       write a letter ``for our files'' falsely denying that Trump       had directed Mueller's termination.        Firing Mueller would have seriously impeded the       investigation of the President and his associates--      obstruction in its most literal sense. Directing the creation       of false government records in order to prevent or       discredit truthful testimony is similarly unlawful. The       special counsel's report states: ``Substantial evidence       indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute that       he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the       President acted for the purpose of influencing McGahn's       account in order to deflect or prevent scrutiny of the       President's conduct toward the investigation.''    Also within the letter, under the header Attempts to Limit the  Mueller Investigation, the report describes multiple efforts by the  President to curtail the scope of the special counsel's investigation.   First, the President repeatedly pressured then-Attorney General Jeff  Sessions to reverse his legally mandated decision to recuse himself  from the investigation. The President stated the reason was that he  wanted an Attorney General who would ``protect'' him, including from  the special counsel's investigation. He also directed then-White House  Chief of Staff Reince Priebus to fire Sessions, and Priebus refused.   Second, after McGahn told the President he could not contact Sessions  himself to discuss the investigation, Trump went outside the White  House and instructed his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to  carry a demand to Sessions to direct Mueller to confine his  investigation to future elections. Lewandowski tried and failed to  contact Sessions in private. After a second meeting with Trump,  Lewandowski passed Trump's message on to senior White House official  Rick Dearborn, who Lewandowski thought would be a better messenger  because of his prior relationship with Sessions. Dearborn did not pass  along Trump's message.   As the report explains, ``[s]ubstantial evidence indicates that the  President's effort to have Sessions limit the scope of the Special  Counsel's investigation to future election interference was intended to  prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President's and his  campaign's conduct.''   In other words, the President employed a private citizen to try to  get the Attorney General to limit the scope of an ongoing investigation  into the President and his associates.   All of this conduct--trying to control and impede the investigation  against the President by leveraging his authority over others--is  similar to conduct we have seen that has been charged against other  public officials and people in powerful positions.   The next section of the special counsel's report establishes that the  President tried to influence the decisions of both Michael Cohen and  Paul Manafort with regard to cooperating with investigators. Some of  this tampering and intimidation, including the dangling of pardons, was  done in plain sight via tweets and public statements. Other such  behavior was done via private messages through private attorneys, such  as Trump counsel Rudy Giuliani's message to Cohen's lawyer that Cohen  should ``[s]leep well tonight[], you have friends in high places.''   Of course, these aren't the only acts of potential obstruction  detailed by the special counsel. It would be well within the purview of  normal prosecutorial judgment also to charge other acts detailed in the  report.   We emphasize that these are not matters of close, professional  judgment. Of course, there are potential defenses or arguments that  could be raised in response to an indictment of the nature we describe  here. In our system, every accused person is presumed innocent, and it  is always the government's burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable  doubt. Yet to look at these facts and say that a prosecutor could not  probably sustain a conviction for obstruction of justice--the standards  set out in Principles of Federal Prosecution--runs counter to logic and  our experience.         As former Federal prosecutors, we recognize that       prosecuting obstruction of justice cases is critical because       unchecked obstruction, which allows intentional interference       with criminal investigations to go unpunished, puts our whole       system of justice at risk. We believe strongly that but for       the OLC memo, the overwhelming weight of professional       judgment would come down in favor of prosecution for the       conduct outlined in the Mueller report.    Over 600 former Federal prosecutors are saying that if we were  talking  [[Page S2666]]  about any person in this country other than the President of the United  States, that person would be prosecuted for obstruction of justice.  Because of that OLC opinion that a sitting President cannot be  indicted, the only mechanism to hold the President accountable and to  ensure that the President is not above the law is for Congress to  initiate impeachment proceedings.   There has been more commentary. Scholars at Lawfare have put together  a very helpful piece that breaks down all of the examples documented in  the Mueller report in which Trump may have obstructed justice. Then it  analyzes the strength of the case to be made that the President is  guilty of obstruction of justice.    Per Lawfare:         The key question is how Robert Mueller and his team       assessed the three elements ``common to most of the relevant       statutes'' relating to obstruction of justice, which are an       obstructive act, a nexus between the act and an official       proceeding, and corrupt intent.        As Mueller describes, the special counsel's office       ``gathered evidence . . . relevant to the elements of those       crimes and analyzed them within an elements framework--while       refraining from reaching ultimate conclusions about whether       crimes were committed'' because of the Office of Legal       Counsel (OLC)'s guidelines against the indictment of a       sitting president.    The Lawfare blog identified four instances in the Mueller report that  documented ``substantial'' evidence of all three of those elements. In  other words, in the following four examples that were documented in the  Mueller report, there is ``substantial'' evidence on all three of the  elements that Mueller based his assessment on that the President  obstructed justice.   First, when it comes to the President's efforts to fire Mueller, the  report found ``substantial evidence''--that is from the report--that  the President's actions constituted an obstructive act. On page 89, it  found that the former White House Counsel, Don McGahn, was a ``credible  witness'' in providing evidence that Trump, indeed, attempted to fire  Mueller. The report reads that this ``would qualify as an obstructive  act'' if the firing ``would naturally obstruct the investigation and  any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.''   Then it established that there was a nexus between the act and an  official proceeding, reading on page 89 that there is ``substantial  evidence'' that Trump was aware that ``his conduct was under  investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of  federal crimes to a grand jury.''   On the question of intent, the Mueller report found ``substantial  evidence indicates that the President's attempts to remove the Special  Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel's oversight of  investigations that involved the President's conduct[.]''   The second example that Mueller cites is the President's efforts to  curtail Mueller. On the question of whether those actions constituted  an obstructive act, Mueller found that Trump's effort to force Sessions  to confine the investigation to investigating only future election  interference ``would qualify as an obstructive act if it would  naturally obstruct the investigation and any grand jury proceedings  that might flow from the inquiry.'' The report continues: ``Taken  together, the President's directives indicate that Sessions was being  instructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the existing  investigation into the President and his campaign[.]''   On the question of whether there was a nexus between the act and an  official proceeding, Mueller found that at the relevant point, ``the  existence of a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special  Counsel was public knowledge.''   On the question of intent, Mueller found ``substantial evidence''  that indicates that Trump's efforts were ``intended to prevent further  investigative scrutiny of the President's and his campaign's conduct.''   Mitch McConnell came to the floor to declare that there will be no  more investigation into what the President has done. Yet the Mueller  report has made clear that there are repeated instances of obstruction  of justice. More than 600 Federal prosecutors have now said that what  is laid out in the Mueller report would constitute obstruction of  justice and would trigger a prosecution for any human being in this  country other than for the President of the United States.   Robert Mueller has put all of the facts and information together for  us and has abided by the Trump administration's declaration, under the  Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting President cannot be indicted  for his crimes. He has handed it over to the Congress of the United  States of America for us to do our constitutional duty.   We are a government that works by a separation of powers. We are not  a government that circles the wagon around a leader and says that  everything else falls away. Instead, we say there are powers that are  given to the President and powers that are given to Congress, and each  operates as a check on the other.   The information that has been given to us in the Mueller report  clearly constitutes adequate information to begin an impeachment  proceeding in the House of Representatives. No matter how many times  Mitch McConnell or the rest of the Republicans want to wish that away,  it is there in black and white in the report.   I urge every Republican in this Chamber, every Republican and  Democrat in Congress, and every person in this country to read the  Mueller report.   Robert Mueller makes clear that the President of the United States  worked actively to obstruct justice. There is enough here to bring an  impeachment proceeding. For us, for this body, for Congress, to back up  from that and to say that protecting the President is more important  than protecting the Constitution is not only wrong, it is a violation  of our oath of office.   I am here to say one more time and publicly this is not a fight I  wanted to take on, but this is the fight in front of us now. This is  not about politics. This is about the Constitution of the United States  of America.   We took an oath not to try to protect Donald Trump; we took an oath  to protect and serve the Constitution of the United States of America,  and the way we do that is we begin impeachment proceedings now against  this President.   I yield the floor.
