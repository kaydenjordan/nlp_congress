 Mr. Speaker, Washington, in fact, has a spending addiction.  We doubled our spending last year to fight the pandemic, protect public  health, and get the economy back open and protect jobs. On top of that,  this spring, Democrats spent another $1.9 trillion on extra spending.   Now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are further fueling  this addiction and just can't take their foot off the gas. We are  headed downhill with no brakes. They continue to push forward with what  amounts to another $5.5 trillion tax-and-spending spree that is nothing  more than a Trojan horse filled with tax hikes for American families  and far-left, progressive priorities.  [[Page H6077]]    We need to abandon this reckless spending and come together in a  bipartisan way and put together a commonsense 2022 budget plan before  we burden our children and grandchildren with further debt.                              Heating Bills Jump     Mr. Speaker, winter is right around the corner and  households could see their heating bills jump 54 percent. While some of  this can be attributed to our supply chain issues, the administration's  spending addiction coupled with their anti-American energy policies  aren't helping.   At every turn, the Biden administration has hindered domestic energy  production. They halted construction on the Keystone XL pipeline,  costing jobs in my home State of Arkansas and throughout the Midwest.  They halted new oil and gas leasing on U.S. lands and waters, costing 1  million American jobs in the near term. Now they are pushing a heat- your-home tax in their tax-and-spending spree.   Mr. Speaker, the holidays are around the corner and Americans will  unfortunately bear the burden of President Biden's ill-conceived, anti- American energy policies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to end their war on American  jobs and our energy independence.    Recognizing 2021 Arkansas History Teacher of the Year Kristy Brasfield     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Kristy Brasfield,  the 2021 Arkansas History Teacher of the Year.   Mrs. Brasfield earned her bachelor and master's degree in education  from Arkansas State University at Jonesboro and is currently working on  her doctorate.    Currently, Mrs. Brasfield teaches U.S. history and English IV at the  Joe T. Robinson High School in Pulaski County.   To those who know her, this award is no surprise. Her hard work and  dedication have been previously rewarded, winning the 2019 Arkansas  Council for Social Studies 9 through 12 Teacher of the Year and the  2016 Rotary Educator of the Year.   Mrs. Brasfield, on behalf of all the parents in central Arkansas, I  thank you for your hard work, your dedication to your students, and  congratulate you on this meaningful award.           Recognizing the Outstanding Achievement of Julia Gaffney     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  achievement of Julia Gaffney of Mayflower, Arkansas. This summer she  won the bronze medal in the 400 meter freestyle and the bronze medal in  the 100 meter backstroke at the Tokyo Paralympics.   Julia has been swimming competitively since 2015, and quickly has  made a name for herself. This year was her first Paralympic appearance,  and it was an awe-inspiring achievement.   Julia's path to being a Paralympic medalist was unlike any other.  After a setback in this year's games, she said: I had to move on, and I  am so happy that I was able to bounce back and earn a bronze for Team  USA.   I admire Julia's courage and determination, which are the  characteristics that led her to that Paralympic podium. Julia, you make  Mayflower and all of central Arkansas proud.              fuller & son hardware marks 100 years of business     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable  accomplishment of Fuller & Son Hardware for marking 100 years of  business in central Arkansas.   Fuller & Son Hardware originally started as a feed store operated by  Walter ``Pop'' Fuller at the corner of 28th and Arch Streets in Little  Rock in 1921.   Over the past 100 years, Fuller & Son Hardware has weathered the  storm of change. They have expanded to include hardware and added five  locations in central Arkansas. They are now launching an online  shopping option. All that by remaining closed on Sundays. The founder  said, ``Some money just costs too much.''   Congratulations on the centennial for Fuller & Son Hardware.                            ____________________
