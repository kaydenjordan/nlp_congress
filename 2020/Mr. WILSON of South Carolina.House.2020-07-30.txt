 Mr. Speaker, the entire world has had  to endure the Wuhan virus destroying lives. Now there is evidence that  China has launched state-sponsored hackers to target virus vaccine  research. As chairman of the RSC National Security and Foreign Affairs  Task Force, I am grateful to have introduced the RSC National Security  Strategy.   This report recommends over a dozen measures to counter theft by the  Chinese Communist Party of our IP and trade secrets, including new  measures to stop and punish their cyberattacks and enhance outdated  laws. One of these is to change the International Trade Commission,  making it easier for American companies to block Chinese imports that  were the product of stolen trade secrets. This report also includes the  toughest sanctions ever on the oppressive Chinese Communist Party,  promoting opportunities for the Chinese people.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Our sympathy for the  family and friends of Bernell Trammell of Milwaukee.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member    Ken Calvert for yielding.   I am grateful to support two amendments, Nos. 94 and 95 to division A  of H.R. 7617. These two amendments would prohibit taxpayer money from  going to the Badr Organization and other murderous Iranian-backed  militias comprising the Popular Mobilization Units.   The Badr Organization, perhaps the largest and most murderous  Iranian-backed militia in Iraq, which has oppressed the people of Iran,  was founded by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps with the mandate  to export Iran's failing Islamic revolution.   They are controlled by the tyrannical regime in Tehran and have a  long history of involvement in attacks directly targeting Americans and  our NATO allies in Iraq. Their deranged leader proudly brags of his  involvement in the New Year's Eve attack on unarmed civilians at our  Embassy in Baghdad.   Badr and other cowardly Iranian-backed militias should not be the  beneficiaries of U.S. aid. They have blood on their hands, and the  American people should not be funding them.   I urge my colleagues to support these amendments and the underlying  bill.
