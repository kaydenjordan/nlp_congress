 Mr. Speaker, others before me have said why it matters that  we have working locks and dams. It has always mattered.   The United States has more miles of navigable rivers, lakes, and  canals than anywhere else in the world. It made us who we are as a  nation. We could move iron ore to make steel faster, cheaper, and  easier than all of our competitors because of our water, but especially  because of our locks and dams that control the water. So we need to fix  them, and this bill will help.   I hope that America will take note of something else here today,  which is that this Congress still works. It might not be as well as  people would want every single day, but this is a major bill. This is a  major infrastructure bill, and this is a major infrastructure bill that  has been bipartisan from the very beginning and, hopefully, will end  bipartisan when our friends in the Senate work with us to get this  done.   I want to give a special thanks to my Republican friend and colleague  from Texas (Mr. Babin). Together, we led a big group of Members from  both parties in support of a better way to fund these locks and dams.   I especially want to thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member  Graves, who agreed. Now we have a better chance to rebuild the locks  and dams and to deliver on the promise we made to the American people.
