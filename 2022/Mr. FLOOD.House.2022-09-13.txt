 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to wish Ken Stinson from Omaha,  Nebraska, a happy 80th birthday.   A Notre Dame grad, a degree in civil engineering, two tours in  Vietnam, a master's degree in civil engineering from Stanford, he had a  wonderful career with Peter Kiewit Sons in Omaha, one of the Nation's  largest general contractors.   He is an accomplished engineer credited with the McHenry Tube Tunnel  in the Baltimore Harbor, which more than 43 million vehicles pass  through annually.   He and his wife, Ann, live in Omaha with six children. He has changed  lives in the State of Nebraska through his public service and through  his philanthropy. Nebraska and America are a better place because of  it.   On behalf of the people of the First District of Nebraska, all  Nebraskans, and our Nation, a very happy birthday to Ken Stinson.                            ____________________
