 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 5387 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, on March 31 of this year, my two friends  Senator Joe Manchin and Senator Mark Kelly wrote to President Biden:         We are writing to urge you to develop and implement a new       5-year program for oil and gas production in the Gulf of       Mexico without delay.    My amendment would fulfill that request and make it a congressional  directive.    Mr. President, do I have any time left?    Mr. President, all my amendment does is to take Senator  Manchin's letter and Senator Kelly's letter--well-written, well- reasoned--and make it a congressional directive. That is all it does.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5387     Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 5385 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment, which I also offer on  behalf of many of my Republican colleagues, would substantially and  dramatically lower the cost of insulin for millions of Americans.   As you know, we have 1,403 federally qualified healthcare centers in  America, sometimes called community health centers. They have 16,000  sites of service.   My amendment would reimplement a rule that President Biden repealed.  My amendment would make insulin available at federally qualified health  centers for pennies on the dollar, and it would pay for itself by  redirecting existing money from the ObamaCare Public Health and  Prevention Fund.    Do I have any time left?    Thank you.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5385     I ask for the yeas and nays.
