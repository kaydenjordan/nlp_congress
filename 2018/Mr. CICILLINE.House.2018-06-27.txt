 Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act improved access  to quality healthcare for millions of Americans. One of the most  important protections in this law is that insurance companies can no  longer deny people coverage because they have a preexisting condition.   Millions of Americans with arthritis, cancer, diabetes, mental  illness, and other preexisting conditions have benefited from this  requirement. And that is why it is so disturbing that earlier this  month the Trump administration went to court to argue that insurance  companies should no longer have to cover people with preexisting  conditions.   If they succeed, it will further unravel the Affordable Care Act. It  will be harder for individuals and small businesses to buy health  insurance. Some experts believe that there will be even more Americans  without health coverage than ever before. This is wrong. The President  is putting the interests of health insurance companies and health  insurance company CEOs ahead of American consumers.   Republicans in Congress should be demanding that this President stop.  They should demand that their constituents have access to the best  healthcare possible, but, instead, they are silent in the face of a  President trying to take away coverage for preexisting medical  conditions.   It is wrong. We can do better.                            ____________________
