 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the  resolution of disapproval before us that would terminate President  Trump's phony national emergency.   President Trump's national emergency declaration, which he attempts  to justify using falsehoods about immigration and the Southern border,  presents a serious threat to the separation of powers and the rule of  law.   First I would like to speak about how there really isn't an emergency  at the border, then I would like to get into the constitutional  problems with the President's actions.   While illegal border crossings do occur, all of the numbers refute  President Trump's claim that there is a crisis at the border. Those  claims simply don't hold up.   Unauthorized border crossings have been at their lowest levels in  years.   In 2000, border agencies reported more than 1.6 million  apprehensions.   In 2017, the agency reported just 303,916 apprehensions, one-fifth of  the level just two decades ago.   It is clear that investments in border security have worked. Those  include additional border patrol agents, fencing in urban areas, ground  sensors, drones, and increased use of E-Verify.   In addition, since 2014, two-thirds of undocumented immigrants have  come to the United States legally but then overstayed their visas, more  than 500,000 per year. A border wall would do nothing to curb visa  overstays.   Dangerous criminals aren't overrunning our country.   Immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens. Data  collected in Texas show the arrest rate for undocumented immigrants in  2015 was 40 percent lower than for the native-born population.   Additionally, many immigrants are actually legally seeking asylum  through the process already in place. There are often families with  young  [[Page S1881]]  children fleeing persecution and violence in Central America who have a  legal right to petition our government for asylum.   Under current law, they can apply for asylum by presenting themselves  at a U.S. port of entry. Unfortunately, by focusing on a border wall  instead of investing in modernizing entry points, President Trump's  policies force many of these families to turn themselves into Border  Patrol in between ports and ask for asylum or wait for long periods in  Mexico in dangerous conditions.   The timing of the President's declaration also undercuts his claim  that this is an emergency.   President Trump kicked off his Presidential campaign nearly 4 years  ago by claiming that immigrants were bringing drugs and crime to the  United States. Despite this, he decided to wait until more than halfway  through his term to declare his emergency and only then after Congress  refused to give him the money he wanted.   If there were truly an emergency, the President should have declared  it on day 1. He did not.   Trump also emphatically rejected a bill that would have given him $25  billion for a border wall in exchange for providing Dreamers a path to  citizenship. Clearly, there was no emergency then either.   But the most clear statement that there is no emergency came from  President Trump himself, who after declaring the emergency, said this  in a Rose Garden speech: ``I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do  it much faster.''   We shouldn't judge the President's attempt to divert appropriated  funds to his border wall through a partisan lens, but rather view it as  a radical departure from our constitutional separation of powers.   Through its appropriations clause, the Constitution provides  Congress, not the President, with the power of the purse. Congress  decides how to spend taxpayer dollars.   By providing Congress with this power, our Founding Fathers imposed a  key check on the President, a check that President Trump is trying to  do away with.   Congress exercised its power of the purse last month in a spending  bill to keep the government open by including $1.35 billion for border  barriers, rather than the $6 billion the President sought for a border  wall.   The Constitution gave the President two options at that point: sign  the bill or veto it. President Trump tried to create a third path,  saying he would sign the bill but still divert additional Federal  dollars to the wall, his so-called emergency.   In essence, the President decided to violate the Constitution so he  could more quickly fulfill a campaign promise to build his border wall.   One of the ironies of President Trump's decision to divert funds to a  border wall that won't stop drugs or crossings is the pots of money  from which he is drawing.   First, the White House said it would pull $2.5 billion from a  counternarcotics program that is used to support international law  enforcement interdiction and apprehension efforts, as well as to fund  National Guard support for State drug law enforcement operations,  including in California.   Second, the White House said it would take another $3.5 billion from  military construction projects.   These are programs that actually help improve our national security,  and the President wants to take billions of dollars from them to build  a wall--incredible.   The long-term danger here is that President Trump will set a  precedent that a Commander in Chief can interpret the Nation's laws and  the Constitution any way he wants. This can't be allowed to stand.   The National Emergencies Act of 1976 does allow the President to  reprogram funds appropriated by Congress in case of a national  emergency, like a hurricane or earthquake, but it is clear that the law  was never intended to be used to explicitly overrule the will of  Congress, which is how President Trump wants to use it.   During the Korean war, the Supreme Court struck down a similar  attempt by President Truman to use emergency powers to seize privately  owned steel mills, an action inconsistent with laws passed by Congress.   Even if there were an emergency--which there isn't--President Trump  still wouldn't have the authority to reprogram Federal funds in this  context.   Specifically, the statute that President Trump relies on, 10 U.S.C.  Sec. 2808, allows the President, in a national emergency that  ``requires the use of the armed forces,'' to spend unobligated military  construction funds for military construction projects ``that are  necessary to support . . . use of the armed forces.''   The situation at the border does not ``require the use of the armed  forces,'' and it is unclear how the wall would be ``necessary to  support'' them.   If anything, the President's use of the military at the border to  enforce the law raises additional questions under the Posse Comitatus  Act, which has prohibited the use of the Armed Forces for domestic law  enforcement for well over a century.   In sum, President Trump is relying on an incredibly frail legal  argument to justify this blatant power grab. It is incumbent upon  Congress to hold this President accountable as he attempts to seize one  of our most important powers.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval and  cancel President Trump's phony emergency.   Thank you.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private  immigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident  status to Adilene Martinez, who is originally from Mexico but has been  living in California for over 20 years. I believe she merits Congress'  special consideration for this extraordinary form of relief.   Adilene, age 30, was brought to the United States by her parents Jose  Alberto Martinez Moreno and Micaela Lopez Martinez. When Jose came to  the United States from Mexico, he began working as a busboy in  restaurants in San Francisco, California. In 1990, he started working  as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award-winning Italian restaurant in San  Francisco.   Jose and his wife, Micaela, call San Francisco home. Micaela is a  homemaker and part-time housekeeper. They have three daughters, two of  whom are United States citizens. Their oldest daughter, Adilene, is  undocumented and is currently working at the San Francisco Opera House.  Adilene attempted to legalize her status through several channels with  her family, but the current green card backlog for relatives from  Mexico is very long.   In 2002, the Martinez family applied for political asylum. Their  application was denied. An immigration judge denied their subsequent  application for cancellation of removal. The Martinez family has become  an integral part of their community in California. They are active in  their faith community. They volunteer with community-based  organizations and are, in turn, supported by their community. When I  first introduced this bill, I received dozens of letters of support  from their fellow parishioners, teachers, and members of their  community.   The Martinez family truly exemplifies the American dream. Jose worked  his way through the restaurant industry to become a chef and an  indispensable employee at a renowned restaurant. With great dedication,  Micaela has worked hard to raise three daughters who are advancing  their education and look forward to continuing the pursuit of their  goals.   I believe that Adilene's continued presence in the United States  would allow them to continue making significant contributions to their  community in California. I ask my colleagues to support this private  bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 794         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Alfredo Plascencia Lopez; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to  provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez,  a Mexican national who lives in the San Bruno area of California.   I offer legislation on his behalf because I believe that, without it,  this hardworking man, wife who is a lawful permanent resident, and  children would face extreme hardship. His children would either face  separation from their father or be forced to leave the only country  they know and give up the education they are pursuing in the United  States.   Alfredo and his wife, Maria, have been in the United States for over  20 years. They worked for years to adjust their status through  appropriate legal channels, but poor legal representation ruined their  opportunities.   The Plascencias' lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise  communicate with them in any way. He also failed to forward crucial  immigration documents. Because of the poor representation they  received, Alfredo only became aware that they had been ordered to leave  the United States 15 days prior to his scheduled deportation.   Alfredo was shocked to learn of his attorney's malfeasance, but he  acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and filed the appropriate  paperwork to delay his deportation and determine if any other legal  action could be taken.   Together, Alfredo and Maria have used their professional successes,  with the assistance of private bills, to realize many of the goals  dreamed of by all Americans. They have worked hard, and saved up to buy  their home.   Their oldest child, Christina, is 28 years old and is currently a  paralegal. Erika, age 24, serves in the United States Air Force and  hopes to one day become a police officer. Danny, age 24, currently  attends the University of California and volunteers at his local  homeless shelter in the soup kitchen. Daisy, age 17, and Juan Pablo,  age 13, are all in school and plan on attending college.   Allowing Alfredo to remain in the United States is necessary to  enable his family to continue thriving in the United States. His  children are dedicated to pursuing their education and being productive  members of their community. I do not believe that Alfredo should be  separated from his family. I am reintroducing this legislation to  protect the best interest of Alfredo's U.S. citizen children and his  wife, who is a lawful permanent resident. I believe that Alfredo will  continue to make positive contributions to his community in California  and this country. I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 795         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ALFREDO PLASCENCIA                     LOPEZ.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of       section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1151), Alfredo Plascencia Lopez shall be eligible for the       issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to       that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence       upon filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa       under section 204 of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for       adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.        (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Alfredo Plascencia Lopez       enters the United States before the filing deadline specified       in subsection (c), Alfredo Plascencia Lopez shall be       considered to have entered and remained lawfully and shall be       eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of       immigrant visas or the application for adjustment of status       are filed with appropriate fees within two years after the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting       of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Alfredo       Plascencia Lopez, the Secretary of State shall instruct the       proper officer to reduce by one, during the current or next       following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Alfredo       Plascencia Lopez under section 203(a) of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Alfredo Plascencia Lopez under section 202(e) of that Act (8       U.S.C. 1152(e)).        (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the       purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of       2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest       statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''       for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,       provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the       vote on passage.                                   ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 796. A bill for the relief of Ruben Mkoian and Asmik Karapetian;  to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce private relief  legislation in the 116th Congress on behalf of Ruben Mkoian and Asmik  Karapetian. The Mkoian family has been living in Fresno, California,  for over 20 years. I continue to believe this family deserves Congress'  special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a  private bill.   The Mkoian family is originally from Armenia. They decided to leave  Armenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several  incidents in which the family experienced harassment, vandalism and  threats to their well-being.   In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing.  At one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which  he refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later  learned that a co-worker had registered the vehicles at the request of  the same chief.   After Ruben reported the bribe offer to illegally register vehicles  and said he'd call the police, his family store was vandalized and he  received threatening phone calls telling him to keep quiet. A bottle of  gasoline was thrown into his family's residence, burning it to the  ground. In April 1992, several men entered the family store and  assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.   Ruben, Asmik, and their son Arthur, who was 3 years old at the time,  left Armenia and entered the United States on visitor visas. They  applied for political asylum that same year on the  [[Page S1903]]  grounds that they would be subject to physical attacks if returned to  Armenia. It took 16 years for their case to be finalized, with the  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denying their asylum case in January  2008.   At this time, Ruben and Asmik have exhausted every option to obtain  immigration relief in the United States. It would be a terrible shame  to remove this family from the United States and to separate them from  their son Arsen, who is 20 years old and a U.S. citizen. The Mkoians  have worked hard to build a place for their family in California and  are an integral part of their community.   The family attends St. Paul Armenian Apostolic Church in Fresno. They  do charity work to send medical equipment to Armenia. Ruben works as a  driver for Uber. He previously worked as a manager at a car wash in  Fresno and as a truck driver for a California trucking company that  described him as ``trustworthy,'' ``knowledgeable,'' and an asset to  the company. Asmik has worked as a medical assistant the past 6 years  at the Fresno Shield Medical Center.   Reflecting their contributions to their community, Representatives  George Radanovich (R-CA) and Jim Costa (D-CA) strongly supported this  family's ability to remain in the United States. When I first  introduced a private bill for the Mkoian family, I received more than  200 letters of support and dozens of calls of support from friends and  community members, attesting to the positive impact that this family  has had in Fresno, California.   I believe that this case warrants our compassion. I respectfully ask  my colleagues to support this private legislation on behalf of the  Mkoian family.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 796         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR RUBEN MKOIAN AND                     ASMIK KARAPETIAN.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of       section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1151), Ruben Mkoian and Asmik Karapetian shall each be       eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa or for       adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted       for permanent residence upon filing an application for       issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such Act       (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of status to lawful       permanent resident.        (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Ruben Mkoian or Asmik       Karapetian enters the United States before the filing       deadline specified in subsection (c), Ruben Mkoian or Asmik       Karapetian, as appropriate, shall be considered to have       entered and remained lawfully in the United States and shall       be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the application for the issuance of       an immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status       is filed with appropriate fees not later than two years after       the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an       immigrant visa or permanent resident status to Ruben Mkoian       and Asmik Karapetian, the Secretary of State shall instruct       the proper officer to reduce by two, during the current or       next following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Ruben Mkoian       and Asmik Karapetian under section 203(a) of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Ruben Mkoian and Asmik Karapetian under section 202(e) of       such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).

A bill for the relief of Shirley Constantino Tan; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for  the private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina  national living in Pacifica, California. She is the proud mother of 20- year-old U.S. citizen twin boys, Jashley and Joriene, and the spouse of  Jay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.   I believe Ms. Tan merits Congress' special consideration for this  extraordinary form of relief because her removal from the United States  would cause undue hardship for her and her family. She faces  deportation to the Philippines, which would separate her from her  family and jeopardize her safety.   Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence in the Philippines before she  left to come to the United States. When she was only 14 years old, her  cousin murdered her mother and her sister and shot Shirley in the head.  While the cousin who committed the murders was eventually prosecuted,  he received a short jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, Ms. Tan fled  the Philippines just before her cousin was due to be released from  jail. She entered the United States legally on a visitor's visa in  1989.   Ms. Tan's current deportation order is the result of negligent  counsel. She applied for asylum in 1995. While her case appeal was  pending at the Board of Immigration Appeals, her attorney failed to  submit a brief to support her case. As a result, the case was  dismissed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals granted Shirley  voluntary departure from the United States.   Ms. Tan never received notice that the Board of Immigration Appeals  granted her voluntary departure. Her attorney moved offices, did not  receive the order, and ultimately never informed her of the order. As a  result, Ms. Tan did not depart the United States and the grant of  voluntary departure automatically led to a removal order. She learned  about the deportation order for the first time on January 28, 2009,  when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took her into  immigration custody.   Because of her attorney's negligent actions, Ms. Tan was denied the  opportunity to present her case in immigration proceedings. She later  filed a complaint with the State Bar of California against her former  attorney. She is not the first person to file such a complaint against  this attorney.   On February 4, 2015, Ms. Tan's spouse, Jay, a U.S. Citizen, filed an  approved spousal petition on her behalf. On August 20, 2015, U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services denied her application due to the  fact that she still had a final order or removal. Ms. Tan must go back  to the immigration court and ask for the court to terminate her case  and then reapply for her green card. Ms. Tan is now again facing the  threat of deportation while she seeks to close her case before an  immigration court.   In addition to the hardship that would come to Ms. Tan if she is  deported, her deportation would cause serious hardship to her two  United States citizen children, Jashley and Joriene.   Joriene is a junior at Stanford University and is pre-Med, majoring  in Human Biology. In addition to his studies, Joriene is involved in  Stanford's Pilipino-American Student Union. Jashley is a junior at  Chapman University, majoring in Business Administration. Ms. Tan no  longer runs her in-home daycare and is a homemaker.   If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the United States, her family has  expressed that they would go with her to the Philippines or try to find  a third country where the entire family could relocate. This would mean  that Jashley and Joriene would have to leave behind their education and  the only home they know in the United States.   I do not believe it is in our Nation's best interest to force this  family, with two United States citizen children, to make the choice  between being separated and relocating to a country where they may face  safety concerns or other serious hardships.   Ms. Tan and her family are involved in their community in Pacifica  and own their own home. The family attends Good Shepherd Catholic  Church, volunteering at the church and the Mother Theresa of Calcutta's  Daughters of Charity. Ms. Tan has the support of dozens of members of  her community who have shared with me the family's spirit of commitment  to their community.  [[Page S1904]]    Enactment of the legislation I am introducing on behalf of Ms. Tan  today will enable this entire family to continue their lives in  California and make positive contributions to their community. Mr.  President, I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be included in the  Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 797         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria  Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola; to  the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, today, I offer private immigration  relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to  Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola  Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola. The Arreolas are Mexican nationals  living in the Fresno area of California.   Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived in the United States for over 20  years. Two of their 5 children, Nayely and Cindy also stand to benefit  from this legislation. The other 3 Arreola children, Robert, age 27,  Daniel, age 22, and Saray, age 22, are United States citizens. The  story of the Arreola family is compelling and I believe they merit  Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of  relief as a private bill.   The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous  errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been  disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it  compelled an immigration judge to write to the Executive Office of  Immigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in  his clients' immigration cases.   Esidronio came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural  migrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a  migrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent  residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) program, had  he known about it.   Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became  pregnant with her daughter Cindy. She returned to Mexico to give birth  because she wanted to avoid any immigration issues.   Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United  States, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of  deportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United  States legally. However, the poor legal representation they received  foreclosed this opportunity.   One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this  private bill is the devastating impact the deportation of Esidronio and  Maria Elena would have on their children-3 of whom are American  citizens--and the other 2 who have lived in the United States since  they were toddlers. America is the only country the Arreola children  have ever known.   Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high  school and the first to graduate college. She recently received her  Masters in Business Administration from Fresno Pacific University, a  regionally ranked university, and now works in the admissions office.  Nayely is married and has a young son named Elijah Ace Carlos.   At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals  of citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her  full potential both through her academic endeavors and community  service. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific  University States in a letter of support, ``[T]he leaders of Fresno  Pacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become  exemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''   In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual  Determination, AVID, college preparatory program in which students  commit to determining their own futures through attaining a college  degree. Nayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service  organization. Perhaps the greatest hardship to Nayely's U.S. citizen  husband and child, if she were forced to return to Mexico, would be her  lost opportunity to realize her dreams and contribute further to her  community and to this country.   Nayely's sister, Cindy, is also married and has a 7-year-old daughter  and a 5-year-old son. Neither Nayely nor Cindy is eligible to  automatically adjust their status based on their marriages because of  their initial unlawful entry.   The Arreolas also have other family who are United States citizens or  lawful permanent residents of this country. Maria Elena has 3 brothers  who are American citizens, and Esidronio has a sister who is an  American citizen. They have no immediate family in Mexico.   According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any  problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their  taxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked  hard to support themselves.   As I mentioned, Esidronio was previously employed as a farm worker,  but now has his own business in California repairing electronics. His  business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home  for his family. He and his wife are active in their church community  and in their children's education.   It is clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream.  Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the  Arreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their  community as well as the United States. I ask my colleagues to support  this private bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 798         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ESIDRONIO ARREOLA-                    SAUCEDO, MARIA ELENA COBIAN ARREOLA, NAYELY                     ARREOLA CARLOS, AND CINDY JAEL ARREOLA.

(b) Adjustment of Status.--If Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo,       Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy       Jael Arreola enter the United States before the filing       deadline specified in subsection (c), Esidronio Arreola-      Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos,       and Cindy Jael Arreola shall be considered to have entered       and remained lawfully in the United States and shall be       eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the applications for issuance of       immigrant visas or the applications for adjustment of status       are filed with appropriate fees not later than two years       after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting       of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Esidronio       Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola       Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola, the Secretary of State shall       instruct the proper officer to reduce by four, during the       current or next following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Esidronio       Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola       Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola under section 203(a) of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely       Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola under section 202(e)       of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).

A bill to permit the televising of Supreme Court proceedings;  to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing private  immigration relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident  status to Adilene Martinez, who is originally from Mexico but has been  living in California for over 20 years. I believe she merits Congress'  special consideration for this extraordinary form of relief.   Adilene, age 30, was brought to the United States by her parents Jose  Alberto Martinez Moreno and Micaela Lopez Martinez. When Jose came to  the United States from Mexico, he began working as a busboy in  restaurants in San Francisco, California. In 1990, he started working  as a cook at Palio D'Asti, an award-winning Italian restaurant in San  Francisco.   Jose and his wife, Micaela, call San Francisco home. Micaela is a  homemaker and part-time housekeeper. They have three daughters, two of  whom are United States citizens. Their oldest daughter, Adilene, is  undocumented and is currently working at the San Francisco Opera House.  Adilene attempted to legalize her status through several channels with  her family, but the current green card backlog for relatives from  Mexico is very long.   In 2002, the Martinez family applied for political asylum. Their  application was denied. An immigration judge denied their subsequent  application for cancellation of removal. The Martinez family has become  an integral part of their community in California. They are active in  their faith community. They volunteer with community-based  organizations and are, in turn, supported by their community. When I  first introduced this bill, I received dozens of letters of support  from their fellow parishioners, teachers, and members of their  community.   The Martinez family truly exemplifies the American dream. Jose worked  his way through the restaurant industry to become a chef and an  indispensable employee at a renowned restaurant. With great dedication,  Micaela has worked hard to raise three daughters who are advancing  their education and look forward to continuing the pursuit of their  goals.   I believe that Adilene's continued presence in the United States  would allow them to continue making significant contributions to their  community in California. I ask my colleagues to support this private  bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 794         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JOSE ALBERTO                     MARTINEZ MORENO, MICAELA LOPEZ MARTINEZ, AND                     ADILENE MARTINEZ.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of       section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1151), Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, Micaela  [[Page S1902]]       Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez shall each be eligible       for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status       to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence       upon filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa       under section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for       adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.        (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno,       Micaela Lopez Martinez, or Adilene Martinez enters the United       States before the filing deadline specified in subsection       (c), Jose Alberto Martinez Moreno, Micaela Lopez Martinez, or       Adilene Martinez shall be considered to have entered and       remained lawfully in the United States and shall be eligible       for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the applications for issuance of       immigrant visas or the applications for adjustment of status       are filed with appropriate fees not later than two years       after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting       of immigrant visas or permanent resident status to Jose       Alberto Martinez Moreno, Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene       Martinez, the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper       officer to reduce by three, during the current or next       following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Jose Alberto       Martinez Moreno, Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene Martinez       under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act       (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of Jose       Alberto Martinez Moreno, Micaela Lopez Martinez, and Adilene       Martinez under section 202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).        (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the       purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of       2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest       statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''       for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,       provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the       vote on passage.                                   ______    Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to  provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez,  a Mexican national who lives in the San Bruno area of California.   I offer legislation on his behalf because I believe that, without it,  this hardworking man, wife who is a lawful permanent resident, and  children would face extreme hardship. His children would either face  separation from their father or be forced to leave the only country  they know and give up the education they are pursuing in the United  States.   Alfredo and his wife, Maria, have been in the United States for over  20 years. They worked for years to adjust their status through  appropriate legal channels, but poor legal representation ruined their  opportunities.   The Plascencias' lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise  communicate with them in any way. He also failed to forward crucial  immigration documents. Because of the poor representation they  received, Alfredo only became aware that they had been ordered to leave  the United States 15 days prior to his scheduled deportation.   Alfredo was shocked to learn of his attorney's malfeasance, but he  acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and filed the appropriate  paperwork to delay his deportation and determine if any other legal  action could be taken.   Together, Alfredo and Maria have used their professional successes,  with the assistance of private bills, to realize many of the goals  dreamed of by all Americans. They have worked hard, and saved up to buy  their home.   Their oldest child, Christina, is 28 years old and is currently a  paralegal. Erika, age 24, serves in the United States Air Force and  hopes to one day become a police officer. Danny, age 24, currently  attends the University of California and volunteers at his local  homeless shelter in the soup kitchen. Daisy, age 17, and Juan Pablo,  age 13, are all in school and plan on attending college.   Allowing Alfredo to remain in the United States is necessary to  enable his family to continue thriving in the United States. His  children are dedicated to pursuing their education and being productive  members of their community. I do not believe that Alfredo should be  separated from his family. I am reintroducing this legislation to  protect the best interest of Alfredo's U.S. citizen children and his  wife, who is a lawful permanent resident. I believe that Alfredo will  continue to make positive contributions to his community in California  and this country. I respectfully ask my colleagues to support this  bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 795         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ALFREDO PLASCENCIA                     LOPEZ.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of       section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1151), Alfredo Plascencia Lopez shall be eligible for the       issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to       that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence       upon filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa       under section 204 of that Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for       adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.        (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Alfredo Plascencia Lopez       enters the United States before the filing deadline specified       in subsection (c), Alfredo Plascencia Lopez shall be       considered to have entered and remained lawfully and shall be       eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of       immigrant visas or the application for adjustment of status       are filed with appropriate fees within two years after the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting       of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Alfredo       Plascencia Lopez, the Secretary of State shall instruct the       proper officer to reduce by one, during the current or next       following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Alfredo       Plascencia Lopez under section 203(a) of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Alfredo Plascencia Lopez under section 202(e) of that Act (8       U.S.C. 1152(e)).        (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the       purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of       2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest       statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''       for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,       provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the       vote on passage.                                   ______    Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce private relief  legislation in the 116th Congress on behalf of Ruben Mkoian and Asmik  Karapetian. The Mkoian family has been living in Fresno, California,  for over 20 years. I continue to believe this family deserves Congress'  special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a  private bill.   The Mkoian family is originally from Armenia. They decided to leave  Armenia for the United States in the early 1990s, following several  incidents in which the family experienced harassment, vandalism and  threats to their well-being.   In Armenia, Ruben worked as a police sergeant on vehicle licensing.  At one point, he was offered a bribe to register stolen vehicles, which  he refused and reported to his superior, the police chief. He later  learned that a co-worker had registered the vehicles at the request of  the same chief.   After Ruben reported the bribe offer to illegally register vehicles  and said he'd call the police, his family store was vandalized and he  received threatening phone calls telling him to keep quiet. A bottle of  gasoline was thrown into his family's residence, burning it to the  ground. In April 1992, several men entered the family store and  assaulted Ruben, hospitalizing him for 22 days.   Ruben, Asmik, and their son Arthur, who was 3 years old at the time,  left Armenia and entered the United States on visitor visas. They  applied for political asylum that same year on the  [[Page S1903]]  grounds that they would be subject to physical attacks if returned to  Armenia. It took 16 years for their case to be finalized, with the  Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denying their asylum case in January  2008.   At this time, Ruben and Asmik have exhausted every option to obtain  immigration relief in the United States. It would be a terrible shame  to remove this family from the United States and to separate them from  their son Arsen, who is 20 years old and a U.S. citizen. The Mkoians  have worked hard to build a place for their family in California and  are an integral part of their community.   The family attends St. Paul Armenian Apostolic Church in Fresno. They  do charity work to send medical equipment to Armenia. Ruben works as a  driver for Uber. He previously worked as a manager at a car wash in  Fresno and as a truck driver for a California trucking company that  described him as ``trustworthy,'' ``knowledgeable,'' and an asset to  the company. Asmik has worked as a medical assistant the past 6 years  at the Fresno Shield Medical Center.   Reflecting their contributions to their community, Representatives  George Radanovich (R-CA) and Jim Costa (D-CA) strongly supported this  family's ability to remain in the United States. When I first  introduced a private bill for the Mkoian family, I received more than  200 letters of support and dozens of calls of support from friends and  community members, attesting to the positive impact that this family  has had in Fresno, California.   I believe that this case warrants our compassion. I respectfully ask  my colleagues to support this private legislation on behalf of the  Mkoian family.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 796         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR RUBEN MKOIAN AND                     ASMIK KARAPETIAN.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of       section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1151), Ruben Mkoian and Asmik Karapetian shall each be       eligible for the issuance of an immigrant visa or for       adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted       for permanent residence upon filing an application for       issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such Act       (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of status to lawful       permanent resident.        (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Ruben Mkoian or Asmik       Karapetian enters the United States before the filing       deadline specified in subsection (c), Ruben Mkoian or Asmik       Karapetian, as appropriate, shall be considered to have       entered and remained lawfully in the United States and shall       be eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the application for the issuance of       an immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status       is filed with appropriate fees not later than two years after       the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon granting an       immigrant visa or permanent resident status to Ruben Mkoian       and Asmik Karapetian, the Secretary of State shall instruct       the proper officer to reduce by two, during the current or       next following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Ruben Mkoian       and Asmik Karapetian under section 203(a) of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Ruben Mkoian and Asmik Karapetian under section 202(e) of       such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).        (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the       purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of       2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest       statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''       for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,       provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the       vote on passage.                                  ______    Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for  the private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina  national living in Pacifica, California. She is the proud mother of 20- year-old U.S. citizen twin boys, Jashley and Joriene, and the spouse of  Jay Mercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.   I believe Ms. Tan merits Congress' special consideration for this  extraordinary form of relief because her removal from the United States  would cause undue hardship for her and her family. She faces  deportation to the Philippines, which would separate her from her  family and jeopardize her safety.   Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence in the Philippines before she  left to come to the United States. When she was only 14 years old, her  cousin murdered her mother and her sister and shot Shirley in the head.  While the cousin who committed the murders was eventually prosecuted,  he received a short jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, Ms. Tan fled  the Philippines just before her cousin was due to be released from  jail. She entered the United States legally on a visitor's visa in  1989.   Ms. Tan's current deportation order is the result of negligent  counsel. She applied for asylum in 1995. While her case appeal was  pending at the Board of Immigration Appeals, her attorney failed to  submit a brief to support her case. As a result, the case was  dismissed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals granted Shirley  voluntary departure from the United States.   Ms. Tan never received notice that the Board of Immigration Appeals  granted her voluntary departure. Her attorney moved offices, did not  receive the order, and ultimately never informed her of the order. As a  result, Ms. Tan did not depart the United States and the grant of  voluntary departure automatically led to a removal order. She learned  about the deportation order for the first time on January 28, 2009,  when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took her into  immigration custody.   Because of her attorney's negligent actions, Ms. Tan was denied the  opportunity to present her case in immigration proceedings. She later  filed a complaint with the State Bar of California against her former  attorney. She is not the first person to file such a complaint against  this attorney.   On February 4, 2015, Ms. Tan's spouse, Jay, a U.S. Citizen, filed an  approved spousal petition on her behalf. On August 20, 2015, U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services denied her application due to the  fact that she still had a final order or removal. Ms. Tan must go back  to the immigration court and ask for the court to terminate her case  and then reapply for her green card. Ms. Tan is now again facing the  threat of deportation while she seeks to close her case before an  immigration court.   In addition to the hardship that would come to Ms. Tan if she is  deported, her deportation would cause serious hardship to her two  United States citizen children, Jashley and Joriene.   Joriene is a junior at Stanford University and is pre-Med, majoring  in Human Biology. In addition to his studies, Joriene is involved in  Stanford's Pilipino-American Student Union. Jashley is a junior at  Chapman University, majoring in Business Administration. Ms. Tan no  longer runs her in-home daycare and is a homemaker.   If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the United States, her family has  expressed that they would go with her to the Philippines or try to find  a third country where the entire family could relocate. This would mean  that Jashley and Joriene would have to leave behind their education and  the only home they know in the United States.   I do not believe it is in our Nation's best interest to force this  family, with two United States citizen children, to make the choice  between being separated and relocating to a country where they may face  safety concerns or other serious hardships.   Ms. Tan and her family are involved in their community in Pacifica  and own their own home. The family attends Good Shepherd Catholic  Church, volunteering at the church and the Mother Theresa of Calcutta's  Daughters of Charity. Ms. Tan has the support of dozens of members of  her community who have shared with me the family's spirit of commitment  to their community.  [[Page S1904]]    Enactment of the legislation I am introducing on behalf of Ms. Tan  today will enable this entire family to continue their lives in  California and make positive contributions to their community. Mr.  President, I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be included in the  Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 797         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SHIRLEY CONSTANTINO                     TAN.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of       section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1151), Shirley Constantino Tan shall be eligible for issuance       of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of       an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon       filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under       section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of       status to lawful permanent resident.        (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Shirley Constantino Tan       enters the United States before the filing deadline specified       in subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered       and remained lawfully and shall be eligible for adjustment of       status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality       Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the enactment of this       Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the application for issuance of an       immigrant visa or the application for adjustment of status is       filed with appropriate fees within two years after the date       of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting       of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Shirley       Constantino Tan, the Secretary of State shall instruct the       proper officer to reduce by one, during the current or next       following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Shirley       Constantino Tan under section 203(a) of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Shirley Constantino Tan under section 202(e) of such Act (8       U.S.C. 1152(e)).        (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the       purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of       2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest       statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''       for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,       provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the       vote on passage.                                  ______    Mr. President, today, I offer private immigration  relief legislation to provide lawful permanent resident status to  Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola  Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola. The Arreolas are Mexican nationals  living in the Fresno area of California.   Esidronio and Maria Elena have lived in the United States for over 20  years. Two of their 5 children, Nayely and Cindy also stand to benefit  from this legislation. The other 3 Arreola children, Robert, age 27,  Daniel, age 22, and Saray, age 22, are United States citizens. The  story of the Arreola family is compelling and I believe they merit  Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of  relief as a private bill.   The Arreolas are facing deportation in part because of grievous  errors committed by their previous counsel, who has since been  disbarred. In fact, the attorney's conduct was so egregious that it  compelled an immigration judge to write to the Executive Office of  Immigration Review seeking the attorney's disbarment for his actions in  his clients' immigration cases.   Esidronio came to the United States in 1986 and was an agricultural  migrant worker in the fields of California for several years. As a  migrant worker at that time, he would have been eligible for permanent  residence through the Seasonal Agricultural Workers (SAW) program, had  he known about it.   Maria Elena was living in the United States at the time she became  pregnant with her daughter Cindy. She returned to Mexico to give birth  because she wanted to avoid any immigration issues.   Because of the length of time that the Arreolas were in the United  States, it is likely that they would have qualified for suspension of  deportation, which would have allowed them to remain in the United  States legally. However, the poor legal representation they received  foreclosed this opportunity.   One of the most compelling reasons for my introduction of this  private bill is the devastating impact the deportation of Esidronio and  Maria Elena would have on their children-3 of whom are American  citizens--and the other 2 who have lived in the United States since  they were toddlers. America is the only country the Arreola children  have ever known.   Nayely, the oldest, was the first in her family to graduate from high  school and the first to graduate college. She recently received her  Masters in Business Administration from Fresno Pacific University, a  regionally ranked university, and now works in the admissions office.  Nayely is married and has a young son named Elijah Ace Carlos.   At a young age, Nayely demonstrated a strong commitment to the ideals  of citizenship in her adopted country. She worked hard to achieve her  full potential both through her academic endeavors and community  service. As the Associate Dean of Enrollment Services at Fresno Pacific  University States in a letter of support, ``[T]he leaders of Fresno  Pacific University saw in Nayely, a young person who will become  exemplary of all that is good in the American dream.''   In high school, Nayely was a member of Advancement Via Individual  Determination, AVID, college preparatory program in which students  commit to determining their own futures through attaining a college  degree. Nayely was also President of the Key Club, a community service  organization. Perhaps the greatest hardship to Nayely's U.S. citizen  husband and child, if she were forced to return to Mexico, would be her  lost opportunity to realize her dreams and contribute further to her  community and to this country.   Nayely's sister, Cindy, is also married and has a 7-year-old daughter  and a 5-year-old son. Neither Nayely nor Cindy is eligible to  automatically adjust their status based on their marriages because of  their initial unlawful entry.   The Arreolas also have other family who are United States citizens or  lawful permanent residents of this country. Maria Elena has 3 brothers  who are American citizens, and Esidronio has a sister who is an  American citizen. They have no immediate family in Mexico.   According to immigration authorities, this family has never had any  problems with law enforcement. I am told that they have filed their  taxes for every year from 1990 to the present. They have always worked  hard to support themselves.   As I mentioned, Esidronio was previously employed as a farm worker,  but now has his own business in California repairing electronics. His  business has been successful enough to enable him to purchase a home  for his family. He and his wife are active in their church community  and in their children's education.   It is clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream.  Enactment of the legislation I have reintroduced today will enable the  Arreolas to continue to make significant contributions to their  community as well as the United States. I ask my colleagues to support  this private bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 798         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR ESIDRONIO ARREOLA-                    SAUCEDO, MARIA ELENA COBIAN ARREOLA, NAYELY                     ARREOLA CARLOS, AND CINDY JAEL ARREOLA.         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of       section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1151), Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola,       Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola shall each be       eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or for adjustment       of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent       residence upon  [[Page S1905]]       filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under       section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of       status to lawful permanent resident.        (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo,       Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos, and Cindy       Jael Arreola enter the United States before the filing       deadline specified in subsection (c), Esidronio Arreola-      Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola Carlos,       and Cindy Jael Arreola shall be considered to have entered       and remained lawfully in the United States and shall be       eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the       date of the enactment of this Act.        (c) Application and Payment of Fees.--Subsections (a) and       (b) shall apply only if the applications for issuance of       immigrant visas or the applications for adjustment of status       are filed with appropriate fees not later than two years       after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Numbers.--Upon the granting       of immigrant visas or permanent residence to Esidronio       Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola       Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola, the Secretary of State shall       instruct the proper officer to reduce by four, during the       current or next following fiscal year--        (1) the total number of immigrant visas that are made       available to natives of the country of birth of Esidronio       Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely Arreola       Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola under section 203(a) of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)); or        (2) if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that       are made available to natives of the country of birth of       Esidronio Arreola-Saucedo, Maria Elena Cobian Arreola, Nayely       Arreola Carlos, and Cindy Jael Arreola under section 202(e)       of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).        (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the       purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of       2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest       statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation''       for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional       Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee,       provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the       vote on passage.                                  ______
