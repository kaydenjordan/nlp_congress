 Mr. President, I wish to recognize Purple Heart recipient  Mr. Ricky Raley for his valiant service in the Indiana National Guard  Alpha Company, Task Force 1-151. Also known as the Avengers, Task Force  1-151 covered more than 250,000 miles in convoy escorts and were  continuously involved in combat operations during Operation Iraqi  Freedom.   Ricky served in Iraq from 2007 to 2008 and was stationed near Tikrit  at COB Speicher. He served as a lead gun truckdriver for various  patrols and security missions. In 2008, Ricky's truck activated an  improvised explosive device, leaving Ricky with sustained traumatic  brain injuries.   On April 17, 2009, Ricky was involved in a car accident causing  paralysis from the waist down. Since then, Ricky has joined the Boot  Campaign, a nonprofit organization providing life-improving programs  for veterans and military families. He also works with the Paralyzed  Veterans of America, serving on the board of directors for the  Kentucky-Indiana Chapter.   To remain active, Ricky has become a devoted handcyclist, training up  to 6 days a week. Currently, Ricky is  [[Page S5718]]  handbiking from New York to Florida, covering 1,500 miles in 14 days to  raise awareness for veterans across the Nation.   As a marine, it is with overwhelming pride that I recognize Ricky for  his service to this country. As his journey progresses, I wish him the  best of luck, and I look forward to his further contributions to our  veterans and the great Hoosier State.                            ____________________
