 Mr. Speaker, this week, I join dozens of communities  across the Nation that are celebrating the 10th annual Latino  Conservation Week. Today, I want to take the time to honor a remarkable  leader and Hispanic conservation pioneer of New Mexico, Mr. Kent  Salazar.   Kent has made it his life's mission to ensure those places that are  so special to us in New Mexico and across the West are conserved and  accessible to all.   The Honorable Kent Salazar made an impact as the director of  environmental health for the city of Albuquerque, serving on the New  Mexico Climate Change Task Force, as president of the New Mexico  Wildlife Federation, as chair of the National Wildlife Federation, and  was appointed by President Barack Obama to chair the Valles Caldera  National Trust.   Kent also founded Hispanics Enjoying Camping, Hunting, and the  Outdoors, or HECHO, a testament to his  [[Page H3649]]  leadership in creating diversity in the outdoors.   More importantly, Kent is a friend to all New Mexicans, a fearless  champion of diversity, an accomplished hunter and outdoorsman, and one  of my very good friends, someone who opened doors for me and so many  others.   I thank Kent for what he has done for our State and for young  conservationists like myself. His work will have a lasting impact for  generations. May we carry his spirit forward with the same passion and  commitment that has defined his extraordinary life.   ``Muchas gracias,'' ``Thank you very much.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, at the appropriate time I will offer a  motion to recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules  permitted, I would have offered the motion with an important amendment  to this bill.   My amendment would insert the text of the bipartisan American Dream  and Promise Act, which provides a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers.  This is an issue that Congress has failed to address, although my  colleagues on the other side have continuously committed to supporting  this bill.   Now, I find the response from some of our colleagues comical when  they are so deathly afraid of immigrant children in our schools, but  yet, when they are serviced by undocumented immigrants in the hotels  that they stay at, when there are undocumented kitchen workers in the  restaurants that they go to, when their houses and their homes are  built by undocumented workers, we never see the same type of outrage.   I see a lot of ignorance in the response that we are seeing as to  what undocumented folks provide in value to our country, and we cannot  ignore that.   Now, there are nearly 2.3 million Dreamers in this country who are  integrated into our communities already. They contribute to our  economy. They participate in our workforce. They spend their wages.  They pay taxes. We need to let Dreamers live and work in the only  country they have ever known as home. We have a bipartisan bill right  here to make that a reality.   I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to take one of the  first steps to fix our broken immigration system.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in voting  for the motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.
