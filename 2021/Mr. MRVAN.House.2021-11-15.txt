 Madam Speaker, it is my great pleasure today to recognize  the outstanding achievement of the Andrean High School girls volleyball  team.   Earlier this month, the 59ers won the Indiana Class 2A State  Volleyball championship against Western Boone in a five-set match.  Congratulations to Coach Grant Bell on his persistence and direction of  this exceptional team, and special kudos as well to all the seniors for  your leadership, including the starters: middle blocker, Brooke Molson;  setter, Madison Kmetz; and my niece, outside hitter, Angelina  Majchrowicz.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing the Andrean 59ers and  all of these impressive young athletes for their skill, tremendous hard  work, and representation to our region.   You make all of Northwest Indiana and the 59er community very proud.                            ____________________
