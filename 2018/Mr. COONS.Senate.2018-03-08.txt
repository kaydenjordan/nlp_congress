 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in this historic Chamber to offer my  thanks, my respect, and to pay homage to an incredibly valued member of  my staff who is about to retire from the U.S. Senate after decades of  dedicated service.   A New Englander by birth and a Delawarian by choice, Mary Ann Kelley  has served as my deputy scheduler now for 7 years and is due to retire  tomorrow, March 9.   Mary Ann Kelley--or MAK, as she is affectionately called in my  office--started a career with the U.S. Senate way back in December 1990  as a staff assistant for then-Senator Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr.  Except for a break in service, Mary Ann served on Senator Biden's team  until he resigned to become Vice President in 2009. She stayed on  through the tenure of Senator Ted Kaufman and joined my scheduling team  late in 2010.   In her having served now three U.S. Senators, Mary Ann brings a  breadth of knowledge and experience to my front office and scheduling  team. She helps to maintain my schedule, helps to organize and evaluate  and to track hundreds of invitations and scheduling requests to  coworkers and constituents. Mary Ann's professionalism and business  acumen are unwavering and valued. She always maintains her composure  despite the stress and sometimes craziness this unique position offers.  My team in Delaware appreciates her ready wit, balanced judgment, and  calming presence.   Krista Brady, my talented casework manager, said:         MAK adds that something extra Irish to the office. Every       morning, she comes in wearing her snazziest outfit, drinking       her cappuccino from Starbucks, and ready to tell a funny       story.    Krista reminded me about Mary Ann's love for cats, her famous  Halloween mask, her curry chicken, and,  [[Page S1568]]  of course, her wicked New England spirit.   Mary Ann's story is rooted deeper than in just her years of Senate  service. MAK's authenticity, personality, and devotion to friends and  family make her a staff favorite and valued member of my team. To  properly honor Mary Ann, let me share some details about her background  and her persona.   A graduate of Cardinal Spellman High School and Framingham State  University, Mary Ann was born and lived in Massachusetts until she  moved to Delaware in 1979. Ask MAK about her hometown, and she will  quickly chime in with ``Brockton, MA--home of Rocky Marciano and Marvin  Hagler!'' Thanks to Rocky and Marvin, world heavyweight and  middleweight boxing champions, Brockton is recognized as the City of  Champions.   If Rocky and Marvin are Brockton's boxing champions, Mary Ann is the  city's undisputed world champion in cooking, whether it be baking,  roasting, or toasting. Like Rocky and Marvin, Mary Ann has a passion  and talent for her own chosen sport, one that she has practiced and  refined over many years. Marvin Hagler explained what makes a winner,  and what Mary Ann did to become a well-seasoned top chef is the same  thing. Marvin Hagler, the boxer, once said, ``Every fighter has got  [to] be dedicated, learn how to sacrifice, know what devotion is all  about, make sure you're paying attention and studying your art.''   Mary Ann learned to cook at an early age. She will say that she was  born with a love of cooking. This interest is something she has pursued  through her college years and into today. She earned a bachelor's of  science in food and nutrition from Framingham State in 1967 and  subsequently mentored and educated students as a home economics teacher  for 5 years. Mary Ann taught classes on food, nutrition, and, of  course, cooking.   Over the decades, our very own MAK perfected a wide range of  delicacies to soothe and feed family, friends, and fellow Delawarians.  Often, the people she fed and cared for were through her efforts at the  Ministry of Caring in Wilmington, DE. Mary Ann worked for a decade as  the head chef at the Ministry of Caring, a community-based nonprofit  that provides a network of social, health, and support services for  those who are living in poverty or who are homeless. Mary Ann used her  professional education, her faith, and her experience to feed the souls  of people and provide them comfort through food served at the  Ministry's Emmanuel Dining Room.   When Mary Ann returned to the Senate after her break in service, she  rallied her coworkers to volunteer and serve food monthly at the  Emmanuel Dining Room, where I, too, have volunteered. When I took  office as a Senator, we continued this outreach, and it served as a  great opportunity for my casework team and others to connect with  constituents.   Besides MAK's involvement with the Ministry of Caring, for many  years, she owned and operated her own excellent business, Creative  Catering Cuisine. To this day, she still receives catering requests and  calls from friends for cookies, cakes, and other treats. Mary Ann's  depth and variety of dishes are unique and storied. Staff favorites  include MAK's mouth-watering filet mignon, cranberry coffee cake, Irish  cake, banana pudding, and a wide variety of pound cakes. Lynne Phifer,  my intern coordinator, speaks highly of Mary Ann's homemade oatmeal  cookies and other confections. Lynne and the rest of the team, however,  are unanimous in their vote for MAK's curry chicken.   Mary Ann's food is influential and, I would say at times, even  transcendent. I am confident, if MAK's menu had existed in earlier  times, it could have changed the course of history as we know it. If  this sustenance had been available in 1775, Founding Father Patrick  Henry may have exclaimed, ``Give me Mary Ann's curry chicken or give me  death!''   Mary Ann goes to great lengths, in all seriousness, to prepare meals  for those she loves. She gets the best and freshest ingredients. Some  on my staff remember the day Mary Ann returned from her lunch break  with a half dozen lobsters--the main course for a dinner prepared in  honor of her son's birthday.   Desiree Burritt, my immigration case worker, who also worked for  Senators Biden and Kaufman before me, said:         Mary Ann has always been our in-house chef, always there to       pull up a chair, quick to smile, laugh, and listen. MAK is       like a mother to all of us.    Mary Ann may not know just how much she inspires and influences those  around her. I have been moved to hear and witness the impression that  she has made on my staff, on her friends, and her family.   Terry Wright, who also previously worked for Senator Biden--a member  of my Service Academy Selection Board--has known Mary Ann for many  years. Terry said Mary Ann is ``generous with an absolute willingness  to help anyone in any way she can. When she's your friend,'' Terry  said, ``you have a friend for life.''   Elena Sassaman, a newer member of my casework team, said:         Mary Ann is one of the nicest and most thoughtful people       I've met both here, working in the Senate, and in everyday       life. MAK was one of the first people to include me in the       office family dynamic when I first started.    Elena has developed a love for knitting, crocheting, and other crafts  thanks to Mary Ann's encouragement and valued friendship.   When I am not in DC, I am usually in my Wilmington office in  Delaware, and we enjoy the opportunity to have lunch as a group with  everybody on the Delaware staff. I love those lunches, listening to  Mary Ann tell funny stories, share observations, even show photos of or  brag about her grandkids.   My dad, whom I miss dearly, was born in Boston, MA, himself, and Mary  Ann, who never lost her remarkable Boston accent, has provided me a  familiar and comforting presence whenever she speaks.   I love her Massachusetts spirit, her soul, and her positive attitude.  Mary Ann is a good and decent person and a great presence in our  office. She is at the same time both a fixture and a breath of fresh  air.   Mary Ann's work in the Senate and her career as a chef shows us all  the importance of working hard and embracing what you love, using your  strengths to help your friends and neighbors and to better the country  and community.   Mary Ann said she would miss all aspects of working with us in the  Senate. It has been such a big part of her life, I know. Mary Ann, I  know you will also miss the comradery of your coworkers in the Delaware  office.   As a longtime chef, I am confident, Mary Ann, that you already have a  recipe for retirement and will embrace the joy of not working. Your  retirement will surely be filled with activities such as cooking,  knitting, and outings with your friends Jill, Norma, Sue, and Tanya,  and you will spend more time with your sons Michael and Terence,  daughters-in-law Nell and Jennifer, and beloved grandchildren Cole,  Mitch, Meredith, and Nolan, who all live right nearby, just over the  line in Pennsylvania. Whether their Nan is joining them for dinner or  attending a Unionville High School rowing event, I know you will be  there in high spirits, prepared with a great story and an even better  dessert.   Mary Ann, I know you look forward to trips to Westborough, MA, and to  spending holidays and warmer weekends with Terence, Jennifer, Meredith,  and Nolan.   Let me conclude by saying to Mary Ann, thank you for your years of  service to the Senate, to our community, and to the people of the First  State. You have been a valued member of my team, and I will close with  a traditional Irish blessing:       May there always be work for your hands to do.      May your purse always hold a coin or two.      May the sun always shine on your windowpane.      May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain.      May the hand of a friend be always near you.      May God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.    With that, Mary Ann, I offer you a fond farewell and a thanks to you  for all you have done for Delaware and the Senate.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
