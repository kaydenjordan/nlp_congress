 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, the long march for equality  for LGBTQ Americans took a step forward. The Supreme Court handed down  a landmark decision that Federal employment discrimination protections  do, in fact, extend to LGBTQ Americans. Believe it or not, before  today, it was not a settled legal matter that you could sue your  employer for firing you solely on the basis of sexual orientation or  sexual identity.   In 2020, in America, it was still OK to discriminate against people  because of their sexual orientation or identity. Is that unbelievable  that in the 21st century it was still allowed? Well, now it isn't  because of the Supreme Court, and they deserve credit for that case.   One of the cases that formed the basis of today's ruling originated  in my home State of New York, where a skydiving instructor was fired  for admitting his sexual orientation. So, today, the Supreme Court did  the right thing and ruled that workplace discrimination on the basis of  sexual orientation is just as unlawful as discrimination on the basis  of gender, race, or religion.   Of course, the ruling in no way diminishes our efforts here in  Congress to pass the Equality Act led by my colleagues, Senators  Merkley, Baldwin, and Booker, which would be a great leap forward on  equality that we are all looking for. It passed the House over a year  ago, but it has been gathering dust in Leader McConnell's legislative  graveyard. Senate Republicans are still not in the 21st century. They  must think it is OK to discriminate against people because of their  orientation or identity. Unbelievable. But maybe now, the fact that  even a few Justices appointed by Republican Presidents believe that it  was against the law--maybe that will prick the hearts of our Republican  colleagues and Leader McConnell and they will allow a vote on the  Equality Act here on the floor. Even without the Senate and its  backward ways, it is clear that the country is moving in the right  direction.                           Justice in Policing Act    Mr. President, these are not ordinary times in America. For 21  straight days, hundreds of thousands of Americans have taken to the  streets to protest police violence and racial injustice. Clashes  between police and peaceful protesters over the past few weeks, in  which some police departments have responded with overly aggressive  tactics, have only articulated further the need for bold and wide- reaching reform of police practices.   Being killed by police is now the sixth leading cause of death for  young Black men in America. Let me repeat that. Being killed by police  is now the sixth leading cause of death for young Black men in America,  and that is why the House and Senate have drafted legislation, the  Justice in Policing Act,  [[Page S2961]]  that will deliver comprehensive reform to police departments, including  a ban on choke holds, a ban on no-knock warrants in Federal drug cases,  a ban on racial profiling, and limits on the transfer of military  equipment to police departments. Our bill would make it a lot easier to  hold police accountable in court for misconduct and institute several  reforms to prevent that misconduct in the first place.   Only a few months ago, the Justice in Policing Act might have seemed  controversial, but in the wake of such obvious injustice recorded on  iPhones throughout the country, there is now broad and deep support for  the policies we Democrats are pushing in the Justice in Policing Act.   A recent Reuters poll reported--listen to this--82 percent of  Americans, including 7 in 10 Republicans, want to ban police from using  choke holds; 83 percent of Americans, including 7 in 10 Republicans,  want to ban racial profiling; 92 percent of Americans, including 9 in  10 Republicans, want Federal police to wear body cameras; 91 percent of  Americans, including 9 in 10 Republicans, support allowing independent  investigations of police departments that show patterns of misconduct;  and 75 percent of Americans, including 6 in 10 Republicans, support  allowing victims of police misconduct to sue police departments for  damages, also known as qualified immunity reform.   Now is the time to seek bold and broadscale change, not change around  the margins. Now is the time for wholesale reform, not piecemeal  reform. The Justice in Policing Act takes a comprehensive approach,  but, at the moment, our Republican colleagues seem to be on a path  toward taking a much, much narrower, less inclusive approach. That is  wrong.   Some Senate Republicans have endorsed individual proposals in our  bill, like qualified immunity reform and bans on choke holds, but it  looks like these policies may not be included in the Republican bill.  While our bill recognizes that a strong Federal response is necessary  to bring change to every police department in America, the Republicans,  it seems, are going to leave much of the task up to the States. If  history has taught us anything, particularly when it comes to civil  rights, it is that progress on civil rights has been stunted, slowed  down, and sometimes stymied by letting the States take the lead.   Let me repeat to my Republican colleagues: We need comprehensive and  bold reform, and we need a commitment from the Republican leader to  consider broad, strong police reform--the Justice in Policing Act--on  the floor of the Senate before July 4.   Again, I ask our Republican leader--I have asked before: Allow the  Justice in Policing Act to be on the floor. We can debate it. We can  amend it. Some of you may not vote for it, but the Nation is crying out  for debate on a comprehensive and strong approach, not to cherry-pick  one or two items and say ``See, we have done our job'' and go home.   This has been a pervasive and deep problem in America for decades and  centuries. To now give it short shift and to try and get off the hook  would be so wrong at the moment when Americans are calling for it. The  vast majority of Republican voters are calling for it. Do we have any  courage here or any strength to face the issue head-on at a time and at  a moment when we can do it? I hope our Republican friends will summon  that courage, that strength, and that desire to bring real, strong, and  comprehensive reform. The time for waiting is over                                 Coronavirus    Mr. President, meanwhile, a global pandemic continues to assail our  country and our economy. The COVID-19 pandemic did not disappear while  the Nation rightfully turned its attention to the issues of racial  justice. In fact, just as the country was preparing for the early  stages of reopening, the number of cases began to spike again in a  number of States.   Arizona has activated emergency plans to deal with the surge of new  patients. Over the weekend, Florida reported its highest single-day  number of cases. Twenty-two States are reporting increases in the  numbers of confirmed cases of coronavirus after those numbers had been  declining. The experts tell us that it is not simply because there is  more testing. There is also more coronavirus in many of these States.   A headline in Time magazine sums it up: ``America Is Done With COVID- 19. COVID-19 Isn't Done With America.'' It is our responsibility to  deal with this problem. The trends are extremely concerning.   I have asked the White House to have members of the coronavirus task  force, including Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx, give Senate Democrats a  briefing on these recent spikes. I have yet to hear back. The White  House continues to muzzle the most knowledgeable people.   President Trump, haven't you learned that when you don't face the  truth, it hurts the country and hurts you? You tried to deny that this  coronavirus was real--it was a hoax; it will go away in a few days;  there are very few cases--and, of course, it ravaged our country.   Now they are doing the same thing. President Trump is doing exactly  the same thing--withholding the experts and withholding the truth in  hopes that things will disappear. That is just not how science tells us  things work.   President Trump now seems ready to dismiss these issues entirely. It  is appalling. He is planning big campaign rallies, asking reporters,  amazingly, to sign waivers not to sue if they contract COVID from  attending. I guess he worries that they might get it, but he doesn't  care. He wants to have his rally. That is the superficiality of this  President.   President Trump has also moved major parts of the Republican  convention out of North Carolina in order to avoid having to respect  the most basic precautions against the spread of coronavirus.   Today, amazingly enough, the FDA withdrew the emergency authorization  of the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment against COVID. Remember  how the President of the United States, only a few weeks ago, was  promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine like a pharmaceutical salesman,  going so far as to take the drug himself despite not having the  disease? Now the FDA says that it is not reasonable to believe the drug  is effective against COVID or that its benefit outweighs the ``known  and potential risks.'' That is the President's own department telling  him to stop it--to stop telling Americans lies about the coronavirus  and about what is good and bad to treat it. It is amazing. An agency  like this one, which knows they are not supposed to buck the President  or face his wrath, still felt the obligation to come forward and tell  Americans the truth about hydroxychloroquine.   This should be a warning to all Americans. You can't listen to  President Trump when it comes to healthcare, whether it comes to  hydroxychloroquine or anything about the coronavirus itself, because  the experts in his own administration so often contradict his advice.  It shouldn't need saying that the President is not a doctor, yet he has  been issuing off-the-cuff medical advice from the White House podium  only to have the experts scrambling to backtrack weeks later. This is  not how a leader handles a crisis. This is not even how a normal person  handles a crisis.   Senate Republicans, meanwhile, have relegated the COVID issue to the  back burner. As the expiration dates for several of the programs  established under the CARES Act quickly approach, Leader McConnell has  reportedly told his caucus not to expect another emergency relief bill  until the end of July. The emergency unemployment insurance we passed  in the CARES Act is soon going to run out. The ban on evictions is soon  going to expire. State and local governments are preparing to slash  public services and are in dire need of Federal support. Cliff after  cliff after cliff faces us. Economic trouble after economic trouble  after economic trouble is looming upon us very soon. Yet all of these  problems and all of these deadlines seem to mean very little to the  Republican Senate majority, which is taking its sweet time to respond  to an urgent and multifaceted national crisis.   What are our Republican friends going to tell people whose  unemployment insurance runs out? Tough luck? What are our Republican  friends going to tell people evicted from their homes? Too bad? What  are our Republican friends going to tell the many public servants fired  because their   [[Page S2962]]  States are running out of money and we have refused to step up to the  plate? What are they going to tell the Nation's parents when schools  will not be able to open because we haven't given them adequate  resources to do so?    We are going to tell them that the Republican majority is asleep at  the switch during a major national crisis, but that will be of little  solace. We would much rather work together and get things done.   Even on bedrock issues of democracy elections, the Republican  majority has once again been absent. The COVID pandemic has made our  elections a challenge, obviously. In Nevada, South Carolina, Wisconsin,  and, most recently and most glaringly in Georgia, voters have had to  overcome significant barriers to voting. Senators Klobuchar, Feinstein,  and Peters have been demanding that Republican chairs of their  respective committees hold hearings on these election issues. That  would be the bare minimum the Senate could do in response to widespread  election issues.   Police reform, racial injustice, voting rights, a global pandemic,  massive levels of unemployment--these are huge issues that demand the  attention of the U.S. Senate, but Leader McConnell and the Republican  majority just can't seem to find the time. On issues like COVID, racial  justice, the economy, voting, the Republican majority is sadly missing  in action.   Instead, Leader McConnell is pushing two rightwing judges onto the  Nation's circuit courts: Justin Walker and Cory Wilson.   Mr. Walker is a man of limited judicial experience who has made it  very clear he personally opposes our healthcare law. He called the  Roberts decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act indefensible and  catastrophic.   Mr. Wilson, by the same token, called our healthcare law illegitimate  and perverse. That is right, folks. If you need healthcare and you are  suffering because of COVID, well, our Republican friends are nominating  judges who think the law is illegitimate and perverse. In the middle of  a public health crisis, the Republican majority is planning to confirm  rightwing judges who oppose our healthcare law.   Adding insult to injury, Mr. Wilson has been one of the leaders in  opposing and undoing voting rights. Here, at a time when people are  protesting for racial equality, the Republican majority has the  temerity to put on the floor of the Senate someone who has spent his  career trying to limit the rights of people, oftentimes minorities, to  vote. Mr. Wilson has supported restrictive voter ID laws and expressed  strong opposition to parts of the Voting Rights Act. That is right. In  the middle of a national movement on issues related to racial justice,  Senate Republicans are trying to put a judge on the bench with a  hostile record on voting rights.   We all know that when you have the Senate majority, it is all about  priorities. We are all empowered here on the Senate to propose bills  and amendments and to ask consent to speak for as long as we want, but  only Leader McConnell gets to decide which bills reach the floor, and  for the past 2 months, as the economic pain from the coronavirus  deepens, as the disease starts to come back, as the economy runs into  trouble after trouble after trouble, as long-simmering issues of racial  justice and police brutality propel peaceful protesting in our biggest  cities and smallest towns, the Republican Senate majority has been out  to lunch. This week, as Leader McConnell asks us to consider more  rightwing judges for the Federal bench, it could not be more apparent.    I yield the floor.
