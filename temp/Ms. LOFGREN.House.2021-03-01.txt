 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Our  democracy is in urgent need of repair. The American people deserve a  transparent, inclusive, and healthy democracy, and H.R. 1 will get us  there.   It is transformational, a once-in-a-generation, pro-democracy,  anticorruption reform package. It is composed of comprehensive policies  for eliminating structural and legal barriers to voting, ending the  dominance of big money in our campaign finance reforms, and  implementing real government ethics and accountability reforms.   With this landmark bill, we take a giant leap toward ensuring our  Republic is an authentic and inclusive representative democracy, and  ensuring the voices of everyday Americans are no longer drowned out by  those of wealthy special interests.                                time  1945    Article I, Section 4 says this:   ``The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and  Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the legislature  thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such  regulations.''   Mr. Speaker, that is what we are doing here. As the gentleman has  said, we had a huge turnout in the 2020 election, despite efforts by  some to suppress turnout. Now, we see legislatures all over the country  trying to put barriers in place so the American people will not be able  to exercise their franchise. That is simply wrong. We should look to  our constitutional obligation to make sure that every American has the  capacity to vote.
