 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill would  prohibit late term abortions on unborn babies who can feel pain. As we  now know, babies can feel pain as early as 20 weeks. This means during  dismemberment abortion and induction abortions, babies feel the pain  from these procedures, while in the womb. We are one of seven countries  that still allows late term abortions, putting us in the company with  North Korea and China.   In fact, one of my staffers great niece was born at 26 weeks,  weighing just 2 lbs, 11 oz. It's unconscionable that we allow babies  such as her niece to be aborted. This bill is one step closer to  achieving our goal of protecting these innocent lives. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill and to protect the sanctity of life.
