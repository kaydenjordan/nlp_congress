 Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I object.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   There is a lot of noise in this town right now about government  shutdowns, and the fact is, the issue isn't about shutdowns. It is  about whether or not Members of this body will continue to use money we  don't have to fund mandates, indoctrination, and the use of force  against our citizens:   $73.5 billion for the Department of Education that subsidizes the  indoctrination of our children with critical race theory and woke  gender ideologies;   $10 billion for an FBI that was just used by the Attorney General of  the United States to target parents;   $50 billion for a Department of Homeland Security that leaves our  borders wide open, empowering cartels because Secretary Mayorkas fails  to execute the laws of the United States;   $6 billion for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases run by Dr. Fauci.   Need I say more?   $592 million for OSHA, which has imposed an unconstitutional vaccine  mandate on 84 million Americans.   I offered an amendment to strip any funding from this bill that would  fund Federal vaccine mandates, and it wasn't even able to see the light  of day.   This is about a Congress that is supposed to use the power of the  purse, our Article I authority, rather than hiding behind the judges in  Article III, to check the executive branch. We have a moral obligation  to give voice and representation to the people who elected us whose  liberty and livelihoods are being attacked.   My friend who battles MS is looking at being terminated from the  university she teaches at because of the unlawful Federal contractor  mandate.   The medical hero in Texas who is 9 months pregnant is facing  termination under the unlawful CMS mandate.   Military personnel, including the 13-year Army veteran in my district  who is concerned about myocarditis, are facing being discharged from  service to our country.   These are our neighbors, our relatives, our friends--maybe not for  some of you who go home to double-masked, vaccine passport cities. But  [[Page H6876]]  these are real Americans that this government wants to go after.   I urge my colleagues to stop empowering executive branch tyranny over  Americans, and I urge my Republican colleagues to not just vote ``no''  and give a speech, but go stand with Mike Lee. Go stand with others in  the Senate trying to defend these Americans. We should not fund tyranny  over American citizens.    Madam Speaker, I object.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I am fascinated to learn that I serve in the  United States House of free stuff because that is what I have been  hearing nonstop this entire week.   There is an unlimited supply of money and resources apparently, an  unlimited supply of dollars that we can continue to print while  devastating our economy, devastating the American dollar, and  transforming our society by encouraging Americans to believe that there  is a free lunch. And there ain't no free lunch.   My wife is the product of a single mom growing up in Texas. Her mom  worked multiple jobs to send her to college. She worked hard to be able  to go to college. She left with 70-something thousand dollars of  student loans  [[Page H6902]]  despite going to two top public universities in the State of Texas.   She is not asking for her loans to get repaid because she went there  with a free will. She went there and made a choice. She could have  chosen a different path. She chose to take the debt. I did the same  thing when I went to law school at the University of Texas. I might not  have chosen to go to law school if the loans hadn't been available, and  that might be fine.   What is the fundamental problem? Why has the cost of education  skyrocketed in my lifetime at an inflation rate multiple times over  virtually every other product and service in this country except for  healthcare? Why is it up something like 3,000 percent?   Is it perhaps because we are subsidizing the holy heck out of it?  Just thinking perhaps that there might be a correlation to the  availability--massive, widespread availability--of subsidized student  loans, the massive subsidization of K-12 education and higher ed. Do we  think there might be a correlation to why the costs have skyrocketed so  much?   But no, no, no, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle now walk  in here and say, oh, you know, we are not the party of big spenders; we  have got a chart here with $1.7 trillion on it with another chart  saying, ``Cancel Student Debt.''   Who is paying for that? Does anybody in this body give a rat's rear  end about who is paying for anything at all? No. Oh, no, then they will  come out here and say $3 trillion of tax cuts. They don't care about  economic growth and opportunity. But fine.   Why don't we actually have a conversation about spending and taxes?  No, no, we don't do that. We just spend money we don't have. That is  what we did today in the continuing resolution to keep this government  running. Oh, my gosh, panic ensues if you dare question whether or not  the government must be funded Saturday at 12:01 in the morning. What  will the American people do? How will they function if the United  States House of free stuff isn't doling out free stuff?                                time  1945    No one is in this Chamber, of course. Just reminding the American  people how this place doesn't work. We are now on 5\1/2\ straight years  of no amendments being offered on the floor of this august Chamber.   I would like to remind the American people every once in a while that  what they saw about how a bill becomes a law is a complete fraud. See,  there is a handful of people who get into a room and they decide what  you are going to vote on.   The Speaker knows it is true, and my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle know it is true. And my colleagues on this side of the aisle  know it is true because they did it when they were in the majority just  as much as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle did it when  they were in the majority.   We get a massive bill dropped on our desk, and we say take it or  leave it. Go offer an amendment in rules, they say. Never taken. Never  accepted. Always prechosen, always pregamed out.   This is deliberation and debate? This is the constitutional order?  What value is there for an election certificate if you can't use it?  You come to the floor and want to offer an amendment in good faith to  try to make a piece of legislation better, and you can't do it.   We have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 people max who decide everything that goes  on in this Chamber in all of their infinite wisdom. Then we come down  and look at the board, and it is party-line votes, and then it is walk  out on the steps and go give a speech and go to the press and go on  Twitter and go on Facebook and go talk about why you are voting no or  yes. That is what we are relegated to in the United States House of  free stuff.   But today, we just voted to extend the funding of government with a  continuing resolution, which is going to barrel us toward a trillion- dollar deficit this year, give or take. Who knows? Does it matter? Does  anybody know what the difference is between a trillion dollars or $1.2  trillion? Does anybody know the difference between $29 trillion in debt  or $30 trillion in debt? Nobody knows or cares in this Chamber.  Literally not a lick. We don't talk about it.   Then each side comes down on the floor and offers more spending for  whatever their priority is, defense, nondefense, mandatory spending,  nonmandatory spending.   If the unbelievably terrible circumstance occurred Friday night at  midnight of this government daring to pause, do the American people  know that about 82 percent of it is on autopilot with mandatory  spending? I mean, does that matter? When you walk out and a gaggle of  reporters come up with bated breath, oh, no, there might be a  government shutdown. It always gets paid back. Eighty-two percent of it  keeps running.   There is never a serious debate about what is actually happening here  in the United States of America. We never actually sit down like family  or a small business, roll our sleeves up, and decide how to spend  money. Do you imagine if we actually had to adhere to a budget like any  business or American family, and we actually had to sit down, Madam  Speaker, at that table and not leave this Chamber until we said our  budget is $3 trillion or $4 trillion, whatever it is, here is our  income; here is what we can spend; that is all we can do; let's figure  out our priorities. Well, we disagree. You know, do you want to fund  NEA? Do you want to fund the Department of Education, XYZ? Do you want  to fund the military? Do you want to fund specific B-52 bombers? Do you  want to fund healthcare? Do you want to fund border security?   Make a choice. We never make a choice, ever--both parties, by the  way, both leaders. We never make a choice. All we do is preen and  posture and come down here with massive bills that have some of our  priorities, depending on who is in the majority. That is it. Again, we  are relegated to being the United States House of free stuff.   You have to call it free stuff because we are just printing the money  to do the stuff. We are down here talking about, oh, we have to cancel  the student debt. Well, man, wouldn't that be lovely? Who cares about  the people who have already worked hard their whole lives to pay off  their student loans, whether they be Black, Brown, White, male, female.  Who cares?   They have worked their whole life. They paid off their student loans.  They did what they were supposed to do, or they are in the middle of  paying off their student loans. Oh, no, let's just go down here. One of  my colleagues just said $50,000, President Biden. Did they just pick  that number out of the air? $50,000 of free stuff, here you go.   Somebody else chose not to go to college. Somebody else started a  business, worked hard, borrowed money to run a business. Guess what?  That money also had interest, to my colleague from Michigan who was  down here talking about, oh, the pain of interest. As if it is not as  old as time, as if it is not Biblical to say: Hey, I don't have the  money to do something. I would like to have the money to do something.  How might I get the money to do something? I don't know. One, get a job  and earn the money, save the money. Two, ask for it from somebody who  loves you. Three, borrow it.   Okay, now what do you do with that? Go do something with it. Make a  choice. Start a business. Start a lemonade stand. Go to college if you  want. But, oh, no, let's just go pay off $1.7 trillion of debt. It  doesn't matter if you went to school and got a degree in sociology or  gender studies and you are floating around and trying to figure out  what you are going to do with your life. Oh, no, let's pay off that  $140,000.   There ain't no free lunch. But we live in this fiction that we can  just keep printing money, and the horrors of printing the money is not  just that we have $30 trillion in debt; it is not just that we have  rampant inflation; it is not just that we are undermining our dollar;  it is not just that we are handing over power to China and every other  country around the world to kick our rear ends; it is that we are  funding a government to do things to us to interfere with us.   We are funding an FBI to target parents for daring to question the  wisdom of school boards around this country. People say: Oh, that is  not true. You must be embellishing.   It is not true? We just had hearings with the Attorney General of the  United States. We just saw memoranda making it very clear that the FBI  is targeting parents. We are funding that.   For all Americans out there watching this, all 12 of you, we are  funding  [[Page H6903]]  that. We are borrowing dollars, spending money we don't have, and we  are taking those dollars, and we are funding an FBI to target parents.   We are taking away dollars from police departments, and Federal  dollars are going in and funding programs allegedly to take the place  of police and then wondering why department stores are getting looted.   Then you have the White House press secretary today literally at the  podium saying that is the fault of the pandemic, all the looting. We  are not talking about somebody breaking into a grocery store to buy a  loaf of bread. We are talking about people swarming a department store  and taking Gucci bags.   Oh, no, let's not enforce the law. Let's not enforce the rule of law.  Let's blame it on the pandemic. Let's blame Border Patrol for whipping  migrants, which was demonstrably and totally and clearly false.   There is no shame coming from the Press Secretary's Office of the  White House. No lie that won't easily slip out about what is actually  going on, like Border Patrol agents whipping migrants. No apology. All  of those Border Patrol agents down there on the front lines dealing  with COVID, dealing with being outmanned and outgunned, dealing with  cartels, no apology.   Here we sit in the United States House of free stuff funding the  Department of Homeland Security not to secure the homeland; funding the  Department of Education not to educate our kids, other than to  indoctrinate them to hate our country and to believe they are racist  for the color of their skin; $700 billion for a Department of Defense  to now run climate training and to focus on chief diversity officers in  the Department of Defense rather than focusing on, I don't know,  blowing stuff up and killing people, which is what the Department of  Defense, formerly known as the Department of War, is actually supposed  to do; $11 billion for an Internal Revenue Service that took a record  $4 trillion from Americans last fiscal year; $9 billion for an EPA that  is destroying American energy through regulation, pushing a radical  climate agenda. None of which, by the way, is actually going to drive  down CO2 production, which we have been doing with clean- burning American natural gas over the last decade.   Today, we pass this continuing resolution in the United States House  of free stuff to rack up another trillion dollars of debt, continuing  to fund agencies to carry out their tyrannical activities, in  particular to carry out vaccine mandates on the American people that  are getting slapped down one by one by courts across this country  because, of course, the President of the United States doesn't have the  authority or the power to mandate that an American citizen go into a  doctor's office and get a needle jabbed in their arm. He doesn't have  that power.   The United States House of free stuff here allegedly representing the  people is supposed to actually care enough about representing those  people to stand here as a board holding the line against an  authoritarian President of the United States, against a President  carrying out executive overreach. That is what we see happening. He is  being slapped down left and right by the courts.   Now, I don't believe in wearing a partisan hat when we are talking  about standing up for the Constitution, standing up for the Article I  branch of the Federal Government. I introduced legislation when the  previous President, a Republican, President Trump, was in office called  the Article I Act to take away powers from the President with respect  to emergency powers being used. I did so, frankly, in the wake of the  use of dollars for border fencing and wall construction, which I  supported, which was important, which was a response to an emergency  and, by the way, was working. But it was important for us to start  laying out a foundation for protecting Article I, the United States  Congress.   Today we pass a continuing resolution that we sent over to the United  States Senate, and we never had a vote in this body about the vaccine  mandates that are being slapped down in courts across this country for  being unlawful, unconstitutional, tyrannical overreach by the executive  branch of the United States.   Never in our history have we had Federal mandates applying across the  country to the American citizens that they must be vaccinated. They  have been local decisions, local schools, local counties in States and  specific responses to highly communicable diseases that they knew might  be communicable and be pulled back by a vaccine, and after many years  of study with massive numbers of exemptions and protections for  individual liberty and choice. That is the history of how we have  handled it in a federalist 50-State republic, not a decision by a  President or, frankly, probably more likely the President's advisers,  that the American people must be vaccinated, that a small business or a  business of any size must vaccinate their employees.   People act like, well, it is no big deal. I ought to direct my  remarks here to my Republican colleagues, my Republican colleagues who  today were perfectly happy to vote no on this CR. Yes, I will go home,  and I will give a speech: I voted no on this CR. I voted no because  this continuing resolution had these terrible provisions in it. And,  yes, this continuing resolution had vaccine mandate funding, funding  the Department of Labor and funding OSHA and funding the Department of  Defense to carry out these mandates. I voted no, don't you know.   So what? Who cares if you voted no? You vote no, and you give a  speech, pat yourself on the back. Good for you. Did you do anything, go  stand with any of the Senators who had a chance to actually do  something with this, with the Senators over there right now having a  debate and trying to force a vote on an amendment to prevent the  tyrannical application of vaccine mandates?   Did my colleagues say let's go round up and go over and stand  alongside Mike Lee, or did they hide behind the Article III judiciary?  Did they hide behind the courts and say, well, let's let the courts  sort it out. No, that is exactly what they did. Secure the blessings of  liberty in the Constitution indeed by the supposed primary branch of  government.                                time  2000    And these have real consequences for real Americans, real lives.  Hospitals in Massachusetts are already limiting elective procedures due  to critical staffing shortages. Do we care? Are we concerned about  that?   The New York Governor issued an executive order that postponed  elective surgeries in order to deal with the staffing shortages. Do we  care? Are we concerned?   The largest children's hospital in Wisconsin is struggling to treat  victims of the BLM extremist, who rammed his car through the Waukesha  Christmas parade. Do we care?   A dear friend of mind suffering from multiple sclerosis, teaching at  the university, she is being told she may not be able to continue  teaching because she believes, in consultation with her doctor, that it  is in her best interest not to be vaccinated at this time. She should  have the right and the ability to choose to do that for her and her  family and her interest without coercion from an overextended Federal  Government under an unlawful and unconstitutional mandate by the  President of the United States.   And this body, the Congress of the United States, should do its  Article I job and stand up in defense of her and every other American  who is facing losing their job at Thanksgiving and Christmas, or being  discharged from the military of the United States that they proudly  served because they believe in their interest, in their own personal  safety, their own health interest, that they should be the one to  choose, not a faraway President.   We structured this government specifically not to do this. We  structured this government with Federalism and separation of powers  specifically to avoid having a king. That man on the painting over on  this wall, in this House Chamber, the first President of the United  States, turned down being a king, turned down the monarchy, turned down  a third term because the Founders knew why that mattered. The Founders  knew why separating powers and limiting powers mattered because they  saw and foresaw exactly what we are seeing today in this country and  across the world. Where, in Austria and Germany and Australia and  places around the world, we see mandates forcing people to be in their  homes and  [[Page H6904]]  not go out and not engage in society because they are not vaccinated.  It is absurd.   This country is built on a bedrock of liberty and protecting liberty  and securing the blessings of liberty, and this President is stepping  on it. And the United States Congress, Members of both parties, are  MIA, missing in action, unwilling to stand up in defense of liberty  while patting themselves on the back for voting ``no'' on a continuing  resolution and then kicking it over to the Senate for one man to stand  on the floor of the United States Senate, Senator Mike Lee, daring to  say we should have a vote on an amendment, an amendment that says we  shouldn't have this vaccine mandate. God bless Mike Lee for doing that.  I hope he holds to his guns.   And no, I am not going to freak out or panic if Saturday at 12:05 in  the morning rolls around and, Oh, no, we haven't gotten that funding  done. That funding, by the way, that is racking up, as I said before,  another trillion dollars of debt. The United States House of free  stuff.   A father called me up in tears because his 13-year Army veteran son  is likely going to be discharged because he believes, based on his  conversation with his doctors, that it is not in his interest to get  the vaccination. Millions of Americans who know they have natural  immunity, who have been ignored, who have been absolutely ignored  because the leaders of our national health organizations and agencies  aren't actually focusing on natural immunity. We haven't had a study on  natural immunity of any consequence out of our leaders. We have got to  rely on Israel and the U.K. and other places, and private entities. But  all of these millions of Americans who have natural immunity are being  told, Sorry, you must still go get a needle stuck in your arm in order  to have a job.   In what world is this the land of the free? It is not. And in what  world are the people in this Chamber who are supposed to represent the  people of the United States, how are they doing their job in the  Article I branch of our Federal Government if they are not standing up  for these people?   Those people who are going about their lives, making decisions in our  interests--and by the way, as if this matters to me a whole lot--that  even the experts, so-called, heading up our national health agencies  and organizations, acknowledge that if you are vaccinated you still  spread the daggone virus. It literally makes no sense.   We are killing people. We are restraining and restricting  therapeutics that can actually help people. We belittle people who are  working in consultation with doctors to find ways to solve the problem  if they happen to get the virus--whether they have been vaccinated or  not, by the way. And we are mandating people to get the vaccination,  irrespective of whether they had the virus and have natural immunity.   For months, I have been hearing about, Oh, they laugh off natural  immunity. And now suddenly, you start to hear--bow down to the altar of  all things--Dr. Fauci, that he suddenly said, Oh, yeah, natural  immunity, that is kind of a real thing. No kidding.   What world do you live in? The world of Washingtonian magazine and  propping your feet up with sunglasses and getting cool pictures and  throwing baseballs out at games?   I had a young woman who is 9 months pregnant. Remember all the  frontline workers everybody was celebrating a year ago? She is one of  them; she is a nurse. I saw all these people standing up at games,  people in this Chamber going around praising the frontline workers.  Well, good, we should have been praising the frontline workers who are  out there, in an unknown virus, showing up and helping those who were  sick. But suddenly now, if you are one of those frontline workers, and  for your own health and well-being, you decide you don't believe you  should be vaccinated, you might have natural immunity, maybe you have  got an underlying condition and you choose not to. Then this young  lady, a Texan, who is 9 months pregnant, is losing her job in direct  response to the President's unlawful and unconstitutional mandates.    Let's talk about those mandates for a minute.   The OSHA mandate. When the President goes in and tells businesses  across this country, You must get your employees vaccinated or go  through OSHA rulings and fines. This body just voted to increase the  OSHA fines, something like 700 percent or 900 percent. We just did that  when we passed the so-called BBB bill that is going to destroy America  with a whole bunch of more free stuff, $2 trillion of unpaid nonsense.   Oh, no, don't worry. It's paid for. CBO said so. Garbage. Absolute,  pure garbage. Of course, it is not paid for. It was games. The American  people know all this. It is how this body works. Nobody here is serious  about actually operating within the bounds of normalcy, like you would  in a business or in your home, because they don't care. There is no  consequence. There is literally no consequence to spending money we  don't have, to printing money. But that is what we do.   So we just voted to increase fines by OSHA. Now with those fines OSHA  can go target businesses.   Well, what happened? Now, that has been consolidated. U.S. District  judge for the Eastern District of Missouri granted a preliminary  injunction on November 29 for 10 States who brought forth a November 10  lawsuit by State AGs.   On December 1, in a similar ruling, Louisiana Western District U.S.  Judge Terry Doughty issued a nationwide injunction to the CMS mandate,  a separate mandate, a CMS mandate--sorry, I mixed these up.   The OSHA mandate, a panel of judges with the Fifth Circuit Court of  Appeals issued an order staying enforcement and implementation of the  OSHA mandate.   Now, back to the CMS mandate. Matt Schelp, the U.S. District judge  for the Eastern District of Missouri, granted a preliminary injunction  for 10 States. And on December 1, in a similar ruling, there is a  nationwide injunction on the CMS mandates. So these are the mandates  that are shutting down hospitals and nurses and doctors from carrying  out their job.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't care. And I know  they don't care because they just passed a continuing resolution  continuing to fund the mandates of a tyrannical executive branch  without holding him accountable.                                time  2010    I promise you if that were a Republican President they would be  outraged at these mandates. My colleagues on this side of the aisle  think voting ``no'' and walking out to go to dinner is perfectly fine  because that is what is going on here. They are not over in the Senate  backing up Mike Lee or here talking.   Federal workers mandate, Federal contractors mandate--on November 30,  U.S. District Judge Gregory Van Tatenhove of the Eastern District of  Kentucky issued a preliminary injunction halting the government's  enforcement of the Federal contractor vaccine mandate, which, by the  way, is mandating universities, which is causing my friend with MS to  possibly or probably lose her teaching job.   Veterans, Active Duty military, frontline health workers, university  teachers, professors, visiting professors, people across this country  in private business--hopefully, the courts will strike this down. Since  when is it the job of the Article I Congress to punt to the courts, and  say, Well, I hope you do it.   Do we care about the power of the purse?   Do we care if bureaucrats are targeting American citizens, saying,  You must get a needle in your arm?   There is no science indicating in any way, shape, or form that those  mandates are solving any problem at all, but rather causing problems.  Over 80 percent of Americans over the age of 12 years old have gotten  one shot of the vaccine; 99 percent or something close to it are people  over 65.   We are not even a year into the broad rollout of the vaccines. This  blows way past the polio epidemic. My dad had polio. I am well-versed  in the impacts of the polio epidemic. It didn't roll out nearly this  fast. It was targeted at kids, not people over 65.   Any mandates were left to school districts, and it took them awhile  to get there. This was a vaccine that had been worked on for years with  a significant amount of knowledge. It was a different kind of virus, by  the way, not a coronavirus.  [[Page H6905]]    A 21-year-old nursing assistant in Crawfordsville, Indiana, worked  60-hour weeks throughout the pandemic; she is facing termination. Do we  care? Does the Indiana delegation care? Either side of the aisle? I  would like to know.   Is the Indiana delegation over alongside Mike Lee fighting to prevent  the funding of the government bureaucrats that are going to enforce  that mandate on Becca Pitts?   Jen Peters, a 39-year-old San Diego maternity nurse was forced to  resign from her position after not getting vaccinated.   I recently met with heart surgeons that fly around the country saving  lives doing heart surgeries. They come in and they do that. They do pro  bono work. They do a lot of volunteer work. They fly all over the  world. They have been providers for, roughly, three decades, and if the  CMS mandates stay in place, they are no longer going to be able to save  lives, they will have to shut down. Are we fine with that? Is that  okay?   Dozens of my constituents in the military have contacted me about  this vaccine mandate. I represent thousands--like many of us do--but I  represent San Antonio, a heavy population of veterans and Active Duty  military. People call me in tears because it was their dream to serve  their country and wear the uniform of the United States, and they are  being told they must get the jab, or they will be discharged.   I am not talking about the ability of a commander of a submarine  going out for a 9-month tour, and saying, Okay. Sorry. I am going to  make sure everybody in the submarine is vaccinated. Okay. Do you have  to discharge the guy or gal? Or you can say, You know what, we are  going to relocate you and leave you able to serve. But while this virus  is going around, we are going to require the commander of the submarine  to be able to make that decision. Okay. That is a reasonable outcome.   Discharging under current law dishonorably, by the way, members of  the United States military for not wanting to get the vaccine, for  whatever reason they believe is in their interest, with young men in  particular having concerns about the myocarditis and the heart issues,  and we are going to say, Sorry, too bad, you get discharged.   This body just funded the DOD, and the government is forcing those  people to be discharged, instead of continuing to carry out their  service to this country, and this body should be ashamed of it.   A lot of people in this town seem to have forgotten that the American  people are not our subjects. They are our fellow citizens, and we owe  them the duty of representing them. They are our neighbors, our  relatives, our friends. The people are sovereign in this country, not  the President.   George Washington turned that down, the Founders rejected that  structure, and yet this body, which was supposed to be a check against  an overbearing executive acting as a monarch refuses to check the  executive.    The CDC estimates that there have been 146 million infections,  suggesting that nearly half of the United States has natural immunity.   The first U.S. omicron patient was fully vaccinated and had mild  symptoms. One study found the protective effect of the vaccine dwindles  alarmingly at 3 months after the second shot, hence, the boosters.  People are now saying that maybe we made a mistake, having the first  two shots of the vaccine happen right next to each other reduced the  effectiveness. Well, lo and behold, hard to believe when you are  rushing and reacting to a virus that you might make an error.   Financial institutions today are putting out reports saying their  concern isn't about the omicron variant but rather governments'  reaction to it. Of course, it is. One of the first doctors who  discovered the variant in South Africa said, ``Most of the patients are  seeing very, very mild symptoms. We have been able to treat these  patients conservatively at home.''   On the 626th day into 15 days to slow the spread, we have had enough.  The American people have had enough of being lied to and told what to  do by a tyrannical Federal Government and so-called experts that we  cannot and should not trust.   This continuing resolution that we passed today was considered under  a closed rule. As I said earlier, no chance for amending it. I offered  an amendment upstairs--rejected. We don't want to have a debate on  vaccine mandates. Why would we want to do that?   My colleagues, I assume, would not like to take a vote on a vaccine  mandate funding repeal. Otherwise, why not have the vote? Why not have  the debate? The more and more that we turn over the decisionmaking to a  small group of people in this body and a small group of people in the  Senate and a couple of people at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,  the more and more this Republic is getting ripped apart thread by  thread. It is happening no matter who is in the White House and no  matter who is in charge of this body.                                time  2020    If we do not restore debate on the floor of this body and in the  Senate--the greatest deliberative body in the world. Come on.   When was the last time you saw any great debate or deliberation in  that body or this one, Madam Speaker?   You don't. We all know it. Nobody cares because all we are going to  do is drop another 2,000-page bill, somebody is going to offer a motion  to recommit. Boy, that will light things on fire. Oh, the previous  question. Oh, man, the bars around town are talking about you.   Did you see that previous question?   Did you see that MTR?   When are we going to represent the people again?   When is this institution going to actually stand up and do the hard  part of representation?   We don't govern. We use that term a lot. We don't govern. We  represent. That is what we are supposed to do in a republic.   Next week we are going to turn to the National Defense Authorization  Act, and if the Senate doesn't make any additional modifications, we  are going to have another version of the NDAA, the National Defense  Authorization Act, sent over to this Chamber for us to vote on again.  In that legislation there are a number of problematic provisions. There  is no accountability for the failed exit from Afghanistan, the 13  marines who died, the failed drone strike that led to the killing of 10  people including seven children. No accountability.   There is no accountability for the $85 billion of assets left behind  in Afghanistan that were just being used in a parade by our enemies, by  the Taliban. No accountability.   Madam Speaker, you have legislation that requires the Secretary of  Defense to submit to Congress their plan to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions and praises the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Well, praise the Lord. Our Department of Defense is focused on the  really important stuff as China is doubling and tripling and  quadrupling their navy, ramping up their military prowess, and shooting  missiles around the Earth at low orbit hitting their targets. Yes.  Let's focus on diversity. Yes. That will get them.   That NDAA requires the DOD to hire and train gender advisers. Boy,  that will send the Chinese packing.   Yes, the National Defense Authorization Act will for the first time  in the history of this country require women--girls--18 years and older  to register for Selective Service, to register to be eligible for the  draft.   My daughter is 10 years old. The infinite wisdom of this body is  going to require that my daughter be forced to register for the draft.  If we want to have a debate about ending the draft, I am happy to do  it. Let's offer the bill, let's have a debate and decide if we need to  draft. I think most people in this body would probably vote the draft  down. But that is not what we are going to do because my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle and, frankly, the retreat by my colleagues  on my side of the aisle from such touchy issues, they want to make a  statement. They want to make a statement about so-called equity, and  they want to use my daughter to make that statement. They want to make  your daughter, America, part of that statement.   If you are one of the thousands of people across this country who  have been reaching out to my office enraged because this body with no  debate, no amendment, and no vote on the substance is going to adopt  the National  [[Page H6906]]  Defense Authorization Act that for the first time in history will  require your daughter, your sister, your mom, and your wife to register  for the draft. Well, don't worry, I am going to keep fighting it.   I am not going to retreat, and I am not going to run away from some  pollster coming in saying, Well, I don't know. I am not sure how people  feel about it.   I know how people feel about it. I know how they feel about it in my  district. I know how they feel about it in my kids' school, in my  communities. I know the people who have stop me in the airport saying  thank you for standing up for some sort of common sense about how we  should actually function as a society.   Speaking of the United States House of free stuff, we spent $36  million for a study to determine whether single-sex units performed  better or worse than mixed-sex units.   What do you think they found?   Madam Speaker, you will be blown away by this piece of information.  The single-sex male units performed better. Oh, we don't want to have  that talk. My colleagues don't want to have that debate. But I am going  to keep having that debate.   Whatever they do at the NDAA, if the Senate doesn't have the  backbone, if my Republican colleagues in the United States Senate won't  stand up for my daughter--our daughters--I will keep calling them out,  every single one of them. I will call on every one of my colleagues in  this body, and I sure as heck will not ever vote for a single one of  them for any office if they are going to make my daughter eligible for  the draft.   This is not the way we should do things.   Have a debate, offer data, have amendments, have the courage to have  straight up-or-down votes on subjects rather than mega bills cooked up  in back rooms so people can go preen and posture in front of cameras  outside on the steps.   No matter who is in charge of this body, restore this body, and don't  continue to operate as the United States House of free stuff doling out  dollar after dollar and printing money to create programs that we can't  even afford and to fundamentally alter and transform this society into  one that is expected from government rather than serving themselves,  their fellow man, and their communities.   We are destroying the core of this great country by empowering  government and doing so knowing full well we don't have the dollars or  the resources to do it; knowing full well that we are ripping out the  soul of people by taking away the value of work; and destroying family  units; destroying the public education system, by turning them into  political corruption entities. The veil having been lifted now after  COVID has exposed so much of that corruption, and what we just saw in  Loudoun County, Virginia, what we just saw unfold in the Commonwealth  of Virginia.    The American people are seeing the corruption that flows from the  dollars that flow from this town without any responsibility. Again,  that is not a partisan statement. Both sides are equally guilty of  walking into this Chamber and writing checks they can't cash. And if we  don't stop it, this country will not survive. This country will not  make it. We will not keep the Republic if we keep spending money we  don't have. If we keep turning over power to a small group of  individuals in this Chamber, the other Chamber, the other end of  Pennsylvania Avenue and, oh, by the way, the courts to make decisions  rather than the people's Representatives.   It is time, Madam Speaker, for this body to function again. And it is  time for us to do it without regard to who is in the other end of  Pennsylvania Avenue in the White House. We have a duty in Article I to  use the power of the purse responsibly, to stand up for the people, to  defend the people, and to stop the encroachment in their lives by  unelected bureaucrats or a President using power that has now already  in three different courts been found to be unconstitutionally and  unlawfully executed against the people while they are lose their jobs,  lose their livelihoods, destroy their lives because they want to make a  decision that they believe is in the interest of them and their  families.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
