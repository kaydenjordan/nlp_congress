 Madam President, I am pleased Congress recently passed my  bipartisan bill, the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim  Assistance Act of 2018. This legislation will help provide meaningful  assistance for child pornography victims to support their recovery and  allow them to reclaim their lives. This is a momentous day and many  years in the making. I have introduced similar versions of this bill in  the last three Congresses, and I look forward to the President signing  it into law.   Nearly 25 years ago, Congress enacted the Violence Against Women Act,  which created a process for victims to seek restitution from  defendants. For crimes that involve individual defendants who cause  specific harm to particular victims, the restitution statute works in a  straightforward way.   Child pornography is unlike any other crime. The abuse involved in  creating these images profoundly alters the lives of victims, while  trafficking in the permanent record of that abuse  [[Page S7253]]  perpetuates and expands the harm. As the Supreme Court noted in its  2014 opinion in Paroline v. United States: ``Every viewing of child  pornography is a repetition of the victim's abuse.'' Unfortunately, the  internet has radically changed the nature of child pornography  trafficking by drastically increasing the number of individuals who  harm victims while simultaneously making it more difficult to identify  the individuals from whom victims can seek restitution.   In its decision in Paroline, the Supreme Court made clear that the  current restitution statute cannot provide meaningful compensation for  most child pornography victims. The Amy, Vicky, and Andy Act changes  that.   The Amy, Vicky, and Andy Act establishes more relevant and useful  standards for child pornography victims who seek restitution from  defendants, including improved criteria for judges to use when  calculating victims' losses and provisions that ensure victims will  receive meaningful restitution. Under this legislation, a victim of  trafficking in child pornography may choose to seek restitution from  defendants or to receive a one-time payment from the Child Pornography  Victims Reserve within the federal Crime Victims Fund. The reserve will  be supported by an assessment on all child pornography defendants.   Congress understands the concern of the Supreme Court in Paroline  that it is difficult to identify a discrete, readily definable  incremental loss any one defendant caused any one victim, and so we  have determined, after considering a range of options with the specific  goal of fully compensating victims of child pornography in a swift and  just manner, that it is reasonable, fair, and equitable to fix the  minimum restitution amount for trafficking in child pornography at  $3,000.   Congress firmly believes that the amounts in the act are consistent  with the principle in Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411 (1990),  that restitution should reflect the consequences of the defendant's own  conduct. Congress finds that $3,000 is the minimum restitution that  each individual defendant of trafficking in child pornography crimes  should be assessed that comports with a defendant's relative role in  the causal process that underlies a victim's general losses. This is  fully in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision in Paroline. This  amount also upholds Congress's longstanding goal of proportionality in  sentencing because it reflects the amount of restitution currently  being sought and ordered in district courts throughout the country.   Criminals convicted of child pornography crimes--be they crimes of  production, distribution, or possession--are part of a group of  wrongdoers who collectively cause harm. Indeed, the profound suffering  of victims of child pornography crimes is due in part to their  knowledge that, each day, untold numbers of people across the country  and around the world are viewing and distributing images of the  victims' sexual abuse. Criminals who commit child pornography crimes  cannot escape their responsibility to pay restitution by hiding in a  crowd.   Another important provision in the bill gives victims access to the  images depicting them, which can be important for victim  identification, expert testimony, forensic review, and treatment.   The Amy, Vicky, and Andy Act has been endorsed by the National  Organization for Victim Assistance, National Association of Attorneys  General, National Crime Victims Law Institute, National District  Attorneys Association, National Center for Victims of Crime, National  Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators, National Crime Victims  Bar Association, CHILD USA, RAINN, APSAC in partnership with The New  York Foundling, Enough is Enough, Thorn, Academy on Violence and Abuse,  DV LEAP, Utah Crime Victims Legal Clinic, Utah Coalition against Sexual  Assault, and the Children's Justice Fund. I appreciate all of their  support.   Developing and passing this important legislation has truly been a  collaborative and years-long effort. There are a number of people I  would like to thank who have been vital in this process.   First and foremost, I wish to recognize and thank Amy, Vicky, and  Andy, the brave individuals for whom this bill is named. As victims in  some of the most widely distributed child pornography series in the  world, they represent so many child pornography victims. Amy, Vicky,  and Andy strongly support this bill.   Second, I want to thank Amy's lawyer, James Marsh; Vicky's lawyer,  Carol Hepburn; Andy's advocates at the Utah Crime Victims Legal Clinic;  and Professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah, who took Amy's  case all the way to the Supreme Court. Their assistance with this bill,  drawn from their tireless advocacy for victims, has been truly  invaluable and much appreciated. Likewise, I must thank the dedicated  attorneys at the Department of Justice for their important  contributions to this legislation. I would particularly like to thank  Alexandra Gelber of the Department of Justice Child Exploitation and  Obscenity Section.   Third, I wish to thank the Senators on both sides of the aisle who  supported this important legislation, especially the 26 colleagues who  co-sponsored this legislation with me. In particular, I wish to thank  Ranking Member Feinstein, who joined me in introducing this bill. We  have served together for many years, and she has long been a champion  for crime victims. I likewise want to express my gratitude to Chairman  Chuck Grassley, who also joined me in introducing the bill and who was  crucial to getting this important legislation across the finish line.  Throughout our Senate service, I have worked with Chairman Grassley and  Ranking Member Feinstein on several bills to protect children, and I  thank them for their commitment to ensuring that child victims have the  support they need. I must thank members of their staff as well for  their outstanding work: Senator Feinstein's counsel, Nicholas Xenakis,  her former chief counsel for crime, Peter Hyun, and her former  detailee, Sunjeet Randhawa; and Senator Grassley's chief Constitution  counsel and crime counsel, Aaron Cummings, and his chief counsel for  justice programs, juvenile justice, and violence against women, Evelyn  Fortier.   Fourth, I wish to recognize some colleagues in the House of  Representatives. I would like to thank Congressman Trey Gowdy, the  House sponsor of the bill. He has been a tireless advocate for child  pornography victims, and I appreciate his dedicated service. Anna  Bartlett in his office was a terrific help. Congressman Matt  Cartwright, who represents Amy in the House, has been a champion on  this issue and has introduced similar legislation in the last three  Congresses.   I would also like to recognize House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte. I have been fortunate to work with him on several  initiatives throughout the years that were enacted into law, most  recently the Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act. I  was pleased to collaborate with him again on the Amy, Vicky, and Andy  Act. I would like to thank his chief of staff, Shelley Husband, and his  deputy chief of staff and chief counsel, Branden Ritchie, for their  excellent job in shepherding this bill through the House. I also need  to thank staff on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations for their great work, chief counsel Robert  Parmiter and former counsel Chris Grieco. I would like to give a  special shout-out to Crime Subcommittee counsel Margaret Barr, who was  an outstanding partner in this effort. They all deserve tremendous  credit for this victory.   I would be remiss if I did not thank staff in the cloakroom and  Senate legislative counsel for their assistance. Our work in the Senate  would not be possible without their dedicated service.   Lastly, I would like to thank those on my staff who assisted me with  this bill. Firstly, I would like to thank my former chief counsel and  senior nominations counsel, Thomas Jipping, who spearheaded this effort  while he was a member of my staff. Next, I need to recognize Matt  Sandgren, my chief of staff His tenacity and expertise was invaluable  in getting this legislation passed. I am also grateful to my  legislative director, Matt Jensen, for his dedicated work on this bill  through each step of the legislative process. Finally, I would like to  thank Kristin  [[Page S7254]]  McLintock, my senior legislative aide, who worked diligently with House  staff and stakeholders over the last several months to refine this bill  and get it across the finish line. They all deserve immense credit for  their work to get this bill enacted into law.   Child pornography is a truly evil crime that has lasting impacts on  its victims. The Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim  Assistance Act will help provide victims the assistance they need to  put their lives back together. I am honored and extremely pleased this  legislation will soon be signed into law.                            ____________________
