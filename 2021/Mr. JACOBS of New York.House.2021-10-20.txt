 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  the Democrats' radical reconciliation package and, specifically, their  plans to weaponize the IRS and dramatically expand the agency's reach  into the lives of everyday Americans.   Originally, Democrats' plan was to hire thousands of new IRS agents  to surveil the bank accounts of Americans who have $600 or more in  their accounts. While they have upped that amount in the legislation to  $10,000 in deposits and withdrawals, this would still subject every  American working at least a minimum wage job, who has a bank account,  to government intrusion.   I can tell you, and I think most of my colleagues would agree, that I  have not had a constituent call and beg me for more IRS agents or for  the agency to have increased ability to monitor their accounts. Rather,  my constituents are concerned this proposal represents an attempt by  the administration to weaponize and politicize the IRS and fund their  partisan agenda.   I believe Americans are entitled to privacy and constitutional  rights. This proposal is a dramatic overreach and emblematic of this  administration's  [[Page H5707]]  priorities: expand the government's control over everyday Americans.                            ____________________
