 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Later today, I will attend a second discussion between  President Biden and Speaker McCarthy on the Nation's debt limit.   The Speaker presented his case to the President back in February.  House Republicans passed legislation to raise the debt ceiling in  April, but as of mid-May, the President of the United States has found  just two--two--more occasions to sit down and discuss an agreement to  preserve the Nation's full faith and credit.   The Biden administration took 3 months to reach a conclusion that  just about everyone else recognized from the beginning. I said it  myself back in February: that the only way forward is spending  negotiations between the President and the Speaker. That is how the  American people arranged the current situation, and, by the way, that  is how 7 of the last 10--7 of the last 10--debt limit increases have  been secured--bipartisan negotiations.   That is how a Republican President and Democratic Speaker avoided  crisis 4 years ago. I remember telling President Trump he needed to do  something he was not anxious to do, which was to talk to Speaker  Pelosi, because the American people had given us divided government.  That is how a Democratic President and a Republican Speaker will avoid  this crisis as well.   Speaker McCarthy is right. The Senate Democrat majority hasn't passed  a bill to raise the debt ceiling. The House Republican majority has.   So that is where the solution to this looming crisis will be found.   Last fall, the American people sent a divided government to  Washington. They chose to require that President Biden work with House  Republicans on the most consequential issues. Now, the President has to  make a choice of his own: Pretend the last election didn't happen or  sit down with the Speaker and deal responsibly with our Nation's debt.   Time is of the essence--of the essence. So, for the second time, I  will be glad to sit in at the White House to support Speaker McCarthy  and to urge President Biden to start operating in reality.                               Border Security    Now, Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, it has been 5  days since the Biden administration ended title 42 emergency border  enforcement authorities--5 days. By all accounts, the situation at our  southern border is absolutely catastrophic--absolutely catastrophic-- for the brave men and women of Customs and Border Protection and for  countless communities across Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.   As title 42 expired on Thursday, officials in Del Rio, TX--listen to  this--reported a 1-day increase in border apprehensions of 75 percent-- 1 day. In El Paso, one area of downtown is rapidly being overrun by  tents and garbage--tents and garbage. One Border Patrol officer reports  that every CBP enforcement sector along the southern border is now near  150 percent capacity--150 percent capacity. Sadly, what the country is  witnessing right now is a slow-moving car crash.   Republicans have spent years urging President Biden and his party to  get serious about securing our southern border. And the American people  have known for quite some time that Democrats' approach helped create  this humanitarian and security crisis. On President Biden's watch, just  last fiscal year, Customs and Border Protection recorded an all-time  high for migrant apprehensions: 2.7 million in 1 year. By the Agency's  own estimates, another 1.2 million ``got-aways'' have successfully  snuck across the southern border since the President took office.   The Biden administration made no effort to hide how little it cares  about cleaning up the mess. Remember, for months on end, the White  House Press Secretary assiduously avoided calling the situation at the  southern border what it obviously was--a crisis.   Vice President Harris, the administration's official ``border czar,''  has been to the border just once in 2\1/2\ years.   When Congress asked the head of the Department of Homeland Security  to account for the chaos unfolding on his watch, Secretary Mayorkas  characterized functionally open borders as ``executing on the plan.''   Apparently, Republicans are the only ones interested in getting the  southern border crisis under control.   Later this week, the Senate will vote on a resolution from Senator  Marshall to remove a major pillar of the Biden administration's open- borders approach. Our colleague's measure takes aim at a rule the  administration implemented late last year to severely limit what  immigration officials are allowed to consider when determining whether  a potential immigrant is likely to become a ``public charge'' and rely  on taxpayer-funded services.   In other words, facing record flows of illegal migration, President  Biden's response was to greet people at the border with food stamps and  housing vouchers--welcome to America. Sadly,  [[Page S1657]]  that is exactly what some of the would-be immigrants arriving at the  border have come to expect from Washington Democrats.   One Venezuelan man who made it to El Paso said he was told: ``They  will feed you, clothe you, help you with your studies, and get a job.''  That is what this migrant from Venezuela was told.   It is alarming that Washington Democrats must be forced to be good  stewards of taxpayer dollars. The Biden administration should not need  to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to do right by the hard-working  citizens of this country.   So I am grateful to the junior Senator from Kansas for calling the  Senate's attention once again to the Biden administration's shameless  failure at the southern border, and I will urge each of my colleagues  to join me in supporting the resolution later this week.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
