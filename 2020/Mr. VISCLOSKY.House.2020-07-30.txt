 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairwoman for her  very kind remarks. I also want to thank Nita for her friendship over  the years. As I am going to again mention in my prepared remarks, the  gentlewoman's life of service to not only her constituency, not only to  this great Nation, but to the people of the world, given all of her  work on the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Agencies, and again, having a broad, long-term view of dedicating her  life to make sure that the world we leave is going to be better for our  children and posterity.   So I appreciate that as well. As I have quipped, if the gentlewoman  is not going to be back next year, I am not going to be back next year.   I, first of all, do want to thank my ranking member and my friend,  Mr. Calvert, for his continued commitment to being collegial,  transparent, and bipartisan.   I cannot overstate the value of the gentleman's friendship and the  partnership we have enjoyed over the years. He is a gentleman.   Further, I would again appreciate and acknowledge the work of  chairwoman, Mrs. Lowey, who is also departing the House at the end of  this year. Again I commend you, Nita, for your dedicated life of  service and a commitment to leaving this world better. Thank you very  much.                                time  1100    I want to also thank the subcommittee staff, particularly our clerks,  Becky Leggieri and Johnnie Kaberle; as well as Walter Hearne, Brooke  Boyer, Ariana Sarar, Kiya Batmanglidj, Jackie Ripke, David Bortnick,  Matt Bower, Bill Adkins, Jennifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg, Paul  Kilbride, Shannon Richter, Sherry Young, Kyle McFarland, Jamie  McCormick, Brian Potts, and Nick Vance; those in Ranking Member  Calvert's personal office, as well, Rebecca Keightley and William  Hendrickson; and my personal staff, Joe DeVooght and our fellow from  the Department of Defense, Major Stephen Cash.   I am profoundly grateful to each for their dedicated service to the  public, for their acumen, and for their generosity of spirit.   The bill continues to focus on the well-being and morale of those in  uniform and their families as well as DOD civilians and their  communities. The bill provides an additional $116 million for upgrades  to childcare facilities, and the report contains language directing the  military services to present innovative ideas to address the serious  backlog for childcare.   It provides $1.49 billion for environmental restoration activities,  which is $415 million above the request.   We provide $327 million to address the ongoing epidemic of sexual  assault in the military and at the service academies, which is $49  million more than requested. Despite dire warnings, the Department's  budget for sexual assault prevention and response remains stagnant. The  Department has got to do a much better job.  [[Page H4115]]    Another area of deep concern for me is the Department's lack of  compliance with many congressionally directed reporting requirements.  For example, last year, the committee directed the Department to submit  a report on its contracts for advertising services with socially and  economically disadvantaged small businesses. The report was supposed to  accompany the Department's fiscal year 2021 budgets submission in  February, but it was transmitted to the committee on July 14, 5 months  late and the same day we marked up the bill. Regrettably, reporting  deadlines are often missed, making it much more difficult for the  committee to make timely decisions.   The bill, again, contains several provisions to rein in the  Department's now habitual redirection of funding and contravention of  congressional intent. One DOD official in a meeting earlier this year  referred to these transfers of $10 billion as anomalies. I refer to  them as habitual abuses. The sense of entitlement in these actions is  galling, and I hope that at some point the Department will have the  leadership in place to recognize it is Congress' constitutional  prerogative and restore trust to the appropriations process.    Mr. Speaker, before I begin with my remarks on the fiscal year (FY)  2021 bill, I would like to briefly discuss some concerns I have as a  longtime member of the House Appropriations Committee.   The Committee has a unique responsibility. It is charged with funding  and oversight of the entire government, and ensuring that it is as  effective and as efficient as possible. However, in some ways, the  Committee is at its nadir in terms of its ability to achieve bipartisan  solutions. In part, this is due to the Budget Control Act of 2011,  which is an ill-fated attempt to balance the federal budget by cutting  only discretionary spending.   Currently, mandatory spending and interest on the debt represent 70  percent of the money spent each year by the federal government.  Discretionary spending, which is an investment in the future, makes up  just 30 percent of federal spending. When less than 30 percent of young  Americans are qualified to join the military, it is clear we need to  invest more in our nation's health, education, infrastructure, and  jobs. Unfortunately, from my perspective, recent Congresses have  mistakenly relied on mandatory spending to avoid making difficult  decisions on discretionary spending on an annual basis. A case in  point, last week the House passed a bill that will provide much needed  funding to address the maintenance backlog in our public lands. But the  bill utilizes mandatory funding mechanisms that further decrease the  ability of Congress and the Appropriations Committee to exercise annual  discretion and oversight.   I implore my colleagues who serve in the next Congress to avoid  repeating the mistakes of the recent past. The lasting solution to our  nation's fiscal problems will only be realized by confronting the  continued growth in mandatory spending while simultaneously increasing  revenues. In the year 2000, the last year the federal government had a  surplus, revenues, as a percentage of GDP, were 20 percent. In fiscal  year 2019, revenues were 16.3 percent. We need revenue to invest in the  future of our country, and every appropriated dollar is an investment.   Moving onto the FY 2021 bill, I first want to thank my Ranking Member  and friend, Mr. Calvert, for his continued commitment to being  collegial, transparent, and bipartisan. I cannot overstate the value of  his friendship and the partnership we have enjoyed over the years.   I also want to express my sincere gratitude to Chairwoman Lowey and  Ranking Member Granger. We would not be here without their leadership  and dedication.   Further, I would like to acknowledge that Chairwoman Lowey will be  joining me in departing the House at the end of this year. I commend  her for a dedicated life of service and commitment to leaving this  world a little bit better than the way she found it. Thank you very  much. It is a joy to work with you.   I want to thank the Subcommittee staff, particularly, our clerks,  Becky Leggieri and Johnnie Kaberle, as well as Walter Hearne, Brooke  Boyer, Ariana Sarar, Jackie Ripke, David Bortnick, Matt Bower, Bill  Adkins, Jennifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg, Paul Kilbride, Shannon  Richter, Sherry Young, Kyle McFarland, Kiya Batmanglidj, Jamie  McCormick, Brian Potts, and Nick Vance, my personal office staff, Joe  DeVooght and Stephen Cash, and those in Ranking Member Calvert's  personal office, Rebecca Keightley and William Hendrickson. Having to  assemble the bulk of the bill and report remotely increased the degree  of difficulty substantially, as it has for all of the subcommittees. I  commend them for their professionalism and acumen.   The bill would provide $694.6 billion for the Department of Defense  budget, which is $1.3 billion above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level  and $3. 7 billion below the request. The base funding recommendation is  $626.2 billion, which is $3.5 billion above the fiscal year 2020  enacted level and $3.5 billion below the request. The overseas  contingency operations recommendation is $68.4 billion, which is $2.2  billion below the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and $215 million below  the request.   This legislation recognizes the complex challenges the members of our  Armed Forces and intelligence community face every day throughout the  world, and it aims to ensure that they are able to continue to meet  these challenges and complete their missions to the best of their  abilities. To support this forward-looking posture, the bill makes  major investments in operations and maintenance, procurement, and  research and development.   I also think it is important to highlight some investments the  Committee has made with regards to the current COVID-19 pandemic. This  legislation would provide:   $758 million in procurement for COVID-19 recovery for second, third  and fourth tier suppliers. This has been of particular interest to Mr.  Calvert, and I appreciate his advocacy of this issue;   $450 million in operation and maintenance for COVID-19 recovery and  resupply; and   $150 million in the Defense Health Program for COVID-19 response.   In addition to the funding enumerated above, the legislation places  several reporting requirements on the Department specific to COVID-19.  The budgetary impacts of the pandemic on the Department are still  largely undetermined. Some programs will cost more. However, there will  be savings obtained through delayed or cancelled events and activities.  It is imperative that the Committee and Congress have as much detail as  possible to properly delegate funding and to conduct oversight.   And most importantly, the bill continues to focus on the well-being  and morale of those in uniform and their families, as well as DoD  civilians and their communities.   The bill provides an additional $116 million for upgrades to  childcare facilities and the report contains language directing the  military services to present innovative ideas to address the serious  backlog for childcare.   The bill provides $1.49 billion for environmental restoration  activities, which is $415 million above the request. This increased  funding will help DoD address the significant and salient public health  risks associated with PFOS/PFOA.   The bill and report take steps to stop the Department from closing  military treatment facilities and from reducing military healthcare  billets, which would have cost $334.6 million this fiscal year. These  plans were poorly justified to the Committee prior to the pandemic, and  even harder to defend under current conditions.   The bill provides $327 million to address the ongoing epidemic of  sexual assault in the military and at the service academies, which is  $49 million more than requested. And I must express my personal upset  over this issue. The most recent report on the sexual assault rate for  women has jumped a shocking 50 percent from 2016 to 2018. Despite dire  warnings, the Department's budget for sexual assault prevention and  response remains stagnant. And I would also say it is not just a  question of money. Year after year after year, we have testimony from  officials who contend that they are really committed to solving this  problem. And yet we are going backwards. The Department must do a much  better job.   These efforts and several others within the bill will have an  immediate positive impact on people's quality of life.   Another area of concern for me is the Department's lack of compliance  with many Congressionally directed reporting requirements. For example,  last year the Committee directed the Department to submit a report on  its contracts for advertising services with socially and economically  disadvantaged small businesses. The report was supposed to accompany  the Department's FY 2021 budget submission in February, but it was  transmitted to the Committee on July 14, five months late and the same  day we marked up the bill. Regrettably, reporting deadlines are often  missed, making it much more difficult for the Committee to make timely  decisions.   The bill, again, contains several provisions to rein in the  Department's habitual redirection of funding and contravention of  congressional intent. These actions have irreparably damaged the  Department's credibility with the Committee. One DoD official, in a  meeting, referred to these transfers of billions of dollars as  anomalies. I refer to them as habitual abuses by the Department.   In recent years, the Department leadership has not missed an  opportunity to claim that a 3 percent to 5 percent annual growth rate  in the defense budget is necessary to support the National Defense  Strategy. But at the  [[Page H4116]]  same time, those same leaders facilitated the transfer of nearly $10  billion to non-defense activities not enumerated in their own National  Defense Strategy. And while this was happening, they also have the  temerity to repeatedly request more flexibility from Congress for  executing their budget and for reprogramming authorities. The sense of  entitlement in these actions is galling, and I hope that at some point  the Department will have the leadership in place to recognize  Congress's constitutional prerogative and restore trust to the  appropriations process.   In closing, I would again thank my chair, ranking member, and all of  the members, who have logged so many hours in making this bill  possible. I look forward to debate on the amendments.

In closing, I would again thank my chair, ranking member, and all of  the members, who have logged so many hours in making this bill  possible. I look forward to debate on the amendments.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and  I  [[Page H4140]]  do appreciate the gentlewoman's concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I would begin my remarks by saying the United States  military is a very special place. Only about 30 percent of young  Americans between 17 and 24 are eligible to join the military. Others  are not because of educational issues, because of health issues, and  other circumstances.   It is clear we have to make an investment in society. But having said  that, this is a special place and we ought to cast a very broad net to  encourage young Americans to serve their country in the military,  especially those--I would point out, living in Gary, Indiana--in  disadvantaged communities, many of which don't even know that  opportunity exists.   The gentlewoman is concerned about abuses, and I share that concern,  and I think Mr. Calvert certainly does. We have seen abuses--setting  the issue of technology aside--with recruiters making false promises.  That is why we have controls in place. That is why those people are  punished. That is why we have Congressional oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I do understand the criticism of younger people viewing  esports channels. The ArmyEsports team Twitch channel has been set to  18-plus since August of 2019. I would grant that it is difficult in  many instances to verify age online, and I do find recent media reports  on the ArmyEsports team in the banning of commentators concerning. It  is difficult to balance a platform's churn of service and community  guidelines with free speech, and I understand that ArmyEsports has  taken a pause on streaming and is reviewing its internal policies and  procedures.   We, on the committee, certainly look forward to seeing the results of  that review to allow the military to learn how to ensure that these  platforms are used properly in the future.   The gentlewoman rightly also points out the issue of age. I would  point out to all of my colleagues in this Chamber, that our bill  already funds educational programs that give children under the age of  16 exposure to military service, including Junior ROTC, Civil Air  Patrol, STARBASE, National Guard Youth Challenge, Young Marines, and  Sea Cadets. These programs are in high demand and enjoy great  bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, the concern is well-placed. It is the reason we have to  exercise great oversight and control, but I do have to oppose the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1067, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chair of the Committee on Education and  Labor.  [[Page H4147]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Loebsack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Schrier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Ms. Stevens).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1067, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McNerney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. Schrier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I ask for support of the amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
