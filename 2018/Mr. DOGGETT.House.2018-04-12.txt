 Mr. Speaker, like some stormy sermon from Trump on the  virtues of chastity, I believe these House Republicans today really do  deserve a gold medal for hypocrisy.   After approving their budget-busting, trickle-down, trillion-dollar  tax break and refusing to pay a dime for their huge increase in  military spending, they have the audacity to advance a balanced budget  amendment. Choosing words over deeds, they shamelessly preach the  gospel of ``do what I say, not what I do.''   I have already voted for a balanced budget when I voted for not going  into an unnecessary war without paying anything for it.   I voted for a balanced budget when I voted to reject the distorted  Republican theology that, when it comes to taxes, less always means  more. The more tax cut theology has proven wrong over and over and over  again. Republicans keep demanding just one more tax cut to drive us  ever deeper into debt.   Dripping in red ink, this newest Trump tax bill that he is promoting  right now at the White House certainly validates his boast that he is  the ``King of Debt,'' and these House Republicans are his supplicants.   Our children and our grandchildren are being saddled with over $2  trillion in debt just because of this one bill, all so that Trump, his  wealthy buddies, and a few multinational corporations, can receive a  tax windfall.   For Trump and his congressional enablers, fiscal responsibility is  just a hollow political slogan that they use to undermine the vital  education, healthcare, and retirement security initiatives, like  Medicare, that they have always not truly supported. They would surely  let Medicare ``wither on the vine,'' to use the words of one the King  of Debt's loudest troubadours.   Reject this proposal.
