 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan (Mr.  Upton).   I rise in support of H.R. 951, a bill I authored to extend the  license authorizing the Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company's construction  of its hydropower project at W. Kerr Scott Dam.   The project has required exhaustive coordination with the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers, and there have been delays in the review process  for the design plans. As the Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company takes  steps to comply with statutory mandates and requirements by Federal  regulators, the shot clock for action on breaking ground dwindles. As  has often happened with these projects, delays in the review process  and coordination efforts precluded the start of construction.   I ask my colleagues to support a new authorization for this project,  along with the other projects the House is considering today.  Furthermore, I applaud Representative McMorris Rodgers and the House  Energy and Commerce Committee for working on comprehensive reform  legislation to address the statutory framework and FERC processes  pertaining to these projects.   I am a proud supporter of our Nation's renewable energy resources.  Congress should optimize the use of our Nation's clean, renewable  hydropower potential by bringing regulatory and permitting certainty to  the process.   Given North Carolina's growth and demand for electricity, my State  needs Congress to explore every opportunity to meet our energy demands,  provide for job growth, and sustain our environment. As chair of the  Education and the Workforce Committee, I will work tirelessly with the  other committees in the House and the Trump administration to achieve  this.   I thank Chairman Walden, Majority Leader McCarthy, and former  Chairman Upton for bringing this important legislation to the floor.   Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
