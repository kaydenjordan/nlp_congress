 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to address  the nomination of Congressman Ryan Zinke to lead the Department of  Interior.   As Secretary of Interior, Representative Zinke will be the steward of  our Nation's precious public lands, national parks, tribal lands, and  historical and cultural resources. These lands not only play an  important role in preserving habitat, landscapes, and history, they  also create jobs and invigorate nearby communities.   During his confirmation hearing, I was excited to hear Congressman  Zinke refer to himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist.   We all know the important role Teddy Roosevelt played in protecting  our natural resources. During his Presidency, Roosevelt established 230  million acres of public lands. In 1901, he created the U.S. Forest  Service and established 150 national forests. In 1906, he signed into  law the Antiquities Act, legislation that allowed either the President  or Congress to set aside ``historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric  structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest'' in  order to stop their destruction. With this act, he designated 18  national monuments, including several iconic areas.   A modern version of Teddy Roosevelt would be a wonderful selection to  head the Department of Interior. But, after closely examining  Representative Zinke's record, he doesn't appear to be a Teddy  Roosevelt conservationist.   Last Congress, Representative Zinke voted in favor of an amendment to  the House Interior appropriations bill that would have rolled back the  authority of the President to use the Antiquities Act in seven Western  States. He also supported a bill that would have effectively eliminated  public review of hardrock mining activities on Federal lands. And he  supported the Keystone XL pipeline.   Conservationist groups seem to have similar concerns about  Congressman Zinke's record.   The League of Conservation Voters gave him a 3 percent rating for  2015 and a 5 percent rating for 2016--hardly what you would expect from  a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist. This troubles me, as Representative  Zinke, if confirmed, would be responsible for managing new monuments of  great importance--namely, the Pullman National Monument and the Bears  Ears National Monument.   The Pullman National Monument was designated by President Obama in  2015 in a Chicago neighborhood that has played a significant role in  our country's African-American and labor history.   It represents the culmination of a collaborative effort by  businesses, residents, and other organizations seeking to restore and  preserve this unique community.   The Pullman neighborhood was originally developed a century ago by  rail car magnate George Pullman as a factory town that would help shape  our country as we know it today.   It was the birthplace of the Nation's first Black labor union, the  Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which is credited with helping to  create the African-American middle class and making crucial civil  rights advancements in this county.   Pullman workers also fought for fair labor conditions in the late  19th century. During the economic depression of the 1890s, the Pullman  community was the catalyst for the first industry-wide strike in the  United States, which eventually led to the creation of Labor Day as a  national holiday.   The Pullman National Monument not only highlights stories from  communities that are rarely represented in other national parks, but  its location on Chicago's South Side--easily accessible to millions of  people by public transportation--also makes it particularly unique.  Following its designation, the Pullman neighborhood joined the National  Mall and the Statue of Liberty as one of the few DOI-managed lands in  an urban area.   But Pullman now needs an Interior Secretary who is committed to  dedicating resources that will ensure the monument is a driver of  tourism and job creation in the community.   Public lands have certainly been a great economic driver in Utah, and  the Bear Ears National Monument will no doubt build on this success.   The 1.35 million acre swath of land, declared a national monument by  President Obama, covers forested mesas to redrock canyons and will  protect the region's abundant cultural resources, which include well- preserved cliff dwellings, rock and art panels, artifacts, and Native  American burials.   Bears Ears is special, as it is the first monument of its kind to be  proposed and advocated for by a united coalition of five tribes, who  sought its protection because of its important place in all of their  respective cultures.   Congressman Zinke is well aware of the monument and has said his  first priority as Secretary would be to go to Utah and make a  recommendation regarding the status of the Bears Ears National  Monument.   While this monument designation has been met with opposition from  Utah politicians, the attacks on the Bears Ears Monument do not reflect  the views of all Utahans.   Recently, Utah's paper of record, the Salt Lake Tribune, called the  political fervor a ``blindness.''  [[Page S1467]]    ``That blindness can be sourced to Utah's one-party political system  that has given us leaders who are out of touch with their  constituents.'' It continues, ``The Bears Ears monument may be with us  forever, and there is no bucket of gold waiting if it does go away. The  presidential proclamation bent far toward the same boundaries and  shared management [Utah Rep. Rob] Bishop pursued with his Public Lands  Initiative.''   Sadly, attacks on monument designations are nothing new.   One of our greatest conservation Presidents, Teddy Roosevelt, faced a  great deal of opposition to his designation of a national monument you  may be familiar with, the Grand Canyon. Most Americans can't imagine an  America without the iconic Grand Canyon, a true national treasure.   But, at the time of its 1908 designation, groups were opposed to  protecting this area. For years after its designation, oil and gas  miners fought against additional protections for the Grand Canyon. In  the end, conservationists won out, and by 1919, the Grand Canyon was  made into a national park to be protected for future generations.   Roosevelt said, ``It is also vandalism wantonly to destroy or to  permit the destruction of what is beautiful in nature, whether it be a  cliff, a forest, or a species of mammal or bird. Here in the United  States we turn our rivers and streams into sewers and dumping-grounds,  we pollute the air, we destroy forests, and exterminate fishes, birds  and mammals--not to speak of vulgarizing charming landscapes with  hideous advertisements. But at last it looks as if our people were  awakening''   Since Roosevelt's time, we have made a lot of progress in protecting  our lands and waters, but still have a long way to go. That is why the  next Interior Secretary needs to take a step forward in protecting more  of our public lands, not backwards.   Therefore, I have no choice but to oppose Congressman Zinke.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it has now been almost 5 months since our  intelligence community first detailed how Russia launched a cyber act  of war on America and our last Presidential election--5 months. In  those 5 months, how many times have my Republican colleagues come to  the floor of the Senate to discuss this national security threat, this  cyber attack by Russia? How many times has the party of Ronald Reagan-- who so clearly understood the threat of the Soviet Union--spoken on the  Senate floor about this Russian cyber attack on America? Zero. That is  right--zero. They have found more than 35 occasions to talk about  stripping health care from millions of Americans, and they made time to  urgently rush votes dismantling environmental and anticorruption  regulation, but to talk about how a former KGB official launched a  cyber act of war against America aimed at eroding trust in our historic  democracy and electing the candidate seen as more sympathetic to  Russia--zero. Not once.    Why would Russian dictator Vladimir Putin favor President Trump in  the last election? Well, I just returned from a week visiting our  allies in Eastern Europe. I can tell you, they are puzzled by this,  too, and they are worried. They are worried that Donald Trump, the new  President, is already advancing and will further advance policies  sympathetic to Vladimir Putin's dangerous agenda, specifically  weakening the Western transatlantic democratic alliance.   Regardless of the partisan leanings of who was in government in the  nations  [[Page S1468]]  I just visited--populist, social democrat, conservative, liberal--the  concerns in each of these nations of Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine  were the same. Is the United States' history of championing democracy  and collective security in Europe ending? Are we backing away from  those values and commitments just as Russia is more aggressively  challenging them? Is the American President really using phrases like  ``enemy of the people'' to describe the free press in America?   You see, the countries that I visited were once in the Eastern bloc,  Warsaw Pact, or Soviet Union. They are familiar with that term, ``enemy  of the people.'' That was a term used by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin  that was so ominous that the Soviet Premier, Nikita Khrushchev, later  demanded that the Communist Party stop using it because it eliminated  the possibility of any kind of ideological fight.   Think of that. Here was Khrushchev saying: Stop using the Stalin term  ``enemy of the people''; it is too divisive. Now it is being used to  describe the media, a description that has been offered by the new  President of the United States. Are the Trump administration's bizarre  blinders to Vladimir Putin's aggression and true nature--and the  silence of too many of his colleagues on this danger--a harbinger of  some kind of Western retreat when it comes to Russian aggression?   It is hard to believe this is happening in 2017. President Trump has  called NATO obsolete. That is a stark and completely wrong statement,  so bad that it required the Vice President of the United States to  travel to Munich, Germany, last week and reassure our allies who have  been part of our alliance since World War II that NATO was not  obsolete.   When has it happened in history that the President of the United  States would make such a sweeping, erroneous, dangerous statement about  the most important alliance in the world and then send his Vice  President out on a repair job? The President has surrounded himself  with people like Steve Bannon, who reportedly once called himself a  Leninist and seems bizarrely sympathetic to Putin's dictatorial model  and weakening the European alliance.   It turns out that the just-resigned National Security Advisor, LTG  Michael Flynn, the one who was fired by the previous administration,  the one who led chants unworthy of a great democracy about locking up  Hillary Clinton, was, in fact, speaking to Russian officials before he  or Donald Trump had taken office and, suspiciously, just after  President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its attack on our  election.   President Trump still refuses to release his tax returns to clarify  what his son said in 2008 regarding Trump's businesses seeing ``a lot  of money pouring in from Russia.'' President Trump even said yesterday:  ``I haven't called Russia in 10 years.'' That is hard to verify. He  spoke to Vladimir Putin on the telephone just a month ago, which was  followed, incidentally, a day later by renewed fighting by the Russian- backed separatists in Ukraine.   President Trump visited Russia in 2013. He tweeted at the time: ``I  just got back from Russia--learned lots & lots.''   Clearly, he did not learn enough about Vladimir Putin. As if that  were not enough, this President still refuses to acknowledge Russia's  attack or to criticize Vladimir Putin. You see, the President of the  United States has trouble, a real habit of lashing out at everyone and  anyone involved in a perceived slight, a dangerous and unbecoming  behavior when granted the privilege to be President of this great  Nation.   In fact, the vast number and range of those attacked or insulted via  Twitter is so significant that I need considerably more time here on  the floor of the Senate to list all of the targets of President Trump's  attacks on Twitter. So if you make any criticism or joke about  President Trump, make any perceived slight, run a department store,  lead a labor union, do just about anything, you may be a victim of one  of his Twitter attacks, except, of course, if you happen to be a former  Communist KGB official who now leads Russia, a nation that recently  attacked our election.   How is it possible? How is it sensible? How is this not an abdication  of the President's responsibilities? Russian President Putin launched a  cyber attack and war on the United States and its democracy. November  8, 2016, is a day that will live in cyber infamy because of this  Russian attack on the United States of America.   President Putin interfered in our election and tried to influence the  selection of the American people in choosing their leader. The evidence  is overwhelming. It has been available in increasing amounts for almost  5 months. The White House is silent, in denial.   Republican Senators are largely silent, and not one of them has come  to the Senate floor to even address this issue. Meanwhile, Vladimir  Putin continues his aggressive military cyber disinformation campaign  throughout Europe.   Just last week, the Washington Post reported that the White House led  an effort to discredit news stories that described contacts between the  Trump campaign and Russian Government officials. The House Intelligence  Committee chairman, Congressman Nunes of California, a Republican, went  so far as to dismiss these claims of Russian interference in the  campaign for the President of the United States and to condemn the  leaks that have brought this information to the attention of the  American people. Rather than doing their part to ensure an impartial,  independent investigation of these chilling facts, the White House has  tried to spin it out of existence. In fact, yesterday, it was reported  that the White House Press Secretary asked CIA Director Michael Pompeo  and the chairmen of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees to  help discredit news articles about the Trump campaign aides' contacts  with Russian officials.   John Brennan, who was head of the Central Intelligence Agency under  President Obama, was asked in an interview last night if he could  imagine being contacted by the White House and asked to spin a story  one way or the other. He said it was unthinkable. It just wasn't done  under previous administrations. Here we are, not even 6 weeks into this  Presidency, and it is already happening.   Can anyone here--anyone--imagine what would happen if the situation  had been reversed? I can just imagine the howls of ``treason'' and  ``impeachment.'' Not a single nominee would be confirmed until there  were answers and accountability if this had happened and there was an  effort by the Russians to influence an election in favor of the  Democrats.   What has happened to my friends on the other side of the aisle? When  will they put the country that they are sworn to represent and to  uphold above any partisan consideration? A Polish expert who I ran into  during my journey summed all this up wisely when he said: If the United  States does not respond to the Russian attack on its own election,  Putin will feel he has a free hand to keep taking destabilizing actions  in the West.   There was a time in Washington when national security issues were  bipartisan. Politics used to stop at the water's edge. The security of  the Nation meant putting aside partisan agendas to face a common  threat. It is time to return to that tradition. We need an independent,  transparent investigation of this Russian involvement in our  Presidential election.   We know the voters list in my home State of Illinois was hacked. We  know that some 17 different intelligence agencies have told us  unequivocally that Russia did everything in its power to try to change  the outcome of this last election. We are told that there could have  been up to 1,000 Russian trolls sitting in headquarters in Moscow,  trying to hack into the computers of people in the United States to  influence the outcome of this election.   We know that, coincidentally, some 2 hours after a very  controversial, negative story came out against Donald Trump, the  Russians released information that they had hacked from the campaign of  Hillary Clinton.   Two hours. A coincidence? Not likely. There is a lot of information  that needs to be followed up on. No conclusions can be reached until  there is a thorough, independent, credible investigation. I worry about  using the Intelligence Committees for this purpose.  [[Page S1469]]  These committees and their activities are important, critical, but they  are largely invisible and their deliberations are interminable. We are  waiting, hoping that they will come up with information to help us  spare the United States from a future attack by Russia or any other  country on the sovereignty of our Nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize  my constituents, Brian and Joanne Leber, of Leber Jeweler Inc. in  Chicago, IL. A third-generation, family-owned business first  established in 1921, Brian and his wife, Joanne, are dedicated to  socially conscious and eco-friendly fine jewelry. Leber Jeweler Inc.  has been instrumental in not only serving as a model for responsible  and ethical sourcing in the jewelry industry, but Brian and Joanne also  have a deep history of activism and philanthropy, advocating for  important policies that support human rights.   In 1999, Brian and Joanne developed and launched Earthwise Jewelry.  Leber Jeweler Inc. was the first company in the United States to use  conflict-free Canadian diamonds, and the landmark collection also  utilizes fairly traded gemstones and recycled precious metals, all  sourced, mined, designed, and produced with concerns for both the  environment and fair-labor standards.   Brian and Joanne also have been notable advocates for laws related to  the responsible sourcing of precious stones and metals, including of  rubies and jadeite from Burma and gold and tungsten from the Democratic  Republic of Congo. In 2007, Brian testified before Congress in support  of the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, and in 2009, he advocated for  the suspension of Zimbabwe from the Kimberley Process for its human  rights abuses in the Marange diamond fields. Then, in 2010, Brian  supported efforts to pass bipartisan legislation that would create a  mechanism to enhance transparency in the sourcing of conflict minerals  and help American consumers and investors make informed decisions.   I have had the privilege of traveling to the Democratic Republic of  Congo twice, in 2005 and 2010. It is a nation of breathtaking natural  beauty, but like too many others, it has suffered from the paradox of  the resource curse. Despite being rich in natural resources that should  seemingly promote growth and development, the Democratic Republic of  Congo has faced decades of weak governance, poverty, and  incomprehensible violence. And fueling much of the violence, at least  in part, has been the contest for control of these resources and their  trading routes. Sadly, this violence had coined a dubious distinction  for eastern Congo, known as the Rape Capital of the World.   I have seen firsthand the efforts of people like Dr. Jo Lusi and Dr.  Denis Mukwege, who founded the HEAL Africa Hospital and the Panzi  Hospital, respectively, restoring health and dignity to the survivors  of sexual violence. When I chaired the first-ever hearing in the U.S.  Senate about the uses of rape as a weapon of war in 2008, Dr. Mukwege  stressed the importance of not just treating the consequences of sexual  violence in the Congo, but addressing the root causes.  [[Page S1474]]    Most people probably don't realize that the products we use and wear  every day, from automobiles to our cell phones and even our wedding  rings, may use one of these minerals and that there is a very real  possibility it was mined using forced labor from an area of great  violence. In 2009, I joined with then-Senators Brownback and Feingold-- a Republican and a Democrat--along with then-Congressman Jim McDermott,  to pass bipartisan legislation that would help stem the flow of  proceeds from illegally mined minerals to those perpetuating such  violence. For the first time, companies registered in the United States  were required to report in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,  SEC, disclosures any usage in their products of a small list of key  minerals from the Congo or neighboring countries. Companies also had to  include information showing steps taken, if any, to ensure the minerals  are legitimately mined and sourced and that, by responsibly sourcing  these minerals, they are not contributing to the region's violence. It  wasn't a ban, but a transparency measure aimed at giving consumers  choice and fostering a cleaner supply chain.   It took time for the SEC to thoughtfully craft the rule for this  simple and reasonable law, and disappointingly, as is increasingly too  often the case with the rulemaking process, some tried to gut the law  in court, but its core provisions have been repeatedly upheld.   A look since then at the filings submitted to the SEC indicates that  some companies had already been leaders on this for years--Apple Inc.,  Intel Corporation, Motorola, Inc., KEMET Corporation, just to name a  few. Leber Jeweler Inc. has been a trailblazer in its own right from  the start as well.   It has been 7 years since passage, and we are seeing this law make a  difference. According to the nongovernmental organization the Enough  Project, an expert on the issue, more than 70 percent of the world's  smelters and refiners for tin, tungsten, tantalum, or gold have now  passed third-party conflict-free audits. In addition, the International  Peace Information Service found that, as of 2016, more than three- quarters of tin, tantalum, and tungsten miners in eastern Congo are  working in mines where no armed group involvement has been reported.   There is new concern today that the President may sign an Executive  order suspending this simple reporting requirement; and yet many  companies have come out in support of its continuation, including Brain  and Joanne of Leber Jeweler Inc.   I am grateful to Brian and Joanne, for their support and advocacy on  this important cause. They and others like them in the industry have  been stalwart advocates for the responsible sourcing of minerals, and I  look forward to continuing to work with them on ways to stem the  horrific violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.                            ____________________
