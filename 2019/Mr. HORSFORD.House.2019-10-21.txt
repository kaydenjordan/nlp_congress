 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to anchor this Congressional  Black Caucus Special Order hour, and I thank our CBC chair,  Congresswoman Karen Bass, for her leadership in organizing this effort.   For the next 60 minutes, we want to pay a special tribute to  Congressman Elijah E. Cummings.   The Congressional Black Caucus, the entire country, and this  institution suffered a great loss. As a lifelong advocate for justice,  equality, and the truth, Congressman Cummings was the true definition  of a leader and public servant.   To many, Chairman Cummings was a friend and a mentor, but to the  members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Chairman Cummings was  family.   Last week, Congress lost a fierce leader, a tireless champion of the  people, and my friend, Chairman Elijah Cummings. It is a sad time for  Congress, for Maryland, and, in fact, for the entire country.                                time  1945    For the next 60 minutes we will hear from members of the  Congressional Black Caucus and other colleagues as we pay tribute to a  great man.   Mr. Speaker, I yield, first and foremost, to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass), chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for her timely remarks  and for her leadership and compassion for our entire Congressional  Black Caucus membership during this very difficult time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority whip for his  heartfelt remarks and for sharing his personal reflections on his  friendship and service with Chairman Cummings.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), a  civil rights icon and a man whom I am very honored to serve with in  this body each and every day.    Mr. Speaker, we as a body extend our sincerest  condolences to Chairman Cummings' wife, Dr. Maya Rockeymoore; their  children, grandchildren, friends, staff, and all those whom he  positively impacted in his life and work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  (Ms. Norton).                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for sharing her  remarks and reflections on his leadership.   He definitely had a presence as a dignified leader and chairman, and  he personified what it really means to oversee his committee with  civility and respect for each Member. I had the honor of serving on  that committee during my first tenure in Congress, and I learned a lot  and will continue to carry out that leadership.   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for again sharing  his very heartfelt remarks.   This body tonight, it is very humbling to be here with each of the  Members who have joined us, each one great in their own way.  [[Page H8287]]    As one of the new Members here in this body, it gives me great pride  to be a part of the Congressional Black Caucus and to know that each  and every Member has made such significant contributions, not just to  their districts, but to the entire country.   I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Rush for his  encouraging words, the Word that we know we needed, not just the day  that we heard of the passing of Chairman Cummings, but the Word that  continues to sustain us each and every day.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott),  chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, one of the big five, as  we call them here in the Congressional Black Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and chairman of the  Education and Labor Committee.   I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the  chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, another great chairman who  governs with a steady hand and another example of the wonderful  leadership that we have in this body.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for coming to the  floor and speaking on behalf of his experience and friendship with  Chairman Cummings.   As the gentleman said, he really demonstrated a life worth living and  an example, an embodiment, definitely for young people and young  leaders of what they should do to exemplify a good role model.   I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee),  who is another great leader. She is one of the co-chairs of the  Steering and Policy Committee for the House Democrats and a true  champion on so many issues, particularly for women, children, and  families.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her heartfelt  remarks.   Each one of us can tell our own story of our experiences and  opportunities that we had to share with Chairman Cummings, and that is  really the opportunity that we have tonight during this Special Order  hour.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), who  is another person with a great legacy, who continues to serve his  constituents with dignity.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressman for coming to the  floor to share his remarks.   Many experiences have been shared from the Oversight and Reform  Committee, from those who served on that committee, those who worked  with Chairman Cummings on his staff. He was known to have one of the  best staffs here in the House of Representatives, and it is partly  because they got to work with such a great chairman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Butterfield), who is the former chairman of the Congressional Black  Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Butterfield again for  sharing his stories of friendship and how Chairman Cummings really  touched his life as an example to so many here in this body.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke),  who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. It has been my  great honor to coanchor this Special Order hour with my esteemed  colleague, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett. And I want to, again, thank  our chairwoman, Karen Bass, for her effort in bringing forward this  opportunity for us to all share our reflections.   And I just want to say, on my behalf, that Chairman Cummings stood up  for, really, the most vulnerable in society, and supported policies to  ensure that the next generation of Americans have access to a clean  environment, affordable housing, quality healthcare and education, and  financial empowerment.   Congressman Cummings was a firm believer in the United States  Constitution, who fought for equality for all Americans. It is certain  that Chairman Cummings did everything in his power, and then some, to  defend our country and its institutions, to keep our democracy alive  and thriving, despite attacks from within. His legacy of leadership  will continue to inspire us all, and his presence in Congress will  surely be missed.   I hope now that he is resting in power and dancing with the angels,  happily, with the knowledge that he set an example of resistance and  perseverance, and that we will continue in his footsteps, we will carry  on his spirit, and we will carry on his legacy.   I now turn this over to the coanchor for this Special Order, my  colleague and good friend, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett from the U.S.  Virgin Islands, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
