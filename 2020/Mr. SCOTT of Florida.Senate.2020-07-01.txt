 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  honor a very important group of people in our Nation's history. The  65th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Army known as the Borinqueneers was  comprised of U.S. citizens from Puerto Rico.   The Borinqueneers courageously fought for decades to defend the  freedoms we enjoy today. They answered the Nation's call to serve, and  they are the longest standing and only Active-Duty Latino military unit  in U.S. history.   On April 13, 2016, Congress awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to  the 65th Infantry Regiment in recognition of the Borinqueneers'  numerous contributions to American history and outstanding military  service from World War I to the recent conflicts in Afghanistan and  Iraq.   Today, I am honored to join my colleagues in recognizing the bravery,  service, and sacrifice of the Puerto Rican soldiers of the 65th  Infantry Regiment and to express deep gratitude for the contributions  to the Armed Forces that have been made by hundreds of thousands of  patriotic U.S. citizens from Puerto Rico.   I am honored to designate April 13 as National Borinqueneers Day to  ensure their legacy lives on. History will forever pay tribute to the  sacrifices these individuals and their families made to defend our  freedom.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate in  Spanish.    It is my honor to recognize the service of  these brave American citizens from Puerto Rico who fought for our  Nation. Your legacy will live on. Thank you for your service.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of S. Res. 641, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be  [[Page S4103]]  agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
