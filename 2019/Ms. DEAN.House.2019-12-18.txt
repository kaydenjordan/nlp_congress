 Madam Speaker, words matter. We have heard many words over  the course of these last weeks. Still, what strikes me are the words  that are missing from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, a  gaping hole in this conversation, the words they cannot or will not  mouth, defending a President's conduct, conduct that threatens our  constitutional order.   So, Madam Speaker, I ask: When is it ever right for a President to  coerce a foreign power to interfere in our elections?   When is it ever right for a President to intimidate a foreign leader  into announcing false investigations into a political rival?   When is it ever right for that President to withhold congressionally  appropriated aid to that country at the expense of its national  security and our very own?   And when is it ever right for a President to block a coequal branch  of government from investigating this scheme to cheat an election?  [[Page H12149]]    The answer, of course, is never. But that word does not come  trippingly from the tongues of those who are making the choice to stand  behind a man whose behavior is not worthy of your tortured words.   By our vote today, we are speaking to future Presidents and to future  generations. We are declaring that we will not tolerate foreign  interference in our Presidential elections. Americans alone will  determine the outcome.   And we will not permit a President to order the complete defiance of  a coequal branch of government.   In the end, regardless of the outcome of this impeachment, the  President's tenure will end, and this body and our grandchildren will  be left with what we did here today.   Ours is a somber generational duty about love of country and lifting  our Constitution to its gravest protections but its highest  aspirations.   Our democracy is a matter of conscience and, by voting to safeguard  our Constitution, mine is clear.
