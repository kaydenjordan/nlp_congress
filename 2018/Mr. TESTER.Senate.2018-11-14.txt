 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the service  and career of veteran and dedicated advocate Garry Augustine.   As the executive director of the Disabled American Veterans, DAV,  since 2010 and a 46-year life member, Garry has helped shaped the  legislative landscape for disabled veterans and their families by  advocating before Congress, the White House, and the VA. Back home,  Garry has led DAV's efforts to make sure disabled veterans can access  the healthcare and benefits they need and earned.   A native of Cleveland, OH, Garry enlisted in the U.S. Army in August  1969. As a member of the 198th Infantry Brigade in South Vietnam, he  served on the Batangan Peninsula. During a combat patrol operation on  April 9, 1970, he was severely wounded by a land mine explosion.   After 18 months and multiple surgeries at Walter Reed Medical Army  Hospital, Garry returned home to Cleveland, where he continued physical  rehabilitation and underwent additional surgeries at the Cleveland VA  hospital. In December 1972, he was medically discharged from the U.S.  Army.   Following his service, Garry went on to earn a bachelor's degree with  honors from Ohio University in 1978. In 1983, he completed a master's  degree in sociology from Cleveland State University, the same year he  became a life member of DAV Chapter 42 in Mentor, OH.   In Mentor, he served in various positions, including chapter  commander and adjutant, and on statewide committees, as well as  director of service for the DAV Department of Ohio. In 1989, he was  selected as one of the Outstanding Young Men of America.   Along the way, Garry met and married Kellie Lambing and raised two  children, Chelsea and Kyle.   Garry began his tenure with DAV as a hospital service coordinator in  1988 at the Cleveland Wade Park VA Hospital. That same year, he joined  DAV's professional staff as a national service officer apprentice. He  remained at the Cleveland national service office where he was promoted  to assistant supervisor in 1997 and supervisor in 2000.   He served as supervisor at the Cleveland DAV National Service Office  until being appointed assistant national service director at DAV's  Washington Headquarters in 2002. In January 2004, he was appointed  deputy national service director and was named national service  director in 2010.   As executive director of DAV, Garry has helped lead an organization  that has always been at the forefront of advocating for veterans and  securing the resources, healthcare, and benefits veterans have earned.  Garry has been a fierce advocate for VA healthcare reform, expanding  caregiver benefits, securing critical resources for veterans  initiatives, modernizing the disability appeals system, and improving  VA services and resources for women veterans.   As ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, it has  been a joy to work with Garry and DAV on important pieces of  legislation like the Deborah Sampson Act, the Veterans Appeals  Improvement and Modernization Act, the VA Accountability and  Whistleblower Protection Act, the Rural Veterans Transportation  Enhancement Act, and the VA MISSION Act.   These bipartisan bills, several of which were signed into law, serve  as a testament to Garry's dedication and leadership on behalf of  veterans. While future generations of veterans will be able to look at  these bipartisan reforms as examples of Garry's dedication, they will  also feel the reach of Garry's mission to serve veterans in their  communities.   Under his leadership, DAV continues to be a cornerstone for  communities across our Nation. At the local level, DAV helps injured  and ill veterans get to and from their doctor appointments, transition  back to civilian life through its mobile service offices, and navigate  the VA healthcare and benefits systems.   It is my honor to recognize Garry's lifetime of service as a soldier,  veteran, and leader of DAV. As Garry begins a new adventure into  retirement, I have no doubt that he will continue to serve those in  need. To Garry, on behalf of myself and a grateful nation, I extend my  greatest appreciation to you for your enduring bravery, service,  sacrifice, and advocacy.                            ____________________
