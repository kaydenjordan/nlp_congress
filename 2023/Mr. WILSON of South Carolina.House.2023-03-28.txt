 Mr. Speaker, every day, American  families experience the failed policies of Biden and Democrats.   On the day Biden was sworn in, the average price of gas was $2.39.  Today, it is $3.44, 44 percent higher. The Biden war on energy resulted  in a high cost of over $5 last year.   During the same period, the first week of his Presidency, Biden  killed the Keystone pipeline, which would supply 800,000 barrels of oil  a day from Canada, with the mining equipment in Alberta using Michelin  tires made in South Carolina.   The idiotic war on fossil fuels subverts science and common sense,  and it causes dependence on China for batteries, panels, blades, by  Biden.   This week, House Republicans have all-of-the-above legislation to  reduce inflation, create jobs, and return America to energy  independence with the innovative bill by Congressman Jeff Duncan of  South Carolina.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues,  sadly, moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Our sympathies to the families of Nashville and Mississippi.                            ____________________
