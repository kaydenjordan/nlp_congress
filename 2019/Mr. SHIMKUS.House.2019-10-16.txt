 Mr. Speaker, it is great to come down here today and  talk on this issue. I have been a little bit outspoken since the  decision was made by the executive branch, so it is great to see the  legislative branch take a stand and talk about what this policy  decision has made. And I am good friends with Chairman McCaul and, of  course, Eliot Engel who is the chairman of the committee.   As someone who served for many years in the military, and I am very  involved with the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and our alliances-- alliances and values are important. Walking away from friends is the  sad indication of policy that we don't want to support, we don't want  to condone. Yes, we want America to be great, but we are also great  because of our friends and our allies.   Coalitions are not bad. Coalitions strengthen our public policy  around the world. And our relationship with the Kurds goes way back to  the first Gulf war and the protection of the northern Iraqi Kurdish  area protecting the air space.   Talk to people in uniform who have been protected by Kurdish fighters  throughout these 20 years of involvement in Syria. We give them our  word that we will be with them. I liken it to being in a foxhole with  someone from another country, and the attack is coming. You don't get  out of the foxhole and go to the rear and leave your ally in the  foxhole to defend themselves.   We see what is going on. I think this could have been predicted. It  is unfortunate. I don't know how we get the genie back in the bottle,  but I am glad we are getting a chance to make a statement from Article  I of the Constitution to the legislative branch that we think this  policy has been wrong and failed and we do it in a strong bipartisan  matter.   So I thank both of you for bringing this, and I look forward to  voting ``yes'' on it.
