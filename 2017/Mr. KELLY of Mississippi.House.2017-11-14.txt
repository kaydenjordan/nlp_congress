 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thornberry  for his continued leadership in rebuilding and reforming the Department  of Defense.   Today I rise in strong support of H.R. 2810, the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   As a 32-year veteran of the Mississippi Army National Guard and two  Iraq deployments, I know the national security challenges facing our  country firsthand.   This year's NDAA makes important strides toward achieving equipment  and benefits parity for our armed services' Reserve component. The  enemies of this country do not distinguish between the Active component  and Reserve component of our military, and neither should we.  [[Page H9207]]    I am happy to report that this year's NDAA increases the size of both  our Active component and our Reserve component. It also increases  benefits parity to our Reserve component soldiers by authorizing those  deployed on title X orders to receive preactivation and postactivation  TRICARE coverage when on 12304a and 12304b orders. Additionally, the  FY18 NDAA will allow for procurement of much-needed equipment for our  Reserve component.   Finally, I would like to thank my subcommittee chairmen--Mr. Coffman,  Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Turner--for their leadership and hard work through  this process.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation.
