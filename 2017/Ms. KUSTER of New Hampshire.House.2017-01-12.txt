 Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned about  the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and what it would mean for  Americans struggling with debilitating diseases.   Prior to the ACA, the struggle of a debilitating illness like  Alzheimer's or cancer could be compounded because of the financial  burden from lack of affordable health care. Imagine being denied  necessary health care because you or a loved one suffered from a  preexisting condition. These are the concerns that I am hearing from  constituents across the Granite State.   Take Sally from West Chesterfield. Her daughter has Crohn's disease,  and she is on their family plan because she is under age 26. She will  always need access to health care because of her condition, and if the  Affordable Care Act is repealed and not replaced, she could lose  coverage because of her preexisting condition. These concerns are all  too commonplace.   I agree the ACA is not perfect, and I am committed to working in a  bipartisan way to ensure the law will work  [[Page H403]]  for all Americans. But in the meantime, the ACA is helping 22 million  Americans, including 1 in every 10 Granite Staters. We should build on  those successes.   I urge my colleagues on the Republican side to resist the temptation  to repeal the law, especially without a plan that ensures affordable  coverage for all Americans.                            ____________________
