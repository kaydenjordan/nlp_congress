 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res.  104, which rightfully condemns this violation of the United States'  sovereignty by the Chinese Communist Party.   Last week, we saw the Chinese Communist Party breach U.S. airspace  with the intention of openly surveilling sensitive U.S. national  security facilities, including locations housing nuclear missiles. This  is unacceptable and demonstrates again that the CCP is willing to  challenge the United States and to flaunt its intelligence-gathering  operations in our country.   The Biden administration owes the American people an explanation as  to why earlier action was not taken against this threat. Why is any  foreign government allowed to act in this fashion without an immediate  response from the U.S.?   We must project strength, not weakness, if this Nation wants to be  taken seriously on the world stage.   I thank the men and women of our Armed Forces who carried out this  mission to remove this surveillance from our skies. I will continue  working with my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee to support  our partners in the Indo-Pacific to address this threat posed by the  CCP and to provide appropriate oversight over this administration.
