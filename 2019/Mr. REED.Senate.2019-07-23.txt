 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor just the day before  Robert Mueller is set to come before the House Intelligence and  Judiciary Committees to focus attention on some of the key findings of  the special counsel's report on Russia's interference in our 2016  elections.   I have spoken on the floor many times about the depth and breadth of  the Russian interference in the 2016 election. The special counsel's  report goes to great lengths to detail this, in his terms, ``sweeping  and systemic interference.'' What continues to be worrisome is that  these information warfare attacks and other malign influence operations  are ongoing with more plans for our elections next year.   This threat to our national security and the integrity of our  democracy has yet to be sufficiently recognized or counted by this  administration. Indeed, in the months since the report was released,  the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly  claimed that the report vindicates the President on all charges of  collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and on obstruction of  justice rather than taking steps to ensure that we will never be  targeted in this way again.   The special counsel's testimony is vital so he can detail what he  uncovered and shed additional light on the events of the investigation.  In particular, what Congress and the American people need to hear from  Director Mueller relates to three broad categories of questions. For  instance, what was the full scope of Russian interference in the 2016  election?   Second, what evidence did the special counsel find of coordination  between Trump campaign associates or the President and the Russian  Government, and why did he decide the available evidence was not  sufficient to prove a criminal conspiracy with Russia?   Third, what evidence did the special counsel find that the President  obstructed justice?   Tomorrow's testimony will help the public understand the gravity of  the President's conduct in the White House  [[Page S5004]]  and the extent to which Russia influenced the 2016 election. These  hearings are not the end. This is not case closed. The intelligence  community has assessed that the threat from Russia will continue to  evolve and grow even more sophisticated. For our elections to remain  free, open, and transparent, we must take seriously the threat posed by  Russia and other potential foreign adversaries. We must hold hearings  in the Senate with testimony from the special counsel's office and key  witnesses from the report. We must consider legislation on election  security, foreign influence operations, disinformation, Federal  election laws, money laundering, and many other issues.   When it comes to protecting our democracy, we cannot be complacent.  Now is the time for action to make sure we are ready ahead of the  elections in 2020 and beyond. Each and every one of us in this Chamber  swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United  States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. In order to do that,  we can't just take tweets about no collusion and no obstruction at face  value. This isn't a witch hunt, nor should it be an effort to circle  the partisan wagons around the President and absolve him of any  wrongdoing. It has to be a serious examination of what happened and how  to defend our Nation against future attacks.   Mr. President, in anticipation of the upcoming testimony of the  special counsel before the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees,  I want to highlight key findings in his report that go to the heart of  Russian interference into our elections in 2016 and the ongoing threat  still facing our national security and the integrity of our democracy.   Indeed many of the President's own national security officials have  warned of heightened Russian information warfare attacks and other  foreign influence operations in next year's election--which could make  its 2016 interference in our elections, catalogued in the Mueller  report, look like child's play. Federal Bureau of Investigation  Director Wray recently stated that the 2018 midterm elections were seen  by Russia as ``a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.'' Wray added  that the FBI anticipates the 2020 ``threat being even more  challenging.'' Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats warned  the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2019 that, in the 2020  election cycle, ``Moscow may employ additional influence toolkits--such  as spreading disinformation, conducting hack-and-leak operations, or  manipulating data--in a more targeted fashion to influence U.S. policy,  actions, and elections.''   Despite this ongoing and increasingly sophisticated threat, we are  still not fully prepared to defend against the inevitable Russian  attacks on our democracy. The Russian interference in the 2016 election  was akin to a military operation against our nation. To date, we do not  have a complete understanding of what happened in 2016. More  importantly, we do not have a comprehensive strategy, nor have we  reorganized our government or prepared the American people, so that  such foreign interference will not happen again. The release of the  Mueller report cannot mark the end of the strategy to investigate and  prevent Russian interference. The special counsel's testimony will add  to the urgency for this administration and Congress to change course  and act immediately to protect our democracy and strengthen public  faith in the American election process.   Since the release of the special counsel's report, the President, the  Attorney General, and some Republican congressional leaders have said  that the case of Russian interference in the 2016 election is closed,  that our work is done, and that we can move on. The President has  repeatedly claimed that the special counsel's report cleared him of any  connections to Russia and any wrongdoing in contradiction of the  voluminous evidence laid out in the report. But those declarations of  innocence just don't square with the facts. Congress has a  constitutional duty to review the findings of the special counsel on  behalf of the American people and not simply accept the  administration's spin and mischaracterizations of Robert Mueller's  findings.   Despite the President's declarations of ``hoax'' and ``witch hunt,''  the special counsel's office did bring indictments for ``conspiracy to  commit offense or to defraud the United States'' under 18 U.S. Code  Sec. 371, against Putin crony Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was in charge of  the Kremlin-linked troll operation known as the Internet Research  Agency, and against his related holdings and multiple employees. The  investigation also resulted in conspiracy indictments of 12 officers  from Russian Military Intelligence, also known as the GRU.   While the available evidence did not meet the legal standard to  charge the President or his associates with a crime for a coordinating  role in that conspiracy, the special counsel takes care to note that  does not mean that evidence of coordination does not exist. This is  not, as the President has attested, ``a complete and total  exoneration.'' As the special counsel plainly points out, in regards to  coordination with Russia, while ``this report embodies factual and  legal determinations that the office believes to be accurate and  complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps,  the office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable  information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the  events described in this report.''    What is more, President Trump and his supporters purposefully leave  out important context from the report where the special counsel  explains that he lacked the authority to indict a sitting President  because of an Office of Legal Counsel, OLC, opinion finding that ``the  indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would  impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform  its constitutionally assigned functions'' in violation of ``the  constitutional separation of powers.''   Another critical consideration for the special counsel was that a  Federal criminal investigation of a sitting President could preempt the  authority vested in Congress by the Constitution to address  Presidential misconduct. In addition, Mueller notes that ``a President  does not have immunity after he leaves office'' and that ``we conducted  a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when  memories were fresh and documentary materials were available.'' Put  together, while the special counsel concluded that he could not  prosecute the President, he makes it clear that he is creating a record  of evidence and deferring to Congress and future prosecutors should  they pursue an obstruction case.   Which is all the more reason why we must hear from the special  counsel on his findings and his decision-making process. In particular,  what Congress and the American people need to hear from Special Counsel  Mueller relates to three broad categories of questions.   First, what was the nature and extent of the Russian interference  campaign launched against the United States in the 2016 election?  Second, what evidence did the investigation find of Trump campaign  associates or the President coordinating with the Russian campaign, and  why did Mueller decide the available evidence was not sufficient to  prove ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that they had criminally conspired  with the Russian efforts? And the third set of issues relate to acts of  obstruction by Trump campaign associates and the President himself.   On the first set of issues, one of the main responsibilities charged  to the special counsel by the Department of Justice was to conduct a  ``full and thorough investigation of the Russian government's efforts  to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.'' As the report  concludes, ``the Special Counsel's investigation established that  Russia interfered in the 2016 election principally through two  operations.''   First, Mueller provides detailed evidence that Kremlin-linked  operators sought to help the Kremlin's preferred candidate, whose  election would serve Russia's interests. The report describes how a  Kremlin-linked troll operation, called the Internet Research Agency,  ``carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential  candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary  Clinton.'' It also found that ``[a]s early as 2014, the [Kremlin-linked  Internet Research Agency] instructed its employees to  [[Page S5005]]  target U.S. persons who could be used to advance its operational  goals.''   Second, Mueller describes in detail the Russian spying operation to  steal ``dirt'' on the opposition candidate and then use that stolen  information against her. The report states unequivocally, ``[a] Russian  military intelligence's spying operation conducted computer intrusion  operations against entities, employees and volunteers working on the  Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents.''   The Mueller report makes clear that the Russian election interference  was a coordinated campaign targeting our democracy along multiple lines  of effort. While these conclusions affirm the assessments of our  intelligence community, the President appears unwilling or unable to  take them seriously.   At the G20 Summit in Osaka in June 2019, President Trump treated  Russian election interference as a joke, signaling to Putin that he  would not hold Russia accountable. And in a recent interview, the  President failed to grasp what was wrong with taking ``dirt'' on his  political opponent from a foreign source and indicated that, if it  happened again in the 2020 campaign, he would listen to what they had  to say and then decide whether or not to report it to the FBI.   Now let me turn to the second set of issues Special Counsel Mueller  needs to address, relating to his task by the Department of Justice to  investigate ``any links and/or coordination between the Russian  government and individuals associated with the campaign of President  Donald Trump.''   The special counsel's report presents significant evidence that  President Trump and his associates embraced, encouraged, and applauded  Russian help. The report definitively concludes that Russia saw its  interests as aligned with, and served by, a Trump Presidency; that a  central purpose of the Russian interference operations was helping the  Trump campaign; and that the Trump campaign anticipated benefiting from  the fruits of that foreign election interference. Mueller provides  detailed evidence of multiple contacts by Russian government officials  or their proxies with the Trump campaign to facilitate relationships.  The report states: ``[t]he investigation . . . established numerous  links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.''   Ultimately, however, the special counsel's investigation lacked  sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Trump  campaign or its associates conspired with the Russian Government in its  election interference. As the report states: ``[a]lthough the  investigation established that the Russian government perceived it  would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that  outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally  from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the  investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign  conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election  interference activities.''   As referenced earlier, a key question that Special Counsel Mueller  needs to address during his testimony is why was the investigative team  unable to establish to a criminal standard of proof that is ``beyond a  reasonable doubt'' coordination between people associated with the  Trump campaign, and Russian actors conspiring to undermine the U.S.  elections.   This raises questions related to the third set of issues for Special  Counsel Mueller, namely whether the President obstructed justice in  connection with the Russia-related investigation and hindered the  ability of the special counsel's office to gather relevant evidence.  And if so, did that obstruction materially impede Mueller's ability to  conclude ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that the Trump campaign or the  President himself conspired with Russian interference? These questions  raise profound issues for our national security and the integrity of  our democracy, and the special counsel's answers will determine what  Congress's next steps should be in meeting its constitutional  responsibilities.   Indeed, the Mueller report establishes multiple incidents in which  the President committed acts that were capable of impeding the Trump- Russia investigation. For example, President Trump asked then-FBI  Director James Comey to stop looking into his former National Security  Advisor General Michael Flynn, after finding out that Flynn was  questioned about his contacts with the Russian Ambassador. President  Trump also repeatedly asked Comey to publicly say that Trump himself  was not under investigation and then fired Comey when it became clear  he was unwilling to do so.    In addition, the President tried several different tactics to have  the special counsel's investigation curtailed. President Trump  initially put forward claims that the special counsel had conflicts of  interest, which his advisers informed him were meritless. When that did  not work, the President gave his subordinates--including White House  Counsel Don McGahn, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and  former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski--direct orders to either have  the special counsel removed or to pressure then-Attorney General  Sessions into limiting the scope of the special counsel's investigation  to future election interference, instead of scrutinizing the President  and his campaign's conduct. McGahn, Lewandowski, and Priebus all failed  to follow the President's orders. The special counsel importantly notes  that attempts ``to influence the investigation were mostly  unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded  the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.''   Furthermore, the special counsel's report found that the President  and his aides materially impaired the investigation. For instance, the  President did not give an in-person interview to the special counsel  and would only answer written questions that did not address issues  relating to Presidential obstruction. In his written responses, the  President replied that he could not recall or did not remember more  than 30 times, covering the vast majority of the questions. In  addition, numerous Trump campaign associates and others from his inner  circle, including General Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, and Roger  Stone, and his attorney Michael Cohen, lied about their dealings with  Kremlin or Kremlin-linked actors. Michael Cohen, for example, admitted  to the special counsel that among the reasons he lied to Congress about  the Trump Tower Moscow project was to try and limit the ongoing Russia  investigation. In each of these cases, the Mueller report found ``those  lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election  interference.''   Similarly, the special counsel found that Trump campaign associates  frustrated the investigation by deleting information or otherwise  impeding the ability of the special counsel to obtain relevant  communications pertinent to the investigation. One example was Trump  campaign associates' communications with Konstantin Kilimnik, a  Ukrainian national whom the FBI assesses as having ties to Russian  intelligence and who worked for Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's  political consulting business for many years. During 2016, Manafort  directed his campaign deputy Rick Gates to provide internal polling  data to Kilimnik. Manafort expected Kilimnik to share that information  with others in Ukraine and Putin crony Oleg Deripaska, who had funded  pro-Kremlin political influence operations in the past. The Mueller  report details that Gates used an encrypted app to send the polling  data and then deleted it daily. As a result of deleted and encrypted  communications and because of Manafort's false statements, the special  counsel was not able to determine what happened with this data and  whether it was part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the  Trump campaign to interfere in our election. The report makes clear  that the lying, obfuscations, and denial of access to key information  had a direct effect on the investigation's ability to determine the  nature and extent of any coordination by President Trump and his  associates with Russian conspirators.   What makes the Mueller's testimony even more urgent are the Trump  administration's efforts to attack the credibility of the report and to  prevent Congress from further investigating Mueller's findings. The  White House has adopted a strategy of trying to block key witnesses  named in the Mueller report from testifying before  [[Page S5006]]  Congress, including Don McGahn, Annie Donaldson who served as chief of  staff to White Counsel McGahn, and White House and Trump campaign  communications director Hope Hicks, by invoking legally dubious or  overly broad claims of privilege. The White House has also stymied  Congress by asserting Executive privilege over the full, unredacted  version of the report and the underlying documents and only providing  access to a few select Members.   It is not only the White House that has been trying to muddy the  waters around the Mueller report. Attorney General William Barr has  deliberately mischaracterized and increased partisan skepticism of the  report. Before releasing the report to the public, Barr published a  misleading summary of its findings, which the special counsel disputed.  Barr also held a press conference where he claimed that the White House  fully cooperated with the special counsel's investigation, that the  special counsel found ``no collusion,'' and that there was not  sufficient evidence to establish obstruction of justice. These  statements are favorable to the President, but none of them are  consistent with the special counsel's findings.   As I have laid out, despite the ongoing and increasingly  sophisticated threat we face and despite the 2020 election being less  than a year and a half away, we are still not prepared to defend  against the inevitable Russian attack on our democracy. As Mueller said  during his press conference on May 29, 2019, ``I will close by  reiterating the central allegation of our indictments--that there were  multiple, systematic efforts to interference in our election. That  allegation deserves the attention of every American.''   I could not agree more. We cannot forget that Russia interfered in  our election in 2016 with hybrid warfare tactics and tried to do it  again in 2018. And our intelligence community assessed that it is  poised to conduct additional operations against our elections in 2020  with increasing sophistication. We cannot ignore these attacks or wish  them away.   The impediments erected by the President and the people around him  meant that despite the best efforts of the Mueller team, there remains  unfinished business in getting to the bottom of what happened in 2016  and afterward, which is why it is critically important we hear from the  special counsel.   While it is an important step that the special counsel is testifying  to the House in front of two committees, I am making this statement  about the questions that should be asked of Mueller because, as of this  moment, there are no scheduled hearings or plan for him to appear in  the Senate. We should be holding hearings in the Senate with testimony  from the special counsel and others on many issues, including the ones  I have raised. We should be passing legislation, including on election  security, to ensure that we are appropriately reorganized across  government and society ahead of the elections in 2020 and beyond.  Indeed, the administration needs to take election security seriously.  That means being proactive. It also means finding ways to reassure the  American people about the legitimacy and validity of our elections. For  example, we could require the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the  concurrence of the Director of National Intelligence and the FBI  Director, to rapidly assess and inform the public about whether any  foreign interference or influence is detected against our election  process, procedures, and infrastructure.   As Former Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul wrote in the Washington  Post after the special counsel's report was released: ``the Mueller  report is a good start, but it is only a start.'' There is too much at  stake for our national security and the integrity of democracy to stop  now.                         Nomination of Mark T. Esper    Mr. President, I had the opportunity and the privilege, as we all did  earlier today, to vote for Secretary Mark Esper as the next Secretary  of Defense.   I have known Dr. Esper for more than a decade. He is a public servant  and a patriot of the first order. I think the overwhelming vote today  indicates the confidence we have in him, and it indicates the  importance we understand that job holds for all of us. We have  entrusted it to someone who began his dedicated service to the country  as an 18-year-old at West Point, served in the Army, then went on to  serve in administrations and as a public-spirited citizen through his  entire life.   Mr. President, I rise to state my support for the nomination of Dr.  Mark Esper, who was confirmed earlier today to be the 27th Secretary of  Defense.   Dr. Esper has served this Nation in a variety of roles most of his  life. He is a 1986 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy. He served in  the 101st Airborne Division and participated in the 1990-91 Gulf War  with the ``Screaming Eagles.'' He retired from the U.S. Army in 2007,  after spending 10 years on Active Duty and 11 years in the National  Guard and Army Reserve.   After the Army, Dr. Esper worked in the private sector, but he also  worked in several offices on Capitol Hill, including the offices of  Senator and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Senate Majority Leader  Bill Frist. He also was a professional staff member on the Senate  Foreign Relations and Senate Government Affairs committees and the  House Armed Services Committee. Until his nomination to be Secretary of  Defense, Dr. Esper was serving as the 23rd Secretary of the Army. His  wealth of experience in defense policy and in senior leadership  positions in both the public and private sector should serve him well  as Secretary of Defense.   It has been nearly 7 months since the Department has had a Senate- confirmed Secretary of Defense. At no other time in history has the  office of the Secretary remained vacant for so long. In addition, we  must bear in mind the national security challenges facing our country.  Currently, the Department is focused on competition with near-peer  adversaries like China and Russia. As the Department pursues the new  strategic direction established by the National Defense Strategy, Iran  and North Korea remain dangerous, and the threat posed by violent  extremist organizations is not diminishing. Furthermore, the Department  must continue to recruit and retain high-caliber individuals, while  restoring readiness, and pursuing new high-end capabilities for the  force.   Despite these daunting challenges, the number of senior-level  civilian vacancies throughout the Department is staggering. The  constant turnover of senior civilian leadership, coupled with the  duration of these vacancies, has been troubling. I believe it has had a  significant impact on the Defense Department, which is adrift in a way  I have not seen in my time on Capitol Hill. It is my hope that Dr.  Esper will work to fill these civilian leadership positions because it  is necessary to manage the difficult challenges facing the Department,  as well as the extensive Pentagon bureaucracy.   In addition, Dr. Esper will help oversee national security policy for  a President whose temperament and management skills are challenging. It  is extremely important for our Nation that he be surrounded by leaders  who can provide thoughtful advice and counsel. Diversity of opinion is  important when crafting policy and making decisions that impact the  well-being of our men and women in uniform. It is my fervent hope that  Dr. Esper will be willing and able to provide the President with his  best policy advice even if the President disagrees with the counsel or  it runs contrary to his policy goals.   But most importantly, while the Secretary of Defense serves at the  pleasure of the President, we should never forget that they also  oversee the finest fighting force in the world, men and women who have  volunteered to serve a cause greater than themselves. Our  servicemembers and their families should always be at the forefront  when considering defense policy or military action.   On a final note, I would also like to thank Dr. Esper's family, his  wife Leah and their children, Luke, John, and Kate. They, too, will be  serving our country, and we appreciate their support.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
