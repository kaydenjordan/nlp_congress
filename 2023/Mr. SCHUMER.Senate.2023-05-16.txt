 Madam President, before I get into my remarks, just a  little housekeeping. I understand there is a bill at the desk due for a  second reading.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill by title for  the second time.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (H.R. 2) to secure the borders of the United States,       and for other purposes.     In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the bill will  be placed on the calendar.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of H.J. Res. 42 and the Senate proceed to  its consideration, as provided for under the previous order.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, yesterday afternoon, Treasury Secretary  Yellen released a letter updating congressional leadership about their  latest forecast regarding default. The Treasury's projection remains  unchanged: The Federal Government is in danger of failing to pay its  bills as soon as June 1.   Since last week's White House meeting, Democratic staff have in good  faith held conversations with our Republican counterparts about the  Nation's fiscal future.   The talks are separate but simultaneous to our responsibility to  avoid default. Democrats will not use the threat of default to get what  we want. Nobody should use default as a hostage. Nobody should say:  ``Unless you do this, then we default'' because the consequences of  default will be devastating for ordinary Americans.   We talked through the weekend; we talked yesterday; and both sides-- the staffs, that is--are talking today as well. And later this  afternoon, I will join President Biden, House Leader Jeffries, Speaker  McCarthy, and Leader McConnell at the White House.   Democrats welcome a debate about this year's budget. For decades,  both parties have regularly worked out their differences about spending  and revenues throughout the appropriations process. That is what is  happening right now while we separately but simultaneously work to  avoid default.  [[Page S1656]]    And, again, let me just repeat this because it is so important as we  get closer to June 1. Nobody--nobody--should use default as a hostage.  Nobody should say: ``Unless you do this, then we default'' because the  consequences will be devastating for America.   Default would almost certainly create another recession, kill more  than 8 million jobs, send costs soaring on everything from mortgages,  car payments, student loans, small business loans, and so much more. If  you want to own a home one day, default would take that dream and run  it through the shredder. If you want to protect your 401(k), default  would rob you of your livelihood. If you want to grow your small  business or borrow student loans or if you benefit from Social Security  or Medicare, a default would be a nightmare scenario.   We all know these things are fast approaching the closer we get to  June 1. Congress cannot--under any circumstances--fail its obligation  to protect the full faith and credit of the United States. It is one of  our highest obligations.                                 Nominations    Madam President, now on nominations and Senate business, last night  we filed cloture on three more outstanding judicial nominees: two  district court judges and a circuit court judge. Even as Senate  Democrats proceed on our agenda to help working and middle-class  families avoid default, we will not relent on filling the vacancies on  our Federal judiciary with qualified, mainstream, and diverse judges.   Yesterday, we took a big step forward toward strengthening the bench  with the historic confirmation of Bradley Garcia, the first Latino ever  to serve on the DC Circuit, the second most important court in the  land. And the three judges we filed cloture on last night continue that  effort. They are highly qualified and diverse candidates, both  demographically and professionally. They will strengthen our Federal  judiciary and help the bench better reflect the diversity and dynamism  of our country.   Senate Democrats are going to keep working this week to advance these  nominees, and I hope both sides can work together to move the process  along quickly and in a bipartisan way.   Today, the Senate is also busy off the floor. As we speak, the Senate  Banking Committee is holding a very important hearing, hearing  testimony from the former CEO and chairman of Silicon Valley Bank and  Signature Bank, to examine the failures that led to their collapses. I  want to thank Chairman Brown and all the Members of the committee for  holding this important hearing because we need to get to the bottom of  what went wrong with SVB and Signature Bank.   The American people must have confidence that Congress can work  across the aisle to hold bad actors in banking accountable, and that is  why it is essential we hear directly from the CEOs of these failed  institutions.   I hope today's hearing brings us one step closer to bipartisan action  on commonsense banking oversight legislation that Americans rightfully  demand.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, another criminal trial arising out of the  events of January 6, 2021, is scheduled to begin on May 22, 2023, in  Federal district court in the District of Columbia. The defendant in  this case is charged with multiple counts, including unlawfully  entering and remaining in a restricted area within the U.S. Capitol  grounds.   The prosecution and defense are seeking trial testimony from Michael  J. Mastrian, director of the Senate Radio and Television Gallery, which  operates under the authority of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of  the Senate, relating to the Gallery's regulation of access to the  Capitol by bona fide members of the electronic news media.   Senate Sergeant at Arms Gibson would like to cooperate by providing  relevant testimony in this proceeding from Mr. Mastrian.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, this  resolution would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Mr. Mastrian, with representation by the Senate legal counsel.
