 The ``nuclear option'' would gut the very essence and core  of what the Senate is about as an institution--flying directly in the  face of our Founders who deliberately rejected a parliamentary system.  A current debate, over a particular set of issues, should not be  permitted to destroy what history has bestowed on us.   And the stakes are much, much higher than the contemporary  controversy over the judiciary. Robert Caro, the noted author on Senate  history, wrote the following in a letter to the Chairman and Ranking  Member of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration:         [I]n considering any modification [to the right of extended       debate in the Senate Senators should realize they are dealing       not with the particular dispute of the moment, but with the       fundamental character of the Senate of the United States, and       with the deeper issue of the balance between majority and       minority rights . . ., you need only look at what happened       when the Senate gradually surrendered more and more of its       power over international affairs to learn the lesson that       once you surrender power, you never get it back.    The fight over the nuclear option is not just about the procedure for  confirming judges. It is also, fundamentally, about the integrity of  the Senate. Put simply, the ``nuclear option'' changes the rules  midstream. Once the Senate starts changing the rules outside of its own  rules, which is what the nuclear option does, there is nothing to stop  a temporary majority from doing so whenever a particular rule would  pose an obstacle.   It is a little akin to us agreeing to work together on a field. I  don't have to sit down and agree with you that we are going to divide  up this field, but I say, OK, I will share my rights in this field with  you. But here is the deal we agree to at the start. Any change in the  agreements we make about how to run this field have to be by a super- majority. OK? Because that way I am giving up rights--which all the  Founders did in this body, this Constitution--rights of my people, for  a whole government. But if you are going to change those rules with a  pure majority vote, then I would have never gotten into the deal in the  first place.   I suffer from teaching constitutional law for the last 13 years, an  advanced class on constitutional law at Widener University, a seminar  on Saturday morning, and I teach this clause. I point out the essence  of our limited constitutional government, which is so different than  every other, is that it is based on the consent of the governed. The  governed would never have given consent in 1789 if they knew the outfit  they were giving the consent to would be able, by a simple majority, to  alter their say in their governance.   The Senate is a continuing body, meaning the rules of the Senate  continue from one session to the next. Specifically, rule V provides:         The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to       the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in       these rules.    I say to my colleague from North Carolina, on the floor, I say to my  colleague from South Carolina, I say to my colleague from Utah: If you  vote for this ``nuclear option'' you are about to break faith with the  American people and the sacred commitment that was made on how to  change the rules.   Senate rule XXII allows only a rule change with two-thirds votes. The  ``continuing body'' system is unlike many other legislative bodies and  is part of what makes the Senate different and allows it to avoid being  captured by the temporary passions of the moment. It makes it different  from the House of Representatives, which comes up with new rules each  and every Congress from scratch.   The ``nuclear option'' doesn't propose to change the judicial  filibuster rule by securing a two-thirds vote, as required under the  existing rules. It would change the rule with only a bare majority. In  fact, as pointed out recently by a group of legal scholars:         On at least 3 separate occasions, the Senate has expressly       rejected the argument that a simple majority has the       authority claimed by the proponents of the [nuclear option].    One historical incident is particularly enlightening. In 1925, the  Senate overwhelmingly refused to agree to then-Vice President Dawes'  suggestion that the Senate adopt a proposal for amending its rules  identical to the nuclear option.   On this occasion, an informal poll was taken of the Senate. It  indicated over 80 percent of the Senators were opposed to such a  radical step.   Let me be very clear. Never before have Senate rules been changed  except by following the procedures laid out in the Senate rules. Never  once in the history of the Senate.   The Congressional Research Service directly points out that there is  no previous precedent for changing the Senate rules in this way.   The ``nuclear option'' uses an ultra-vires mechanism that has never  before been used in the Senate--``Employment of the [nuclear option]  would require the chair to overturn previous precedent.   The Senate Parliamentarian, the nonpartisan expert on the Senate's  procedural rules--who is hired by the majority--has reportedly said  that Republicans will have to overrule him to employ the ``nuclear  option''.   Adopting the ``nuclear option'' would send a terrible message about  the malleability of Senate rules. No longer would they be the framework  that each party works within.   I've been in the Senate for a long time, and there are plenty of  times I would have loved to change this rule or that rule to pass a  bill or to confirm a nominee I felt strongly about.   But I didn't, and it was understood that the option of doing so just  wasn't on the table.   You fought political battles; you fought hard; but you fought them  within the strictures and requirements of the Senate rules. Despite the  short-term pain, that understanding has served both parties well, and  provided long-term gain.   Adopting the ``nuclear option'' would change this fundamental  understanding and unbroken practice of what the Senate is all about.  Senators would start thinking about changing other rules when they  became ``inconvienent.'' Instead of two-thirds of the vote to change a  rule, you'd now have precedent that it only takes a bare majority.  Altering Senate rules to help in one political fight or another could  become standard operating procedure, which, in my view, would be  disastrous.    The Congressional Research Service has stated that adopting the  ``nuclear option'' would set a precedent that could apply to virtually  all Senate business. It would ultimately threaten both parties, not  just one. The Service report states:         The presence of such a precedent might, in principle,       enable a voting majority of the Senate to alter any procedure       at-will by raising a point of order . . . by such means, a       voting majority might subsequently impose limitations on the       consideration of any item of business, prohibiting debate or       amendment to any desired degree. Such a majority might even       alter applicable procedures from one item of business to the       next, from one form of proceeding to a contrary one,       depending on immediate objects.    Just as the struggle over the ``nuclear option'' is about  constitutional law and Senate history, it is also about something much  more simple and fundamental--playing by the rules.   I reiterate that I think Senator Frist and his allies think they are  acting on the basis of principle and commitment, but I regret to say  they are also threatening to unilaterally change the rules in the  middle of the game. Imagine a baseball team with a five-run lead after  eight innings unilaterally declaring that the ninth inning will consist  of one out per team.   Would the fans--for either side--stand for that? If there is one  thing this country stands for it's fair play--not tilting the playing  field in favor of one side or the other, not changing the  [[Page S1787]]  rules unilaterally. We play by the rules, and we win or lose by the  rules.   That quintessentially American trait is abandoned in the ``nuclear  option.'' Republican Senators as well as Democratic ones have benefited  from minority protections. Much more importantly, American citizens  have benefited from the Senate's check on the excesses of the majority.   But this is not just about games, and playing them the right way.  This is about a more ethereal concept--justice. In his groundbreaking  philosophical treatise, A Theory of Justice, the philosopher John Rawls  points to the importance of what he calls procedural justice.   Relying on this predecessors such as Immanuel Kant, Thomas Hobbes,  Jean Jacques Rousseau, and John Locke, Rawls argues that, in activities  as diverse as cutting a birthday cake and conducting a criminal trial,  it is the procedure that makes the outcome just. An outcome is just if  it has been arrived at through a fair procedure.   This principle undergirds our legal system, including criminal and  civil trials. Moreover it is at the very core of our Constitution. The  term ``due process of law'' appears not once but twice in our  Constitution, because our predecessors recognized the vital importance  of setting proper procedures--proper rules--and abiding by them.   It is also the bedrock principle we Senators rely on in accepting  outcomes with which we may disagree. We know the debate was conducted  fairly--the game was played by the rules. A decision to change the  Senate's rules in violation of those very same rules abandons the  procedural justice that legitimates everything we do.   It is interesting to ask ourselves what's different about now, why  are we at this precipice where the ``nuclear option'' is actually being  seriously debated and very well might be utilized? Why have we reached  this point when such a seemingly radical rule change is being seriously  considered by a majority of Senators? It's a good question, and I don't  have an easy answer.   We have avoided such fights in the past largely because cooler heads  have prevailed and accommodation was the watchword.   As Senator Sam Ervin used to say--the separation of powers should  not, as President Woodrow Wilson warned, become an invitation for  warfare between the two branches.   Throughout this country's history--whether during times of war or  political division, for example--Presidents have sometimes extended an  olive branch across the aisle. Past Presidents have in these  circumstances made bipartisan appointments, selecting nominees who were  consensus candidates and often members of the other party.   President Clinton had two Supreme Court nominees, and the left was  pushing us as hard as the right is pushing you. What did he do? I spent  several hours with him consulting on it. He picked two people on his  watch who got 90 or so votes. Moderate, mainstream appointments. He did  not appoint Scalias. He did not appoint Thomases. He appointed people  acceptable to the Republicans because he was wise enough to know, even  though he was President, we were still a divided Nation.   History provides ample examples. During the midst of the Civil War,  President Lincoln selected members of the opposition Democratic party  for key positions, naming Stephen Field to the Supreme Court in 1863  and Andrew Johnson as his Vice Presidential candidate in 1864.   On the brink of American entrance into WWII, President Roosevelt  likewise selected members of the opposition Republican party, elevating  Harlan Fiske Stone to be Chief Justice and naming Henry Stimson as  Secretary of War.   Other 20th Century Presidents followed suit. In 1945, President  Truman named Republican Senator Harold Burton to the Supreme Court. In  1956, President Eisenhower named Democrat William Brennan to the  Supreme Court. What has happened to us? What have we become?   Does anyone not understand this Nation is divided red and blue and  what it needs is a purple heart and not a red heart or a blue heart.   Lest any of my colleagues think these examples are merely culled from  the dusty pages of history, let me remind them that the Senate has  witnessed recent examples of consensus appointments during times of  close political division. As I already mentioned, President Clinton  followed this historic practice during vacancies to the Supreme Court a  decade ago.   As explained by my friend, the Senior Senator from Utah, who was then  the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, President Clinton  consulted with him and the Republican Caucus during the High Court  vacancies in 1993 and 1994. The result was President Clinton's  selection of two outstanding and consensus nominees--Ruth Bader  Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer--both of whom were confirmed overwhelmingly  by the Senate, by votes of 97-3 and 87-9, respectively.   Indeed, the last two vacancies to the Supreme Court are text book  examples of the executive branch working in cooperative and collegial  fashion with its Senate counterpart to secure consensus appointments,  thus averting an ideological showdown. The two constitutional partners  given roles in the nomination process engaged in a consultative process  that respected the rights and obligations of both branches as an  institutional matter, while also producing outstanding nominees who  were highly respected by both parties.   To be sure, a careful review of our Nation's history does not always  provide the examples of consultation, comity, or consensus in the  nomination process. Presidents of both parties have at times attempted  to appoint nominees--or remove them once confirmed--over the objections  of the Senate, including in some instances where the Senate was  composed of a majority of the President's own party. And sometimes the  Senate has had to stand strong and toe the line against imperialist  Presidential leanings.   Our first President, George Washington, saw one of his nominees to  the Supreme Court rejected by this Senate in 1795. The Senate voted 14  to 10 to reject the nomination of John Rutledge of South Carolina to be  Chief Justice. What is historically instructive, I believe, is that  while the Senate was dominated by the Federalists, President  Washington's party, 13 of the 14 Senators who rejected the Rutledge  nomination were Federalists.   The Senate also stood firm in the 1805 impeachment of Supreme Court  Justice Samuel Chase. President Jefferson's party had majorities in  both the House and the Senate, and Jefferson set his sights on the  Supreme Court. Specifically, he wanted to remove Justice Chase, a  committed Federalist and frequent Jefferson critic, from the Court.    Jefferson was able to convince the House to impeach Justice Chase on  a party-line vote, and the President had enough members of his party in  the Senate to convict him. But members of the President's own party  stood up to their President; the Senate as an institution stood up  against executive overreaching. Justice Chase was not convicted, and  the independence of the judiciary was preserved.   The Senate again stood firm in the 1937 court-packing plan by  President Franklin Roosevelt.   This particular example of Senate resolve is instructive for today's  debates, so let me describe it in some detail. It was the summer of  1937 and President Roosevelt had just come off a landslide victory over  Alf Landon, and he had a Congress made up of solid New Dealers. But the  ``nine old men'' of the Supreme Court were thwarting his economic  agenda, overturning law after law overwhelmingly passed by the Congress  and from statehouses across the country.   In this environment, President Roosevelt unveiled his court-packing  plan--he wanted to increase the number of Justices on the court to 15,  allowing himself to nominate these additional judges. In an act of  great courage, Roosevelt's own party stood up against this  institutional power grab. They did not agree with the judicial activism  of the Supreme Court, but they believed that Roosevelt was wrong to  seek to defy established traditions as a way of stopping that activism.   In May 1937, the Senate Judiciary Committee--a committee controlled  by the Democrats and supportive of his political ends--issued a  stinging rebuke. They put out a report condemning Roosevelt's plan,  arguing it was an effort ``to punish the justices''  [[Page S1788]]  and that executive branch attempts to dominate the judiciary lead  inevitably to autocratic dominance, ``the very thing against which the  American Colonies revolted, and to prevent which the Constitution was  in every particular framed.''   Our predecessors in the Senate showed courage that day and stood up  to their President as a coequal institution. And they did so not to  thwart the agenda of the President, which in fact many agreed with;  they did it to preserve our system's checks and balances; they did it  to ensure the integrity of the system. When the Founders created a  ``different kind of legislative body'' in the Senate, they envisioned a  bulwark against unilateral power--it worked back then and I hope that  it works now.   The noted historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., has argued that in a  parliamentary system President Roosevelt's effort to pack the court  would have succeeded. Schlesinger writes: ``The court bill couldn't  have failed if we had had a parliamentary system in 1937.'' A  parliamentary legislature would have gone ahead with their President,  that's what they do, but the Founders envisioned a different kind of  legislature, an independent institution that would think for itself. In  the end, Roosevelt's plan failed because Democrats in Congress thought  court-packing was dangerous, even if they would have supported the  newly-constituted court's rulings. The institution acted as an  institution.   In summary, then, what do the Senate's action of 1795, 1805, and 1937  share in common? I believe they are examples of this body acting at its  finest, demonstrating its constitutional role as an independent check  on the President, even popularly elected Presidents of the same  political party.   One final note from our Senate history. Even when the Senate's rules  have been changed in the past to limit extended debate, it has been  done with great care, remarkable hesitancy, and by virtual consensus.  Take what occurred during the Senate's two most important previous  changes to the filibuster rule: the 1917 creation of cloture and the  1975 lowering of the cloture threshold.   First, let's examine 1917. On the eve of the United States' entry  into WWI, with American personnel and vessels in great danger on the  high seas, President Wilson asked that Congress authorize the arming of  American merchant vessels. Over three-fourths of the Senate agreed with  this proposal on the merits, but a tiny minority opposed it. With  American lives and property at grave risk, the Senate still took over 2  months to come to the point of determining to change its rules to  permit cloture.   When they did so, they did it by virtual consensus, and in a  supremely bipartisan manner. A conference committee composed equally of  Democrats and Republicans, each named to the committee by their party  leadership, drafted and proposed the new rule. It was then adopted by  an overwhelming vote of 76-3.   In 1975, I was part of a bipartisan effort to lower the threshold for  cloture from two-thirds to three-fifths. Many of us were reacting  against the filibustering for so many years of vital civil rights  legislation. Civil rights is an issue I feel passionately about and was  a strong impetus for me seeking public office in the first place. Don't  get me wrong--I was not calling the shots back in 1975; I was a junior  Senator having been in the chamber for only 2 years.   But I will make no bones about it--for about two weeks in 1975--I was  part of a slim bipartisan majority that supported jettisoning  established Senate rules and ending debate on a rules change by a  simple majority.   The rule change on the table in 1975 was not to eliminate the  filibuster in its entirety, which is what the current ``nuclear  option'' would do for judicial nominations; rather it was to change  from the then-existing two-thirds cloture requirement to three-fifths.  It was a change in degree, not a fundamental restructuring of the  Senate to completely do away with minority rights.   The rule change was also attempted at the beginning of the Senate  session and applied across the board, as opposed to the change  currently on the table, brought up mid-session concerning only a very  small subset of the Senate's business. Nonetheless, my decision to  support cutting off debate on a rules change by a simple majority vote  was misguided.   I carefully listened to the debate in 1975 and learned much from my  senior colleagues. In particular, I remember Senator Mansfield being a  principled voice against the effort to break the rules to amend the  rules.   Senator Mansfield stood on this floor and said the following:         [T]he fact that I can and do support [changing the cloture       threshold from \2/3\ to \3/5\] does not mean that I condone       or support the route taken or the methods being used to reach       the objective of Senate rule 22. The present motion to invoke       cloture by a simple majority, if it succeeds would alter the       concept of the Senate so drastically that I cannot under any       circumstances find any justification for it. The proponents       of this motion would disregard the rules which have governed       the Senate over the years, over the decades, simply by       stating that the rules do not exist. They insist that their       position is right and any means used are, therefore, proper.       I cannot agree.    Senator Mansfield's eloquent defense of the Senate's institutional  character and respect for its rules rings as true today as it did 30  years ago. Senator Mansfield's courage and conviction in that  emotionally charged time is further evidence, I believe, of why he is  one of the giants of the Senate.   In the end, cooler heads prevailed and the Senate came together in a  way only the Senate can. I changed my mind; I along with my Senate  colleagues. We reversed ourselves and changed the cloture rule but only  by following the rules. Ultimately, over \3/4\ of the voting Senators-- a bipartisan group--voted to end debate. In fact, the deal that was  struck called for reducing the required cloture threshold from \2/3\ to  \3/5\; but it retained the higher \2/3\ threshold for any future rules  changes.   Now I understand that passions today are running high on both sides  of the ``nuclear option'' issue, and I can relate to my current  Republican colleagues. I agree with my distinguished Judiciary  Committee Chairman that neither side has clean hands in the escalating  judicial wars.   I also understand the frustration of my Republican colleagues-- especially those who are relatively new to this Chamber--that a  minority of Senators can have such power in this body.   For me, the lesson from my 1975 experience, which I believe strongly  applies to the dispute today, is that the Senate ought not act rashly  by changing its rules to satisfy a strong-willed majority acting in the  heat of the moment.   Today, as in 1975, the solution to what some have called a potential  constitutional crisis lies in the deliberate and thoughtful effort by a  bipartisan majority of Senators to heed the wisdom of those who  established the carefully crafted system of checks and balances  protecting the rights of the minority. It's one thing to change Senate  rules at the margins and in degrees, it's quite another to overturn  them.   Federalist No. 1 emphasizes that Americans have a unique  opportunity-- to choose a form of government by ``reflection and  choice'':         It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been       reserved to the people of this country . . . to decide the       important question, whether societies of men are really       capable or not of establishing good government from       reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined       to depend for their political constitutions on accident and       force.    We need to understand that this is a question posed at the time of  the founding and also a question posed to us today. At the time of the  founding, it was a question about whether America would be able to  choose well in determining our form of government.   We know from the experience of the last 225 years that the founding  generation chose well. As a question posed to citizens and to Senators  of today, it is a question about whether we will be able to preserve  the form of government they chose.   The Framers created the Senate as a unique legislative body designed  to protect against the excesses of any temporary majority, including  with respect to judicial nominations; and they left all of us the  responsibility of guaranteeing an independent Federal judiciary, one  price of which is that it sometimes reaches results Senators do not  like.   It is up to us to preserve these precious guarantees. Our history,  our  [[Page S1789]]  American sense of fair play, and our Constitution demand it.   I would ask my colleagues who are considering supporting the  ``nuclear option''--those who propose to ``jump off the precipice''-- whether they believe that history will judge them favorably.   In so many instances throughout this esteemed body's past, our  forefathers came together and stepped back from the cliff. In each  case, the actions of those statesmen preserved and strengthened the  Senate, to the betterment of the health of our constitutional republic  and to all of our advantage.   Our careers in the Senate will one day end--as we are only the  Senate's temporary officeholders--but the Senate itself will go on.   Will historians studying the actions taken in the spring of 2005 look  upon the current Members of this Senate as statesmen who placed the  institution of the United States Senate above party and politics?   Or will historians see us as politicians bending to the will of the  Executive and to political exigency?   I, for one, am comfortable with the role I will play in this upcoming  historic moment.   I hope all my colleagues feel the same.   Thank you.                            ____________________
