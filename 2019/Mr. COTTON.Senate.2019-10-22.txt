 Madam President, Army CPL Jerry Garrison was reported  missing in action on December 2, 1950. After all these years, Corporal  Garrison is on his way home to be laid to rest with full honor due to a  member of the U.S. Armed Forces.   Corporal Garrison was one of ``The Chosin Few'' who fought on that  frozen ground to protect his fellow soldiers and the independence of  the Korean people against the Communist hordes. God, in His mysterious  providence, chose to call Corporal Garrison home during that epic  battle, but only recently were his remains discovered in Vietnam.   Corporal Garrison's funeral today is a long-overdue moment of honor  for a brave soldier and a long-anticipated moment of mourning and  remembrance for his loved ones.   Let's also remember in our prayers the many families whose loved ones  haven't yet come home. Corporal Garrison's recovery is a moment of hope  for these families, a reminder that our Nation will not rest until  every one of our missing heroes is brought home, and it is a reminder  to our troops who are in harm's way today that we will always bring  them home should they fall in the line of duty or go missing in action.  We have now fulfilled that solemn pledge to Corporal Garrison. Nearly  70 years after he went missing, we have once again affirmed that the  United States leaves no man behind.   Rest in peace, Corporal Garrison.              Anniversary of the Beirut Marine Barracks Bombing    Madam President, 36 years ago this week, an Iranian suicide bomber  detonated thousands of pounds of explosives inside a Marine compound in  Beirut, Lebanon. So terrible was the blast that 15 miles out at sea,  the marines aboard the USS Iwo Jima could see black smoke building over  Beirut like an ominous storm cloud. The devastating attack claimed the  lives of 241 Americans who were bravely keeping the peace in a country  that was wracked by violence. A separate blast claimed the lives of 58  of our French allies.   This anniversary is a sobering reminder that freedom comes at a  price--a price too often paid by brave Americans in uniform. In Beirut,  it was paid by 220 marines, 18 sailors, and 3 soldiers.   As a memorial to their valor, I ask unanimous consent to have their  names printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Names of the Fallen in the Beirut Marine Barracks Bombing         Cpl Terry W Abbott, USMC; Cpl Clemon S Alexander, USMC;       LCpl John R Allman, USMC; Cpl Moses J Arnold Jr, USMC; LCpl       Charles K Bailey, USMC; LCpl Nicholas Baker, USMC; LCpl       Johansen Banks, USMC; Cpl Richard E Barrett, USMC; HM1 Ronny       K Bates, USN; 1stSgt David L Battle, USMC; Cpl James R       Baynard, USMC; HN Jesse W Beamon, USN; GySgt Alvin Belmer,       USMC; LCpl Stephen Bland, USMC; Sgt Richard L Blankenship,       USMC; LCpl John W Blocker, USMC; Capt Joseph J Boccia Jr,       USMC; Sgt Leon Bohannon Jr, USMC; SSgt John R Bohnet Jr,       USMC; Sgt John J Bonk Jr, USMC.
