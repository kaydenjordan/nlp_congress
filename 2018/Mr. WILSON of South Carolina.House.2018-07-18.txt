 Mr. Speaker, the latest results are in  from the Republican tax cuts, with Trump deregulation, producing jobs:  $2,059 average tax cut for a typical family of four; $2,000 new per  child tax credit, double the old amount.   Sixteen regulations rolled back through the Congressional Review Act  process, the most in history. Ninety percent of Americans are receiving  bigger paychecks under the new withholding tables.   A 3.4 percent increase in real disposable income in the first quarter  of 2018; a record high level of U.S. exports of goods and services,  over $200 billion; 3.7 million jobs created since November 2016; 1.3  million jobs created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law; 6.6  million job openings as of May 2018, meaning more jobs than job  seekers. Sixty-five percent of Americans now say it is a good time to  find a quality job.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
