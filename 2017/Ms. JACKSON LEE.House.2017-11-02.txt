 Mr. Speaker, good morning, America. What about those  Houston Astros?   As Representative of the 18th Congressional District in the great  city of Houston, let me thank the Houston Astros for taking a Harvey- worn community to the highest lengths. We had never won the World  Series.   Minute Maid is a fine stadium and the L.A. Dodgers were a very fine  competitor. Let me thank all of them for the great sportsmanship, the  character that was shown.   It shows what America is about. You can be two great adversaries on  the battlefield of baseball, but you can still be great friends and  colleagues and part of the great American pastime.   Thank you to the mayor, the county government, the State government,  all of those fans out there. Thank you to George Springer and Altuve,  who caught the final out. Oh, I was so excited.   Congratulations to those southern boys, the boys of the south, the  boys of the southwest. They did a great job. Yes, we are the World  Series champion, the American League champion. Go, Houston Astros.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your kindness. I am so excited. They are  great young men.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me make a proclamation here on  the floor of the House, and that is that all the sweat and tears of the  Democratic Members, although we offered the opportunity to our  Republican friends to do something about healthcare, all of our sweat  and tears proved to be a successful response to the 25 million  uninsured Americans.   No matter how much our friends on the other side of the aisle try to  nitpick and pick away at a successful affordable care program, they  simply cannot do it.   To the American people: It worked. It worked because we included and  supported healthcare for children with CHIP. It worked because we  supported and expanded community health centers. It worked because we  had IPAB, which is not going to be in effect until 2021 and not to do  anything but preserve Medicare.   On the other hand, today we have a pronounced tax bill that will  jeopardize the Medicare trust fund, will take millions and billions  away from Medicaid. The last hammer in the coffin will be the  destruction of the Children's Health Insurance Program and community  health clinics.   Let me be very clear: I happen to be in an area in the southern part  of Texas, from Corpus to Port Aransas, to Rockport, to Beaumont, to  Houston and Harris County, where Hurricane Harvey devastated our  community.   Healthcare is crucial. Many of our hospitals were under water. People  were not able to access healthcare. The community health clinics are  the best neighborhood source of healthcare.    Madam Speaker, the legislation by my friends is to  destroy Peter to prop up Paul, rather than take the Pallone amendment-- which I want to thank Ms. Slaughter for offering in the Rules  Committee--to provide real funding and that would find a way to  effectively support the Children's Health Insurance Program and, of  course, the community health clinics, which, in the State of Texas, has  been a lifesaver for all of our communities.   We were the poster child for having the largest number--a quarter of  our people in Texas--who did not have health insurance. With the  Affordable Care Act and, of course, the community health clinics, we  were able to do it.   Let me finish by saying it was a bipartisan effort in 1997, with a  balanced budget, that we created the Children's Health Insurance  Program. It has been an effective, strong armor, if you will, around  children's health.   Everywhere I go, such as the Texas Children's Hospital, they are  raving about the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid.  Today or tomorrow, we are going to break that system by taking money  from somewhere else to destroy another healthcare program and putting  in this program.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 849, the  so-called ``Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2017,'' which  repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), that was  established under the ACA in response to high rates of growth in  Medicare expenditures and charged with developing proposals to ``reduce  the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending.''   I opposed this bill when it came to the floor as H.R. 1190 in the  114th Congress and I oppose it now because by repealing IPAB, the bill  would eliminate an important safeguard that will help reduce the rate  of Medicare cost growth responsibly while protecting Medicare  beneficiaries.  [[Page H8420]]    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 849 is nothing but another attempt, in a long line  of House Republican efforts to undermine both the Medicare guarantee  and the Affordable Care Act.   Repealing IPAB would cost over $17.5 billion during the course of a  ten year period according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).   Mr. Speaker, Republicans do not even make an attempt to find an  offset for this $17.5 billion increase to the deficit resulting from  repeal of the IPAB, while at the same time they plan to bring to the  floor a partisan bill to reauthorize CHIP, Community Health Centers,  and other public health extenders by cutting Medicare and slashing  funding for programs relied upon by Medicaid recipients, low and middle  income families with Affordable Care Act health coverage.   After more than seven years under the Affordable Care Act, more than  20 million Americans have gained health coverage; up to 129 million  people who could have otherwise been denied or who faced discrimination  now have access to coverage.   Mr. Speaker, given the real challenges facing our nation, it is  irresponsible for the Republican majority to continue bringing to the  floor unpaid for bills that would do serious harm to millions of  Americans if they were to be enacted.   House Republicans have tried more than 65 times to undermine the  Affordable Care Act, which has enabled more than 20 million previously  uninsured Americans to know the peace of mind that comes from having  access to affordable, accessible, high quality health care.   Their batting average to date is .000; they have struck out every  time because the American people appreciate and strongly support the  Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to look at the facts and abandon  this misguided effort to undermine the ACA and impose significant  negative impacts on Americans currently insured.   The Independent Payment Advisory Board is to recommend to Congress  policies that reduce the rate of Medicare growth and help Medicare  provide better care at lower costs.   IPAB membership by law is to be made up of 15 members appointed by  the President and confirmed by the Senate and been comprised of the  non-partisan CBO, economists, and health policy experts as contributing  to Medicare's long-term sustainability.   Mr. Speaker, the IPAB is already prohibited from recommending changes  to Medicare that ration health care, restrict benefits, modify  eligibility, increase cost sharing, or raise premiums or revenues.   Under current law, the Congress retains the authority to modify,  reject, or enhance IPAB recommendations to strengthen Medicare, and  IPAB recommendations would take effect only if the Congress does not  act to slow Medicare cost growth.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, let me point out to our friends across the  aisle that according to the CMS actuary, IPAB will not be triggered  until 2021, so the timing of today's repeal is premature and  politically motivated.   IPAB was enacted as a backstop to the other cost saving and quality  improvement efforts in ACA, such as accountable care organizations,  patient-centered care models like medical homes, programs that pay for  quality not quantity, and value based purchasing.   Because of the ACA and these programs, Medicare spending growth has  slowed and Medicare's solvency has been extended.   Increasing the deficit by $17.5 billion as a result of repealing the  IPAB would is fiscally irresponsible, especially now that Republicans  have introduced a tax package that will saddle our country with $1.5  trillion of debt in order to give tax cuts to the wealthy and  corporations.   Mr. Speaker, despite the Supreme Court's upholding of the law's  constitutionality, the reelection of President Obama, and Speaker  Ryan's admission that ``Obamacare is the law of the land,'' Republicans  refuse to stop wasting time and taxpayer money in their effort to take  away the patient protections and benefits of the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon House Republican leaders to stop wasting our  time trying to take away healthcare protections that Americans depend  on and to start addressing pressing national priorities.   And they should start with working with Democrats on a bipartisan and  responsible plan to reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program  (``SCHIP'') which insures more than 9 million kids and fully funding  the relief efforts needed to help American communities recover from the  devastating effects of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against H.R. 849.
