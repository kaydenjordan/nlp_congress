 Madam Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues to use  Black History Month to celebrate the contributions of people who came  to this hemisphere not of their own free will--in chains, in bondage,  and then helped to make this country great.   It is important that we not only recognize them and their  contributions but their example of resilience:   Philip Reid, who as an enslaved man was responsible for casting the  statue which sits atop this building, and as a free man supervised the  installation of the Statue of Freedom; Maggie Walker, who became the  first woman to preside over a savings institution, which during the  Great Depression consolidated to become the Consolidated Bank and  Trust, which still exists today; Ralph Bunche, an American diplomat  fundamental to the creation and adoption of the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights who later went on to be the first African American to  win the Nobel Peace Prize for his negotiation efforts between Egypt and  Israel; and William Leidesdorff of Saint Croix, master of shipping of  vessels, rancher, gold miner, and one of the founders of San Francisco.   These Americans are quietly embedded in our Nation's history, but  today, this month, we celebrate them, their work, and their dedication.                            ____________________
