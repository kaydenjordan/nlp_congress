 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the ranking  member, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).   I rise today in support of the Childhood Cancer STAR Act.   Thanks to research funded by the National Institutes of Health, the  private sector, and philanthropic funds, we have made progress in the  study and treatment of childhood cancers. However, every year, 16,000  children and their families receive that terrible, nightmarish news  that their child has been diagnosed with cancer.   My constituent Allison Easter-Lara was diagnosed with stage IV  neuroblastoma when she was about 2 years old. Throughout her fight, she  endured some of the harshest cancer treatments there are, with  chemotherapy and stem cell transplants.   Allison's dad, Keith, visited my office earlier this year, and he  shared a remarkable update. Allison is beating the odds. She is  currently in remission and in a phase two drug trial.   We must pass the STAR Act because we need more good outcomes like  Allison's. This bill will expand childhood cancer research  opportunities at the NIH, improve our understanding of cancer as a  disease, and work to enhance the quality of life for all survivors.   It may be a moonshot, but I believe we can find new treatments and  eventually a cure for childhood cancer.
