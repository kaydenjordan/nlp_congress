 Madam Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Neal for yielding  me the time.   In my congressional district, I represent more than 9,600 family  farms and 90,000 labor households. I have toured my district many times  and was fortunate enough to bring the Speaker of the House into the  State of Illinois over the summer to meet with our family farmers.   Trade is one of the top issues people back home bring up to me, and  the message that they deliver is loud and clear: We need a strong trade  deal with broad-based support to help both America's farmers and our  labor communities.   I have worked to help bring parties to the table and reach a deal  that works for everyone. I am proud to say that the United States- Mexico-Canada trade agreement is that deal.   The USMCA outlines protections for labor that will make America  better prepared to expand opportunities for our workforce. It builds on  trade relationships critical to our agriculture markets, and it  represents the strongest trade enforcement mechanisms our country has  ever seen.   I am proud to cast my vote to support this step forward and to help  build the foundation for future trade agreements.
