 Thank you, Mr. President.   Before I get to the substance of my remarks, I remind my dear friend  the majority leader that the vast majority of the benefits of this tax  break, this tax cut, went to the wealthiest of Americans and large  corporations. What are they doing with the money? They are using most  of it for buybacks. That was a buyback. They buy back their own stock.  The CEO--already a rich guy--is making more money. The shareholders,  one-third of whom are out of the country and most of whom are in the  top 10 percent of America, make more money. The middle class and rural  America particularly are left behind in this bill.   We could have done a tax bill where the benefits went to the middle  class--not just some--10, 20 percent--but all. So this bill is a bit of  a fake. There are small benefits for the middle class, along with harm  to their healthcare. The things put in this bill are going to raise  many people's premiums far more than their small tax break.   Let's be honest about this. This bill was done for the rich and the  wealthy in power, and there were some benefits to the middle class, but  it could have been so much better. Our Republican colleagues listened  to the wealthy special interests, the large contributors, and that is  how this bill came about.   By the way, because it creates a deficit of $1.5 trillion--and I  remind our leader that rural America really cares about deficits--there  are a lot of Republicans, particularly the more conservative ones, who  say: Now let's cut Medicare and Social Security. How is an elderly  person in rural America going to feel about that?   I would simply say that this bill was not the right remedy for  America, which is owed a lot better.                            ____________________     Now, Speaker Ryan. I know Speaker Ryan quite well. He is  a good man. He is always true to his word. Even though we disagree on  most issues, in the areas where we can work together, I find him to be  smart, thoughtful, and straightforward. I find him to have a great deal  of integrity. We don't agree, but he has deep beliefs, and he is not  like some on his side of the aisle who say: It is my way or no way. He  is willing to meet you to try to get something done.   So I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Speaker Ryan. I admire him  as a human being, as a religious man, and somebody who cares a lot  about his family. I understand his frustrations; I do. When you have so  many intransigent people in your caucus who say ``it is my way or no  way,'' and your job, even though you have deep beliefs, is to want to  get something done, it is hard. It is hard.   Now, with his newfound political freedom, I hope the Speaker uses his  remaining time in Congress to break free from these hard-right factions  that have plagued him so and that have kept Congress from getting real  things done. If he is willing to reach across the aisle, he will find  Democrats willing and eager to work with him.   I say to Speaker Ryan: Let's work together. You are more of a free  man now. Follow your instincts. Your beliefs will not be the same as  ours, but you will want to try to come to some kind of an agreement  where we can meet somewhere in the middle.   The job may be made harder because Congressmen Scalise and McCarthy  are now competing for Ryan's job and the hard right's favor--they are  too vital in that caucus--but I believe Speaker Ryan is up to the job  and can overcome that problem and work in his last few months here for  the betterment of our country.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on the issues of yesterday and last  [[Page S2049]]  night, for months, I have heard my Republican colleagues argue that  there is no need to pass legislation to protect Special Counsel Mueller  and the Russian probe from President Trump because they have been  assured by anonymous White House officials that it will not happen.   President Trump, in his own words on Monday night, made it plain as  day that he may be considering firing the special counsel and/or the  Deputy Attorney General, which would be equally egregious. The White  House spokeswoman, from the podium, said President Trump believes he  has the authority to fire the special counsel all by himself, and a  report in the New York Times said President Trump considered firing  Mueller as recently as December, in addition to a year ago in June.   Only an hour ago, the President tweeted that the ``Fake & Corrupt  Russia Investigation''--his words--was ``headed up by all the Democrat  loyalists, or people that worked for Obama.''   Mr. President, will you start telling the truth? Robert Mueller is a  Republican. Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein is a Republican whom you  appointed. Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI, is a Republican whom  you appointed.   I don't know how long the President can believe people will swallow  the bold mistruths he spews out day after day after day, but what he  said--that the people the investigation was being headed up by are all  Democratic loyalists or people who work for Obama--is patently false,  and the President should retract it.   These kinds of remarks make it all too obvious that the President,  who cares so little for truth, may be considering the firing of the  special counsel or the Deputy Attorney General. So I would like to  direct my remarks to my Republican colleagues. I say to my Republican  colleagues, you can no longer rely on anonymous sources as a reason for  delay or inaction on legislation to protect Mr. Mueller and avoid a  constitutional crisis. The evidence is staring us all in the face. We  cannot ignore the elephant in the room any longer because the  consequences of the President taking action against Mueller or  Rosenstein or issuing political pardons is just too dire. As Democrats  have said, and as many Republicans have said, such action would  precipitate a constitutional crisis in this country. The President  doesn't seem to realize it, but I know my Republican colleagues do.   No person is above the law in this country--not even the President.  He is not a King. He is the President. If the President were to  interfere in any way with the chain of command in the Russia  investigation or clean house at the Justice Department in order to  install lackeys who will carry out his orders, we would be no better  than a banana republic. The kinds of things we see happening in other  parts of the globe would be happening here. In those places, leaders  use the levers of power to subvert or avoid accountability in all ways.  President Trump seems to wish he could do just that.   I want to be crystal clear on this point. If the President were to  take action against Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, it would be  every bit as grave of a mistake as removing Special Counsel Mueller.  America, as we know it--as we love it--would diminish. I know  Republicans and Democrats agree on that.   So why not take the bull by the horns? Why wouldn't we take immediate  action to potentially prevent a constitutional crisis from coming to  pass? Why don't we head it off at the pass and move bipartisan  legislation that has been introduced this morning, through the  Judiciary Committee--which I am told Senator Grassley is seriously  considering--on to the floor of the Senate, where I hope Leader  McConnell will place it. A bipartisan group this morning--Senators  Graham and Tillis, Booker and Coons--have introduced legislation that  would help protect the special counsel. Why not pass this legislation  now and avoid a constitutional crisis? Why not avoid an injury to the  body of this great country and then try to stitch it up? Why not avoid  an injury instead of sustaining it and trying to stitch it up? That is  what we should be doing.   Let's not wait until it is too late. Let's head the constitutional  crisis off at the pass by passing the bipartisan legislation introduced  by Senators Graham, Tillis, Booker, and Coons and take the threat of a  crisis off the table right now.   So I urge Senator Grassley to schedule a hearing and markup on this  bill and to report it out of his committee. He must be sure not to  water it down with amendments or accept changes that would render it  useless. I urge Leader McConnell to then take that bill and put it on  the floor where we can debate and pass it. Surely, something this  serious deserves the time and attention of U.S. Senators. I dare say,  if bipartisan legislation like this came to the floor, it would pass by  a large majority--Members of both parties--and the pressure on the  House to do the same would be large.   The rule of law cannot be a partisan issue and should not be a  partisan issue. We cannot let it become a partisan issue. The Congress  must clearly, loudly, and with one voice pass legislation to ensure  that any effort by the President to remove Special Counsel Mueller or  Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein would be rendered unsuccessful.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
