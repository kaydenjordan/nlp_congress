Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, we have heard time and time again that the Democrats say  this is not a violation of due process; not a violation of our  constitutional rights. It most certainly is.   Remember the basics here. Someone doesn't like you. They file a  complaint. There is a hearing within 24 hours, a hearing that you are  not allowed to attend, you are not allowed to be there to face your  accusers. The government takes your gun or guns. Several days later  there is a real hearing--well, a real hearing with a lower standard.  The burden of proof for the government is not beyond a reasonable doubt  to deny you your constitutional right. It is a clear and convincing  standard. So a lower standard to take away your fundamental liberty  when you didn't commit any crime. If that is not a violation of due  process, I do not know what is.                                time  1015    Title I of this bill, it will all be administered by the Biden  administration Department of Justice, the same Department of Justice  that got a letter from a leftwing political organization and, 5 days  later, sent a memorandum to every single U.S. attorney in this country  saying this: Set up a dedicated line of threat communication on  parents; use counterterrorism measures against moms and dads who had  the nerve to show up at a school board meeting and speak up for their  kid.   Then, 16 days after that memorandum went out, the FBI sends an email  out and says: Put a threat tag, a designation, a label, on moms and  dads who did show up at school board meetings who someone filed a  complaint about on that snitch line, and investigate them. That same  Biden administration Justice Department will be administering this law.   That is why we are so against this measure and why it is so darn  dangerous. They can say all day long it doesn't violate due process; it  most certainly does, and it is going to be administered by a Justice  Department that has already proven they are willing to go after parents  who speak up for their kids.   That is why this bill is so terrible, why Republican Senators are  pushing this and, as Mr. Gaetz from Florida said, trying to bribe  States to implement this when we have the history of the Biden Justice  Department and know what this thing is going to look like and how it is  going to violate due process. That is what is wrong with this  legislation and why Republicans are so darn against this thing.   I hope they will come to their senses, stand up for the law-abiding  American citizens and their fundamental liberties, and vote this thing  down.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).

Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Issa).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
