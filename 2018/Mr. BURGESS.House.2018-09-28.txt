 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6 is by far the most comprehensive legislation to  address this national crisis. While more work remains--and I am the  first to admit it--it provides meaningful solutions and vital resources  for our States and localities.   Many of the priorities developed by the Energy and Commerce Committee  are included in H.R. 6, like the 21st Century Tools for Pain and  Addiction Treatment Act, partially repealing the institutions for  mental disease exclusion and strengthening interagency coordination at  our international mail facilities so that, perhaps, once and for all,  we can do something about this poison coming into our country from  eastern Asia to the detriment of our citizens.   I believe H.R. 6 could have been stronger. It could have included  language aligning 42 CFR Part 2 with HIPAA. That stand-alone bill  received 357 votes in this House. And I promise you, you will see it  again. I am concerned about expanding prescriptive authority for  nonphysicians, and I hope we will be able to look at that again in the  future.   But I cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I urge our  Members to support this product today.
