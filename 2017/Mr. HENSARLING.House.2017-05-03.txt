 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, a very destructive  storm system moved across my home State of Texas, the Midwest, and the  Southeast, killing 15 of our fellow citizens and destroying whole  communities in its wake.   In Van Zandt County in the Fifth Congressional District of Texas,  which I have the privilege to represent, four constituents lost their  lives in a series of four violent tornadoes that shattered homes,  shattered lives, and devastated neighbors in the Fifth District and the  Fourth District of Texas.   These storms also tragically killed seven people in Washington,  Carroll, and Madison Counties in Arkansas; two people in Rankin and  Holmes Counties in Mississippi; one person in Nashville, Tennessee; and  one person from Billings, Missouri. Many more, Mr. Speaker, have been  hospitalized.   Joining me here today are some of the Members whose communities were  affected: Congressman Womack and Congressman Crawford of Arkansas,  Congressman Harper of Mississippi, Congressman Thompson of Mississippi,  Congressman Cooper of Tennessee, Congressman Long of Missouri, and my  fellow Texan, Congressman John Ratcliffe--again, Mr. Speaker, all who  represent communities that were tragically affected.   Mr. Speaker, our citizens who were lost have left a void in their  families and left a void in their communities. Our hearts are heavy.  Our prayers are sincere for the loved ones they leave behind and for  those who recover from their wounds.   For many of us, in our faith, there is a time to mourn. Mr. Speaker,  now is the time to mourn. But as we have, in our faith, a time to  mourn, we also have faith, Mr. Speaker, that one day our citizens will  heal and they will heal and rebuild their communities as well.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would ask the House to help us in  honoring those who lost their lives in these deadly storms and the  families and loved ones they leave behind by joining us in observing a  moment of silence.
