 Madam Speaker, tomorrow, at noon, the city of Columbia,  South Carolina, Historic Columbia, and the University of South Carolina  will unveil a monument that will mark the 60th anniversary of the  landmark case Edwards v. South Carolina.   That case resulted from the protest march of almost 200 college and  high school students from across South Carolina who came to Columbia to  protest segregation, discrimination, and what amounted to apartheid.   Madam Speaker, 192 or 193 of us were arrested on that day, and 189  were convicted. Two years later, the Supreme Court of the United States  overturned those convictions in this historic and landmark case against  South Carolina, which rendered an end to any State passing laws to  subject protest marchers to anything but what they were.   Madam Speaker, tomorrow, I will submit a full statement, thanking  those for doing so.                            ____________________
