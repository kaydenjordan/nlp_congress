 Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the Committee on  Natural Resources, I want to thank the gentleman for his support, his  assistance, and his friendship in helping to bring H.R. 801 to the  floor here today.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 801 is the Route 66 National Historic Trail  Designation Act, and we are happy to have it here today on this floor.  I also want to thank my friend and Democratic colleague, Congresswoman  Grace Napolitano of California, for introducing this legislation along  with me. Through our combined efforts, we have successfully built  strong bipartisan support for this particular bill.   I am proud to represent Illinois' 18th Congressional District in  Congress, especially given its rich American history. H.R. 801 focuses  on a small piece of that, Route 66, also commonly known or referred to  as the Main Street of America or the Mother Road.   As many know, Route 66 spans eight States and runs from Illinois to  California. Also of note, Route 66 will celebrate its 100th anniversary  in 2026. In my district, Route 66 passes through places like Lexington,  Illinois; Towanda; Bloomington-Normal; Atlanta; Lincoln; Elkhart;  Springfield; and stretches into the northern part of our State near  Chicago.   Route 66's impact on small, rural communities in Illinois and across  the country cannot be understated. For example, both Atlanta, Illinois,  and Springfield, Illinois, have benefited from the recent renewed  emphasis on Route 66. In Atlanta, we have seen an increase in tourism  to the area. As a result, we have had an increase in sales tax revenue.  In Springfield, which is our State capital, we have seen revitalization  in several parts of town.   These are just two examples, but I can say with confidence that the  highway's significance has become a key driver of attracting both  domestic and international tourism as well as local economic activity  for the areas and States that many of us in Congress represent.   On any given day, you will find people flying into Chicago, into  O'Hare Airport, and renting motorcycles or cars or getting on buses and  driving along this iconic roadway through America.   It should also be known that the Federal Government already  recognizes the importance of Route 66. The highway currently benefits  from the National Park Service's Route 66 Corridor Preservation  Program, but this program is scheduled to sunset in 2019.   My legislation, H.R. 801, is simple and straightforward and improves  upon current efforts. If signed into law, it will designate Route 66 as  a national historic trail, ensuring that the National Park Service will  have the authority to assist and support States and local communities  in preserving, promoting, and economically developing Route 66 for  generations to come.   Importantly, in 1995, a Route 66 special resource study was conducted  by the National Park Service, as authorized by Congress. The study  determined that Route 66 meets the criteria in the National Trails  System Act for designation as a national historic trail.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record 10 letters of support from Route  66 associations and organizations across the country which back the  legislation.                                                   October 11, 2016.      Re Route 66: The Road Ahead Partnership         To Whom It May Concern: I am pleased to write this letter       of endorsement on behalf of the Route 66 Alliance in support       of Route 66 being designated as a National Historic Trail.        The Route 66 Alliance, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is       committed to the preservation and marketing of the entire       2,448 miles of historic Route 66. Its key role in the       development of the United States is beyond question. And       efforts in Tulsa have begun in earnest to highlight this       iconic road, and the important role that Tulsa played in its       development.        Recently, the Mayor of Tulsa established a Route 66       Commission to oversee the enhancement, development, visitor       experience, and revitalization of the authentic Route 66,       twenty-four miles of which pass through Tulsa County. This       Commission, which I chair, is comprised of City Councilors,       County Commissioners, business owners, Main Street Program       directors, and other passionate supports of the Mother Road,       all committed to maintaining and enhancing this culturally       significant treasure.        Since 1999, when the National Park Service established the       Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program, tremendous progress       has been made in revitalizing significant historic properties       all along the road. This in turn has lead to increased       tourism, both national and international, as well as enhanced       economic vitality in these communities.        Despite its reauthorization by Congress in 2009, the Route       66 Corridor Preservation Program is scheduled to sunset in       2019. Establishing Route 66 as a National Historic Trail will       ensure a federal focus that will continue the work of the       Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program for generations to       come.        Thank you for your consideration.            Kind regards,                                                         Ken Busby,      Executive Director & CEO.                                   ____                                                 September 19, 2016.        This letter is to indicate the National Historic Route 66       Federation's support for the designation of Route 66 as a       National Historic Trail.        Beginning in the 1920s, Route 66 built a robust economy in       the regions it passed through by serving the travelling       public with restaurants, motels, gas stations, stores and       entertainment. However, it was doomed by progress. In the mid       1950s, it began to be replaced by interstate highways. By the       mid 1980s it was no longer a Federal highway. Motorists chose       the multi-lane, high speed interstates over the two lane,       slower speed highway, and numerous businesses--even entire       towns--closed down.        Then, in 1999, the National Park Service created the Route       66 Corridor Preservation Program to revitalize and promote       the historic road. This program has been an important       catalyst for reinvigorating the Route 66 Corridor. It has       resulted in the restoration of many historic properties,       increased tourism and contributed to significant economic       growth.        The continuation of these economic benefits may be in       jeopardy, however. Despite its reauthorization by Congress in       2009, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program is scheduled       to sunset in 2019.        Securing National Historic Trail designation will       permanently ensure a federal focus on Route 66 that will       continue the work of the Corridor Preservation Program. A       Route 66 National Historic Trail will promote collaboration       among the communities, businesses, non-profit organizations,       and state  [[Page H4756]]       agencies to help ensure visitors have the best experience       possible when traveling Route 66.            Sincerely,                                                     David Knudson,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                    October 1, 2016.        The Route 66 Association of Illinois supports the       designation of Route 66 as a National Historic Trail. This       designation will provide much needed support to preserve the       ionic features of Route 66 and maximize the benefits       available to Heritage tourism.        In 1999 the National Park Service created the Route 66       Corridor Preservation Program to revitalize and promote this       historic road. This program has been a significant catalyst       for reinvigorating the Route 66 Corridor, and this has       assisted with the domestic and international tourism       destination.        Illinois has benefitted from 26 of these grants since 2001.       These grants, totaling over $248,000.00 were all matching       grants that benefitted businesses and communities throughout       the entire state.        The continuation of these economic benefits is in jeopardy.       The Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program is scheduled to       sunset (end) in 2019. Securing the National Historic Trail       designation will permanently ensure a federal focus on Route       66 that will continue the work of The Corridor Preservation       program. A Route 66 National Historic Trail will promote       collaboration among the communities, non-profit       organizations, and state agencies that help ensure visitors       have the best experience possible when traveling Route 66 to       discover America. The National Trail will provide a cohesive       experience along the route, assisted by the individual state       associations and byway programs.        The Route 66 Association of Illinois strongly supports this       designation.                                                Cathie Stevanovich,      President, Route 66 Association of Illinois.                                   ____                                 Route 66 Association of Missouri,                                                   February 6, 2017.        The Route 66 Association of Missouri supports the       designation of Route 66 as a National Historic Trail at this       time but reserves the right to amend our decision when other       details become available. This designation will provide much       needed support to preserve the iconic features of 66 and       maximize the benefits available through heritage tourism.        Route 66 has served as an economic engine since the 1920s.       It brought significant commerce in serving the travelling       public with restaurants, motels, gas stations, and       merchandise. Unfortunately, it was eventually replaced with       the interstate system. As a result, many communities,       businesses, attractions, and individuals suffered economic       loss. In 1999 Congress created the Corridor Preservation       Program to help revitalize and promote this historic road.       This program has been a significant catalyst for       reinvigorating Route 66, helping reinvent the road as a       domestic and international tourism destination.        The Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program is scheduled to       sunset in 2019. Securing National Historic Trail designation       will permanently ensure a Federal focus on Route 66 that will       help preserve and promote Route 66 and its historic role in       developing America through strong partnerships between the       National Park Service and the communities, non-profit       organizations, and state organizations along this important       historic road.''        National Historic Trail designation for Route 66 will be of       significant economic and cultural benefit. Accordingly, the       Route 66 Association of Missouri supports the designation of       Route 66 as a National Historic Trail.            Sincerely,                                                     Tommy G.

The Kansas Historic Route 66 Association supports the       designation of Route 66 as a National Historic Trail. This       designation will provide much needed support to preserve the       iconic features of Route 66 and maximize the benefits       available through heritage tourism.        Route 66 has served as a true economic engine since the       1920s. First it brought significant commerce in serving the       travelling public with restaurants, motels, gas stations, and       merchandise. Unfortunately, it was soon replaced with the       interstate system and the communities that are located along       the 13.2 mile stretch in Kansas such as Galena, Riverton and       Baxter Springs suffered economic loss as a result. However,       in 1999 the National Park Service created the Route 66       Corridor Preservation Program to revitalize and promote this       historic road. This program has been a significant catalyst       for reinvigorating the Route 66 Corridor, reinventing the       road as a domestic and international tourism destination.        This has resulted in:        Tourism visits both foreign and domestic        Sales tax revenue        Grants for revitalization of the Phillips 66 Visitor       Center, Rainbow Bridge and the Galena Viaduct        Established museum or tourism center        Opened new businesses like Cars on the Route, Angels on the       Route and Cafe on the Route        Festivals        Bus tours, Motorcycle tours and Bicycle tours        Protecting our historic resources, establishing Historical       Districts and placing Icons on Historical registers        The continuation of these economic benefits may be in       jeopardy, however. Despite its reauthorization by Congress in       2009, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program is scheduled       to sunset in 2019. Securing National Historic Trail       designation will permanently ensure a federal focus on Route       66 that will continue the work of the Corridor Preservation       Program. A Route 66 National Historic Trail will promote       collaboration among the communities, non-profit       organizations, and state agencies that help ensure visitors       have the best experience possible when traveling Route 66 to       discover America.        National Historic Trail designation for Route 66 will be of       significant benefit to our 13.2 miles of Route 66 in Kansas       and the communities along that route. We strongly support       designation of Route 66 as a National Historic Trail.            Sincerely,                                                  Renee Charles,                                          President, Kansas Historic      Route 66 Association.                                   ____                                                     April 28, 2017.        The New Mexico Route 66 Association strongly supports the       designation of Route 66 as a National Historic Trail       Memorializing Route 66 as a National Historic Trail will       provide much needed support to preserve and promote iconic       features of Route 66 in New Mexico, as well as across the       other seven states through which the Mother Road runs.        In 1999, the U S. Congress authorized the National Park       Service to create the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program       to revitalize and promote this historic road This Corridor       Preservation Program has been a significant catalyst for       reinvigorating the Route 66 Corridor, helping to reinvent the       road as a domestic and international tourism destination       However, with that program scheduled to sunset in 2019, the       virtually unanimous congressional support for the       internationally popular road will not be sustained Although       Congress reauthorized the ten-year Route 66 Corridor       Preservation Program in 2009, we are told that another       reauthorization is unlikely The National Historic Trails       program, with assured permanent funding and connection with       many other historic corridors will sustain federal focus and       provide a far more secure and more broadly supportive haven.        We are totally dedicated to the preservation, promotion,       and enjoyment of the historic corridor in New Mexico and are       committed to helping insure that National Historic Trail       designation will continue the work of the Route 66 Corridor       Preservation Program. In the process, a Route 66 National       Historic Trail will promote collaboration among communities,       non-profit organizations, and state organizations such as our       New Mexico Route 66 Association that help preserve and       promote Route 66.

[[Page H4757]]                                          ____  [From Arizona's Historic Route 66 National Scenic Byway Program, May                                 30, 2017]             Support for the Route 66 National Trails Initiative         On behalf of the Arizona Historic Route 66 National Scenic       Byway Program, a Route 66 community's grass-roots       collaborative, I appreciate this opportunity to show support       for the Historic Route 66 National Trails Initiative. We       believe this all-important, non-patrician initiative is key       to the successful preservation, protection, and promotion of       America's most iconic route into the future. We appreciate       you sharing our letter of support with the appropriate       entities.        As you know, Historic Route 66, dotted with mom and pop       businesses, neon signs, and eclectic roadside attractions       tells the story of America's historical move west. Contrasted       with the other highways of its day, the creation of this       2,448-mile ``super highway'' in 1926 did not follow a       traditionally linear course. Instead its diagonal path linked       hundreds of rural communities across eight states and became       the principal east-west artery making it the Main Street of       America. Like the country that the road traversed, history       was made and imprints were left by the Roaring Twenties, the       Great Depression, the war years, and the road trips of the       fifties and sixties        Recognizing the significance of Route 66 as an economic       driver and historic treasure, in 1999 the U.S. Congress       authorized the National Park Service to create the Route 66       Corridor Preservation Program. This program has guided the       eight states through historic preservation projects, and       reestablishing the Route as a one-of-a-kind travel       experience. It has also opened lines of communication between       communities as well as between states and other key component       for future successes.        Gratefully Congress reauthorized the Route 66 Corridor       Preservation Program in 2009, but this stand-alone program is       once again due to end in 2019 and there is still much work to       be done. Exploring a more secure future for Historic Route       66, it became clear early on that Route 66 would be a perfect       addition to the National Historic Trails Program adding an       American treasure to the collection, and opening new avenues       for continued historic preservation and promotion of Route       66. The Arizona National Scenic Byway Program is committed to       making this important initiative become a reality for the       future of our communities and attractions.

The Old Route 66 Association of Texas supports the       designation of Route 66 as a National Historic Trail. This       designation will provide much needed support to preserve the       iconic features of Route 66 and maximize the benefits       available through heritage tourism.        Route 66 has served as a true economic engine since the       1920s but when it was replaced with the interstate system in       the 1970s, the Texas Panhandle from Shamrock to Glenrio was       changed forever.        However, in 1999 the National Park Service created the       Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program to revitalize and       promote this historic road. This program has been a       significant catalyst for reinvigorating the Route 66       Corridor, reinventing the road as a domestic and       international tourism destination.        For Texas' stretch of Route 66 this has resulted in--        increased visitation, especially from international       tourists.        increased local and state sales tax revenue.        new and reopened businesses along the route.        regional and national festivals along the route.        bus tours including Texas in their Route 66 itineraries.        cooperative marketing amongst federal, state and local       organizations.        increased awareness of protecting our historic Route 66       resources.        The continuation of these economic benefits may be in       jeopardy, however. Despite reauthorization by Congress in       2009, the Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program is scheduled       to sunset in 2019. Securing National Historic Trail       designation will permanently ensure a federal focus on Route       66 that will continue the work of the Corridor Preservation       Program. A Route 66 National Historic Trail will promote       collaboration among the communities, non-profit       organizations, and state agencies that help ensure visitors       have the best experience possible when traveling Route 66 to       discover America.        National Historic Trail designation for Route 66 will be of       significant benefit to the Texas Panhandle. The Old Route 66       Association of Texas strongly supports this designation.            Sincerely,                                                   Dora Meroney,                                                          President,      Old Route 66 Association of Texas.                                   ____                                                    October 1, 2016.        The California Historic Route 66 Association strongly       supports the designation of Route 66 as a National Historic       Trail. This national commemoration will provide much needed       support for preserving and promoting iconic features of Route       66 in California, as well as across the other seven states       through which the Mother Road passes.        In 1999, the U.S. Congress authorized the National Park       Service to create the Route 66 Corridor or Preservation       Program to revitalize and promote this historic road. This       program has been a significant catalyst for reinvigorating       the Route 66 Corridor, helping to reinvent the road as a       domestic and international tourism destination.        However, with that program scheduled to sunset in 2019, the       virtually unanimous congressional support for the       internationally popular road will not be sustained. Although       Congress reauthorized the ten-year Route 66 Corridor       Preservation Program in 2009, we are told that another       reauthorization is unlikely. The National Historic Trails       program, with assured permanent funding and connection with       many other historic corridors will sustain federal focus and       provide a far more secure and more broadly supportive haven.        We are totally dedicated to the preservation, promotion,       and enjoyment of the historic corridor in California and are       committed to helping insure that National Historic Trail       designation will continue the work of the Route 66 Corridor       Preservation Program. In the process, a Route 66 National       Historic Trail will promote collaboration among communities,       non-profit organizations, and state organizations such as our       California Historic Route 66 Association that help preserve       and promote Route 66.            Sincerely,                                                    Glen Duncan,                                                          President,                          California Historic Route 66 Association.     Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.
