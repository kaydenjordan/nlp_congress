 Mr. President, every single day, law enforcement  officers across the Nation put on a badge and leave for work to protect  and serve our families and communities, not knowing if they will return  to their own. Whether it be by ensuring safety on our roadways or  responding to life-or-death crises, these brave men and women  consistently honor their solemn oath in safeguarding the people of this  blessed Nation.   As we commemorate 2022 National Law Enforcement Week, we offer  special honors for the 619 officers our Nation lost last year in the  line of duty, sadly including officers from Mississippi. This week is  dedicated to remembering their ultimate sacrifice, which is dearly felt  by loved ones, friends, and entire communities.   Law enforcement officers have remained steadfast in their commitment  to serve, even when faced with harsh, unfair criticism, scrutiny, and  limited resources. Their ability to carry out their already stressful  duties in such a challenging and sometimes hostile environment is  remarkable.   I want to make it known to all the law enforcement officers across  the State of Mississippi and around the country that I greatly admire  you for your rock solid tenacity and loyalty throughout such  challenges. I will continue to work to ensure you have what you need to  do your job.   These officers, who are truly hometown heroes, are strongholds in our  communities, and the loss of any officer is deeply felt by all. This  Police Week, we honor and mourn five heroes from Mississippi, officers  who died in the line of duty in 2021.   Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol Trooper John Martin Harris, 44,  died on May 28, 2021, after a vehicle struck him during a traffic stop.  Harris' childhood dream was to be a policeman and serve his community.  Having earned two Purple Hearts throughout his 24-year law enforcement  career is a testament to his dedication, bravery, and selflessness. He  leaves behind his wife and his two children.   Jefferson Davis County Deputy Sheriff Thomas Patrick ``Pat'' Barnes,  50, lost his life on April 10, 2021, after he sustained injuries in a  single vehicle car crash while responding to a call for assistance from  another agency. Barnes' passion for law enforcement began while working  in security. He joined and graduated from the police academy in 2017  and began his career with Jefferson Davis County Sheriff's department  shortly thereafter. He leaves behind his wife, four children, and his  grandchildren.   Hancock County Lieutenant Michael Anthony Boutte, Sr., was tragically  shot and killed after responding to an emergency situation involving a  suicidal man who turned his weapon onto arriving deputies. He died on  February 1, 2021, at the age of 57. Before his law enforcement career,  Boutte served in the U.S. Air Force, where he was deployed during  Operation Desert Storm. Boutte is survived by his wife, his child, his  step-children, and his grandchildren.   Deputy Sheriff Bobby Daffin of George County Sheriff's Office passed  away August 12, 2021, following a battle with COVID-19. He was 37 years  old. Daffin served his community for 14 years and had recently served  as a narcotics agent for the Southeast Mississippi Narcotics Task  Force. He leaves behind a young daughter.   Hinds County Sheriff Lee D. Vance, 63, lost his life from  cardiorespiratory failure as a result of COVID-19 on August 3, 2021.  Vance, who has always had a love for the city of Jackson, served as  Jackson police chief from 2014-2017 and was later elected Hinds County  Sheriff in 2019. He leaves behind four daughters, a son, and numerous  grandchildren.   We also honor the lives of many officers, whose stories of sacrifice  had been lost to history until now.   In addition to these recent losses, the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial will include the name of Deputy Town Marshal Walker  Cobb of Saucier, MS. At the age of 41, Cobb was fatally shot on  December 25, 1903, while attempting to arrest an impaired suspect for  disorderly conduct. More than a century later, his loss and sacrifice  will be remembered.   Throughout our Nation's history, our men and women in blue have often  risked personal peril to safeguard their fellow citizens, and we owe  them our staunch support. As we mark National Police Week, let us  acknowledge our debt to these fallen officers and recommit ourselves to  support them and their families, especially when tragedy strikes.   I will continue to be an advocate for law enforcement professionals  and do all I can to honor the legacy of those lost in the line of duty.   To the families and loved ones of our fallen Mississippi law  enforcement officers, I know you have faced enormous loss. It is said,  ``The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in  spirit.'' Please know that it is my prayer that the Lord stays near you  during your time of grief. God bless you, and God bless our men and  women in blue.  [[Page S2489]]                                ____________________
