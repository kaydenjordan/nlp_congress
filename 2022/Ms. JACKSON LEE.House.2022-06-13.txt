 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6270, the  Advanced Aviation Infrastructure Modernization Act, or the AAIM Act.   H.R. 6270 would establish a pilot program to help state, local and  Tribal governments prepare for advanced air mobility operations and  ensure that communities can take advantage of the potential benefits of  the safe integration of these technologies in our nation's airspace.   The AAIM Act outlines a comprehensive set of considerations for  infrastructure planning that will enable communities to maximize the  societal benefits that Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) stands to offer.   Air mobility is a promising industry set to advance and enhance  American methods of transportation.   For more than 100 years, the U.S. aerospace and defense (A&D)  industry has been at the forefront of innovation.   From the first flight in the air to the first steps on the moon, the  industry has led the United States' economic and national security  success domestically and internationally.   AAM is a new concept of air transportation using electric vertical  takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to move people and cargo between  places not currently or easily served.   The AAM market is estimated to reach US$115 billion annually by 2035,  employing more than 280,000 high-paying jobs.   To keep pace with this growing sector, states and localities need to  prepare for anticipated AAM operations and ensure local communities can  take advantage of the potential benefits of the safe integration of AAM  technologies in U.S. airspace.   H.R. 6270 establishes a two-year pilot program that invests $25  million in competitive grants for state, local, territorial, and Tribal  governments to prepare for the development and deployment of AAM  vertiports and related infrastructure.   Powered by electric or hybrid propulsion, AAM offers significant  potential to improve mobility and complement existing public,  transportation networks while reducing congestion and carbon and noise  emissions.   I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 6270 the Advanced Aviation  Infrastructure Modernization Act.    Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of S. 3580 to defend  the right of American business owners and farmers to receive fair  pricing for the exportation of their valuable products across the  world.   Since the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a halt, the  international exchange of goods has struggled to recover.   Many Americans have felt the impact of the supply chain disruption in  their homes and pockets.   Products manufactured in factories overseas take too long to arrive  at our ports.   When they do arrive, they spend days docked on shore before  distribution to American warehouses.   However, the true crime in this broken system has been the theft of  economic opportunity to American exporters.   In the months of October and November 2021, when the global supply  chain was at its most unstable, shipping carriers had the gall to  arrive on U.S. soil, deposit foreign products and then reject the  exports of American farmers and business owners.   In these two months, ocean carriers turned away more than 175,000  containers from ports in California, New Jersey, and New York.   According to some reports, nearly 40 percent of scheduled pickups of  U.S. agricultural exports were cancelled or simply not completed.   Three out of four shipping containers left American ports empty.   That's a loss of over $630 million for American businesses.   When shipping containers were available for export, price gouging ate  into already small profit margins of our hard-working farmers.   In just two years the price of a shipping container leaving the U.S.  quadrupled.   Our business owners, our producers, our farmers are being robbed.   Foreign shipping companies should not be making all time high profits  off the backs of American business owners.   The Ocean Shipping Competition Reform Act will empower the Federal  Maritime Commission to ensure that American companies stand on equal  footing with foreign manufacturers and that these unjust practices come  to an end.   S. 3580 will ensure that shipping companies commit to fair and  equitable pricing practices.   S. 3580 will support the American economy and will empower our  business owners and agricultural leaders to compete on an even playing  field on the international stage.   That is why I stand in support of the Ocean Shipping Competition  Reform Act of 2022, and why I encourage my colleagues to do the same.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and submit additional materials and statements.    Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to proceed under  this Special Order of the Congressional Black Caucus. It is my pleasure  now to begin to frame this very important week to commemorate  Juneteenth, the second acknowledgment of the Federal holiday created on  June 17, 2021, by President Joe Biden--present, of course, was Vice  President Kamala Harris--when the first holiday for nearly 40 years,  Federal holiday, was established.   I am pleased to be able to yield to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Ohio whose vision has helped us craft this recognition and this  Congressional Black Caucus Special Order and her recognition of the  cruciality of honoring those who have never been honored, the  acknowledgment of Juneteenth, a day of freedom, and as well recognizing  H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals. We  thank her for her leadership and her guidance.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty),  the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  distinguished presentation.   I will take a moment, as other Members are on the floor, so I can at  least set the framework of this evening of which she has done so ably.  I think the cornerstone of the chairwoman's remarks is that we have  been building on Juneteenth, as members of the Congressional Black  Caucus, for all of our tenure in Congress. We have done it by the  myriad of legislative initiatives that continue to build and repair  what was generated from the 246 years of slavery.   Let me, first of all, read into the Record that order of General  Gordon Granger on June 19, 1865, on the shores of Galveston, Texas:  [[Page H5473]]    ``The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a  proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are  free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights  of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection  heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and  hired labor. The Freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their  present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not  be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be  supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.''   Most people have not heard the entire order.   Union soldiers, up to 200,000, fought in the Civil War and died.  Union soldiers were killed by Confederate soldiers. Rather than, under  the laws of the military protocol, captured as prisoners of war, they  shot them dead.   Blood was shed by slaves, or Freedmen, and the order that we all so  often praised, let me be very clear, General Granger said you are free,  but your posture, your framework, the guidepost, is you are not to  leave. You are now employer and not even employee but hired labor.   There was no obligation for Freedmen to stay and take a job, and most  of the slaves looked askance. They didn't understand what ``employer''  was. That is not a word they had ever heard, in any large sense, and  ``hired labor.'' We are free.   Tonight, we speak about freedom. They were free. Yet, even in the  goodness of that order, they were advised to remain at their present  homes, probably something that had been given to the plantation and the  masters and to work for wages. It did not say what kind of wages, what  kind of work conditions you had, what kind of workers' comp, insurance.  No, they were informed that they would not be allowed to collect at  military posts, and as if that had been the slaves' mantra, they even  challenged them to not be supported in idleness either there or  elsewhere.   Let me tell you, by this very potent picture, what the ancestors had  gone through for 246 years. For those who were born, lived, and died in  the brutality of slavery, this was their lives, the separation of  families and the unnaming of families. They had first names, or they  were called ``husband'' or ``wife.'' They were not given the dignity of  a name. This was their lot.   So Juneteenth, its essence was freedom, but the words were hesitant.  Even though slavery had been abolished, as most people will know,  except for convicted persons, which made them as a challenged  amendment, if you will, because that process of prisoners continued  into the 20th century.   But I say this to say, as we begin our discussion, and I will just  make this point, I am here to honor those who never were honored, whose  names were never called, whose funerals or burials were never given the  dignity of a human being. They died as less than a person, as the  Constitution dictated, for at least a century. They never had that  dignity of who they were and the work they did and the building of the  economic engine of America and the shedding of blood in both the  Revolutionary War and the wars in between and the Civil War.   As we look at these scars, that is why I am so adamant about H.R. 40,  the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals. Because even  in the pronouncement of freedom, Chairwoman Beatty, Chairman Jeffries,  Chair Bonnie Watson Coleman--even in the proclamation of freedom, they  did not have freedom. They were qualified in their freedom.   With that in mind, I continue to raise up this bill, with almost 217  cosponsors, to this week even become an executive order, pronouncement  of such, or ultimately passed by the House of Representatives, that is,  H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals.   I am prepared to yield to the chairman of the House Democratic  Caucus, who has certainly evidenced the essence of freedom in our work  together on criminal justice reform. I think he well knows what the  13th Amendment left us with, as well as General Granger's order. I hope  that he has heard that even in freedom, we were given qualifications  and structures and strictures, and we were denied the true freedom of  this Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).                                time  2000     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for taking us  through this powerful journey of a continued fight for freedom by the  Congressional Black Caucus and incorporating all of the relief given  for the continued ailments and disparities of African Americans and  leading us to H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation  Proposals for African Americans Act, which really are components of the  work that we have been doing. They are the building blocks of trying to  cure extensive disparities.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman), a Member that has worked on disparities focused on the  journey of Black women, leading on issues of Black women maternity  mortality, as well as my colleague on the Homeland Security Committee  and a number of other collaborations.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing  to our attention some very unique aspects, again, of the Congressional  Black Caucus and her work.   As I travel the country, it is interesting to hear that our community  has been so deprived as it relates to the discrimination against you  with respect to your hairstyle. Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman,  among other things, was able to lead on something, and I hear it often,  that they are so proud of this legislation because it has given dignity  to people whose dignity was taken away.   These are the building blocks that the Congressional Black Caucus  pours into the symbolism of honoring Juneteenth and H.R. 40, the  commission that studies slavery.   Madam Speaker, as I prepare to allow for an additional speaker to  come, let me make this point--let me just take this moment as we  prepare to yield.   Madam Speaker, would you give us the time, please?    Madam Speaker, let me put this into the record as I  prepare to yield, and emphasize what H.R. 40 does. As I do so, let me  emphasize why H.R. 40 is so important.   This is what you see--it is the hanging of Black men, and it is the  presence of individuals who are making a spectacle of this. There is  one Black man already on the ground. There is no evidence of a trial,  no evidence of guilt. This is an example of what preceded 1865.   When you talk about H.R. 40--or even when we were trying to make  Juneteenth a Federal holiday--I introduced resolutions over and over  again and finally got the bill introduced as a Federal holiday, which  then we proceeded and worked to get it passed. There was always a  question: Why?   There was always a question about this issue of freedom. You are  already free. You live in America. The same goes for this issue of: Why  H.R. 40? Because the continuing--continuing--ailments that ailed our  community did not end.   This was obviously not in 1865. This was into the 1900s, the 20th  century, as evidenced--or maybe the late 1800s that Black men were  being hung, Black women were being raped and separated from families,  and the abuse of racism was deep and abiding. The Klan would raid and  burn communities, hospitals, churches, homes, and have a reign of  terror.   This work of the Congressional Black Caucus, with the many splinters  of legislation, can be culminated by the passage through a vote on the  floor of the House or through an executive order that clearly would  provide an answer to the language here that says:   Following the abolition of slavery, the United States Government, at  the Federal, State, and local levels, continued to perpetrate, condone,  and often profit from practices that continued to brutalize and  disadvantage African Americans, including share cropping, convict  leasing, Jim Crow, redlining, unequal education, and disproportionate  treatment at the hands of the criminal justice systems, and lack of  access to healthcare. Harvard University said, If we had it, we would  not have been that impacted by COVID in terms of dying and sickness.  This is a symbolic depiction that racism and discrimination continue to  exist.   This legislation was updated to say: And develop reparation  proposals. That is the key. It is an action item. We want a response to  Black America; a response to African Americans; we want a response to  the 57 members of the Congressional Black Caucus--coming from a variety  of districts--some with small measures of African Americas. Yet, the  recognition of wherever they live in America, and as our members  represent all people, millions of Americans, they understand the stark  disparities they see even in their congressional districts.   That is why we stand here today, to honor Juneteenth which equals  freedom. That is why we are here today, to say that we are never giving  up the fight. We are most proud of the fact that we collectively came  as a body, embraced our work as individual members, and got Juneteenth  signed. We will now go into this week speaking about freedom, but also  speaking about truth and the work we have to do.    Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield to gentlewoman from Ohio  (Mrs. Beatty).                            ____________________
