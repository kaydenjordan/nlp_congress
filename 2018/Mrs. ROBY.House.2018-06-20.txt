 Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I just want to say that  each of the gentlewomen here all play for an individual who is a  survivor or a fighter.   I have a colleague who I have served on the city council with in  Montgomery, Alabama, for 7 years whose 18-year-old daughter, Courtney,  was recently diagnosed with leukemia. So I want all of my colleagues to  know that these are the faces and the individuals whom we are playing  for on the field tonight. I hope that each of my colleagues will come  out.   Go, Congress. Beat the press.                            ____________________
