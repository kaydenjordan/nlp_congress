 Madam President, very briefly, as I know we are about to  begin the vote, the Paul amendment is just one that is based on a  sentiment that I think many of us agree with--that the 2001  authorization needs revision. He proposes to repeal it but not for 6  months, giving us time to do the revision. I would vote against it but  would look forward to working with him and others and the  administration to find out what an appropriate revision should be. I  don't think we should leave a gap.   With respect to the Graham amendment--a colleague who is a good  friend--the President has the ability to take action against Iranian- backed militias in Iraq. The President is doing that every day, not  based on the 2002 authorization.   I agree with my colleague from New Jersey in that this is a debate  about ending a war authorization that has gone on for 20 years, not on  the floor, without committee action, coming up with a new authorization  against a new enemy. If we need to do that, we can discuss it in  committee.   The good news is that the President has article II power to defend  against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and is doing it every day.   With that, I would urge a ``no'' vote on both the Graham and Paul  amendments.  [[Page S902]]     Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   This amendment is to create a new AUMF that does not currently exist.  The President has article II powers, and we are defending against  Iranian-backed militias in Iraq every day under article II.   We do not need this. This is why both the American Legion and the  Concerned Veterans for America oppose Graham 14.   I urge a ``no'' vote. Let's repeal the Iraq war authorization, not  pass a new one.                           Vote on Amendment No. 14
