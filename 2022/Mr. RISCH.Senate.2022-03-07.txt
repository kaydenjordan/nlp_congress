 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and  Senator Crapo to express grave concern with the vulnerability of supply  chains and the long-term implications if we do not act now to develop a  secure supply chain of critical minerals. In light of the aggression  shown by our adversaries, supply chain security is more important than  ever.   Our Nation is at a crossroads; Russia has invaded Ukraine. At the  same time, China continues to use economic coercion to control global  markets and shape countries' political decisions. With Congress'  support, this administration must take drastic and targeted measures to  ensure our Nation takes the right path to advance U.S. competitiveness  and maintain a strong position in domestic and foreign markets,  including critical minerals production.   Critical minerals are vital to the emerging technologies that will  underpin the future economic well-being and prosperity of this Nation.  In recognition of these important minerals, under President Trump, the  Department of the Interior developed a list of 35 critical minerals, a  process that Congress later codified. That list, just last week,  expanded to 50. Our home State of Idaho is rich in many of these  minerals--some of which are fundamental to energy and national security  applications--such as antimony and cobalt.   Antimony and cobalt serve as critical components in grid storage  batteries and other electrification implements essential to providing  reliable energy sources to American homes and businesses. In addition  to its energy contribution, antimony serves as a critical component of  ammunition, armaments, and other national security platforms. Although  these minerals serve as essential components in highly utilized U.S.  products, 53 percent of antimony comes from China, and another 23  percent comes from Russia. Most cobalt is sourced from the Democratic  Republic of the Congo--DRC--where the Chinese Government has subsidized  companies that engage in nontransparent practices, dominate the  industry, and undermine the prosperity and rights of the Congolese.   Aside from mineral production, Idaho is responsible for cutting-edge  mineral research. We are proud to be the home of the Idaho National  Lab, the Nation's premier nuclear energy laboratory, whose research is  paramount to any future clean energy strategy. Unfortunately, the Biden  administration chose to remove uranium from the critical minerals list,  which leaves the Nation's nuclear fleet even more reliant on Russian  fuel.   As tensions rise with Russia and the potential of additional  sanctions loom, China will look to take advantage of the void left by  Russia's isolation in the market. While we need to take strong actions  on Russia, the reality is that we source many of our raw minerals from  them. As we tighten our grip on their financial system and exports, we  must prioritize domestic sourcing and reduce our reliance on countries  like Russia and China.   The time is now for this administration to take real action to  prioritize a strong domestic supply chain for these essential minerals.  We do not want to compromise any of our environmental or other  standards. We are simply calling on the administration to prioritize  the timely completion of the permits of currently proposed projects so  we may take back control of a fundamental piece of many of our  essential industries: critical minerals production.                            ____________________     Mr. President, along with my colleague Senator Mike  Crapo, I rise today to recognize Arthur Brown, a long-time resident of  Idaho, a wonderful citizen, and a tremendous contributor to Idaho. Art  died on February 9, 2022, having lived a full, rich and meaningful  life.   Art was born October 27, 1940, in Germiston, South Africa, the eldest  of three children. Art attended school in Germiston and went on to  study at Witwatersrand Technical Institute, earning a mining  engineering degree. Soon after graduating, he left his homeland to work  for the Cementation Company in Nelson, British Columbia, Canada in  1962. It was in Nelson where he met Tiia, an immigrant from Estonia,  and the woman who would become his wife. Together, Art and Tiia had  three daughters, Lisa, Hayley, and Laura.   Art arrived in Wallace, ID, in June of 1967, where he became an  industrial engineer for Hecla Mining Company. He worked hard and was  eventually promoted to mine superintendent at the Lucky Friday Mine.  While living in the beautiful Silver Valley, Art thoroughly enjoyed the  outdoors, often taking his family skiing and camping. Art, Tiia, and  their two daughters who were born in Canada celebrated becoming U.S.  citizens in 1972.   Art ascended the ranks at Hecla, becoming president in 1986, the same  year the company moved its headquarters to Coeur d'Alene, ID. Art  reached the pinnacle of his career when he was made Hecla's CEO and  chairman of the board. In 2003, Art retired from Hecla, marking the end  of a remarkable career that spanned four decades.   An accomplished businessman and corporate leader, Art was also a  dedicated family man, making time to travel and support his daughters  at ski races, basketball games, tennis matches, and horse shows. And  ever the proud grandfather, he supported his four grandchildren at  football, basketball and baseball games, cross-country meets, golf  tournaments, and soccer matches.   Art shared his enthusiasm for life with everyone he knew and was  always willing to listen and help solve problems. He was genuinely  interested in the people he met and was loved by many. Art will be  missed, but not forgotten.   We are proud to have known Art Brown, for the example he set for  business, for the contributions he made in his community, and for the  way he loved and supported his family. On behalf of so many in our  great State, we honor Art Brown today and express our heartfelt thanks  to him for a lifetime of service to others.                            ____________________
