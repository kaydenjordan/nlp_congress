 Madam Speaker, from the Oval Office, the President's  address to the Nation last night stressed how important decisive action  is today and in the future to prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow.   I commend the President for his latest measures to keep the country  safe and to provide for its continued prosperity.   The travel ban from China proved to be a lifesaving choice for  Americans, and I expect the European travel ban will provide a similar  result and ability to hold off even worse results.   Should the House vote on a coronavirus package today, I would like to  remind my colleagues that our local governments are the best chance we  have of attacking this virus head-on.   The President has worked diligently to provide local public health  officials the resources they need to mitigate the virus, including the  rapid release of the funds from the emergency supplemental we passed  last week.   Our cities and towns know the risks that their citizens face the  best, and Congress should be doing all it can to take proper action in  aiding them and, most importantly, our American citizens.                            ____________________
