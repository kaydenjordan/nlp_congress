 Mr. President, let me first thank my friend and  colleague from Illinois. He is a lamp of light in this horrible moment  when children are being separated from their parents, when we don't  even know where they are, and when we don't even know who their parents  are. He is showing the inhumanity and the incompetence of this  administration rolled into one. He has been a constant and vigilant  voice to reunite the families and bring some justice, some peace, some  calm to these poor kids. So I thank him for the work he has done.
