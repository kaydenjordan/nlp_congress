 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Roxanne Watson,  a resident of the 17th Congressional District who is here in the  gallery today.   Roxanne has dedicated herself to raising awareness about organ  donation, serving as a patient advocate and as a transplant ambassador  for Donate Life, WomenHeart, and the American Heart Association.   As the recipient of an organ donation herself, which saved her life,  Roxanne has taken this issue head-on.   She has served as an advocate and volunteer with LiveOnNY for over a  decade and as a volunteer with the New York Organ Donor Network, where  she has used her platform to help increase the number of organ donors  in Rockland County by over 15 percent in the past 20 years.   For these efforts, she has recently been recognized as a Guinness  world-record holder having signed up over 13,000 individuals to become  organ donors.   Roxanne Watson is a leader within our community and a role model for  others, and I am honored to recognize her today on the House floor for  her lifesaving efforts.                            ____________________
