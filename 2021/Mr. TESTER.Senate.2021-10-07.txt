 Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in support of  our bipartisan resolution to designate a state funeral in honor of the  last surviving Medal of Honor recipient for  [[Page S6966]]  World War II. Woody Williams is that person, and this would also  recognize millions of Americans for their service and sacrifice during  the war.   The Medal of Honor represents a small token of our appreciation for  the spirit, determination, and gallantry of those who performed far  beyond the call of duty, those of our ``greatest generation'' who gave  everything on the battlefield. This includes five brave Medal of Honor  recipients from the great State of Montana: William W. Galt, Laverne  Parrish, Leo J. Powers, Donald Ruhl, and Henry Schauer. Each of these  men pitted bravery and heroism against great odds and showed exemplary  devotion to our Nation. Now, they have all passed, but their memories  live on in each of us--in our freedoms, in the freedoms of our  children, and in those of our children's children.   Today, we have a special opportunity to honor their service and  ensure that their acts of heroism are never forgotten. A state funeral  for the last surviving World War II Medal of Honor recipient is a key  part of fulfilling this promise. These ceremonies offer our Nation the  opportunity to pause and reflect on the service of not only the  individual but also those who served alongside them.   It is my hope that President Biden designates this state funeral so  that we may honor the last surviving Medal of Honor recipient from  World War II with this distinction. It is time to pay a final salute to  the millions of men and women of our ``greatest generation'' who served  our country with great courage.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
