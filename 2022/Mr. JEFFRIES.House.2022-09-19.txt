 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chair for  yielding, as well as his continued leadership of this all-important  committee and in connection with this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of H.R. 6734, the Keep America's Refuges  Operational Act. I thank my colleagues, Representatives Thompson and  Sablan, and certainly Representative Wittman for his leadership on the  other side of the aisle.   This commonsense and bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the National  Wildlife Refuge System volunteer, community partnership, and education  program. Because of this program, refuges continue to benefit from  volunteer support, which has successfully saved taxpayer dollars,  generated millions for local economies, and promoted jobs in  communities throughout America.    The National Wildlife Refuge System is comprised of over 560 refuges  located in every United States territory and State. They make up over  800 million acres of habitat dedicated to the conservation of fish and  wildlife. Each year, National Wildlife Refuge System hosts more than 60  million visitors, generating over $3 billion in revenue for local  economies and supporting more than 40,000 jobs.   Visitors come from all over to explore, hunt, fish, and enjoy  America's natural beauty. Refuges help to mold the next generation of  conservationists and outdoor enthusiasts by providing learning  experiences and cherished memories.   But this wouldn't be possible without the dedicated refuge volunteers  and community partners who donate their time and their energy to keep  refuges open and operational. During fiscal year 2021, approximately  11,700 volunteers gave close to 649,000 hours of their time, which is  the equivalent of nearly 318 full-time employees or a contribution of  more than $18 million.   Volunteers provide critical support to full-time staff in numerous  ways. They operate visitor centers, conduct fish and wildlife  population surveys, maintain visitor structures, roads and paths, fight  invasive species, and protect native plants and animals. They also help  refuges raise money for key infrastructure projects and visitor  centers.   Volunteers are of all ages, come from diverse walks of life, work in  many different capacities, and truly represent the gorgeous mosaic of  the American people. But one thing they all have in common is their  commitment to preserving America's natural beauty so that we can all  enjoy it for years to come.   In the 115th Congress, the House passed an identical reauthorization  bill, which was signed into law by President Trump in April of 2018.  Since that time, the program has continued to leverage volunteer hours  allowing wildlife refuges to remain accessible for millions of visitors  each year. It is my hope that we can again work across the aisle to  support, in different ways, our National Wildlife Refuge System.                                time  1745    I will take a moment to acknowledge the cosponsors of this  legislation, Chairman Grijalva and Representatives Graves, Thompson,  and Sablan, with a particular special thanks to Representative Wittman  for partnering with me, once again, to advance this legislation. I  greatly appreciate their leadership and longstanding support for the  National Wildlife Refuge System.   Supporting this bill in this Chamber means supporting the economic  benefits to be gained from being good stewards of the environment that  God has given to this great country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6734.
