 Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the confirmation  of three nominees to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board,  often called the PCLOB. The PCLOB is a vital oversight mechanism,  empowered by Congress to investigate and write public reports on some  of the government's most secretive and controversial programs.   Today, three board member nominees were confirmed to the PCLOB:  Edward Felten, a computer science professor at Princeton; Jane Nitze, a  former lawyer  [[Page S6807]]  at the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel; and Adam Klein,  nominated to be chair, who is a fellow at the Center for New American  Security.   I have concerns about some of the policy perspectives the Republican  nominees hold. In this case, however, a functioning PCLOB with board  members who listen to dissenting views is better than the status quo,  where the five-member board has only one member. The PCLOB has been  dormant for most of the current administration and regrettably--and in  contrary to its statutory mission--has not made all of its previously  investigated and written reports public. I look forward to working with  the new board members to returning the PCLOB to its core mission of  public oversight of classified programs.   Additionally, I am particularly grateful for Professor Felten's  confirmation. The presence of a true public servant technologist on the  PCLOB will hopefully raise awareness and understanding surrounding  controversial surveillance programs that use advanced technology.   In the coming weeks and months, I will be working with the new board  members on the critical issues of privacy, security, and secret  interpretations of public law. It is my sincere hope that the new  members share my deeply held belief that the government should not have  classified interpretations of public laws that cause the programs to  operate differently than the public understands.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to honor the  65th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice Agreement, which brought  the active hostilities of the Korean war to an end.   Americans don't talk much about the Korean war today. As a result,  too many have forgotten or never knew the history, how Kim Il-sung's  forces invaded South Korea in June 1950; how the United Nations  Security Council condemned the invasion; how American troops made an  amphibious landing at Inchon, driving the North Korean forces back and  helping shift the war's momentum; how 3 years later, representatives  met in Panmunjom where they established a demilitarized zone and ended  active hostilities.   Because this history is so often overlooked, American men and women  who served in Korea have so rarely been given the recognition they  deserve.   These are Americans who answered the call to take up arms again in a  foreign country so soon after World War II, Americans who endured the  bitter cold and harsh weather up and down the Peninsula and the lack of  adequate food, Americans who gave their lives by the thousands on  Korea's far-flung shores in service to their country. All told, more  than 36,000 Americans perished in the Korean war, including more than  270 Oregonians and at least seven from Umatilla County, OR.   The Korean war is often called the Forgotten War.   Well, it isn't forgotten by me. It isn't forgotten by the U.S.  Senate. I am proud to say that it isn't forgotten by the Oregonians I  speak with as I travel around our State.   I have never met a Korean war veteran--or a veteran of any conflict-- who walked onto the battlefield seeking personal recognition.   Today I am proud to recognize these brave servicemembers nonetheless.   This year marks the 65th year since the signing of the Korean War  Armistice and the end of active hostilities.   As we follow new developments on the Korean Peninsula--and there have  been many these past few months--let us reflect on the Americans who  fought so bravely and endured so much in service to these United  States.   I have always believed that the Federal Government owes these men and  women a debt it cannot fully repay. The closest I think we can come is  to honor our commitments to them and to do right by their brothers and  sisters who continue to wear the uniform.   As we look forward to Veterans Day, let us all take a moment to thank  those Korean war veterans still with us and to ensure that their  service and their sacrifices are never forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this November, my hometown of Portland  marks a somber occasion: the 30th anniversary of the murder of Mulugeta  Seraw, a 28-year-old Ethiopian college student, by racist skinheads.  This horrific case galvanized the city, as well as the State of Oregon,  to stand up to hate crimes and acts of violence by the neo-Nazi  movement in the Pacific Northwest. While this brutal slaying happened  30 years ago, it remains fresh in the minds of many who lived through  that time and for people who still experience discrimination and hate  today.   Mulugeta's path to our country mirrors those of so many others who  came to America. He came to the United States seeking an education. A  college student in Portland, he worked multiple jobs and remitted money  to Ethiopia to support his son, Henock.  [[Page S6810]]  Mulugeta, like many immigrants who come to America, was simply seeking  opportunity. His family and friends describe him as a kind, hard- working man. He had friends and family whom he supported and loved. All  this was ripped away by evil, cruel racism.   As a result of the cruelty done to Mulugeta, community members, civil  rights lawyers, judges, elected officials, and nonprofits came together  and demanded justice be served. They succeeded.   The case attracted national attention, and thanks in part to the  great effort of the Southern Poverty Law Center, the White Aryan  Resistance and its leaders who were behind this heinous crime were  bankrupted and jailed. While no prison sentence could bring back  Mulugeta, Oregonians stood and stand in solidarity with Mulugeta and  his family and friends to make clear we will not let hate crimes and  violence take over our communities.   We have to remain vigilant, and we have to continue the fight. We  must recognize our own troubling present in Oregon, which unfortunately  has an awful history as a home for White supremacists, because to not  know our own history dooms us.   In the years since Mulugeta's death, there have been horrific acts of  racially charged violence in Oregon. In May of 2017, a self-proclaimed  White nationalist verbally attacked two women who were riding  Portland's MAX light rail. One of these two women was wearing a hijab.  The perpetrator stabbed three men who defended the women against the  racist and Islamophobic rant, killing two of them.   There have been horrific racist acts throughout the Nation. The march  and murder in Charlottesville is another clear example of how these  White supremacist ideals and concepts continue to draw breath in our  country. Like Oregonians speaking out in remembrance of Mulugeta Seraw,  we must all speak out against hate. It has no place in our country,  including in our White House.   This year, as we remember the 30th anniversary of the murder of  Mulugeta Seraw and 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s  assassination, I would like to acknowledge the many organizations in  Oregon that fight for peace and justice every day on behalf of  marginalized communities. I would like to especially acknowledge  members of these communities who are resilient and strong. I stand with  them today and every day.   In a few weeks, Oregonians will come together to remember and  celebrate the life of Mulugeta Seraw during a 30th year commemoration  conference organized by the Urban League of Portland. I am honored to  add to this remembrance with this Congressional Record. May Mulugeta  and his story never be forgotten, and may we remember, learn, and  change.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  sesquicentennial of Lincoln High School in Portland, OR.   One of the oldest and most celebrated public secondary schools west  of the Mississippi River, Lincoln was established in 1869, a decade  after Oregon's founding. Originally known as Portland High School, it  was eventually renamed in honor of President Abraham Lincoln. Currently  located in the Goose Hollow neighborhood of Southwest Portland, Lincoln  High School has moved four times over the past 150 years and is  currently planning a fifth campus to accommodate its growing student  body.   Lincoln High School's college preparatory program has graduated  generations of Oregon students. Over 60 faculty members oversee and  implement a wealth of academic and extracurricular opportunities,  including enhanced and advanced coursework in literature, the social  sciences, foreign languages, mathematics, and physical and life  sciences. Lincoln offers a celebrated international baccalaureate  program, in addition to a full Spanish immersion program.   Outside the classroom, Lincoln's Constitution Team has won 23 State  championships and six national titles. Its speech and debate team ranks  among the top in the State, and its mock trial team competes  nationally. The school's student newspaper ``The Cardinal Times'' is  the oldest continuously published high school paper on the West Coast.  Lincoln's magazine ``Beyond the Flock'' and its Spanish-language  magazine ``Puno y Letro'' add to the school's rich and diverse literary  tradition. Lincoln's student athletes have brought home 38 State  championships in a variety of sports. Seventy-seven student-led clubs  and unions serve the larger Portland community and demonstrate  Lincoln's commitment to an inclusive, engaged, and diverse student  body.   Lincoln students are dedicated to fostering an open and welcoming  community for all and have committed to carrying those values forth  into 2019, the school's 150th year. For 150 years, Lincoln High School  has inspired generations of global thinkers who have bettered their  communities in the Cardinal spirit of academic and civic engagement.   I rise to acknowledge the significant contribution of Lincoln High  School to the State of Oregon and the Nation as a whole and to offer my  congratulations to the students, faculty, and alumni on the occasion of  its sesquicentennial.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wildlife  Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act which will work to protect  threatened or endangered species, reduce human rights violations, and  limit the illegal operations of international criminal organizations.  [[Page S6821]]    This bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort, sponsored in the  House of Representatives by Representative Madeleine Bordallo and  Representative Don Young, and I look forward to growing its support in  the Senate.   Conservation violations and wildlife trafficking offenses are a  global problem threatening biodiversity and animal welfare and  facilitating significant criminal operations. Tackling this broad  problem is complicated and compounded by insufficient penalties for  offenders and the difficulty of maintaining U.S.-oversight on the  global level.   This bill proposes to address these concerns by criminalizing  elements of wildlife-trafficking operations under Federal racketeering  and organized crime statutes. Classifying wildlife-trafficking crimes  as ``predicate offenses'' under the Money Laundering Statute, Travel  Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act enables  prosecutors to administer substantial fines and prison-time for  violations.   The bill recognizes the value of whistleblowers' information to  direct investigations into wildlife-trafficking violations. It  establishes a procedure to secure valuable, useful information from  informants and provide sufficient compensation for the risks these  individuals make to blow the whistle on illegal operations. To do so,  the bill redirects penalty payments from wildlife-trafficking  violations to fund whistleblower compensation programs. Monetary  rewards to wildlife-crime whistleblowers come from partial share of  penalty paid to the U.S. Government, providing no additional expense to  American taxpayers.   The bill empowers Federal wildlife agents to operate abroad and  provides them with direction to collaborate with local authorities. It  instructs the Secretary of the Interior to adopt an International  Wildlife Conservation Program consisting of four components: a regional  component providing for protection of natural range habitats; a species  component focusing conservation on most vulnerable species; an anti- trafficking component to curtail demand and limit poaching; and a  convention component to implement the Convention on International Trade  in the Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, CITES.   The legislation seeks to expand the Marine Turtle Act of 2004 by  extending the legislation's coverage to include U.S. territories, and  increasing the Act's scope to cover marine and freshwater turtles as  well as tortoises.   Additionally, the bill proposes to strengthen the Marine Mammal  Protection Act of 1972 and the Shark-Finning Measure under the  Magnuson-Stevens Act by establishing that fines associated with  violating these acts are to be used to benefit the same species that  were affected.   Of particular concern to fishermen and women up and down the coasts,  the bill addresses illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing  violations by considering serious abuses as violations of Federal money  laundering laws and therefore subjecting violators to substantial  penalties.   Protecting wildlife requires a unified and strategic approach to end  poaching worldwide. Congress must aggressively counter the relentless  activities of poachers, traffickers, and transnational criminal  organizations. The Wildlife Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act is a  strong response to crimes against wildlife; it will provide the  necessary tools to curtail these illicit activities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wildlife  Conservation and Anti-Trafficking Act which will work to protect  threatened or endangered species, reduce human rights violations, and  limit the illegal operations of international criminal organizations.
