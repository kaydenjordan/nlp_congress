 Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Casey,  Gillibrand, Hassan, and Whitehouse to introduce the Layoff Prevention  Act of 2017. This bill renews and extends Federal support for State  short-time compensation--or work sharing--programs, which help avert  layoffs and the economic effects of long-term unemployment.   Work sharing is a proven concept that is endorsed by economists  across the political spectrum. When business slows down, employers feel  pressure to lay off employees. Under work sharing, employers may  instead opt to reduce hours across-the-board, and employees may then  collect a pro-rata unemployment compensation check for the hours they  lost. This prevents layoffs, lowers employers' rehiring and training  expenses, and costs States only a fraction of what they would pay if  workers went on full unemployment.   The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 included my  Layoff Prevention Act, which modernized  [[Page S4427]]  Federal work sharing laws. Partly as a result of this increased Federal  support for work sharing, State work sharing programs helped to save  over 130,000 jobs between 2012 and the expiration of Federal incentives  in 2015.   The legislation I am introducing today would renew incentives so that  States with existing work sharing programs, and those considering  enacting a program, can qualify for Federal support. Our economy has  come a long way in recent years, and we should invest in proven  programs like work sharing to ensure we do not experience again the  same scale of job loss that we endured during the Great Recession.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this bill to  keep American workers on the job, save taxpayers money, and provide  employers with a practical, positive, and cost-effective alternative to  layoffs.                                  ______                                     By Mr. LEE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Heller, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr.  Daines, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Gardner, and Mr. Franken):   S. 1654. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to update the  privacy protections for electronic communications information that is  stored by third-party service providers in order to protect consumer  privacy interests while meeting law enforcement needs, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.   Mr. Leahy. Six years ago, Senator Lee and I first joined together to  reform our outdated digital privacy laws. We recognized that our  Nation's privacy rules failed to account for how we live our lives  today and provided little protection for Americans' electronic  information.   Most Americans are shocked to learn that a law dating back to the  Reagan administration governs when the government can read their emails  and texts, view their photos, obtain their location information, and  even inspect their Internet browsing history. Thirty-one years ago, I  led efforts to write the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA).  At the time, computers were an emerging technology and there was little  understanding of the Internet, let alone cloud computing. ECPA was  significant and forward-looking legislation in 1986, but it was not  intended to get us through 30 years of technological innovations.  Modern technology and digital communications have transformed our  society. It is past time for Congress to catch up.   ECPA no longer makes any sense in our digital world. When Senator Lee  and I first set out to modernize the statute, we focused on one  critical reform: enacting a clear, uniform rule that the government  must obtain a warrant supported by probable cause whenever it seeks the  content of our emails, texts, photos, and other electronic documents  stored in the cloud. This is what the Constitution requires; and this  is what Vermonters, Utahns, and Americans across the Country expect.   But even in the six years since we first introduced legislation to  reform ECPA, it has become increasingly clear that broader reforms are  necessary to ensure that the statute adequately addresses the privacy  and technological challenges of the modern world. When the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held in 2010 that email was fully  protected by the Fourth Amendment, the court cautioned that ``the  Fourth Amendment must keep pace with the inexorable march of  technological progress, or its guarantees will wither and perish.'' The  bill we introduce today would ensure our laws keep pace.   The ECPA Modernization Act of 2017 introduces a broad set of reforms  to our digital privacy statutes. Like legislation we introduced in  previous Congresses, this bill would create a foundational requirement  that the government obtain a warrant when it seeks the content of our  electronic communications from third-party service providers. The bill  also goes further by addressing the unique privacy concerns associated  with Americans' location information. Following the example set by  States like Vermont, Utah, and California, our bill would require that  the government obtain a warrant when it seeks stored or real-time  location information from third-party service providers, or uses IMSI- catchers or stingrays to get location data from individuals' own cell  phones.   The ECPA Modernization Act additionally would require law enforcement  to notify individuals when their communications or location information  is obtained from third-party service providers. The bill would also add  new privacy protections related to government requests for customer  records and metadata; a suppression remedy for illegally obtained  electronic data; and reform the pen register and trap and trace device  statutes to bring them in line with other laws.   Senator Lee and I are proud to introduce this bill with the support  of a broad range of stakeholders, including the Center for Democracy &  Technology, the ACLU, the Constitution Project, New America's Open  Technology Institute, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American  Library Association, the R Street Institute, TechFreedom, FreedomWorks,  Google, Engine, BSA/The Software Alliance, and many others.   Today Senator Lee and I are also introducing the Email Privacy Act,  companion legislation to the bill introduced in the House of  Representatives by Congressmen Yoder and Polis. The Email Privacy Act  passed the House by voice vote earlier this year, and received an  overwhelming 419 to 0 vote last congress. I commend Representatives  Yoder and Polis for their efforts, and also commend House Judiciary  Committee Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers for reaching a  historic compromise that led to unanimous support for this bill in the  House.   When the House passed the Email Privacy Act last year, I was hopeful  that the Senate would follow suit to protect Americans' digital privacy  and swiftly pass the bill so that it would be enacted into law. I was  disappointed when instead of working in a bipartisan fashion, certain  Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee threatened to use it as a  vehicle to push poison pill amendments on controversial National  security matters, effectively killing the bill for their own political  purposes.   The Email Privacy Act is a good bill that is unanimously supported by  the House of Representatives. That legislation does not include all the  reforms that I believe are necessary to bring our digital privacy laws  into the modern age, but it takes a significant step toward ensuring  that ECPA complies with the Fourth Amendment by requiring a warrant  whenever the government seeks the contents of Americans' emails and  electronic communication. I have worked for years to see this critical  reform implemented into law, and I will take every opportunity to see  that it reaches the President's desk.   But make no mistake: I believe our work must not stop there.  Americans deserve Fourth Amendment protections for their location  information, notice when law enforcement obtains their content or  location data, and strong protections governing the acquisition of  metadata and records. I will keep fighting for the protections we have  now set forth in the ECPA Modernization Act. I will keep pushing the  Senate to advance legislation that keeps pace with Americans'  expectations of privacy. The American people expect these protections,  and they deserve them.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 1658. A bill to amend the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical  Education Act of 2006 to give the Department of Education the authority  to award competitive grants to eligible entities to establish, expand,  or support school-based mentoring programs to assist at-risk students  in middle school and high school in developing cognitive and social- emotional skills to prepare them for success in high school,  postsecondary education, and the workforce; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.   Mr. DURBIN, Mr. President, today I introduce the Mentoring to Succeed  Act, a bill that would break down the walls of access and meet at-risk  youth where they are, in school, to give them the support and guidance  they need to be successful.   Barriers such as childhood poverty, inadequate schools, chronic  absenteeism, adverse childhood experiences,  [[Page S4428]]  community violence, exclusionary discipline policies, and juvenile  justice involvement can lead to poor academic achievement and life  outcomes. Students who grow up facing these challenges without a strong  support system often struggle to transition to high school, college,  and the workforce. School-based mentoring programs are an effective  strategy to help at-risk students thrive in school, careers, and life.   According to a 2014 study, there are an estimated 16 million young  people, including 9 million at-risk youth, who will reach the age of 19  without ever having a mentor. As a result, these youth will miss out on  the powerful effects of mentoring that are linked to significant  outcomes. Youth who have mentors are 52 percent less likely to skip a  day of school; 55 percent more likely to be enrolled in college; 81  percent more likely to participate regularly in sports or  extracurricular activities; 78 percent more likely to volunteer  regularly in their communities; and 130 percent more likely to hold  leadership positions.   Researchers at the University of Chicago found that Youth Guidance's  school-based mentoring program, Becoming a Man, reduced arrests for  violent crime, improved school engagement, and increased high school  graduation rates.   Mentoring programs can help youth develop the skills employers are  seeking. A 2016 study found that 8 in 10 employers say social and  emotional skills are the most important to success, and are the most  difficult skills to find in job applicants.   In Illinois, an estimated 55,000 youth are formally matched with a  mentor, with 68 percent residing in Metro Chicago. Last year, it cost  the State of Illinois an average of $172,000 to incarcerate one youth,  compared to an average of $6,000 for one youth in an intensive youth  development program, and only $2,300 per youth in a formal mentoring  program. In 2012, the University of Chicago Crime Lab found that  benefits to society compared to mentoring program costs in Illinois  measured as high as $31 for every $1 dollar invested.   Lakeisha Steele, a member of my staff that has been working on this  issue, is a testament to the powerful effect mentorship can have. She  lost her oldest brother, Lewis Williams III, to gun violence on July  10, 1996. He was 24 years old and studying to become a welder while  preparing for the birth of his only son, his namesake, who would be  born a month after his death. The loss of her brother's life rocked  Lakeisha's family to its core. There were limited resources in her  community (she is from Kankakee, Illinois) and her family could not  afford to see a grief counselor. She went through her freshman year  grieving the loss of her brother and it impacted her school work. A  once A-student brought home Cs and Ds. She credits her high school  guidance counselor, Paul Meyer of Kankakee High School, for helping her  cope with the trauma of losing her brother and keeping her focused on  her education and future. She says she wouldn't be here today without  his mentorship.   The Mentoring to Succeed Act would help break down the barriers that  make it difficult for far too many of our children and youth to  succeed, especially our students of color. This bill would provide  high-need school districts, schools, and local governments with the  funding they need to create, expand, and support school-based mentoring  programs to improve the academic, social, and workforce skills of at- risk students. It would support partnerships with non-profit,  community-based, and faith-based organizations to serve more at-risk  students. In addition, it would support youth job training by  partnering with local businesses and private companies to provide at- risk students with internships and career exploration activities.  Further, this bill would provide funding to train mentors on trauma and  toxic stress to increase student resilience and promote social and  emotional development.   Last year, the City of Chicago announced a bold and innovative  mentoring initiative to help Chicago's most at-risk youth. By the year  2018, the City's goal is to reach 7,200 8th, 9th, and 10th grade boys  in 22 of Chicago's highest poverty and highest violence neighborhoods.   This bill would support the City of Chicago and other local  governments, schools, and school districts who have undertaken efforts  to help at-risk youth by creating or expanding school-based mentoring  programs. I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Tammy Duckworth  from Illinois for joining me in this effort. I hope my other colleagues  will join me to strengthen investments in school-based mentoring  programs to help at-risk youth develop the academic, social, and  workforce skills that lead to success.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1658         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
