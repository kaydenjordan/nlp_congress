 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  1107, I call up the bill (H.R. 2694) to eliminate discrimination and  promote women's health and economic security by ensuring reasonable  workplace accommodations for workers whose ability to perform the  functions of a job are limited by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related  medical condition, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2694, the Pregnant  Workers Fairness Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  might consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act. No one should have to choose between financial security  and a healthy pregnancy. Unfortunately, our pregnancy  antidiscrimination laws urgently need to be updated to provide  reasonable accommodations for workers.   Current Federal law does not clearly guarantee pregnant workers'  rights to reasonable accommodations in the workplace, such as water,  seating, bathroom breaks, and lifting restrictions. These basic  protections are critical to protecting pregnant workers from the tragic  consequences of unsafe working conditions, and they are particularly  important today, as early evidence suggests that pregnancy leads to  elevated risk of severe illness from COVID-19.   In 2015, the Supreme Court allowed pregnant workers to bring claims  for  [[Page H4510]]  reasonable accommodations under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in the  landmark case of Young v. UPS. However, that decision set an  unreasonably high standard for pregnancy discrimination. Under the  Young standard, workers must prove that the accommodations they were  denied were provided to other workers who were similar in their  inability to work.   This standard is onerous, in part, because it assumes that workers  can access their coworkers' personal health information and establish a  comparable group of workers. It also creates a perverse legal framework  in which companies that treat all of their workers poorly can treat  their pregnant workers poorly as well.   Since the Young decision, courts have ruled against pregnant workers  seeking accommodations most of the time.   In the absence of Federal action, nearly three dozen States and  localities have filled the void by establishing their own protections  for pregnant workers. This patchwork approach is bad for workers who  are frequently left without strong protections and bad for multistate  employers who have to comply with different States' workplace  standards.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a bipartisan proposal that will  finally establish clear, nationwide protections that guarantee pregnant  workers the basic rights to reasonable accommodations.   It will also grant victims of pregnancy discrimination the same  remedies as victims of discrimination on the basis of race, color,  religion, sex, or national origin under Federal civil rights laws.  Similar to the Americans with Disabilities Act, employers are not  required to make accommodations if it imposes an undue hardship on the  employer's business.   This legislation has broad support across the political spectrum and  across our communities. Labor unions, civil rights groups, and the  business community, including the Chamber of Commerce, have all  endorsed this proposal.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter led by the nonprofit  A Better Balance and over 200 worker advocacy organizations calling for  Congress to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.                                                 September 14, 2020.      Re Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.        Dear Member of Congress: As organizations committed to       promoting the health and economic security of our nation's       families, we urge you to support the Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act, a crucial maternal and infant health measure.       This bipartisan legislation promotes healthy pregnancies and       economic security for pregnant women and their families and       strengthens the economy.        In the last few decades, there has been a dramatic       demographic shift in the workforce. Not only do women now       make up almost half of the workforce, but there are more       pregnant workers than ever before and they are working later       into their pregnancies. The simple reality is that some of       these women--especially those in physically demanding jobs--      will have a medical need for a temporary job-related       accommodation in order to maintain a healthy pregnancy. Yet,       too often, instead of providing a pregnant worker with an       accommodation, her employer will fire her or push her onto       unpaid leave, depriving her of a paycheck and health       insurance at a time when she needs them most.        Additionally, pregnancy discrimination affects women across       race and ethnicity, but women of color and immigrants may be       at particular risk. Latinas, Black women and immigrant women       are more likely to hold certain inflexible and physically       demanding jobs that can present specific challenges for       pregnant workers, such as cashiers, home health aides, food       service workers, and cleaners, making reasonable       accommodations on the job even more important, and loss of       wages and health insurance due to pregnancy discrimination       especially challenging. American families and the American       economy depend on women's income: we cannot afford to force       pregnant women out of work.        In 2015, in Young v. United Parcel Service, the Supreme       Court held that a failure to make accommodations for pregnant       workers with medical needs will sometimes violate the       Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA). Yet, even after       Young, pregnant workers are still not getting the       accommodations they need to stay safe and healthy on the job       and employers lack clarity as to their obligations under the       law. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act will provide a clear,       predictable rule: employers must provide reasonable       accommodations for limitations arising out of pregnancy,       childbirth, or related medical conditions, unless this would       pose an undue hardship.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is modeled after the       Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and offers employers       and employees a familiar reasonable accommodation framework       to follow. Under the ADA, workers with disabilities enjoy       clear statutory protections and need not prove how other       employees are treated in order to obtain necessary       accommodations. Pregnant workers deserve the same clarity and       streamlined process and should not have to ascertain how       their employer treats others in order to understand their own       accommodation rights, as the Supreme Court's ruling currently       requires.        Evidence from states and cities that have adopted laws       similar to the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act suggests that       providing this clarity reduces lawsuits and, most       importantly, helps ensure that women can obtain necessary       reasonable accommodations in a timely manner, which keeps       pregnant women healthy and earning an income when they need       it most. No woman should have to choose between providing for       her family and maintaining a healthy pregnancy, and the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act would ensure that all women       working for covered employers would be protected.        The need for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is       recognized across ideological and partisan lines. Thirty       states and D.C. have adopted pregnant worker fairness       measures with broad, and often unanimous, bipartisan support.       Twenty-five of those laws have passed within the last seven       years. These states include: Alaska, California, Colorado,       Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,       Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New       Mexico, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North       Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee,       Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Vermont, Virginia, and       Washington. Lawmakers have concluded that accommodating       pregnant workers who need it is a measured approach grounded       in family values and basic fairness.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is necessary because it       promotes long-term economic security and workplace fairness.       When accommodations allow pregnant women to continue to work,       they can maintain income and seniority, while forced leave       sets new mothers back with lost wages and missed advancement       opportunities. When pregnant women are fired, not only do       they and their families lose critical income, but they must       fight extra hard to re-enter a job market that is especially       brutal on the unemployed and on pregnant women.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is vital because it       supports healthy pregnancies. The choice between risking a       job and risking the health of a pregnancy is one no one       should have to make. Women who cannot perform some aspects of       their usual duties without risking their own health or the       health of their pregnancy, but whose families cannot afford       to lose their income, may continue working under dangerous       conditions. There are health consequences to pushing women       out of the workforce as well. Stress from job loss can       increase the risk of having a premature baby and/or a baby       with low birth weight. In addition, women who are not forced       to use their leave during pregnancy may have more leave       available to take following childbirth, which in turn       facilitates breastfeeding, bonding with and caring for a new       child, and recovering from childbirth.        For all of these reasons, we urge you to support the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.        We also welcome the opportunity to provide you with       additional information.

Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Nadler and  Mr. Katko for their leadership on this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the sponsor of this legislation  and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), the lead Republican sponsor of the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, section 702 is not repealed by this law, and according  to the Congressional Research Service, which studied this issue, all in  all, State statutes providing for pregnancy accommodation generally  incorporate generalized longstanding religious exemptions. In most  cases, exemptions allow religious institutions to favor coreligionists.  States typically do not enact separate or specialized religious  exemptions for pregnancy accommodation laws.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human  Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), the chair of the  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), a member of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Schrier), a distinguished member of  the Education and Labor Committee.    Madam Speaker, can you advise how much time is  remaining on each side?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the chair of the  Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related  Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a distinguished member of the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the chair of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in support of the  legislation from the National WIC Association, that is Women, Infants,  and Children Association, in favor of the legislation, and another  letter from the ACLU, the American Civil Liberties Union.     National WIC Association Letter in Support of H.R. 2694, Pregnant                            Workers Fairness Act         On behalf of the National WIC Association, the 12,000 WIC       state and local service provider agencies we represent, and       the over six million mothers, babies, and young children our       members serve, we enthusiastically support passage of the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694). The accommodations       established by this bill are urgently needed to assure       healthy pregnancies for working mothers served by WIC.        WIC providers serve approximately half of all babies born       in the United States with nutrition support and counseling       throughout pregnancy, the postpartum period, and early       childhood. WIC's nutrition intervention has successfully       supported positive birth outcomes by reducing preterm birth       and other complications that can lead to lifelong health       conditions and significant healthcare costs. Nutrition--      including adequate hydration--is vital for the health of a       pregnancy, but additional protections are needed to address       the factors that influence pregnancy and birth outcomes       beyond nutrition.        This bill wisely extends the workplace accommodations       framework--first developed in the Americans with Disabilities       Act (ADA)--to ensure that employers are taking reasonable       steps to minimize risks to employees' pregnancies. Simple       modifications to the workplace such as a stool to sit on,       relief from heavy lifting, or a water bottle to carry can       contribute to the health of the pregnancy without taking       drastic action that inhibits the pregnant worker's economic       security, such as unpaid leave or termination. This balanced       and effective approach, already familiar to employers from       the ADA context, will work in tandem with other medical and       nutrition precautions to ensure positive birth outcomes and       healthy infants.        Women now constitute the majority of the American       workforce. Three-quarters of working women are expected to be       both pregnant and employed during their adult lives. Without       a clear legal standard, pregnant workers may be forced to       choose between keeping a roof over their head, putting food       on the table, and the health of their pregnancy. This burden       is even more acute for the approximately twenty percent of       working woment--a total of 15.2 million women--who live in       households that earn less than 185 percent of the federal       poverty line, which is the income threshold for WIC       participation. Of these 15.2 million women, 59 percent       (approximately nine million) are working part-time.        No pregnant worker should have to choose between the health       of their pregnancy and their livelihood. As direct-service       providers that support almost two million pregnant and       postpartum women, the WIC community strongly supports efforts       that advance sensible policy to safeguard the health of       pregnancies. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a       thoughtful solution that will complement WIC's tireless       efforts to support expectant mothers as they seek a healthy       start for their babies. We urge swift passage of this       critical legislation.            Sincerely,                                         Rev. Douglas Greenaway,                                                    President & CEO,      National WIC Association.                                   ____                                                 September 11, 2020.      Re Vote YES for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R.           2694).        Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the American Civil       Liberties Union, and our more than 8 million members,       supporters, and activists, we write to express our support       for H.R. 2694, the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This       critical legislation would combat an all-too-common form of       pregnancy discrimination while also providing employers much-      needed clarity on their obligations under the law. We urge       all members of the House of Representatives to vote in favor       of this measured, bipartisan, and long-overdue legislation       and to oppose the motion to recommit.        The ACLU has long fought to advance women's equality and       opportunity by challenging laws and policies that       discriminate against women in the workplace and by       dismantling the stereotypes that constrain women's full       engagement and participation at work. Although the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act has played a critical role over the past       40 years in securing women's place in the workforce, too many       women continue to be marginalized at work because of their       decision to become pregnant and have children. This kind of       discriminatory treatment has become most obvious when       pregnant workers--predominantly women in physically demanding       or male-dominated jobs, low-wage workers, and women of       color--request temporary accommodations to address a medical       need and instead are terminated or placed on unpaid leave,       causing devastating economic harm. The Pregnant Workers       Fairness Act would address this problem by requiring       employers with fifteen or more employees to provide       reasonable and temporary accommodations to pregnant workers       if doing so would not impose an undue hardship on the       business.          Pregnancy Discrimination, the PDA, and Young v. UPS, Inc.         Pregnancy and childbirth are often locus points for       discrimination against women in the workforce. Policies       excluding or forcing the discharge of pregnant women from the       workplace were common in the 1970s and reflected the       stereotype that a woman's primary or sole duties were to be a       homemaker and raise children. The adoption of the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act (PDA) in 1978, an amendment to Title VII       of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, established that       discrimination because of ``pregnancy, childbirth, and       related medical conditions'' was a form of discrimination       ``because of sex.'' It was intended to dismantle the       stereotype, and the policies based on it, that viewed       pregnant women's labor force participation as contingent,       temporary, and dispensable without regard to their individual       capacity to do the job in question.  [[Page H4522]]         The PDA also required employers to treat pregnant workers       the same as other temporarily disabled workers because       Congress recognized that working women contributed to their       families' economic stability and should not have to choose       between a career and continuing a pregnancy. Despite the PDA,       pregnancy discrimination persists, and for many years courts       routinely ruled against workers who brought pregnancy       accommodation cases where they alleged discrimination when an       employer provided a job modification to an employee       temporarily unable to work but failed to do the same for a       pregnant worker.        In Young v United Parcel Service, Inc., the Supreme Court       granted certiorari to resolve a split in the Circuits and for       the first time addressed the PDA's application in the context       of an employee who needed an accommodation due to pregnancy.       The Court concluded that the statute's mandate applied with       equal force in these circumstances and articulated a modified       analysis for failure-to-accommodate cases. The Court also       offered a new pretext analysis that plaintiffs may rely on       when litigating claims under the PDA's second clause. Since       Young, the reflexive approval of employer policies favoring       workers with occupational injuries has largely disappeared.       However, the bright-line deference to employer policies, and       the overbroad reading of such policies as ``pregnancy-      blind,'' has been replaced, in many instances, with an unduly       demanding standard for plaintiffs in making a showing of       differential treatment--even at the initial pleading stage,       prior to having the benefit of discovery. This trend       undermines Young's intent of demanding that employers justify       failures to accommodate pregnancy. Instead, they impose       unwarranted--and often insurmountable--burdens of proof on       pregnant workers that increasingly confer ``least favored       nation'' status on the protected trait of pregnancy. The       stories of clients the ACLU has represented--both as direct       counsel and as lead amicus--illustrate the harm:        Lochren v. Suffolk County: Sandra Lochren and five other       police officers sued the Suffolk County Police Department       (SCPD) for refusing to temporarily reassign pregnant officers       to deskwork and other non-patrol jobs, even though it did so       for officers injured on the job. But for those officers who       opted to keep working patrol,        SCPD also failed to provide bulletproof vests or gun belts       that would fit pregnant officers. Their only safe option was       to go on unpaid long before their due dates.        Cole v. SavaSeniorCare: When Jaimie Cole, a certified       nursing assistant, was in her third trimester, she developed       a high risk of preeclampsia, a condition that can lead to       preterm labor or even death. Her doctor advised her not to do       any heavy lifting. Cole's job required her to regularly help       patients in and out of bed and assist with bathing, so she       asked for a temporary light duty assignment. Instead, her       employer sent her home without pay for the rest of her       pregnancy.        Myers v. Hope Healthcare Center: Asia Myers, a certified       nursing assistant, experienced complications early in her       pregnancy and was told by her doctor that she could continue       to work, but should not do any lifting on the job. Although       her employer had a history of providing light duty to workers       with temporary lifting restrictions, Myers was told not to       return to work until her restrictions were lifted. She was       out of work for over a month with no income or health       insurance coverage.        Hicks v. City of Tuscaloosa: Stephanie Hicks, a narcotics       investigator with the Tuscaloosa Police Department in       Alabama, wanted to breastfeed her new baby, but her       bulletproof vest was restrictive, painful, and prone to       causing infection in her breasts. She asked for a desk job       but her employer refused, even though it routinely granted       desk jobs to officers unable to fulfill all of their patrol       duties. Instead, it offered her an ill-fitting vest that put       her at risk.        Legg v. Ulster County: Corrections Officer Ann Marie Legg       was denied light duty during her pregnancy, even though       Ulster County gave such assignments to guards injured on the       job. In her third trimester, Legg had to intervene in a       fight, prompting her to go on leave rather than face future       risks.        Allen v. AT&T Mobility: Cynthia Allen lost her job because       she accumulated too many ``points'' under AT&T Mobility's       punitive attendance policy due to pregnancy-related symptoms       such as nausea. The policy makes accommodation for late       arrivals, early departures, and absences due to thirteen       enumerated reasons, some medical and some not, but none due       to pregnancy and pregnancy-related symptoms.        Durham v. Rural/Metro Corp.: Michelle Durham was an EMT in       Alabama whose job often required her to lift patients on       stretchers into an ambulance. When she became pregnant, her       health care provider imposed a restriction on heavy lifting.       Durham asked Rural/Metro for a temporary modified duty       assignment during her pregnancy, but was rejected, despite       the company's policy of giving such assignments to others.       She was told her only option was to take unpaid leave.        It is indisputable that Young was an important step forward       to combat pregnancy discrimination. Yet, too many pregnant       workers continue to face insurmountable obstacles in HR       offices, where employers misunderstand their obligations       under the PDA, and in courtrooms across the country, where       judges use Young to hinder access to needed accommodations.       Despite the clear mandates of the PDA, the current legal       landscape leaves exposed and unprotected those pregnant       workers who want to continue working while maintaining a       healthy pregnancy.        Similarly, many pregnant workers have not found protection       or recourse under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990       because absent complications, pregnancy is not considered a       disability that substantially limits a major life activity.       This legal reality means that many of the symptoms of a       normal pregnancy that can disrupt a worker's ability to do       her job such as extreme fatigue, morning sickness, or       limitations on her mobility are not entitled to       accommodation. Moreover, many pregnant workers seek       accommodation precisely because they wish to avoid the       conditions that might disable them or endanger their       pregnancy. Yet because the ADA is so expansive with respect       to other conditions that qualify as disabilities, the       population of non-pregnant workers entitled to reasonable       accommodation is exponentially larger than when the PDA was       enacted more than 40 years ago. Accordingly, without such       express entitlement to accommodation, pregnant workers face       an untenable ``least favored nation'' status in the       workplace.        The simple solution to this no-win situation is the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This legislation, modeled       after the ADA and using a framework familiar to most       employers, takes a thoughtful and measured approach to       balancing the needs of working people and employers by       requiring businesses with fifteen or more employees to       provide workers with temporary, reasonable accommodation for       known limitations related to pregnancy, childbirth, or       related medical conditions if doing so would not place an       undue hardship on business. It also prohibits employers from       forcing a pregnant employee to take a leave of absence if a       reasonable accommodation can be provided; prevents employers       from denying job opportunities to an applicant or employee       because of the individual's need for a reasonable       accommodation; prevents an employer from forcing an applicant       or employee to accept a specific accommodation; and prohibits       retaliation against individuals who seek to use PWFA to       protect their rights.        At a time when women constitute nearly 60 percent of the       workforce and contribute significantly to their families'       economic well-being, passage of PWFA is a dire necessity.       When a pregnant worker is forced to quit, coerced into taking       unpaid leave, or fired because her employer refuses to       provide a temporary job modification, the economic impact can       be severe; if she is the sole or primary breadwinner for her       children, as nearly half of working women are, her entire       family will be without an income when they most need it. She       further may be denied unemployment benefits because she is       considered to have left her job voluntarily. She may have few       if any additional resources on which to rely. PWFA ensures       that women would not face such devastating consequences.       Instead, it treats pregnancy for what it is--a normal       condition of employment.        PWFA promotes women's health. Accommodations make a       'difference in physically demanding jobs (requiring long       hours, standing, lifting heavy objects, etc.) where the risk       of preterm delivery and low birth weight are significant. The       failure to provide accommodations can be linked to       miscarriages and premature babies who suffer from a variety       of ailments. This bill would be an important contribution in       the fight to improve maternal health and mortality.        There is also a strong business case for PWFA. Providing       pregnant employees with reasonable accommodations increases       worker productivity, retention, and morale, and reduces       health care costs associated with pregnancy complications.       PWFA can also reduce litigation costs by providing greater       clarity regarding an employer's legal obligations to pregnant       workers. In fact, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stated that       PWFA would establish ``clear guidelines and a balanced       process that works for employers and employees alike.''       Additionally, a group of leading private sector employers       expressed their support for PWFA and noted ``women's labor       force participation is critical to the strength of our       companies, the growth of our economy and the financial       security of most modern families.''        Finally, 30 states across the political and ideological       spectrum have recognized the benefits of providing reasonable       accommodations to pregnant workers. Congress should ensure       that all pregnant workers, not just some, have the       protections they need.        It is time for Congress to act and pass the Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act.            Sincerely,      Ronald Newman,        National Political Director.      Gillian Thomas,        Senior Staff Attorney.      Vania Leveille,        Senior Legislative Counsel.    Madam Speaker, as I am sure each person in  this Chamber can agree, it is simply unacceptable that many pregnant  workers have to choose between their paycheck and a healthy pregnancy  because they cannot access reasonable accommodations to continue  working safely.  [[Page H4523]]    As my colleagues have pointed out, most accommodations, which can  include water, seating, and more frequent restroom breaks, are not  complex or costly. Yet without these simple accommodations, health  risks to pregnant workers can be significant and potentially tragic.   The COVID-19 pandemic poses increased risks for pregnant workers at a  time when pregnant women comprise 62 percent of frontline workers,  including more than 75 percent of healthcare workers.   Passing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act today, we can take a strong  bipartisan step to guarantee that all pregnant workers have access to  basic workplace protections.   Madam Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support the  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  motion.    Madam Speaker, first, let me just restate what  I said about the Congressional Research Service that found that States  typically do not enact separate or specialized religious exemptions for  pregnancy accommodation laws.   Madam Speaker, this MTR would jeopardize women's health and risk  their pregnancies in order to provide a religious exemption for  employers, to exempt them from the requirement to provide just basic  and reasonable accommodations for the workforce. Exactly who would want  them to deny these basic accommodations?    First, it is unnecessary. The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act already  exempts small private employers, including religious employers, with  fewer than 15 employees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  80 percent of religious organizations have fewer than 10 employees.   Second, the underlying bill does not in any way amend or change the  underlying exemptions in title VII of the Civil Rights Act or Americans  with Disabilities Act or any other bill. It doesn't affect the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But it would, if it is specified in  this bill, give the employer the idea that they could deny reasonable  accommodations if they for some religious reason don't agree with the  pregnancy: women who are pregnant and divorced, women pregnant out of  wedlock, pregnant in a same-sex relationship.   What, you don't have to give them a water break?   This amendment is unnecessary. The other exemptions are there for  legitimate religious reasons, and this overbroad amendment would just  cause mischief.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Wild).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
