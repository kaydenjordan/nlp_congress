 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, the GOP's awful,  irresponsible healthcare bill will impose an age tax on older  Americans, it will raise your premiums, and it will be absolutely  disastrous to our Nation's hospitals.   In my district in New York, our hospitals serve millions of people  every day, and their budgets are already stretched. The GOP healthcare  bill will rip away health insurance for over 24 million Americans,  forcing more people to get care in high-cost emergency rooms while, at  the same time, cutting billions in Federal funding hospitals need to  survive.   New York's hospitals will lose over $1 billion in 2018 alone. With  uncompensated care already skyrocketing, the 27 New York hospitals that  are already on a financial distress watch list tell me they may not  even be able to survive. That is why the Greater New York Hospital  Association, the Healthcare Association of New York State, and other  New York health groups are urging all of us to vote ``no'' on this  terrible GOP bill.                            ____________________
