 Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from  Vermont for yielding and my colleague from Alaska, as well, for  allowing me to interrupt their very important and bipartisan debate.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Mr. President, 8 years ago, when Elena Kagan was nominated to the  Supreme Court, Senate Republicans said: We must get all of her  documents from the Clinton Library and have enough time to analyze them  so that we can determine whether she should be a Justice. The  Republican leadership did not say some of the documents; they did not  say a subset of the documents; they did not say the documents for just  one administrative job; they said all of her documents.   I showed this letter yesterday to my friend who is now the chairman  of the Judiciary, Senator Grassley. He said it is totally different. He  is a man of integrity, but I know there are times he gets twisted by  his leadership and the President to do things that aren't consistent,  and this is one of them.   The Republicans didn't ask only for certain documents. They asked for  all, and we are asking for all. This is one of the most important  positions in the world and certainly in America. Shouldn't we know  everything? It is not just some of the stuff and some of the stuff that  the White House wants us to know--but everything.   Our friends on the other side of the aisle demanded all of the  documents for Justice Kagan. The Democrats agreed. It was the right  thing to do. And because Elena Kagan had nothing to hide, she went  happily forward and said: Go right ahead. Now Republicans ought to do  the same thing for Judge Kavanaugh, particularly if he has nothing to  hide.   For the last week, Senator Feinstein has been ready to jointly  request the same documents of Judge Kavanaugh that Republicans demanded  of Justice Kagan, but our Republican colleagues are dragging their feet  and refusing to agree. They are the reason this whole activity has been  slowed down. It is not Democratic obstruction. It is the Democrats'  desire for transparency and openness that the Republicans are blocking.  They are being the obstructionists.   The Republicans' rationale is--they are downplaying Judge Kavanaugh's  role as White House Staff Secretary. They argue that we don't need to  see documents from that part of his career, although they have no  argument against it. They think we don't need them. We think we do. Why  not show them to us?   Here is what Judge Kavanaugh himself has said. He said that ``my 3  years as Staff Secretary for President Bush--were the most interesting  and in many ways the most instructive.''  [[Page S5318]]  Kavanaugh himself said that the very documents we want to see and  Republicans are blocking us from seeing are the most instructive.  Shouldn't the American people see the writings of what their own  nominee calls the most instructive?   As Staff Secretary, Kavanaugh said he ``participated in the process  of putting together legislation.'' He drafted and revised Executive  orders. He consulted on judicial nominations, including the replacement  of Chief Justice Rehnquist. Isn't that something we want to know--what  his thoughts were about who should be a Justice? Wouldn't that really  inform us of what kind of Justice he might be?   He was one of the most senior officials in the Bush White House, 1 of  only 17 out of hundreds of Presidential aides who were paid the maximum  White House salary. I am sure he deserved it. That is not the issue.  The issue is that he was an extremely high-ranking official there. This  is not looking at when he was some clerk. It was a major, defining part  of his career.   So here we go. Once again, Republicans are against transparency and  are against the full record for one of the world's most powerful  positions, which will last a lifetime. All of this stonewalling on  getting Judge Kavanaugh's records from his time as Staff Secretary  raises these looming questions: What are Judge Kavanaugh and the  Republicans hiding? Why are Republicans hiding his full record from the  Senate and the American people? What don't they want us to see? What  don't they want the American people to see? Is there something there so  damning that it might defeat Judge Kavanaugh's nomination? If there is,  we are entitled to see it. If there is not, then what is the problem  with moving forward?   Just last week, we saw our Republican colleagues defeat a judicial  nomination based on something that nominee wrote in college. Are they  really going to turn right around and say that the nominee for the  highest Court in the land doesn't need to release documents that he  wrote far later in his career when his views were far more formed?   This is about transparency. This is about making sure the Senate does  its job in the right, complete, and open way. Democrats have made a  completely reasonable request for documents--the same request we agreed  to when the shoe was on the other foot. We are being consistent. Our  Republican colleagues are being hypocritical. What was good for them in  the minority when President Obama nominated someone is good for us in  the minority when President Trump nominates someone. I will repeat the  old saying from the Farmers' Almanac and elsewhere: What is good for  the goose is good for the gander. It applies so, so well in this  situation.   Our request is eminently reasonable. The quickest way to get this  nomination moving forward is to get the documents and records, and it  is for Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley to agree to our request.   Mr. President, parenthetically, just today, we saw that the White  House doctored the transcript and, supposedly, the tape of what Mr.  Putin said right after the President and he met. It was sort of like an  autocratic country, a nondemocracy. That is what dictators do; they  change the facts and change the record. Are our Republican colleagues-- so many of them who have stood for transparency--going to join this  coverup of records and truth because they don't like the results? That  is not America. That is not the America the American people know and  love.                                Farmer Bailout    Mr. President, on the farmer bailout, yesterday, President Trump  announced a $12 billion bailout for farmers who have been hurt by the  President's economic policies. Obviously, the farmers are hurting or  the President wouldn't have done this.   The drawbacks of this particular policy aside, the bailout is another  example of the President chasing his own tail. It is becoming a  leitmotif in this administration: President Trump's impulsiveness and  incompetence, his lack of thoroughness and study of an issue, lead him  to act impulsively. He creates a massive problem, and then he is forced  to hastily contrive a way to make it look as if he is saving the day.   The irony of this policy should not be lost on anyone. The  President's bailout is like a Soviet-style program in which the  government props up an entire sector of the economy. That  characterization is one that I spoke of this morning to several  colleagues, and I have now been told one of my Republican colleagues  used the same characterization--Soviet-style program. The Freedom  Caucus, the Koch brothers--this is not what even the hard right in  America stands for.   Knowing this administration, they will design a bailout to help only  massive agribusinesses that will use the money for stock buybacks.  Knowing this administration, family farmers are likely to be left to  suffer.   It was not so long ago that our Republican friends complained  bitterly about picking winners and losers in the market. What is the  President doing here? He is picking winners and losers.   The President's policies have hurt scores of Americans. He proposes a  massive bailout in this case but tries to slash health insurance for  tens of millions of middle-class Americans. He pushes a bailout in this  case, but his budgets continue to decimate infrastructure, education,  healthcare, environmental protection, and more. I would say that is  picking winners and losers.   The President's bailout is another example of President Trump  lighting the fire and grabbing the nearest thing off the shelf to douse  it and then patting himself on the back as to what a great guy he has  been. It is not good policy, it is not good politics, and it is  incredibly telling of this administration's failure to anticipate the  consequences of its decisions.   One more point: If you talk to our farmers, they would rather have  long-term contracts and good markets. A bailout and storing all these  agricultural products on the shelves will lower prices and cause the  people we sell to overseas to find other suppliers and sign contracts  with them. In the long term, it is going to make things worse.   Where does the bailout stop? What about people who use steel and  aluminum? What about other goods that have been targeted by our foreign  competitors? Are they going to get bailouts too? Is it going to go up  from $12 billion to $50 billion to $100 billion? Amazingly, are our  Republican colleagues--this is so against their principles--going to go  along? We shall see.                                    Russia    Mr. President, there is one more point on Russia. After President  Trump's inexplicable behavior in Helsinki last week, many of us were  forced to wonder whether President Putin had something on President  Trump because his behavior was so obsequious in front of Putin.   Well, now it seems it is not just a few Democrats who are wondering.  Yesterday's Quinnipiac poll showed that 51 percent of Americans believe  that the Russian Government has compromising information about  President Trump. That is astounding. Our leading enemy has information,  compromising information, and then our President acts obsequiously.  Whoa, where are we in this country?   Let me repeat that poll. A majority of Americans believe the Russian  Government has something on President Trump. That is astounding. The  fact that millions of Americans are wondering if our President is  compromised by our leading adversary is a message to the White House:  America wants you to be tough with President Putin.   The President will say: Oh, this is fake news. This is made up.   Well, President Trump, if Putin has nothing over you, why aren't you  being tough with him? The best way to show that Putin has nothing over  you is for you to stand up to him--not to be so obsequious and fawning  and not to invite him here to the White House this fall.   There should be no more accepting of Putin's denials over a consensus  of American intelligence, no more bending over backward to avoid  criticizing Putin for interfering in our election, and no more one-on- one meetings with Putin where no one else--not the intelligence  community, not our military leaders, not the Congress, and not the  least of which, the American people know what was said or agreed to.   The writing is on the wall for the White House. This White House  keeps reaching new lows. The American people, so disturbed by the  President's  [[Page S5319]]  posture toward Russia, believe that President Trump may be compromised  by our biggest enemy. I don't think that has ever happened, certainly  in my memory, in my lifetime, and I can't remember an incident in  history where this has happened this way.    President Trump ought to reverse course immediately. He can start by  revoking his invitation to President Putin to visit the White House  this fall.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
