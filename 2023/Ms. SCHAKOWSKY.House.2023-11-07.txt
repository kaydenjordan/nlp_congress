 Mr. Chair, more than 10,000 people die every year  from drunk driving crashes. Drunk drivers are seven times more likely  to be involved in a fatal crash than a sober person.   You would think that the Republicans would want to do something about  it. Democrats have done something about it and said that NHTSA now will  have drunk driver prevention technology.   This technology has the potential of saving thousands of lives, and I  don't see that you are agreeing that we should be saving those lives. I  would say we should all vote against the drunk driver protection act.
