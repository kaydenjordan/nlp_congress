 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Duckworth  amendment, 2140, and I want to talk about that briefly.   First of all, I think there is probably very broad support in this  Chamber, and I certainly support the idea that local transit agencies  meet ADA standards wherever it is possible to do so.   Of course, transit agencies got a truly massive, staggering amount of  money over about a 12-month period ending in March--so much so that,  cumulatively, they are sitting on something very close to $40 billion  that they just weren't even able to spend.   But despite all that, we dramatically increased the annual run rate  of the Federal Government's contribution to transit agencies; and then  on top of that, the bipartisan negotiators agreed to a big, one-time  plus-up above and beyond all the money that was sent to these transit  agencies over the last year.   In the course of these discussions, included for transit agencies was  a nearly $2 billion funding request to the Senator from Illinois--the  junior Senator from Illinois--specifically for ADA upgrades at big city  transit systems.   To my knowledge, it is the first time that the Federal Government has  ever specifically appropriated substantial sums of money--nearly $2  billion this time--for the purpose of improving, upgrading big city  transit systems, in part, perhaps, because, of course, transit systems  have their own sources of money, their own States that can provide  them.   But, anyway, that was--this agreement was struck. Now, in the course  of working out the terms and the details and negotiating over the  language which would accompany this unprecedented funding for ADA  upgrades, you know, there were negotiations. That is the nature of this  process. So we asked for certain changes in the language that was  initially proposed. Some of those requests were rejected, some were  adopted, and that is how we got to a deal.   And one of the changes that was adopted was an agreement that this  amendment--this planning mandate requirement that is contemplated in  the amendment from the Senator from Illinois, that plan would be  dropped.   If we were to go ahead and now adopt this amendment, it would  completely violate the deal that was struck.   Now, let me just briefly explain why we requested that that language  be dropped. The amendment stipulates, among other things, that as a  condition of receiving this nearly $2 billion that this agreement  offers to transit agencies for this specific purpose--as a condition,  it said a transit agency must commit to a new Federal race, age, and  income equity mandate.   This is a quote:         . . . equity of service to all riders . . . taking into       account historical and current service gaps . . .    This is politically correct virtue signaling. This is people claiming  that transit agencies are somehow racist, and that we have got to--I  don't know--we have got to make sure that escalators are not racist.   It doesn't take a very fertile imagination to think about how this  language could be used to impose a host of new requirements on  agencies. You could have bureaucracies here micromanaging who knows  what--route planning, fair pricing, frequency of service--out of some  presumed systemic racism in transit agencies.   If we adopted this, then decisions by transit agencies that should be  guided by cost and ridership issues would end up being influenced by  wokeism.   Now, I think the people who run transit agencies are good and decent  people who care about their communities. They are trying to do the best  they can. They have now got staggering amounts of money with which to  do it, but they don't need to be second-guessed by social engineers who  are insisting that their agency is rife with racism.   So I urge a ``no'' vote, and I want to stress that the ``no'' vote on  this amendment doesn't reduce spending for ADA compliance by a dime.  That is not what this is about. This is about avoiding a ``woke''  planning mandate.    May I be recognized for 2 minutes in opposition?    One minute.   Well, listen, I just want to stress to my colleagues here that  defeating this amendment does not prevent one dime from going to  transit agencies for the purpose of upgrading their stations to  [[Page S5696]]  comply with the ADA. All it does is prevent a mandate for a ``woke''  planning provision that was dropped in the negotiations on this bill,  so I urge a ``no'' vote.
