 Mr. Speaker, on April 8, 2023, Officers Emily  Breidenbach and Hunter Scheel went on their final watch. They died at  the hands of a gunman who then proceeded to take his life.   They were young people who lived in northwestern Wisconsin. They were  relatively young in their service to the State of Wisconsin and to the  people of their local communities. They will be missed dearly, and it  is a tragedy that their lives were taken so young.   On behalf of all of the people of the Seventh Congressional District  in northern and western Wisconsin, I express my condolences and our  condolences. I had a chance to attend the funeral service for these two  officers last Saturday, and as tragic as this was, it was uplifting at  the same time because residents by the hundreds came to the funeral  service.   Then as I went on Highway 8 East in northern Wisconsin, hundreds of  people were along the roadside holding flags with their hands over  their hearts to recognize Officers Emily Breidenbach and Hunter Scheel.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Officers Emily Breidenbach and Hunter Scheel for  their service to our State and to our country, and I thank all of those  who wear a badge and for the service they provide for all of us in  America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the Representative from Louisiana  for giving me a couple minutes here.   I have been here for 3 years now in the House of Representatives, and  we have seen the other side try to overturn the laws of economics.   Here is a quote: ``We absolutely cannot go bankrupt because we have  the power to create as much money as we need to spend. . . .''   That was Nancy Pelosi's budget chairman.   Trying to overturn the laws of economics, trying to overturn the laws  of physics, we are going to make internet power into base load power.  It doesn't work.   Well, now it is a sad day because now we are debating basic biology  on the House floor. Unfortunately, over 50 years since Congress passed  the landmark legislation of Title IX, we now have Democrats denying  that basic biology and women's rights.   Let me be clear: Biological men have no business competing in women's  sports. It is anti-women and it is anti-science to think otherwise.   Here is a headline from NBC news: ``Trans women retain athletic edge  after a year of hormone therapy, the study finds.''   From The Guardian: ``Trans women retain 12 percent edge in test 2  years after transitioning.''   Those are the facts, and we have already seen the results. Over 20  biological men have won national or international competitions or  championships in the women's category.   With the Biden administration seeking to erase women's rights and  continuing to make a mockery of Title IX's fundamental principle of  basic biology, Republicans will protect them.   Tomorrow, House Republicans will defend women's sports when we pass  the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023.   This will ensure that school athletics comply with the Title IX  recognition of a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.   As a father of three daughters, I will always stand up to protect our  daughters. I would hope all Members of Congress, both Republican and  Democrat, would protect decades of progress we have made in securing  women's rights.   That starts by passing this legislation.   At a time when Democrats would rather erase our daughters' rights,  let me repeat: Republicans will protect them. Thank you to the  gentleman from Louisiana.
