 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  reaffirming the importance of the U.S. Israel alliance. At a time when  the Middle East is in constant turmoil, the United States needs strong  allies like Israel. Allies who are stable, dependent, and a force for  good in the region. Effective foreign policy in the Middle East begins  with an acknowledgment of Israel as one of our Nation's strongest  allies. As Israel continues to confront security challenges,  particularly with Iran, it is in America's national strategic interest  to continue to offer security assistance to Israel. For nearly 75  years, Israel has been a constant and stable ally in a region devoid of  stability. With the rise of Iran, the Taliban, and China's growing  influence in the region, the United States and Israel must continue to  stand together against these monstrous regimes. Since its creation in  1948, Israel and the United States have been bonded together through  our common values of freedom, prosperity, and constitutional norms. At  a time when Israel is facing assaults and threats from tyrannical  regimes, the United States Congress must send a strong, unflinching  message that we remain united with our friends and allies just as we  have for nearly 75 years. My amendment provides a full endorsement from  the U.S. Congress on the importance of the United States-Israel  relationship. We unequivocally stand with Israel.
