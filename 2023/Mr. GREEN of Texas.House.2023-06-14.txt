 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair and ranking  member of the full committee that has jurisdiction of these issues.   I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on this amendment.  This amendment delays the implementation of the legislation by 1 year  and requires that a study be conducted in time by GAO on the effects of  implementation.   We are making drastic changes, and drastic changes ought not be made  rapidly. We ought to give ourselves time to study these things so that  we can make prudent and judicious decisions.   A GAO study would provide us with the rigorous, unbiased analysis of  the likely impacts of the bill. It would examine the economic,  regulatory, and administrative implications of this new approval  process.   This amendment would help us to better understand how the shift might  affect industries, consumers especially, the economy, and the  government.   While the intent to improve regulatory oversight is laudable, we must  not rush into this. There should not be this rush to judgment as to the  implications without at least giving ourselves an opportunity to  examine them. We shouldn't do this without fully appreciating the  potential consequences.   Mr. Chair, I believe that this amendment, while simple, is something  that can be of great benefit, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, it is my belief that moving with  measured steps is not a delay. It is a judicious means by which we can  ascertain whether this drastic change--one might say a radical change-- will produce radical, unacceptable results.  [[Page H2911]]    Madam Chair, I think the amendment should be supported, and I ask my  colleagues to do so.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, the goal of this amendment is not to  undermine the power of congressional oversight. Rather, it is to  protect the functionality of government.   By providing a time-bound framework, we ensure that important  regulatory decisions are not left in limbo. That is exactly what can  happen without the benefit of this amendment. That is due to  legislative inertia.   Madam Chair, the Framers of our Constitution designed a government  that balances power between the branches. This amendment respects that  design by allowing for robust legislative review while also ensuring  that the executive branch can effectively administer and enforce our  laws.   However, let me be clear. While this amendment aims to improve the  proposed bill, I still remain fundamentally opposed to it because I  believe that the drastic changes that will take place will not serve to  benefit our legislative process.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Chair, this amendment is not designed to  delay but rather is designed to give us the opportunity to move forward  expeditiously. In fact, that is what has been the argument of the other  side that we should move expeditiously.   If expeditious movement is the choice of the other side, then they  should support this because it forces us to take that necessary action  as opposed to getting engaged in what has been called a paralysis of  analysis.   This a great opportunity for us to link arms, join hands, and cause  this legislation to move quickly. I think that this is what the  gentlewoman wants, it is what I want, and it is what we can produce.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
