 Madam Speaker, many in the Chamber know our friend  Senator Lamar Alexander, but many of you may not know that earlier this  year he lost his wife of 53 years, Leslee Kathryn Buhler Alexander,  better known to all of us as ``Honey.''   Honey was a household name in Tennessee, not for being the first lady  of Tennessee or the wife of a United States Senator, but for being the  voice of so many across the State.   Honey grew up in Texas. She graduated high school in Austin in 1963  and received her college degree from Smith College in 1967. Honey later  joined the Washington, D.C., staff of United States Senator John G.  Tower.   Now, that summer, during a softball game between Senator Tower's  staff and the staff of Senator Howard Baker, Jr., Honey met a young  Baker staffer, Lamar Alexander. Honey and Lamar dated for about 18  months and married in 1969.   When Honey, Lamar, and their 11-month-old son, Drew, moved to  Nashville in 1970, Honey began to focus on the health and well-being of  families and children. She said: ``Strong families make strong  children.''   Later, as Tennessee's first lady, Honey led the statewide Healthy  Children Initiative with the goal of providing prenatal healthcare for  every child. Honey dedicated her life to the well-being of our next  generation.   Honey Alexander cofounded Leadership Nashville, served Family &  Children's Service as president of its board and chaired multiple  events, and additionally served on the boards of the Adventure Science  Center, Vanderbilt Kennedy Center, the Junior League of Nashville, the  Dede Wallace Center, and the Hermitage.                                time  1215    Honey and Lamar had three more children: Leslee, Kathryn, and Will.  Through it all, Honey was a steadfast and committed partner during her  husband's honorable career in public service.   Honey campaigned during Lamar's six races for Governor and United  States Senator, served 8 years as the first lady of Tennessee, moved to  Knoxville when Lamar was the president of the University of Tennessee,  and then moved to Washington when Lamar was the United States Education  Secretary and finally U.S. Senator. When Lamar was campaigning for  President, Honey traveled on her own to over 80 different Iowa  communities.   During the 1996 Presidential campaign in New Hampshire, Honey was  interviewed on the Larry King Show on CNN. Larry King asked Honey this  question: Do you really want to be the First Lady and live in the White  House?   Honey answered in her own way, very succinctly with one word: ``No.''   That was Honey. It was clear to all of us that Honey was happiest at  home with her family. I think that Honey summed it up well when she  wrote: ``The most important facets of my life remain the same:  supporting Lamar; mothering the children; helping others; and nurturing  good physical, spiritual, emotional, and intellectual health in me and  those closest to me.''   When Nashville's Family and Children's Service named its new home the  Honey Alexander Center, the organization said, ``Honey Alexander has  dedicated her life to the service of others.'' In my opinion, that  really is the most suitable statement.   As a child, Honey's daughter Leslee wrote in a school essay: ``My  mother is the lioness who keeps the family in hand and allows us to  live and grow.''   We should all be so lucky to have a Honey Alexander in our lives.   As we grieve the loss of one of our favorite first ladies, we know  that Tennessee is a better place to live and raise a family because of  the work of this wonderful wife, mother, and friend.   From Roberta and me to Lamar, Leslee, Kathryn, and Will: We know your  hearts are heavy this holiday season, but we want to say thank you.  Thank you for allowing your wife and your mother to be a lioness for us  all.                            ____________________
