 Madam Speaker, the new Medicaid proposal from  the White House is a reverse Robin Hood on steroids, a coordinated  effort to steal from the poor and give to the rich campaign donors at  Mar-a-Lago and other places.   This White House has put Medicaid on the chopping block, Medicaid,  the program specifically put in place to provide healthcare to our most  vulnerable citizens, our seniors, our veterans, the working poor, and  their children.   My Republican colleagues will tell you, no, this is merely about  giving States greater flexibility. That is nonsense. Federal law  already gives States flexibility. This is about taking away healthcare  to pay for their tax cuts.   This is the latest in the GOP's long war on the working people and  the poor people of this country. They have cut the Children's Health  Insurance Program. They have cut food stamps. And now they are cutting  Medicaid.   Don't be fooled. This has long been in their plan.                            ____________________
