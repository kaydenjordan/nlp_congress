 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment to the Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription  Drug Costs Act.   Families in my district, in the California Central Valley, need  prescription drugs to go down in cost now, and they need access to care  for every condition, including mental health and treatment for  substance use disorders.   That is exactly what my amendment is going to help with. The  navigators that help folks understand healthcare through the exchanges  are great, but they need additional tools to make sure folks struggling  with opioid addiction get the coverage that they need. My amendment  gives them just that.   In most communities I visit, I hear from someone who has been touched  by the opioid epidemic, and I am no exception. When I was in high  school, I had a friend who was in a tough family situation, so I drove  him to school every day for 2 years. He was one of the best golfers I  ever met, had an amazing sense of humor. But, after graduating, he  developed an addiction to opiates, and about 5 years ago we lost him to  an overdose.   Stories like my friend's are far too common. About 130 Americans die  every single day from opiate overdose. Folks with substance use  disorder deserve access to care just like everyone else, and every  person in this country deserves prescription drugs that they can  actually afford.   It is for my friend and for our loved ones all across the country who  have struggled with this that I urge my colleagues to vote for this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
