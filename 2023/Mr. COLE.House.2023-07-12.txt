No further consideration of       the bill shall be in order except pursuant to a subsequent       order of the House.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my very good friend and the ranking member of the Committee  on Rules, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  House Resolution 582.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported  out a rule, House Resolution 582, providing for consideration of H.R.  2670, the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA as we commonly  know it, for fiscal year 2024, under a structured rule. It provides for  1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services. It provides the  Committee on Armed Services with en bloc authority so that the House  can expeditiously consider hundreds of Member priorities.   I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the NDAA is one of the most critical pieces of  legislation the House considers each year. Congress has a  constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense, and this  is an obligation I know the House takes very seriously. Each year, the  NDAA enables Congress to set appropriate defense policies, to provide  guidance and direction to the armed forces, and above all, to set  authorization levels for defense funding. Collectively, these efforts  provide our warfighters with the training, equipment, and strategy  necessary to meet any challenge around the globe.   Congress has enacted the NDAA every year for the last 62 years. While  we have a long road ahead of us, I am confident that we will do so  again this year, and I am gratified that the House is moving forward  with consideration of this measure on the floor.   Last month, the House Armed Services Committee reported out H.R. 2670  with an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 58-1. From a review of the  bill, it is easy to see why.                                time  1230    H.R. 2670 authorizes $886 billion for defense programs, an increase  of $28 billion. This funding level will ensure our men and women in  uniform are equipped for all threats and are prepared and ready to  defend freedom all around the globe.   In proposing this funding level, the Armed Services Committee stayed  within the parameters of the funding levels set in the Fiscal  Responsibility Act. Additionally, they identified nearly $40 billion  that was repurposed to respond to our current national security needs.  This ensures that the tax dollars of hardworking Americans are being  used in the most efficient and appropriate way possible.   H.R. 2670 includes a 5.2 percent pay increase for our servicemembers,  the largest pay increase in over 20 years. It includes critical  policies that will counter aggression from the Chinese Communist Party,  advance investments in tools to counter emerging threats, and bolster  the reliability of our supply chains. What is more, it includes  critical oversight measures designed to ensure that defense dollars are  wisely spent.   Mr. Speaker, it doesn't stop there. H.R. 2670 also ensures that the  Biden administration cannot continue to put policies ahead of national  security. It rejects the Biden administration's efforts to indoctrinate  our troops with progressive ideology like critical race theory  training, and instead, ensures that the Pentagon's focus is where it  should be, on military readiness and preparedness so that our  warfighters can defeat aggression and defend freedom anywhere in the  world.   In drafting H.R. 2670, the Armed Services Committee followed a robust  bipartisan process. They considered 760 amendments during the markup  and adopted 731 of them.   In preparing today's rule, the Rules Committee sought to continue  this robust, collaborative process. We reviewed over 1,500 amendments,  a record number. In keeping with our longstanding tradition at the  Rules Committee, we welcomed any Member who wished to come testify  about their amendments. Dozens of Members from both parties took part  and educated the committee on their proposals for this bill, and,  indeed, we would have welcomed dozens more.  [[Page H3221]]    In all, today's rule makes in order 290 amendments, reflecting  substantive ideas from Members on both sides of the aisle and ensuring  that Members will have an opportunity to present their priorities to  the House. I look forward to debating these ideas on the floor and to  full and fair consideration of these proposals before the entire House.   Mr. Speaker, all in all, H.R. 2670 is a strong bill, and the rule we  are considering today is an appropriate one for consideration of such  an important measure. I urge the Members to support both the rule and  H.R. 2670, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend. As always, he is a thoughtful  and reflective speaker, even when we disagree on certain things.   Mr. Speaker, the process in front of us is undoubtedly going to go  longer than we originally anticipated. I don't think that is a bad  thing. I actually think that is a good thing. I suspect we will, in the  end, have more votes on a whole variety of issues than we might have  originally had.   Again, I don't think that is a bad thing. That is broadly allowing  the House, within the fine parameters, to work its will as we work  toward a solution. I think we will ultimately get there.   Mr. Speaker, I would also remind my friend that however a bill  changes here, it is going to change again. The NDAA by its very nature  is, at the end of the day on final passage, a bipartisan bill. I would  just suggest to people to not get too upset or get too worried.   You are going to see the House very vigorously debating a whole  variety of issues. That is good for the institution. I think at the end  of the day, the House will work its will and we will pass an NDAA bill  out of here. At some point we will sit down and conference it with the  Senate, and it will come back, and we will have another pretty vigorous  debate.   What we are seeing is a pretty robust democracy working its will and  a pretty robust House of Representatives working its will.   Mr. Speaker, today will be a bipartisan discussion. Most of the  amendments, indeed, have been agreed to by both sides, but they need to  be fully aired and debated. We think that is a good thing. I suspect it  will be somewhat of a more contentious debate later on in the process,  but the process will work out.   At the end of the day, I am confident we will pass an NDAA bill. At  the end of the day, I am confident that once the bill is worked through  the Senate and signed by the President, it will, as most NDAA bills  are, be a bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will state for the record that I certainly have no  objection to defending Social Security and Medicare. As a matter of  fact, for, I think, six Congresses in a row, I have introduced  legislation, which was originally drawn up with my good friend John  Delaney, a former Democratic Member, on doing just that, on trying to  save Social Security.   What we proposed is what we did back in 1983 that actually worked,  that extended the life of Social Security for almost half a century,  which would be to actually do a commission and make a set of reasonable  reforms. I would put revenue on the table. Personally, I think that has  to be part of it. It certainly was then.   Again, my friends haven't been very serious about reforming Social  Security, in my view. To be fair, I don't think anybody has been. We  have been trying to get people to look at this problem for a long time.   I invite my friend from New York or any of my Democratic colleagues  to look at what we have proposed--again, originally with a Democratic  cosponsor. It is the only way we are going to get there. It is going to  have to be a bipartisan sort of deal.   That is what Ronald Reagan, Tip O'Neill, and Howard Baker did back in  that timeframe. We should do the same thing.   To say we are not interested in Medicare and Social Security is  simply wrong. Again, I am the last guy probably to say that to because  I have consistently put out a proposal to try and move forward in that  regard.   I will say this. In 1983, when they saved it, we were within 2 months  of it going broke--not going broke but having to make the cuts that you  make to adjust your outflow to the revenue coming in. We have 10 years.  We ought to take care of that.   Unfortunately, nobody or not enough people seem to be interested.  That includes the President of the United States, who, back in 1983,  actually voted for that commission to be created and then voted to  accept its recommendations. The current White House says it doesn't  want to do any commissions and politicizes the issue.   I see this on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, where people tell  us they want to protect Social Security. If you want to protect it, Mr.  Speaker, then you have to legislate on it because it is steadily  becoming less solvent over the years.   Also, to my friend from New York's remark about the focus on military  spending, I just would point out to the House that the total budget in  the NDAA that is proposed this year is actually the one the President  recommended. Personally, I think it is too low. I would have gone  higher. I will be the first to tell you that, Mr. Speaker.   The number that the committee chose is the President's number. So,  for those of my friends who are critical of how much is being spent, I  would suggest you direct your concerns to the White House because the  Appropriations Committee took the President's recommended number.   Again, if my colleagues think we are misfocused, my friend's first  argument is with the President of the United States and not with your  colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his thoughtful remarks and helpful  suggestions, and I will point out a couple of things quickly in  response.   The House Armed Services Committee has actually done a good job on  doing what my friend wants to do. They have repurposed over $40 billion  in the bill and redirected it more efficiently.   This has been a bipartisan, collaborative process between Chairman  Rogers and Ranking Member Smith, who, frankly, have worked quite well  together whether one was in the majority or the minority.   I think, as an alum of this distinguished committee that I once  served on, it is actually doing a pretty good job of trying to find the  savings that I know my friend sincerely wants to find and redirect.   I wouldn't say I disagree, but I would put some things in perspective  when we talk about spending. I have been around this stuff for a long  time. My dad was a career military guy at the height of the Cold War.  At the height of the Cold War, the United States spent 50 percent of  its entire budget on defense and spent almost 9 percent of its gross  national product because it thought that was what the threat was.   Then, as the Cold War waned, we came down a little bit. We had the  great Reagan defense buildup. At that point, defense was about one- third of the total Federal budget, not half. It had already come down,  and it was about 6 percent of the gross national product. Currently, it  is less than 4 percent, around 3.5, 3.7 percent. I would say that is  probably too low. It is only 15 percent of the entire budget.   What has driven spending around here--and we all know it--is really  not the discretionary budget. It is the entitlement budget. It is  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. That is about 60 percent of  all Federal spending. Throw in interest on the debt and the Federal  retirement system, and we are around 70, 71, 72 percent.   So, I am all for saving money, and there is certainly money to be  saved in defense. If Congress wants to get serious about this, then  let's talk about where the money is and sit down in a bipartisan way,  maybe in the framework that our former colleague Mr. Delaney and I  offered, and get serious about it. This is not where we spend most of  the country's money, and frankly, this is an area where we are  underspending.   Again, for my friends who are concerned--and efficiency suggestions  are always welcomed--the number we have is the President's number. If  we are overspending here, then it is probably good for my friends to  have a conversation with the President of the United States because,  honestly, our colleagues in the majority would prefer, for the most  part, to be at a higher number. I know that is true for Chairman  Rogers, and I suspect it is true for the majority of the committee's  Republican members.   Again, concerns about spending are always appropriate. There is waste  in  [[Page H3227]]  every part of government, including defense, but I would tell you, Mr.  Speaker, broadly speaking, the country certainly is not overspending on  defense in this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would thank my friend, as always, for a  thoughtful and robust debate. We covered a lot of ground. A lot of it  didn't have a lot to do with defense. We talked about Social Security  for a while, and I am delighted to see my friends are worried about the  state of the Republican majority. I think it will do fine.   While the process as always in Congress can look from the outside as  chaotic or sometimes contradictory, the rally is we tend to work  towards things, and we have gotten this bill done for 62 years in a row  for a reason. It didn't matter who was the majority and who was the  minority or what the administration was. I suspect the same thing is  going to happen again this time.   Along the course of that, we will have a robust debate. Today, we  will mostly be talking about things we agree on, as we know, and that  is a good thing.   There will be things that we disagree on, and that is fine, too. I  will remind my friends on my side of the aisle that winning here isn't  necessarily winning. It just gets you to the next stage of the contest.   The Senate will be moving on its version of the NDAA. We will sit  down in conference, and then we will see what the real final product  is. Some of the things that we are watching today, to me, again, are  just the normal process and policy working out.   Mr. Speaker, I would also in closing, urge my colleagues to support  this resolution. H.R. 2670, the NDAA for fiscal year 2024 is a strong,  strong bill. It fulfills Congress' constitutional responsibility to  provide for the common defense while also ensuring that we are  carefully and wisely spending the American people's hard-earned tax  dollars.   It will set appropriate policies for the Armed Services to ensure our  warfighters have the equipment, the training, and the resources they  need to confront aggression anywhere around the world at any time.   It requires the Pentagon to maintain a laser focus on readiness, and  it ensures appropriate oversight of our investments both at home and  abroad.   Mr. Speaker, this is unfortunately a dangerous time in the world.  American adversaries are on the march, threatening global stability and  territorial integrity of our friends and our allies.   These threats range from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to communist  China's continued pressure on Taiwan and our Pacific allies to Iran's  quest for nuclear weapons and to North Korea's  [[Page H3229]]  continued testing of intercontinental missiles.   The United States does not seek armed conflict, but we will be  prepared to meet it should it seek us out.   I would remind this House of the words of Ronald Reagan. `` . . .  peace is the condition under which mankind was meant to flourish. Yet  peace does not exist of its own will. It depends on us, on our courage  to build it and guard it and pass it on to future generations.''   In taking up H.R. 2670, we are continuing that tradition. We are  continuing to build our Armed Forces to meet and confront any foe at  any time anywhere in the world, and it is my hope that in doing so, we  will be building a military that is strong enough to deter aggression.   We will, as people have committed throughout our history, achieve  peace through strength.                        Amendment Offered by Mr. Cole     Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the resolution, as amended.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 582 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. COLE Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move  the previous question on the amendment and on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
