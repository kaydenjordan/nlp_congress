 Madam Speaker, I rise today, October 21, to recognize  Latina Equal Pay Day, the day when the pay for Latina women catches up  to that of White men from the previous year. Latinas typically earn  only 57 cents for every dollar earned by White men.   This disparity harms women, their families, and the communities that  depend on their wages for survival. This inequity is why I am a proud  cosponsor of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would close  loopholes in the Equal Pay Act in an effort to break the patterns of  pay discrimination and strengthen workforce protections for women,  especially women of color.   I would also like to take this time on Latina Equal Pay Day to  acknowledge the recent conclusion of Hispanic Heritage Month and to  recognize and celebrate the many contributions, diverse cultures, and  extensive histories of the American Hispanic community and the over 60  million Americans who identify as Hispanic or Latino.   I am proud to represent one of the most diverse districts in the  United States and the more than 170,000 Hispanic Americans who call  Georgia's Seventh District home.   One of my most significant legislative accomplishments was borne out  of conversations with Tony Rodriguez, CEO and president of the Aurora  Theater in Lawrenceville. My conversations with him encouraged me to  introduce the Paycheck Protection Program Extension Act, which extended  the deadline to apply for forgivable PPP loans from March 31 to May 31  and gave small businesses more time to access this critical assistance.   I would also like to recognize Antonio Molina, chair of the board of  Georgia's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, for his hard work ensuring  Hispanic small business owners have the resources they need to be  successful.   I also recognize Santiago Marquez, the executive director of the  Latin American Association, which provides a critical safety net  service for so many in the Seventh District.   I would also like to thank two Hispanic members of the Cabinet:  Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and SBA  Administrator Isabel Guzman, who visited Georgia's Seventh District  this year. It was an honor to host each of them and introduce them to  the wonderful place we call home.   Finally, I would like to acknowledge my chief of staff, Estefania  ``Stefy'' Rodriguez, for her work leading my staff to serve the great  people of the Seventh District.   As I host and attend events across my district, I am struck by the  vibrancy of the Hispanic communities.   Recently, I visited with the Latino Lions Club of Norcross, the Latin  American Association, the Hispanic Health Coalition of Georgia, and  Latino Community Services to discuss how we can work together to  address the issues that matter most to our community.   We all benefit from the contributions Hispanic Americans have made  and will continue to make. The inclusion of their voices and values in  our community make my district and the United States so much stronger.   They are the scientists, doctors, nurses, and essential workers who  have helped us get through the COVID-19 pandemic; the teachers who  educate the next generation of Americans; the artists who grace our  television screens and our stages; the small business owners who drive  our economy; and the many Hispanic elected officials, some who walk  these very halls, who work every day to make a positive difference for  our community.   I am a proud cosponsor of critical legislation, such as H.R. 6, the  American Dream and Promise Act, and H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce  Modernization Act, which extends the American Dream to millions of  people who already call this great Nation home.   Today, on Latina Equal Pay Day, and following the conclusion of  Hispanic Heritage Month, I reaffirm my commitment to always work to  support and strengthen our vibrant Hispanic communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the PUMP for  Nursing Mothers Act, which will be considered by the House later this  week.   As a working mother, I strongly support this bipartisan bill to  provide reasonable accommodations to nursing mothers in the workplace.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, among other critical changes, would  extend the break time and space protections to workers who are  currently excluded from overtime protections, including teachers,  transportation workers, and agriculture workers.   I was proud to work as part of a bipartisan group along with the  bill's sponsor, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, to offer an  amendment which maintains the undue hardship exemption threshold at its  current level of 50 employees.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act is supported by a broad coalition of  stakeholders, including the National Retail Federation, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, the National Education Association, and the  American Civil Liberties Union.   Mr. Speaker, I enthusiastically support this bill and urge all  Members to do the same when it comes before the House this week.                            ____________________
