 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the  Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 2454) to direct the Secretary of  Homeland Security to establish a data framework to provide access for  appropriate personnel to law enforcement and other information of the  Department, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(a) In General.--        (1) Development.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall       develop a data framework to integrate existing Department of       Homeland Security datasets and systems, as appropriate, for       access by authorized personnel in a manner consistent with       relevant legal authorities and privacy, civil rights, and       civil liberties policies and protections.

(c) Exclusion of Information.--The Secretary of Homeland       Security may exclude information from the data framework       required under this section if the Secretary determines       inclusion of such information may--        (1) jeopardize the protection of sources, methods, or       activities;        (2) compromise a criminal or national security       investigation;        (3) be inconsistent with other Federal laws or regulations;       or        (4) be duplicative or not serve an operational purpose if       included in such framework.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2454, the Department of  Homeland Security Data Framework Act. This legislation provides the  first ever authorization for the DHS data framework.   Under this initiative, the Department is bringing together vital DHS  databases, including travel and cargo information, investigative data,  and critical infrastructure data, among other things.   Mr. Speaker, Americans would not only be surprised, but appalled to  learn about the number of information-sharing stovepipes that still  exist within the Department of Homeland Security. This bill will bring  together the datasets in each of the classified and unclassified spaces  to ensure that the men and women working at the Department have the  information they need to keep our Nation safe.   This bill also mandates privacy and security safeguards, training for  departmental personnel, and requires the Secretary to ensure  information in the framework is both protected and auditable.   The House has overwhelmingly supported this measure twice before as  part of the DHS Authorization Act, on July 20, 2017, and again as a  standalone measure on September 12, 2017.   The Senate made some minor changes to the bill and passed it on  December 6. With today's vote, we will send this bill to the  President's desk for his signature.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to again support this measure, and  I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2454, the Department of  Homeland Security Data Framework Act of 2017.   The Department of Homeland Security Data Framework Act directs the  [[Page H10130]]  Secretary of Homeland Security to develop a data framework  consolidating existing databases and systems at the Department. H.R.  2454 requires the Secretary to ensure that this data framework is  accessible to DHS employees with proper clearances and that they are  trained to safeguard and use such information when appropriate.   The central data framework will help cut down on the processing time  of data searchs and allow analysts at DHS agencies to more efficiently  access information across the Department.   I want to thank my colleague, Congressman Will Hurd, for introducing  this legislation, and Senator Maggie Hassan for introducing its  companion in the Senate. This bill has already passed the House once  before, and I look forward to the President signing it into law this  year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important piece of legislation that has  strong support on both sides of the aisle. It will improve DHS'  operations by moving it towards a consolidated data system, enhancing  the ability of the men and women serving at DHS to access, in a timely  manner, the data that they need to fulfill their critical missions. I  urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2454.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation once again.   Again, we are authorizing the Department of Homeland Security's data  framework. It holds DHS accountable with aggressive timelines, includes  robust requirements for privacy and data standards and data safeguards,  as well as ensuring important congressional notifications continue.   I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for  their support in moving this measure through the House, as well as all  of our colleagues on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee for moving this bill through the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
