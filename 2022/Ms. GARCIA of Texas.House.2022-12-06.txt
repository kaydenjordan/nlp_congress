 Madam Speaker, I rise to call upon our  colleagues in the Senate to protect DACA recipients before the end of  this Congress.   Six years old, Madam Speaker. Six years old. That is the average age  recipients of DACA were when they first entered the U.S. through no  fault of their own.   Known as Dreamers, these young people have served in our military,  attended our schools, and worked in our communities. They have grown up  here, eagerly contributing to our neighborhoods and the diversity that  makes America great. They are Americans in their heart and their soul  and in their minds because this is the only country that they have  known.   Many of them are now educated doctors, trusted lawyers, committed  schoolteachers, and essential workers. In fact, more than 200,000 of  them worked as essential workers during the pandemic keeping us safe,  keeping us healthy. Now, because of right-wing attacks on our  communities' all-stars, their futures are uncertain.   Madam Speaker, Dreamers need action, and they need it now.   In my home State of Texas, nearly 100,000 Dreamers are at risk of  facing deportation, and 30,000 of them live in my hometown of Houston.   They are not strangers; they are not Martians coming in from some  alien nation. We are talking about our friends, our neighbors, people  we go to church with, people we buy groceries with, people that are  just down the street, and they are also part of our families.   For our community, it is now or never. The Senate must put Dreamers  over the political tactics of fear and hate. It is simple: we need to  put people over politics. We need to put Dreamers over rhetoric. The  time is now.
