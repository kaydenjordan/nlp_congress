 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Charles Hall, Jr., as a  part of my Black History Month celebration.   Mr. Hall is the president of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department  Store Union, Local 108, in Maplewood, New Jersey. His commitment to his  members is without equal.   For more than 21 years, Mr. Hall, Jr., has improved wages, health  benefits, and working conditions for workers throughout the Northeast.  He has increased diversity in his own staff and companies across the  area.   Recently, he organized more than 2,000 exploited Latino workers and  got them higher wages. In addition, he got health benefits for local  nursing home workers and their first raise in 10 years.   His contributions to my district are immeasurable. That is why I  celebrated his work during a Black History Month celebration on  February 21.   Charles Hall, Jr., is a great man and deserves all of these accolades  and more.                            ____________________
