 Madam Speaker, S.B. 8 will kill women. It is a  dangerous, dangerous depriving of our constitutional rights, but it  will kill women. It is a bill that provides a provision that I have  never seen in my lifetime living in the United States of America, a  free Nation.   It actually sets a bounty, reminiscent of eras of dastardly life in  this country, the slave life; a bounty in order to stalk a woman to  ensure that the provider does not give and the woman does not get an  abortion.   I support this legislation because it upholds the Constitution, and I  look forward to my bill on preventing vigilante stalking being passed.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the  Chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security; a  member of the Democratic Working Women's Task Force, the representative  of 700,000 highly interested and affected persons in the Eighteenth  Congressional District of Texas; as a sponsor of the legislation; and  as a woman who was born and came of age during a period when the women  of America were denied rights that men took for granted, including the  basic human right of autonomy over one's own body and to decide for  herself the profound and fundamental question of whether to bear or  beget a child, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3755, the Women's  Health Protection Act, which protects a person's ability to determine  whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a health care  provider's ability to provide abortion services.   I am extremely pleased that the Biden-Harris Administration strongly  endorses this legislation and urges its swift passage by the Congress.   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 3755 because it states clearly and  unequivocally in Section 4 that a ``health care provider has a  statutory right under this Act to provide abortion services, and may  provide abortion services, and that provider's patient has a  corresponding right to receive such services, without any burdensome  limitations or requirements.   Burdensome and unlawful requirements include:   1. A requirement that a health care provider perform specific tests  or medical procedures in connection with the provision of abortion  services, unless generally required for the provision of medically  comparable procedures.   2. A requirement that the same health care provider who provides  abortion services also perform specified tests, services, or procedures  prior to or subsequent to the abortion.   3. A requirement that a health care provider offer or provide the  patient seeking abortion services medically inaccurate information in  advance of or during abortion services.   4. A limitation on a health care provider's ability to prescribe or  dispense drugs based on current evidence-based regimens or the  provider's good-faith medical judgment, other than a limitation  generally applicable to the medical profession.   5. A limitation on a health care provider's ability to provide  abortion services via telemedicine.  [[Page H5153]]    6. A requirement or limitation concerning the physical plant,  equipment, staffing, or hospital transfer arrangements of facilities  where abortion services are provided, or the credentials or hospital  privileges or status of personnel at such facilities, that is not  imposed on facilities or the personnel of facilities where medically  comparable procedures are performed.   7. A requirement that, prior to obtaining an abortion, a patient make  one or more medically unnecessary in-person visits to the provider of  abortion services or to any individual or entity that does not provide  abortion services.   8. A prohibition on abortion at any point or points in time prior to  fetal viability, including a prohibition or restriction on a particular  abortion procedure.   9. A prohibition on abortion after fetal viability when, in the good- faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider,  continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant  patient's life or health.   10. A limitation on a health care provider's ability to provide  immediate abortion services when that health care provider believes,  based on the good-faith medical judgment of the provider, that delay  would pose a risk to the patient's health.   It is important to note that prior to fetal viability, the law  prohibits a health care requiring a patient seeking abortion services  to disclose the patient's reason or reasons for seeking abortion  services, or a limiting the provision or obtaining of abortion services  at any point or points in time prior to fetal viability based on any  actual, perceived, or potential reason or reasons the health care  provider believes the patient has for obtaining abortion services.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3755 contains another important provision, this  one directed toward the judiciary, and it is that all courts are to  ``liberally construe'' the provisions of the law to effectuate the  congressional intent in enacting the law and that courts are not to  construe the act in anyway ``to authorize any government to interfere  with a person's ability to terminate a pregnancy, or to diminish or in  any way negatively affect a person's constitutional right to terminate  a pregnancy.''   To enforce the provisions of the legislation, the Attorney General is  authorized to commence a civil action for prospective injunctive relief  on behalf of the United States against any government official that is  charged with implementing or enforcing any limitation or requirement  that is challenged as a violation of a statutory right under this Act.   In addition, H.R. 3755 authorizes private rights of action to be  brought for injunctive relief against the government official that is  charged with implementing or enforcing the challenged limitation or  requirement by any individual or entity, including any health care  provider, aggrieved by the alleged violation of this Act.   Madam Speaker, swift, clear, and decisive action to codify the rights  and protections provided by the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision  in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) is the clearly required response to  the more than 500 state laws restricting abortion access over the past  decade.   These regressive restrictions have eliminated access to abortion care  in large swaths of the United States; nearly 90 percent of U.S.  counties are without a single abortion provider and five states are  down to their last clinic.   The people hurt most by abortion restrictions are those who already  face barriers to accessing health care-including Black, indigenous and  persons of color, women, those working to make ends meet, members of  the LGBTQI+ community, immigrants, young people, those living in rural  communities, and people with disabilities.   Madam Speaker, right-wing Republican legislators passed, and the  Republican governor signed, Texas SB8, an extreme and facially  unconstitutional law that contemptuously violates existing Supreme  Court precedent.   The Texas law significantly impairs women's access to critical  reproductive health care, particularly affecting communities of color,  individuals with low incomes, and those who live in rural or  underserved communities.   The law also turns private citizens into bounty hunters who are  empowered to bring lawsuits against anyone who they believe has helped  another person get an abortion, including family members, faith  leaders, Uber drivers and others providing transportation, and health  care providers.   The new Texas law prohibits abortions as early as six weeks into a  pregnancy and creates the opportunity for almost any private citizen to  sue abortion providers and women seeking to terminate their pregnancy  past six weeks.   The law effectively bans abortion in Texas, as the six-week cutoff is  just two weeks after a missed menstrual cycle.   The ``hotline'' reporting system in the Texas law is particularly  malicious.   Since enforcement of the bill lies entirely with private citizens,  Texans are incentivized to stalk women as they make vitally important  decisions about their own health.   It is anathema to the conscience of the United States of America to  have individuals following women to determine whether they have or will  receive an abortion.   We saw similar occurrences during the KGB era of the Soviet Union, as  neighbor spied on, lied against, and turned against neighbor to hand  over their fellow citizens to the state.   We are Americans, and to have a law that so blatantly foments  distrust and stalking among our citizenry is a blatant spit in the face  of the principles on which this country was founded.   To assist in stopping this law, and to protect women from vigilante  bounty hunters, I have introduced H.R. 5226, the ``Preventing Vigilante  Stalking that Stops Women's Access to Healthcare and Abortion Rights  Act of 2021.''   This bill would enhance criminal penalties under the federal stalking  statute if the stalking is done with the intent to prevent or report on  a woman's health decisions.   Importantly, this bill does not include any mandatory minimums.   This bill will weaken the incentive to stalk women by bolstering the  criminal penalties under the federal stalking statute if the stalking  is intended to prevent or report on a woman's health decisions.   Additionally, earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court announced  that in December it will hear argument on a Mississippi law banning  abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which represents a direct  challenge to the continued vitality of Roe v. Wade.   Madam Speaker, one of the most detestable aspects of these continued  attacks to undermine a woman's right to reproductive health care is  that it would curb access to care for women in the most desperate of  circumstances.   Women like Danielle Deaver, who was 22 weeks pregnant when her water  broke and tests showed that Danielle had suffered anhydramnios, a  premature rupture of the membranes before the fetus has achieved  viability.   This condition meant that the fetus likely would be born with a  shortening of muscle tissue that results in the inability to move  limbs.   In addition, Danielle's fetus likely would suffer deformities to the  face and head, and the lungs were unlikely to develop beyond the 22- week point.   There was less than a 10% chance that, if born, Danielle's baby would  be able to breathe on its own and only a 2% chance the baby would be  able to eat on its own.   Abridging a woman's right to reproductive health care hurts women  like Vikki Stella, a diabetic, who discovered months into her pregnancy  that the fetus she was carrying suffered from several major anomalies  and had no chance of survival and whose physician determined that  because of Vikki's diabetes, induced labor and Caesarian section were  both riskier procedures for Vikki than an abortion.   SB8 is the most brazen, but not the first, attempt to roll back  women's reproductive health care rights in Texas.   In 2013 Texas passed a law that would have cut off access to 75  percent of reproductive healthcare clinics in the state had it not been  challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 and 2015.   On October 2, 2014, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional  a Texas law that required that all reproductive healthcare clinics that  provided the full range of services would be required to have a  hospital-style surgery center building and staffing requirements.   This requirement meant that only 7 clinics in the entire state would  be allowed to continue to provide a full spectrum of reproductive  healthcare to women.   But because Texas is a vast state comprising 268,580 square miles,  (second only in size and population to the state of California),  implementation of the law would have ended access to reproductive  services for millions of women in my state.   In 2015, the State of Texas once again threatened women's access to  reproductive health care when it attempted to shutter all but 10  healthcare providers in the state of Texas.   The Supreme Court once again intervened on behalf of Texas women to  block the move to close clinics.   Madam Speaker, since the United States Supreme Court ruled over 40  years ago, in Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)), that a woman's  constitutional right to privacy includes her right to abortion, both  abortion rates and risks have substantially declined, as have the  number of teen and unwanted pregnancies.   If opponents were so concerned about women's health and safety, they  would be promoting any one of the number of evidence-based proactive  policies that improve women's health and well-being.   Instead, they are continuing their assault on women's constitutional  rights and their campaign to outlaw abortion.   That is their number one priority; it is certainly not about  protecting women's health; it is about politics.  [[Page H5154]]    It is clear women are under attack and must be on perpetual guard  against new attacks on women's access to reproductive health care,  often couched in those same terms.   Madam Speaker, this is not what the American people want.   Support for abortion access is at an all-time high; nearly 80 percent  of Americans do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned.   There is no state in the Nation where making abortion illegal is  popular.   The American people want more access to health care, not less, and it  is more critical than ever to see through this inflammatory  misinformation campaign.   Madam Speaker, the right to make decisions about reproductive health  care, including abortion, is central to individual equality.   The right enables a person to decide if, when, and how to start and  grow their family.   It enables people to pursue and advance in their education and  employment, and to be full and equal participants in society.   Laws that restrict reproductive freedom, including restrictions on  abortion and birth control, perpetuate harmful stereotypes about gender  roles and undermine gender equality.   Courts, federal law, and the public have long connected reproductive  freedom with equality.   Reproductive freedom is central to women's equality, for as the  Supreme Court said in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992):  ``The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and  social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to  control their reproductive lives.''   Americans understand this connection and it is reflected in a January  2019 national poll showing 71% of voters agree--48% agree strongly-- that equal rights for women includes access to reproductive health  care.   State laws like Texas SB8 represent unconstitutional infringements on  the right to privacy, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in a long  line of cases going back to Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479  (1965) and, of course, Roe v. Wade.   In Roe v. Wade, the Court held that a state could not prohibit a  woman from exercising her right to terminate a pregnancy in order to  protect her health prior to viability.   While many factors go into determining fetal viability, the consensus  of the medical community is that viability is acknowledged as not  occurring prior to 24 weeks gestation.   Supreme Court precedents make it clear that neither Congress nor a  state legislature can declare any one element--``be it weeks of  gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor--as the  determinant'' of viability. Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 388-89  (1979).   The constitutionally protected right to privacy encompasses the right  of women to choose to terminate a pregnancy before viability, and even  later, where continuing the pregnancy to term poses a threat to a  woman's life, health, or safety.   This right of privacy was hard won and must be preserved inviolate.   Madam Speaker, every pregnancy is different, and no politician knows,  or has the right to assume he knows, what is best for a woman and her  family.   These are decisions that properly must be left to women to make, in  consultation with their partners, doctors, and their God.   I urge all Members to join me in voting to protect a person's ability  to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and to protect a  health care provider's ability to provide abortion services by voting  for H.R. 3755, the Women's Health Protection Act.                  [From the Intelligencer, Sept. 3, 2021]                Texas Is Already Creating Abortion Refugees                            (By Melissa Jeltsen)         Just pause and breathe. We're going to help, but I need you       to take a breath and calm down for a moment.        Kathaleen Pittman, director of the Hope Medical Clinic for       Women in Shreveport, Louisiana, repeated this mantra over and       over to the teary women on the other end of the phone. The       calls were coming from all over Texas, where abortion is       currently banned at about six weeks, before many women know       they are pregnant. They wanted to know if they could get an       abortion in Louisiana instead.        ``The phone has been ringing off the wall, patients       attempting to get in,'' Pittman said. But appointments were       scarce. When I spoke with her on Thursday, Hope Medical       Clinic was the only functioning abortion clinic in the state       of Louisiana; the other two remaining clinics were closed due       to power outages caused by Hurricane Ida. ``Right now we are       booked out three, possibly four weeks just to get in for that       first visit,'' Pittman said, noting that a state-mandated       waiting period requires patients to come to the clinic twice.       ``We're going to see women who are terminating later in the       pregnancy than desired because they simply can't get in       quickly enough,'' she said. Others, she feared, wouldn't be       able to get an abortion at all. ``Of course it's going to be       the women who have no money,'' she added. ``It's always the       women without the means that suffer the most.''        In the wake of SB 8, which went into effect on Wednesday,       many clinics in Texas are still providing abortions for       patients up to six-weeks pregnant, or before embryonic       cardiac activity can be detected. Everyone else--estimated to       be about 85 percent of all abortion patients--is now being       referred out of state. As a result, clinics in Oklahoma,       Louisiana, New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas are being       inundated with a surge of pregnant people who are racing       against the clock for care. Yet, in many of these states,       years of constant antiabortion attacks have eroded the       existing reproductive health infrastructure, leaving a       fragile system that is ill-equipped to absorb the additional       demand.        ``The second largest state in the country goes dark on a       service and everyone else surrounding is trying to support       and provide care,'' said Emily Wales, interim president and       CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which covers       Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Clinics in all three states       are seeing an increase in Texas patients, she said,       especially in Oklahoma. At the same time, abortion access is       under attack there; five new abortion restrictions are set to       go into effect on November 1. ``It feels a little bit like       it's whack-a-mole right now in trying to beat back what are       medically unnecessary requirements to ensure ongoing       access,'' Wales said.        While other states have passed similar six-week abortion       bans, the Texas law is the only one that has been allowed to       go into effect. That's because of the unique way it was       drafted. The state does not enforce the law. Instead, SB 8       deputizes regular people to file civil lawsuits against       doctors or anyone else who knowingly ``aids or abets'' an       abortion. The law appears to have been intentionally designed       this way to thwart judicial action.        At Trust Women's clinic in Oklahoma City, which is one of       the closest abortion clinics for people in north Texas,       abortion appointments are already being booked three weeks       into September, just like at Hope Medical Clinic in       Louisiana. ``All of our doctors fly in from other states,''       explained Zack Gingrich-Gaylord, communications director for       Trust Women. ``We're currently asking them to consider       working additional days, but of course, our doctors also       practice medicine in their home states as well.'' Trust Women       has another clinic in Wichita, Kansas, with slightly more       availability, but to get there, Texas patients must travel       even further. ``We've already started seeing some of those       Texas patients today, and we've got some scheduled       tomorrow,'' said Ashley Brink, the Wichita clinic director.       ``It's been a really emotional time. A lot of these folks,       they're scared, they're confused, they're sad.''        Kristina Tocce, medical director at Planned Parenthood of       the Rocky Mountains, said she was seeing the same uptick in       Colorado and New Mexico. ``I'm very nervous for patients who       need services immediately because this was an immediate hard       stop to abortion services in Texas without a clear path for       those patients as to where they can go,'' she said. ``Texas       is essentially a pre-Roe world now.''        The distance to the nearest clinic is only one of the       problems that Texas patients now face, said Alan Braid, the       owner and medical director of Alamo Women's Reproductive       Services in San Antonio. Many patients are already mothers,       and cannot leave their jobs or their children for the length       of time needed to access care in another state. Some are       undocumented and cannot travel with ease.        ``It sounds very easy--oh well, you can't get it in Texas,       just go to Oklahoma, New Mexico. But the people that we see--      that hourly wage patient, the single mom, the people that       don't have the means to travel--it's impossible for them,''       he said. ``That's like saying well, just hop on a plane and,       you know, go to France. It's beautiful there, you can get an       abortion and then take a walk down the Champs-Elysees.''        Braid, who has been providing abortion care in Texas since       he began his OB/GYN internship in 1972, said this was the       worst climate he had ever seen for reproductive rights in       Texas since before Roe v. Wade. The new law, with its       vigilante-enforcement scheme, is spreading fear and distrust.       ``You can feel it in the room,'' he said. ``It hangs heavy.''       As a provider, he said, he is usually optimistic that he can       support his patients and meet their needs. ``Now, when I walk       in the room, I have huge doubts about whether I'm going to be       able to help,'' he said. ``I'm not used to that.''        He expressed deep concern about what patients will do to       obtain abortions if they can't get one inside Texas when they       need it. He still has a powerful memory of three teenagers       dying from septic shock and organ failure after obtaining       back-alley abortions back when he was an intern in 1972.        ``That's where we're headed,'' he said. ``I promise you       that people are going to cross the border to Mexico. They're       going to self-induce.''                     [From the AP News, Sept. 2, 2021]        New Texas Abortion Law Pushes Women to Out-of-State Clinics         Even before a strict abortion ban took effect in Texas this       week, clinics in neighboring states were fielding growing       numbers of calls from women desperate for options.        An Oklahoma clinic had received more than double its number       of typical inquiries, two-thirds of them from Texas. A Kansas       clinic is anticipating a patient increase of up  [[Page H5155]]       to 40% based on calls from women in Texas. A Colorado clinic       that already had started seeing more patients from other       states was preparing to ramp up supplies and staffing in       anticipation of the law taking effect.        The Texas law, allowed to stand in a decision Thursday by       the U.S. Supreme Court, bans abortions once medical       professionals can detect cardiac activity, typically around       six weeks. In a highly unusual twist, enforcement will be       done by private citizens who can sue anyone they believe is       violating the law.        ``There's real panic about how are they going to get an       abortion within six weeks,'' said Anna Rupani, co-director of       Fund Texas Choice, one of several nonprofits that help pay       for travel and other expenses for patients seeking out-of-      state abortions. ``There's this fear that if I can't get it       done in six weeks, I may not be able to get it done because I       may not be able to leave my job or my family for more than a       day.''        Traveling for an abortion may be impossible for women who       would struggle to find child care or take time off work. And       for those without legal U.S. status along Texas' southern       border, traveling to an abortion clinic also entails the risk       of getting stopped at a checkpoint.        Fund Texas Choice is among the groups seeking to expand a       network that helps women in Texas and other places with       restrictive abortion laws end their pregnancies in other       states. It already has seen more women reaching out. The       organization typically handles 10 new cases per week but       received 10 calls from new clients just Wednesday, when the       law took effect.        The phenomenon is not new. Women have been increasingly       seeking out-of-state abortions as Republican legislatures and       governors have passed ever-tighter abortion laws,       particularly in the South. At least 276,000 women terminated       their pregnancies outside their home state between 2012 and       2017, according to a 2019 Associated Press analysis of state       and federal data.        The trend appears to have accelerated over the past year.       Abortion clinics in neighboring states began seeing an uptick       in calls from Texas after Gov. Greg Abbott banned abortions       in March 2020 for nearly a month under a COVID-19 executive       order.        The number of Texans seeking abortions in Planned       Parenthood clinics in the Rocky Mountain region, which covers       Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming and southern Nevada, was 12       times higher that month. In California, 7,000 patients came       from other states to Planned Parenthood clinics in 2020.        The number of Texans getting abortions in Kansas jumped       from 25 in 2019 to 289 last year. The Trust Women clinic in       Wichita accounted for 203 of those procedures in a three-      month period. Those patients traveled an average of 650 miles       (1,000 kilometers), Trust Women spokesman Zack Gingrich-      Gaylord said.        ``Last year was a dress rehearsal,'' he said, predicting       similar numbers under the new Texas law.        One woman discovered she was pregnant just as Abbott's       emergency order banning abortions was lifted. She and her       partner had lost their jobs in San Antonio during the       pandemic.        ``We didn't know which way the world was going to go with       everything shut down and no change in sight,'' said Miranda,       who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used       for fear of harassment and intimidation. ``The last thing I       wanted to do was be pregnant.''        She struggled to find an abortion clinic that could help       her. An online search led her to Fund Texas Choice and the       Lilith Fund, another organization that offers financial       assistance to Texans seeking abortions. They offered to pay       for a flight to New Mexico.        ``It's so comforting because it's like someone saying, `We       got you. Let's take care of this together,' '' Miranda said.        Eventually, she found an appointment at a clinic in Dallas,       a five-hour drive away. The groups helped with gas and       lodging, aid that will be even more important with the new       law, Miranda said.        ``To be able to help me in a time of need when I had       nothing, not even a job--that's something I think a lot of       women would benefit from if they knew those options were       there,'' she said.        Trust Women Wichita clinic director Ashley Brink said the       phones have been busier than normal this week with potential       patients from Texas and beyond. Women also have been calling       from Louisiana and Alabama who would typically get abortion       care in Texas but are having to travel even farther.        The clinic typically sees 40 to 50 abortion patients in a       week and now is expecting an additional 15 to 20.        At Trust Women's clinic in Oklahoma City, 80 appointments       were scheduled over the past two days, more than double the       typical amount, co-executive director Rebecca Tong said. Two-      thirds were from Texas, and the earliest opening was three       weeks out.        ``Oklahoma has just barely enough clinics for the amount of       people here,'' Tong said. ``If anyone is thinking, `Oh, they       can just go out of state, it'll be so easy,' a lot of clinics       in the Midwest and South, we don't do abortion care five days       a week.''        Oklahoma providers also face the potential for abortion       restrictions similar to those in Texas in a matter of months.        In recent months, 15% of patients supported by Cobalt, an       abortion access advocacy group in Colorado, were from out of       state, president Karen Middleton said. She expects that       number to keep rising.        The group administers a fund to cover the cost of the       procedure, travel, lodging and meals. It began preparing for       a potential influx of patients from Texas several weeks ago.        ``We reached out to everyone who provides abortion care in       the state of Colorado,'' Middleton said. ``We asked them to       be ready and to let us know if they could handle increased       capacity.''        Traveling for the procedure may still be out of reach for       some. Women without legal U.S. status might turn to abortion       medication, said Diana Gomez, advocacy manager with Progress       Texas, though even that option is in question.        Several Republican-led states have passed laws making it       harder to access the pills and banning prescriptions through       virtual health visits. Texas is considering similar       restrictions, which could force women to get pills by mail       for do-it-yourself abortions or other methods.        ``They are going to have to go underground and find       alternative means in our state,'' Gomez said.                        [From TIME, Sept. 23, 2021]     Florida Lawmaker Proposes Abortion Ban That Mimics Texas SB-8 Law         A Florida legislator has proposed banning most abortions in       the state and allowing lawsuits against doctors who violate       it, mirroring a Texas law that instituted the strictest       abortion restrictions in the U.S.        It wasn't immediately clear how much support the bill would       garner. The Republican-controlled Florida legislature has       shown significant support for tighter abortion policies, but       Governor Ron DeSantis said he hadn't reviewed this specific       proposal and the GOP House speaker was similarly noncommittal       on Wednesday.        The bill, proposed by state Representative Webster Barnaby,       a Republican, would require doctors in Florida to perform       tests to determine if a fetus has a detectable heartbeat       before performing an abortion.        If a physician detects a heartbeat, according to the bill,       abortion would be prohibited. The measure also would allow       doctors to be sued if suspected of performing an abortion       after detecting a heartbeat, matching a powerful provision in       the Texas law, known as Senate Bill Eight, or SB-8.        The bill appeared to be a clear example of a Texas copycat       law in another large, GOP-controlled state. In the days after       the Texas law took effect, abortion clinics turned away       hundreds of patients. It was seen by abortion-rights       supporters as an end-run around Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme       Court decision that has been the foundation of abortion       rights in the U.S. ever since.        Florida's Republican House Speaker Chris Sprowls said       through a spokesman that he supported stricter abortion       restrictions, but said that any bill brought to the floor       would have to withstand judicial scrutiny.        ``We look forward to bringing to the Floor a bill that       saves every unborn life possible,'' he said. ``I have asked       House Judiciary Committee Chairwoman Erin Grall and House       Health & Human Services Chairwoman Colleen Burton to review       the various proposals, look at other ideas, and take point on       this issue this Session.''        Still, the Florida proposal sparked immediate condemnation       from abortion rights advocates, who called legislation       unconstitutional and part of a flurry of harsh restrictions       on women's rights.        ``We are horrified to see anti-choice politicians in       Florida following in Texas' footsteps, and there's no       question that lawmakers hostile to reproductive freedom in       other states will do the same,'' Adrienne Kimmell, acting       president of Naral Pro-Choice America, said in a statement.        Early this month, a sharply divided U.S. Supreme Court       refused to block the Texas law, which outlaws most abortions       after six weeks of pregnancy. SB-8, bars abortion after a       fetal heartbeat can be detected and puts clinics at risk of       being shut down if they are found to be in violation.        Asked about Barnaby's bill on Wednesday in Kissimmee,       Desantis said he considered his record ``100% pro-life'' but       added that he had not seen it.        Desantis, a Republican seen as a potential presidential       candidate, has rejected coronavirus mask mandates and so-      called vaccine passports, saying his position is largely       about an individual's right to determine their healthcare       choices. He said Wednesday that the abortion question was       different because ``another life is at stake.''        Democratic candidates vying to replace Desantis in the 2022       election firmly opposed the legislation.        ``This is a direct attack on a woman's right to choose,''       Charlie Crist, a former governor, said on Twitter. ``We're       going to have to fight tooth and nail to protect reproductive       freedom.''
