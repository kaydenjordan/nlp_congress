 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  Judge Avern Cohn, who turns 95 years young today and marks 40 years of  service in the Eastern District of Michigan.   Although he has technically been on senior status for two decades,  Judge Cohn maintains a remarkably active docket, and his Chambers are a  landmark for anyone interested in an astounding range of history, legal  doctrine, and public policy.   I count myself among the many Michiganders, from all communities and  stations of life, who know room 218 is the place to go when you have a  particularly thorny problem to solve or need advice on a sensitive  matter. You just have to be ready because the judge dispenses his  wisdom unvarnished.   Judge Cohn's work ethic is legendary. In any room, he is generally  both the most well-read person on history, philosophy, culture, and  also, somehow, the most up to date on current affairs, as he devours  numerous newspapers and websites every day.   It is hard to overstate Judge Cohn's impact on the law and the people  who have passed through his courtroom, whether they be defendants,  attorneys, or staff. He has left an indelible imprint on so many lives.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Judge  Cohn on 40 years of service and in wishing him continued success.                            ____________________
