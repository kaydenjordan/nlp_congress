 Mr. Chair, our regional airports are vital for  connecting Americans and strengthening local economies. I represent a  district with four such airports, including the fastest growing air  cargo airport in the Nation. I am thrilled that this year's FAA  reauthorization provides resources for small and large airports alike.   Unfortunately, this bill is not perfect. It includes a shortsighted  provision to raise the pilot retirement age. It also doesn't go far  enough to support our aerospace workers.  [[Page H3715]]    This year, the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee heard from Collins  Aerospace located in my hometown of Rockford, Illinois. They emphasized  the importance of R&D funding right at home, but because of R&D  disinvestment, many companies are looking to European countries for R&D  opportunities.   When American companies go overseas to do their research, it means  jobs and talent go away. Our best and brightest in Illinois are ready  to bring humans to new heights. We in Congress must provide them with  the flexibility and resources to succeed.                                time  1330
