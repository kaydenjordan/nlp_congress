 Madam President, I am honored to recognize Georgia  Merrill of Brentwood as August's Granite Stater of the Month. For the  past 8 years, 14-year-old Georgia has raised tens of thousands of  dollars for the New Hampshire Food Bank through her Peach Project  initiative.   When Georgia was 6 years old and driving in a car with her  grandmother, she saw a homeless person on the side of the road holding  a sign that read, ``I'm hungry.'' It was a moment that stuck with her  and inspired her to give back to her community. She went home and asked  her mom if they could set up a bake sale with proceeds going to people  like the man she had just seen on the road.   Georgia--along with her mother Erin, her dad Josh, and brothers Owen  and Miles--started holding bake sales, with sales going to the NH Food  Bank. Georgia's nickname is Georgia Peach, and so they decided to name  the initiative the ``Georgia Peach Project.'' Georgia's parents were  touched by their daughter's commitment to helping those in need and  worked with Georgia to take the project even further. Georgia started  new projects, and they spread the word about them on social media and  got other families in their community involved.   Now, the project's various initiatives include making and selling  bracelets with proceeds going to the NH Food Bank, holding a food  collection, passing out cards to classmates at school encouraging them  to donate, and hosting a community holiday concert. In addition, every  year, they organize a holiday stroll partnering with local  organizations and families who commit to decorating a part of the walk.  The event also includes a bake sale, a silent auction, and live  entertainment--with all donations from the night going to the NH Food  Bank.   Since the start of the Peach Project, Georgia has raised more than  $66,000 for the NH Food Bank. Her commitment to serving her community  at such a young age is an inspiration for all of us. After she saw a  neighbor in need, it was clear to her that she needed to bring her  community together to do whatever it could do to help. Georgia's  ability to think about the needs of those around her and then act to  address them exemplifies the Granite State spirit of generosity, and  her work demonstrates that you can always make a difference by getting  involved in your community.                            ____________________
