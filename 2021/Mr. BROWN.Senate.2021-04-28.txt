 Madam President, reserving the right to object, no serious  economists across the ideological spectrum are concerned about  inflation right now. No one is hiding information at the White House.   I am in meetings all the time with White House officials talking  about this package. No one believes--first of all, no one is hiding  information. No one believes what the Senator, the junior Senator from  Florida, is saying about this.   Perhaps some millionaire Senators want to make this into an issue,  and I hear that over and over and over, but I talk to people like Jay  Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, nominated by President Trump for  that position. He, of course, keeps his eye on these kinds of things,  but he has expressed no strong concern about inflation.   And we even know that when some experts have been concerned, they  have been wrong. We saw what happened in 2008 after too many elites  worried about inflation. What we really needed was to increase wages  and get people back to work. The result from 2008 was a recovery that  was too slow for most people, while so many of these big costs  continued to rise.   Our economy looks a whole lot better today than it did last year, but  we can't compare where we are today with where we were last year. We  were on the brink of a once-in-a-generation health and economic crisis  at this time last year. Millions of people, mostly low-wage workers,  lost their jobs. Our economy ground to a halt as we tried to stop the  spread of the virus.   This year, we have made good progress with the American Rescue Plan,  as the Presiding Officer from Wisconsin knows, getting shots in arms  and money in pockets and kids back in school, people back to work.   But our recovery is far from over. Just moments ago Fed Chair Powell  said that we are seeing some temporary upticks because things were so  dire last year, but we still have a long way to go.   The bigger risk to the economy is not doing enough to raise workers'  wages and to invest in the infrastructure that allows our economy to  grow.   We know corporate leaders, we know millionaire Senators, we know  people at the top have done very--in many cases, have done very, very  well through this, but we know millions of workers, many of them hourly  workers, have lost jobs. We know millions of workers, so-called  essential workers--one essential worker said to me, works in a grocery  store: I don't feel essential. Frankly, I feel expendable because they  don't pay me much; they don't protect me at work. Those are the people  we should be looking after.   I want to raise wages. I want to bring down costs. That is exactly  what the jobs plan and the family plan will do--bring down healthcare  costs, make childcare more affordable, create more housing people can  afford, bring down energy bills, make work--getting to work cheaper and  easier with better transit. These are the costs that have been rising  and eating away at family budgets for decades.   If my colleague from Florida is so concerned about the cost of living  and raising a family, I hope he will join me to allow Medicare to  negotiate directly with drug companies to bring down prices for  seniors. I hope he will join us in investing in childcare to bring down  the cost of childcare. I hope he will join us as we work to create more  housing, bringing down housing costs. I hope he will join us to raise  the minimum wage.   My first speech on this floor 14 years ago--14 years ago, my first  speech on this floor was to raise the minimum wage, and we did, and it  hasn't been raised since. That is what the Senator from Florida and the  Senator from Indiana can help us with.   But we know most of the conservative elites in this country--most  won't say out loud what this inflation alarmism is really about. They  don't want to invest in the American people. They don't want to do  anything to make Americans' hard work pay off. They would rather try to  scare people: Can't spend this money because there might be inflation.   They don't want us to do what too many have failed to do: put money  in people's pockets and raise wages and rebuild infrastructure.   I would ask my colleagues to listen to the words of a worker from  West Virginia, Pamela Garrison. She testified at our first-ever work  listening session, our ``Dignity of Work'' session in the Banking and  Housing Committee yesterday. She said:         We're seeing corporations make billions every quarter in       profit, but then when we ask for a minimum wage raise, we're       told that ``no that will raise the cost of stuff, oh that'll       cost jobs.''    Funny, corporate executives never seem to say they will have to raise  prices when they give themselves bonuses. It is just we will have to  raise prices if we increase the minimum wage.   This same Ms. Garrison also said: You know, they call me part of the  working poor. The words ``working'' and ``poor'' shouldn't be in the  same sentence, and she is right about that.   Real expenses for most families have gone up for decades, along with  corporate profits and the stock market. Executive compensation has  exploded upward, and workers' wages haven't kept up.   Executive compensation--productivity is up. Executive compensation is  up. Profits are up. Workers' wages are flat. That is the problem. That  is what we should be working on.   I object    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 10 minutes.    Madam President, today we mark Workers Memorial Day, when  we honor and remember workers who have laid down their lives on the  job.   I have worn on my lapel since I was in the House, a pin depicting a  canary in a bird cage given to me at a Workers Memorial Day rally in  Lorain, OH, in the late 1990s.   This pin depicts a canary going down in the mine. It suggests the  mine worker taking a canary down in the mines. If the canary died from  lack of oxygen or from toxic gas, the mine worker got out of the mines.  He had no union strong enough to protect him and no government that  cared enough to protect him in those days.   To me, this pin represents the role of government to support the  middle class and those who aspire to the middle class. It represents  the progress we have made and the society we continue to fight for  every day here.   We know the story. Coal miners took the canary down into the mines.  Throughout the 20th century, we have worked to change that. We passed  workers safety laws and overtime pay. We banned child labor. We passed  clean air and safe drinking water laws. We enacted Social Security and  Medicare and workers' rights and women's rights and civil rights.   But despite that progress over the last year, too many workers have  felt a whole lot like those miners. They have felt like they are on  their own.   A moment ago, I mentioned a grocery store worker in Cincinnati, who  said: ``They tell me I am essential, but I feel expendable.''   That grocery store worker and thousands of others have been on the  frontlines of this pandemic, risking their lives so Americans could  keep food on their table and get their packages delivered. They were  changing linens in hospitals and driving buses and stocking shelves in  supermarkets.   Then workers go home at night and are anxious that they might spread  the virus and infect their family.   We know that hundreds of thousands of workers have been exposed to  the virus on the job. Thousands have died. It is hard to get an exact  count of how many because the previous administration didn't bother to  keep track.   We know that food and commercial workers reported last summer that  more than 16,000 grocery store workers have been exposed, more than 100  have died. We know those numbers keep going up.   The National Nurses United has recorded at least 3,200 healthcare  workers have died. In meatpacking plants, the toll has been horrific.   Last summer, 16,000 workers had been infected; the vast majority of  them Black and Brown workers. More than 230 died.   And yet all of last year, the Trump administration and too many large  corporations failed to protect their workers. The corporate lawyers  that ran the Labor Department from the top down refused to issue  workplace safety requirements   Corporations ran a lot of feel-good TV ads saying thank you to  essential workers, claiming these workers are the heart of their  companies, but workers didn't ask for a PR campaign. They needed  protections on the job.   This Workers Memorial Day, today--we celebrate it every year--we  remember the American workers who have lost their lives on the job from  this virus, sometimes from gun violence, sometimes from workplace  accidents.   We honor them best by fighting to protect these workers and their  fellow workers to make their hard work pay off.   Yesterday, in the Banking and Housing Committee, we held the  committee's first-ever listening session. It was purely a listening  session. No Senators got to ask questions. We just came to listen, with  workers from Ohio and around the country, to hear how the financial  system affects their jobs and their lives.   They shared powerful stories about their work, about how companies  and economic policies prevent their hard work from paying off.   We heard from a distribution worker in Ashtabula County, OH. He told  us:         We rarely go a few weeks without an injury, largely because       of the insane pace we work at. We have suggested that slowing       the pace even just a little would improve safety and could       save money, to which we were told, ``Injuries don't cost the       company much money.''    We heard from a Wells Fargo call center worker who talked about how  the bank misclassified her to avoid paying overtime. They put her on  salary. They said she was management. They worked her more than 40  hours. They never paid her an overtime dollar.   We heard from a full-time gig worker who works for multiple  corporations like Uber and Instacart. He works full time. He has zero  benefits because these companies claim he is an independent contractor.   We heard from a Michigan worker who lost her job when a private  equity firm bought out her company. They laid off 3,100 workers in the  Detroit area, and they pocketed the money.   We heard from a worker in West Virginia who talked about working her  whole life and never seeing that hard work pay off. She said the term  ``working poor'' should not be two words that go together.   If you work hard, you should be able to get ahead in this country. If  you love this country, you fight for the people who make it work.   If even the global pandemic, where America's workers have been on the  frontlines--if even that won't get corporations to rethink their  business model that treats workers as expendable, it is time to stop  letting them run the economy. That is what the new Banking, Housing,  and Urban Affairs Committee is all about. Wall Street had its chance.  They failed. If corporate America won't deliver for its workers, then  we have to create a better system centered on the dignity of work. That  means safe workplaces.   The Biden administration is taking steps toward finally issuing an  OSHA emergency temporary standard. We went a whole year in the pandemic  where the President of the United States simply refused and the  corporate lawyer who ran the Department of Labor simply refused to  issue any standards on workplace safety. Think about that. Now it means  laws and policies will reward work, like the earned income tax credit  and the child tax credit--the junior Senator from New Hampshire is here  and has been supportive of that; a strong overtime rule; ending  misclassification that robs workers of their wages and their rights. It  means a strong labor movement. Unions give people power on the job.  People ought to have the option, if they choose, of joining a union,  allowing them to join together to make their workplace safer.   It is workers who make our economy successful. It is workers who  allow corporations and Wall Street investors to rake in record profits.  It is time for that hard work to pay off for all workers, no matter if  you punch a clock or work for salary or work for tips or take care of  your parents or take care of  [[Page S2282]]  your children. Work should be rewarded in this country. When you love  this country, you fight for the people who make it work on Workers  Memorial Day and the other 364 days of the year.   Madam President, I yield the floor                         nomination of samantha power     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
