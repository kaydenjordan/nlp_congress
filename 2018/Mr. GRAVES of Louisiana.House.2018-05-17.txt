 Mr. Chairman, when other militaries  challenge the United States' military might, we invest more dollars,  just like we did a few months ago in our military.   When the Panama Canal was widened and deepened, we invested more  dollars in our ports so we would remain competitive. When other  countries have lowered tax rates, we lower ours to  [[Page H4177]]  make sure that we remain competitive and we can defend our folks.   Mr. Chairman, I represent thousands of farmers from Louisiana who  depend upon this crop. If we pass this amendment, the precedent that it  sets rolling into other types of crops will devastate American farmers.   This amendment is a flawed amendment. It is going to undermine our  agriculture industry across the United States. I urge opposition.
