 I would ask unanimous consent that, at the end of my  remarks, the scheduled vote take place.    Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Budget  Committee, I want to say a few words about some of the important  budgetary issues that Congress is now facing. I want to focus on the  $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, but before I do that, I want to  comment on the looming debt crisis that we face.   The Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, this morning once again  reiterated that the Republican Party will not vote to lift the debt  ceiling; and in an extraordinarily irresponsible manner, Republicans  have indicated that they will not pay the debts incurred under the  Trump administration.   In his statement, as he has done time and time again, Senator  McConnell implies that this debt ceiling has something to do with  future spending. It does not.   In his statement, as he has done time and time again, Senator  McConnell implies that this debt ceiling has something to do with  future spending. It does not. Like anyone who owns a credit card, the  payments that are made are for past spending--in this case, spending  incurred under the Trump administration.   Let us be clear. If the United States, the largest economy in the  world, defaults on its debt, it will plunge not only our country but  the entire global economy into what could become a severe economic  depression. That means massive unemployment, higher interest rates,  severe reduction in government services, and possible cuts in such  programs as Social Security and Medicare.   The irresponsibility of the Republican leadership is not just  something that I worry about. According to press reports, former  Republican Secretaries of Treasury Hank Paulson, who worked under  George W. Bush, and Steven Mnuchin, who worked under Donald Trump-- Republican Secretaries of the Treasury--both of them visited with  Senator McConnell to make the case about the need to extend the debt  ceiling. They understand, as I think all of  [[Page S6641]]  us do, how important it is that the United States of America does not  default on its debt, and it is about time that my Republican colleagues  listen to them.   Now, let me say a word about the $3\1/2\ trillion reconciliation  bill. There has been a lot of talk lately about the need to compromise.  Well, let me be clear. To a very significant degree, that has already  taken place. Of the 11 Democratic members of the Senate Budget  Committee, 9 understood the need for a $6 trillion bill, which would  finally address the unmet needs--the long-ignored needs--of the working  families of our country, as well as begin the process of tackling the  existential threat of climate change. My guess is that at least 40 out  of the 50 Members of the Democratic caucus supported the $6 trillion  proposal. We compromised big time. We cut that proposal--agreed to cut  that proposal--almost in half, down to $3\1/2\ trillion. That, to my  mind, is a major, major compromise.   As we go forward in this debate, let me be as clear as I can be as to  why every penny of that $3\1/2\ trillion is absolutely needed, and let  me also make clear that this bill, despite some of the rhetoric coming  from my Republican colleagues, will not add--should not add and will  not add one nickel to the deficit.   It will be paid for. It will be paid for by finally demanding that  some of the wealthiest people in this country, who in any given year-- we are talking about multibillionaires who in a given year do not pay a  nickel in Federal income tax or dozens of large, profitable  corporations that in a given year do not pay a nickel in Federal income  tax. Well, we are going to demand that these people start paying their  fair share of taxes, and that is more than enough money to cover the  $3\1/2\ trillion that is in this proposal. So anyone who suggests to  you that this bill is not going to be paid for and that it is going to  add to the deficit is simply not telling the truth. It should and will  be fully paid for.   Now, the media is very worried about process. When are we going to do  this? What about that person? What about that Senator? But they have  forgotten to a large degree to talk about what is in the bill. I am not  quite sure that the average American is staying up nights, worrying  about whether it is completed on a Wednesday or a Friday or what this  Senator thinks or what that Senator thinks; they would like to know  what is in the bill.   The reality is that for many, many decades, while Congress has paid  rapt attention to the needs of the wealthy and large campaign  contributors, it has significantly ignored the needs of working  families, the middle-class, and low-income people. I think the reason  that many of my Republican colleagues are so upset about this  legislation is that we are changing the dynamic. We are now beginning  to pay attention to the needs of working families and not just the  wealthy and the powerful.   So what is in this bill? First, as a result of the extraordinarily  successful American Rescue Plan, which went a long way to pull this  country out of the severe economic decline that we experienced as a  result of the COVID pandemic, as a result of the American Rescue Plan,  we cut childhood poverty in the United States of America by over 50  percent, and for Black and Brown families, that cut was even higher.   Year after year, the United States has the highest rate of childhood  poverty of any major country on Earth. We took a major step forward in  cutting childhood poverty. Now it is clear to me and I think to people  all across this country that we must extend the $300-a-month-per-child  direct payment that working-class and middle-class families now  receive.   Let me be very clear. If we do not pass the reconciliation bill and  not continue those payments, we would once again plunge the children of  this country, millions of them, back into poverty, and that is morally  unacceptable.    Furthermore, in the United States of America, every person should be  outraged by the dysfunctionality of our childcare system. I don't think  there is anybody who disagrees with that. We have millions of people  who cannot find childcare. We have families in Vermont and Maine paying  20, 30, 40 percent of their limited incomes for childcare, which is  pretty crazy. We have childcare workers who are employed at starvation  wages. The system is not working. It is broken. It is dysfunctional.   It is not a radical idea to say that every family in America, when  mom goes to work and dad goes to work, should be entitled to high- quality and affordable childcare. There are a lot of studies out there  that say that the best investment we can make of Federal dollars is to  our children, and that is why we have got to expand what we are doing  in childcare. Under this legislation, no working family in this country  will be paying more than 7 percent of their income for childcare. So if  you are paying 20 percent now or you are paying 30 percent, we will  reduce that to no more than 7 percent.   On top of that and of extraordinary significance, we are going to  make pre-K education for 3- and 4-year-olds universal and free, and we  are going to do, bottom line, what almost every other industrialized  country on Earth does and understand that the most important investment  we can make is in our children.   By the way, importantly, when we do that, we are going to allow well  over a million women to go back into the workforce because they no  longer will have to stay home because of a lack of affordable  childcare. So if you are worried about labor shortages all over this  country, you must support significantly expanding our childcare  capabilities.   Further, what is in this legislation is, at a time when the  pharmaceutical industry charges us the highest prices in the world for  prescription drugs, we are going to demand that Medicare start  negotiating prescription drugs with the pharmaceutical industry.   I know that Americans now have seen a lot of the ads--the completely  dishonest ads from the pharmaceutical industry, and let's be clear.  Over the last 20 years, the pharmaceutical industry has spent well over  $4 billion on lobbying and hundreds and hundreds of millions more on  campaign contributions. Guess what. They own the U.S. Congress. And  that is why--when you walk into a pharmacy and you find that the price  of your medicine has doubled, it is because they can do anything they  want to do. They write the laws. They, right now, have 1,400 lobbyists  running all over Capitol Hill, trying to make sure that we do not lower  the cost of prescription drugs. And that is what this struggle is  about.   These guys, year after year, make outrageous profits. Their CEOs get  extraordinary compensation benefits, and they do that by charging us by  far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Well, those  days are coming to an end if Members of the Congress finally have the  guts to stand up to them.   Now, I understand that the pharmaceutical industry owns the  Republican Party. I got that. And I understand that there will not be  one Republican in the Senate who has the guts to stand up for his or  her constituents and lower the cost of prescription drugs. Well, there  should not be any Democrat who is in that position. There should be no  Democrats who are not prepared to stand up to the pharmaceutical  industry.   When we have Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices, we can save  over $500 billion. One of the things we are going to do with that $500  billion is do what the American people desperately want us to do, and  that is to expand Medicare to cover dental, vision, and hearing aids.  This is the United States. Elderly people should not walk around  without any teeth in their mouths. They should be able to afford to go  to a dentist. It is not a very radical idea. Grandparents should be  able to communicate with their grandchildren because they have a  hearing aid that they need in their ears that today they cannot afford.  Older people should be able to read their daily newspaper because they  can get a pair of glasses that works for them.   The need to expand Medicare to cover dental, hearing aids, and  eyeglasses is absolutely critical. Nobody in the year 2021 denies that  oral health, hearing, and vision are essential parts of healthcare.  Medicare is supposed to cover the healthcare needs of seniors. Well,  oral health, hearing, and vision are parts of healthcare.   Not surprisingly, out of all of the provisions in President Biden's  Build Back Better plan, expanding Medicare to provide dental, vision,  and hearing  [[Page S6642]]  aids is by far the most popular. According to a June 30 Morning Consult  poll, adding dental, vision, and hearing benefits to Medicare is  supported by 84 percent of the American people. It is not often you get  84 percent of the American people supporting anything. And yet that  includes 89 percent of Democrats, 79 percent of Republicans. This is  what the American people want, and this is what we must deliver for  them.    Given that, it is just hard for me to imagine that any Member of the  House or Senate would oppose this very popular and important provision.   It is a bit embarrassing that our Nation, the richest on Earth, is  the only major country not to guarantee paid family and medical leave.  I have been all over this country, and I have met with women--low- income women--who are forced to go back to work 1 week after having  their baby because they need the income. We are the only major country  on Earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave, not to make  sure that a mom can stay home with her sick kid or a dad can spend time  with his dying father or mother.   This legislation finally does what should have been done a long, long  time ago and guarantees paid family and medical leave.   And what this legislation does is address the reality that many of  our younger people are unable to obtain the good-paying jobs that are  out there because they lack the ability to get a higher education.   Now, my own view is we should make public colleges and universities  tuition free. My own view is we should cancel all student debt in this  country. That is not in this bill. But what is in this bill is the  reality that every American will have the right to get at least 2 years  of community college tuition free. And they can use that to get the  training they need for jobs. They can use that to accumulate credits  that can be transferred to a 4-year college, if that is what they  desire.   A few blocks away from here and in every major city in America, there  are Americans sleeping out on the streets. They are veterans. They are  people with all kinds of issues. They are working people who simply  cannot afford the housing in their community. Two blocks away from the  U.S. Capitol there is an encampment of homeless people. Six hundred  thousand Americans are homeless today, and on top of that, we have some  18 million households that spend 50 percent of their limited incomes on  housing.   In other words, we have a major housing crisis. This legislation  addresses that, and, in an unprecedented manner, invests in low-income  and affordable housing. And when we do that, by the way, we create a  whole lot of good-paying jobs.   We are an aging society. And whether people have severe disabilities  or whether they are just getting old, people would rather stay at home  in many cases rather than be forced into nursing homes. What our  legislation will do is to significantly improve home healthcare in this  country and make sure that those people who provide that important  service, that difficult service, are adequately compensated, because  today they are not. We need more of those workers, and we need to pay  them decent wages.   I am sadly aware that many of my Republican colleagues do not believe  that climate change is real or, at the very least, don't believe that  we should do anything about it. But they are dead wrong. In my view, we  cannot go home and look our children and grandchildren in the eye  knowing what we know and knowing that the scientists are telling us  that we have a very, very few years to address the climate crisis or  else there will be irreparable harm done in our country and around the  world.   We have turned on the TV this past summer, and we saw the  unbelievable fires in Oregon and California and learned that in Siberia  their fires were larger than all the other fires combined; smoke went  thousands of miles. We learned that July was the hottest month ever and  that climate is exacerbating extreme weather disturbances like  Hurricane Ida, which brought havoc to Louisiana.   This legislation that we are proposing does not go as far as I think  it should on climate. But make no mistake about it. It is a major,  major step forward in transforming our energy system away from fossil  fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.   So that is where we are right now. We are at a moment where millions  and millions of Americans have lost faith in their government. They  think that we are incapable of addressing their needs, that all we do  is listen to wealthy campaign contributors and the lobbyists and the  billionaire class.   The question we face right now is, At this moment, do we have the  courage to keep faith with the American people and show them that their  democracy in fact can work for them and not just powerful special  interests?   So let us go forward. Let us do the right thing. Let us pass this  $3\1/2\ trillion reconciliation package.   With that, I yield the floor.    I would ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022  congressional budget resolution, included an instruction to the  chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to file enforceable  levels in the Senate in the event the budget was agreed to without the  need to appoint a committee of conference on the measure. On Wednesday,  August 11, 2021, the Senate passed the budget resolution, and the House  of Representatives passed it without changes on August 24. As such,  today, I submit the required filing.   Specifically, section 4006 of the fiscal year 2022 congressional  budget resolution allows the chairman to file an allocation for fiscal  year 2022 for the Committee on Appropriations and an allocation for  fiscal years 2022, 2022 through 2026, and 2022 through 2031 for  committees other than the Committee on Appropriations. The figures  included in this filing are consistent with the levels included in S.  Con. Res. 14.   For purposes of enforcing the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule, which is  found in section 4106 of the fiscal year 2018 congressional budget  resolution, I am resetting the Senate's scorecard to zero for all  fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.
