 Mr. Speaker, most of you have probably never heard of  Cedar Hill, Texas, but you know their story. A gunman walks into a  hospital, which should be a place of healing, and instead inflicts  immeasurable pain and trauma.   That is the story of Cedar Hill on July 25, 2023, a terrifying day  for my constituents but an ordinary day for America, at least the  America of today where guns are gods and people are pawns, the America  where the gun lobby wins and we the people lose.   People lose their lives. They lose a sense of sanity. We all lose a  sense of security.   Make no mistake, when the radical right wins, we the people lose our  rights.   They have no clue what it means to be truly pro-life. If they did,  they would write or at least support legislation that meets the moment,  a moment full of death and destruction that is crying out for solutions  and sanity.                            ____________________
