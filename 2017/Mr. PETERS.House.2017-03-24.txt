 Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress ready to help improve our  healthcare system. And as our colleagues on Chairman Walden's side have  pointed out, there are some insurance markets that aren't providing the  choice and the low cost that consumers want, so let's fix them.   But that is not what this bill does. This bill takes away health  insurance from 24 million Americans, including 37,000 people in my  district in San Diego. And the last-minute changes made will cost the  Federal Government even more money, without increasing coverage or  reducing premiums. Is that really the best we can do?   The only reason we are in this mess is because the Speaker of the  House only ever sought 218 Republican votes. That is why we are left  with a bill that is opposed by doctors, nurses, hospitals, and just  about everyone because it makes the problems in our healthcare systems  worse, not better. That is what happens when you never even reach out  to the other side.    Whether this bill dies today, or in the Senate, I hope we can get to  work together, Republicans and Democrats, to do better for the American  people.
