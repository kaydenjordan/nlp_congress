 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Protecting  Our Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act of 2023.   Since President Biden took office and Secretary Mayorkas took charge  of the Homeland Security Department, the United States has seen 7.5  million encounters nationwide, 6.2 million encounters at the Southwest  border, and 1.7 million known got-aways who evaded U.S. Border Patrol.    New York City is where many of these 1.7 million got-aways now live,  and that is because of two policy choices: the administration's open  border policy and New York's sanctuary city policies.   Instead of changing his open border policies, President Biden has  decided the way they are going to fix this mess is to lease Federal  land, national parks, to build tent cities.   Are they kidding me?   Mr. Chair, this is not the solution. We also need to be  disincentivizing sanctuary city policies, and I believe we should end  Federal funding for the purpose of aiding this crisis in those  jurisdictions.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation.
