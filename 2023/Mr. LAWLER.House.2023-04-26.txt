 Mr. Speaker, throughout this debate, I have had three  basic parameters: The President and the majority leader must negotiate  with the Speaker. We must cut spending. And we must not default.   This bill, the Limit, Save, Grow Act, is a beginning and puts the  President and Senate majority leader on notice: The days of one-party  rule are over. The American people elected a House Republican majority  to serve as a check and balance on the reckless, out-of-control  spending that was the hallmark of the last 2 years: $5 trillion in new  spending, $10 trillion total, a 41-year record high on inflation,  skyrocketing energy costs, America saddled with over $31 trillion in  debt and counting.   It cannot continue.   This bill would save Americans $4.8 trillion over the next decade. It  would restore FY22 spending, which every Democrat previously voted for  and supported.   If it was good 4 months ago, why is it not today?   It would cap future spending at 1 percent per year. It would claw  back billions in unspent COVID funds, which the President has  acknowledged COVID is now over. It would stop the hiring of 87,000 new  IRS agents and employees. It would restore work requirements on able- bodied Americans, requirements previously championed by President Joe  Biden and President Bill Clinton. Finally, it would unleash American  energy, increasing domestic production while reducing costs for  consumers and ending our reliance on foreign oil.   Simply put, we cannot continue to borrow and print new money at the  levels this administration has. Republicans and Democrats must come  together to rein in spending, protect vital programs like Social  Security and Medicare, reduce inflation, and avoid default.    Mr. Speaker, this bill begins the conversation, and  President Biden and Senator Schumer must now come to the negotiating  table and work with Speaker McCarthy in good faith to move our country  forward and restore fiscal sanity and solvency.
