 Madam Speaker, my new district is actually where Susan B.  Anthony, a pro-life woman Republican who got us our right to vote,  actually was tried for voting. I am just happy and proud to represent  that district.   We are elected Representatives. We should respect the Constitution  and due process by debating these issues through regular order, getting  the input from the people we represent, not the political partisans on  one side or the other.   If we allow the majority to undermine constitutional safeguards for  an imagined and fake emergency, they will create more imagined  emergencies in the future to violate and undermine our constitutional  principles and the right of the people to have a voice through  representative government.   The law is clear. For years, the Supreme Court has consistently found  that Americans continue to have access to many safe forms of  contraceptives. Yet, we are here today, listening to another imagined  emergency to try to repeal this right. The right to contraception is  safe. This is not an emergency.   Justice Alito's majority decision in Dobbs versus Jackson was clear.  The decision to return the issue of abortion to the States does not  impact other issues like marriage or contraception as stated numerous  times by Justice Alito in his opinion.   The real reason we are here today is because some of our colleagues  would like to distract and scare the American people and score cheap  political points rather than tackle the bread-and-butter issues  affecting all Americans.   The majority won't admit that their radical spending and war on  energy have driven inflation and gas prices to record levels.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
