 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Jessica Cochran of Blaine County for her entrepreneurship  and creativity during these challenging times.   The COVID-19 outbreak has impacted so many Montana small business  owners and local communities. During these challenging times, it is  tougher than ever for new entrepreneurs to open up shop.   Jessica, a sixth grade teacher at Harlem Elementary School, however  took the initiative to start up her own ice cream truck business this  summer to spread some cheer to her community during these hard times.   Jessica started Bliss Ice Cream, after acquiring and renovating a  1985 Chevy Astro van. Jessica also secured all the necessary permits  and licenses as an independent contractor and food vendor for the  summer. Owning an ice cream truck has been a dream of hers since a  child. She has taken the initiative to purchase all the necessary  supplies and decorations for the children of Harlem and the Fort  Belknap area.   It is my honor to recognize Jessica for taking the bold initiative to  pursue her dream and bring some much needed joy to the children of her  community. As a teacher and a new entrepreneur,  [[Page S4214]]  Jessica is a great role model for all of her students and the folks of  Blaine County.                            ____________________
