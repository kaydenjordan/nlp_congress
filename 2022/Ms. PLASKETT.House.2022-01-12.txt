 Mr. Speaker, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans  have repeatedly taken a stand against the truth and common sense by  devoting themselves to the big lie, flip-flopping from previous  positions with the aim of satisfying a virulent base to obtain power,  defending the January 6 insurrection, and protecting violate radical  extremists, passing dozens of anti-voting laws across the country,  taking up dangerous and destructive efforts to take over and sabotage  future elections, all with the aim of staying in power at the expense  of democracy and what our Founders held dear.   The flip-flop continues with the filibuster. Let's be clear. Mitch  McConnell has a long record of changing the rules whenever it suits  him, and he continues to mislead about the filibuster. There have been  more than 161 changes made to the filibuster in the last five decades,  with the filibuster altered to pass trade deals, tax cuts, and Supreme  Court justices.   The filibuster is not in the Constitution, and the Founders only  mentioned supermajority for impeachment.   They must do better on the other side of the aisle and the other side  of this Capitol.
