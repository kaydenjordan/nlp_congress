 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address concerns about the  Colorado River drought contingency plan and to sound the alarm and  avoid a public health crisis at the Salton Sea in southern California.   To be clear, I support the goals of the DCP, which outlines voluntary  water use cuts across seven Western States in the event of a worsening  drought. However, I am concerned that the current proposal to implement  the DCP provides an expansive waiver to the Bureau of Reclamation that  could result in the reduction of water to the Salton Sea.   The Salton Sea is the largest inland body of water in all of  California, and its very existence is already at risk. Ensuring the  Salton Sea is protected as part of this agreement is critically  important because, if the Salton Sea decline accelerates, thousands of  lake beds will become exposed, subjecting residents of southern  California to harmful dust that penetrates the lungs and can cause  severe respiratory illness.   I look forward to working with the Natural Resources Committee to  find a solution that prevents a broad waiver of Federal laws and that  preserves water rights and critical environmental protections for its  surrounding residents.   Madam Speaker, I support the goals of the DCP. However, I cannot in  good conscience support implementation in a way that harms the Salton  Sea or threatens the health of the people I serve.                            ____________________
