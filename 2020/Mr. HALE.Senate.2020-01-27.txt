 We've often heard at the State Department that       the President of the United States wants to make sure that       foreign assistance is reviewed scrupulously and make sure       that it is truly in the U.S. national interests and that we       evaluate it continuously and that it meets certain criteria       the President has established.         The principle of fair burden-sharing by allies       and other like-minded states is an important element of the       foreign assistance review.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The President expressed these precise concerns  to Senator Ron Johnson, who wrote:         He reminded me how thoroughly corrupt Ukraine was and again       conveyed his frustration that Europe doesn't do its fair       share of providing military aid.    The House managers didn't tell you about this. Why not? And President  Trump was right to be concerned that other countries weren't paying  their fair share. As Laura Cooper testified, U.S. contributions to  Ukraine are far more significant than any individual country, and she  also said EU funds tend to be on the economic side rather than for  defense and security. Senator Johnson also confirmed that other  countries refused to provide the lethal defensive weapons that Ukraine  needs in its war with Russia.   Please keep in mind also that the pause of the Ukraine security  assistance program was far from unusual or out of character for  President Trump. The American people know that the President is  skeptical of foreign aid and that one of his top campaign promises and  priorities in office has been to avoid wasteful spending of American  taxpayer dollars abroad.   Meanwhile, the same people who today claimed that President Trump was  not genuinely concerned about burden-sharing were upset when, as a  candidate, President Trump criticized free-riding by NATO members.   This past summer, the administration paused, reviewed, and in some  cases canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid to  Afghanistan, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and Lebanon. These are  just some of the reviews of foreign aid undertaken at the very same  time that the Ukraine aid was paused.   So what happened during the brief period of time while the Ukraine  security assistance was paused? People were gathering information and  monitoring the facts on the ground in Ukraine as the new Parliament was  sworn in and began introducing anti-corruption legislation.   Notwithstanding what the House managers would have you believe, the  reason for the pause was no secret within the White House and the  agencies. According to Mr. Morrison, in a July meeting attended by  officials throughout the executive branch agencies, the reason provided  for the pause by a representative of the Office of Management and  Budget was that the President was concerned about corruption in Ukraine  and he wanted to make sure Ukraine was doing enough to manage that  corruption. In fact, as Mr. Morrison testified, by Labor Day, there had  been definitive developments to demonstrate that President Zelensky was  committed to the issues he campaigned on: anti-corruption reforms.   Mr. Morrison also testified that the administration was working on  answering the President's concerns regarding burden-sharing. Here is  Mr. Morrison.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
