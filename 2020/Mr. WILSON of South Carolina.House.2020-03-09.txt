 Mr. Speaker, in the February jobs  report, job numbers remain strong. Jeff Cox with CNBC wrote an article  titled: ``Job Growth Smashes Expectations for February As Unemployment  Falls Back to 3.5 Percent.'' This title reflects the 273,000 jobs  created in February, smashing the expectation of 175,000 additions.   The article also said: ``The Labor Department reported . . . that the  U.S. economy added 273,000 new jobs during the month, while the  unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, matching its lowest level in more  than 50 years.''   I am grateful that for African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian  Americans there is record low unemployment with record opportunities to  achieve jobs. President Trump is continuing his record of promises  made, promises kept. This is clear with the release of the February  report of 273,000 more jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
