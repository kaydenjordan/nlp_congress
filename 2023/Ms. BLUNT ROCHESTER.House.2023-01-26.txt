 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk,  amendment No. 71.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment that  ensures that, under the rule of construction, nothing in this  legislation may be understood to repudiate the fact that greenhouse gas  emissions must be reduced significantly in order to meet our global  agreement under the Paris Agreement.   Specifically, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by half from  2005 levels by 2030, and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions must be  achieved by 2050 to meet this commitment.   We need legislative action that brings us closer to achieving our  emissions goals, not further from it. In Delaware, as the State with  the lowest mean elevation in the country, we feel the impacts of  climate change every single day.   From our environmental justice communities in Wilmington, where when  it rains, it floods; to our farmers, who must adjust to rising  temperatures and deal with saltwater intrusion; to our coastal  communities, where a sea level rise is an imminent threat to our homes,  our economy, and our natural resources, we in Delaware are living among  the escalating effects of climate change.   I know Delawareans are not alone in this. Wildfires and drought  continue to ravage our Western States, and hurricanes are becoming more  frequent and stronger across the Gulf Coast and East Coast.   All of us are feeling the impacts of climate change, which is why we  must all work together to satisfy our commitment under the Paris  Agreement to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. We need  legislation that doesn't force us backward but, instead, propels us  forward to a cleaner, safer, and more sustainable planet.   Mr. Chair, I urge the support of all of my colleagues on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
