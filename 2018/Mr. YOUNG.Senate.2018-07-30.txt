 Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to Dr.  George Shambaugh. George is an associate professor of international  affairs and government in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service  at Georgetown University. However, over the last year, he served as a  fellow on my national security team.   George supported my work related to foreign policy and development,  including my work on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. George is  an exceptionally accomplished and impressive individual who made a  significant and durable contribution. His contributions related to  economic statecraft, geopolitical energy issues, and transatlantic  security have been particularly valuable. It is rare to find such an  accomplished and intelligent individual who also brings a humble and  eager desire to help however needed.   George will be returning to his post at Georgetown, where I know he  will continue to excel as a scholar and professor. I wish him the best  in the future, and I look forward to staying in touch with him.                            ____________________
