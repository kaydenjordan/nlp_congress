 Mr. Speaker, this is the second in the series  of House floor speeches by me on the recent Presidential elections.   Previously, I covered constitutional and Federal statutory law  mandating that Congress--not the Supreme Court--decides whether to  accept or reject States' electoral college vote submissions.   Today's remarks focus on who decides a Presidential election if no  candidate receives an electoral college majority vote because of a tie,  because multiple candidates split the electoral college vote, or  because Congress rejected State electoral college votes.   Per the United States Constitution's 12th Amendment, Congress--not  the Supreme Court--elects the next President and Vice President of the  United States if no candidate wins an electoral college vote majority.  Congress' decision is final, determinative, and nonreviewable.   The 12th Amendment states that if no candidate has a majority of the  electoral college vote, then, from the three highest vote-getters for  President, ``the House of Representatives shall choose immediately by  ballot the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be  taken by States, the representation from each State having one vote . .  . and a majority of all of the States shall be necessary to a choice.''   As an aside, the 12th Amendment requires the Senate to elect the Vice  President. There is a twist in the House vote for President. A majority  of Congressmen does not elect the President. Rather, the House votes by  State delegations to elect the next President of the United States.   America has 50 States. After the 2020 elections, 26 State delegations  have a Republican majority. Twenty States have a Democrat majority. The  remaining State delegations are tied 50/50, with Iowa undecided pending  an uncalled election.   Hence, if Congress rejects electoral college votes from States with  election processes that are so badly flawed as to be unreliable and  unworthy of acceptance, House Republicans control the election of the  next President of the United States.   Let me repeat that for emphasis. House Republicans control the  election of the next President of the United States.    For emphasis, the 12th Amendment has, on occasion, resulted in  Congress electing the next President of the United States.   For example, in 1824, Andrew Jackson led the electoral college with  99 votes, to 85 votes for John Quincy Adams, to 41 votes for William  Crawford, to 37 votes for House Speaker Henry Clay. The House elected  second place finisher John Quincy Adams President of the United States  over first place finisher Andrew Jackson, prompting Andrew Jackson to  famously declare, ``The Judas of the West has closed the contract and  will receive the 30 pieces of silver . . . Was there ever witnessed  such a bare faced corruption in any country before?''   Another example is the 1876 election, wherein Democrat Samuel Tilden  won the popular vote and amassed 184 electoral college votes, one shy  of Ohio Republican Rutherford B. Hayes' 185 electoral college votes.   Louisiana's, Florida's, and South Carolina's electoral college votes  were disputed because it strained credibility to believe these States  voted Republican while still suffering from the destructive effects of  a Republican-led invasion during the Civil War. Congress appointed a  15-member commission to study the matter, which split on party lines:  eight Republicans for Hayes, seven Democrats for Tilden.   Congress then elected Hayes President of the United States in a deal  that gave Louisiana's, Florida's, and South Carolina's disputed  electoral college votes to Hayes in exchange for removing occupying  Union troops from the South and ending reconstruction.   In sum, the history and law are clear: Congress, not the Supreme  Court, determines who wins or loses Presidential elections.                            ____________________
