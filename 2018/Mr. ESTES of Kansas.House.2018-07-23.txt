 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  5613, to designate the Quindaro Townsite in Kansas City, Kansas, a  national commemorative site.   Quindaro was founded in 1857 to provide a safe haven for antislavery  activists moving into Kansas during the struggle to help make the  territory a free State. Located on the banks of the Missouri River, the  site quickly became a vital port and a stop on the Underground  Railroad. Although the town dwindled after Kansas became a State,  Quindaro's short but rich history is an important reminder of Kansas'  role in our Nation's history.   Currently, the site sits on the National Register of Historic Places.  However, designating Quindaro a national commemorative site would  qualify the downtown for additional Federal assistance as Quindaro  pursues the ultimate goal of being a national historic landmark.   H.R. 5613 is a great step forward in that process and will help  preserve an important piece of Kansas and American history. I am proud  to cosponsor this bill, and I thank Representative Kevin Yoder for  bringing it forward. I urge my colleagues to support it.
