 Madam Speaker, we know that we have a crisis of mental  health across America, and it impacts gun violence, homelessness, and  so many other factors. One in five U.S. adults live with mental  illness. One in seven in California.   As a result of the pandemic, more Americans have felt alone, scared,  and depressed. In my district there is a severe lack of access to  mental health in culturally and linguistically challenged areas,  especially in southeast Fresno.   In response, we secured $1.5 million to provide expanded mental  health and recovery services. That is not enough. We need to do much  more throughout the valley and throughout our country.   The lack of investment in mental health services and resources has  also fueled a rise in homelessness, as we know, and gun violence in our  country. Not even 1 month into 2023, we have had 39 mass shootings that  have taken place in America. From Monterey Park in California, Half  Moon Bay, to Goshen, California, all three in our State, we have been  torn apart by senseless gun violence.   Americans have offered thoughts and prayers. Those are good but not  enough. We need further action on gun reform and mental health support.  It is critical.   As the chair of the Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus, I am  advocating that we build on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act by  hiring more mental health providers, strengthening access to treatment,  and expanding resources to our youth. It is very necessary today with  our young people.   To all my fellow Americans, it is okay not to be okay. It is okay to  ask for help and dial 988. Let's break the stigma and try to save  lives.                           Floods and Water Storage     Madam Speaker, most are aware that in California we seem  to have extreme floods and extreme droughts. Certainly, that has been  proven true in the last month.   Last week, I met with local, State, and Federal California water  leaders to discuss our efforts to divert flood control and improve  groundwater recharge.   Recent storms have dumped over 32 trillion, with a t, gallons of  water in California, and the weather forecasters are anticipating that  in February we will have more rain.   We need to be better prepared to avoid what happened in Planada,  California where over half of the community was flooded and farmworkers  and others lost their homes. A grammar school was literally inundated  and now the 300 students are being taught at a middle school.   More needs to be done to deal with the displaced farmworkers and the  impacts to farmers.   I am working with Governor Newsom and the White House to streamline  the process to divert floodwater and increase water storage. It is  absolutely necessary with climate change and other factors we are  dealing with.   We have secured some funding to begin to fix our infrastructure. It  is time we get these projects permitted and shovels in the ground.  Let's get to work.                       USDA Funding for Dairy Producers     Madam Speaker, California is also the number one  agriculture State in the Nation. Dairy producers are a key part of that  production. They are feeling the pinch of the pandemic, an unsteady  market, and increases in feed and input costs, which impact the bottom  line.   From milk to cheese that we all enjoy, dairy producers have been  working tirelessly to put food on America's dinner table. California  produces over 20 percent of all the milk in America.   I am proud to announce that I, along with some of my Republican and  Democratic colleagues, have worked with Secretary Vilsack to secure  $100 million in additional aid to support the dairy producers  recovering from the impacts of COVID-19.   As the leading dairy-producing State in the Union, this funding will  help California dairy farmers so they can continue to produce and  deliver the most nutritious products around the world.                                time  1045                      Honoring the Career of Kerri Donis     Madam Speaker, today I honor careers of individuals who  make a difference, such as the career of Kerri Donis.   Madam Speaker, I want to honor Chief Kerri Donis for 27 years of her  fearless leadership and courageous service to the Fresno Fire  Department. Kerri is the first woman to hold the position as the  department's chief in a country where only 4 percent of the  firefighters are women.   Under her leadership, the department has grown to 402 personnel for  the city of Fresno. She has created programs like Girls Empowerment  Camp which introduces fire service careers for young women.   Chief Donis will be remembered for her selfless acts and for  consistently putting safety for her firefighters and the community  above all else.   Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating Chief Kerri Donis on  her retirement.                            ____________________
