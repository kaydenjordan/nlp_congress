 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member  for their work on this bipartisan, strong resolution.   Iran and Russia are locked in a poisonous partnership committed to  terror--terror in Ukraine, terror in Syria. Iran, as the world's  largest state sponsor of terrorism, is further committed to the  destruction of our ally Israel. On October 7, Iran's puppet, Hamas,  commenced its most recent sick, savage slaughter of innocents.    America was the first nation to recognize Israel in 1948. Over the  decades, we have stood at her side when she has been attacked by force  over her borders. We have stood by her side at anti-Semitic rhetoric in  the halls of the United Nations. Together, we have been at the peace  table seeking solutions.   Today, united we stand on this House floor in prayer for the safe  return of all the hostages taken by Hamas. I urge adoption on a strong  bipartisan basis of this resolution in support of our ally Israel.
