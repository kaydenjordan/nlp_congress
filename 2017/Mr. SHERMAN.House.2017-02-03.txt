 Mr. Speaker, as many have explained on this floor,  Trump's executive order, his Muslim ban, repudiates our values and  violates our Constitution.   After 20 years on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I think it is  important to come to this floor and explain how that executive order is  harmful to our national security. Trump's executive order plays right  into the ISIS narrative. It says that there is a clash of civilizations  and that all Islam is our enemy. ISIS, which has, perhaps, a few  hundred thousand followers, dreams of convincing all of Islam--dreams  of convincing 1.5 billion Muslims--that they are at war with America  and the West.   We do not have a clash of civilizations. We have a clash between  civilization and the forces of darkness bent on destroying  civilization, whether they reside in Raqqa or at 1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue.                            ____________________
