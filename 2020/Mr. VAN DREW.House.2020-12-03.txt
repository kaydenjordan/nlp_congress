 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Cape Assist, a  substance misuse prevention and treatment agency which serves Cape May  County in south Jersey.   From prevention and education programs for our community to recovery  services for those in need, the services that they offer are  invaluable. They are invaluable to our community and to the lives that  they literally help save.   During this pandemic, people have, unfortunately, turned to more  drugs and more alcohol and more substance abuse. Cape Assist helps  individuals who are struggling with these addictions to turn the corner  of their addictions and help them to get better.   I thank the staff of Cape Assist for the diligent and lifesaving work  they do to ensure our community is educated in these issues and that  those in need have the support to get through the most difficult times  of their lives.   Keep up the great work, Cape Assist. God bless you and God bless the  work that you do.                            ____________________
