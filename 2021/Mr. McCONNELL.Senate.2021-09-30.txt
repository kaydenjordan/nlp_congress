 Madam President, today the Senate will consider and  pass a government funding bill and do our part to avoid a shutdown.   The continuing resolution contains a number of key items that  Republicans called for. That includes supplemental funds to help  resettle vetted Afghan refugees and hurricane recovery aid for  Louisiana.   It is seriously disappointing that the Democratic side would not let  us include funding for Israel's Iron Dome in the base text. It honestly  baffles me that defensive aid to our ally Israel has become a thorny  subject for the political left.   But, overall, this is encouraging progress. The Democratic majority  has begun to realize that the way forward on basic governing duties  matches the roadmap that Republicans have been laying out for months.  On government funding, what Republicans laid out all along was a clean  continuing resolution without the poison pill of a debt limit increase.  That is exactly what we will pass today. Earlier this week, the  Democratic leader tried to muscle through something different through a  partisan jam, but it failed. Now the government will be funded as we  laid out. That is step 1.   Next will come step 2: the debt ceiling. And we have clearly laid out  the way forward there as well. As I have explained since last July-- last July--Democrats need to begin the fast-track process for handling  this issue through reconciliation. Clumsy attempts at partisan jams by  the majority will not change that reality. It didn't work on government  funding, and it won't work on the debt limit. They will just be wasting  valuable time.   I think this reality is hopefully starting to dawn on our colleagues.  Multiple leading House Democrats acknowledged just this week that their  unified Democratic government is fully capable--fully capable--of fast- tracking a debt limit increase on their own. Nonpartisan experts have  confirmed that they have plenty of time to get this done before late  October.   At the same time that the Senate Democratic leader says, incorrectly,  that he doesn't have enough time, he has spent weeks of the Senate's  time processing midlevel nominations. Today, the majority is spending  multiple hours to confirm a Bureau of  [[Page S6802]]  Land Management nominee who literally collaborated with ecoterrorists,  fiddling away day after day after day while they pretend they lack the  time to do their most basic job.   Senate Republicans have been totally transparent. We have given  Democrats a step-by-step guide to governing in this environment and  months of advance notice to get it done. The conclusion to draw from  this week is very clear: Clumsy efforts at partisan jams do not work.  What works is when the majority accepts the reality of the situation.   We are able to fund the government today because the majority  accepted reality. The same thing will need to happen on the debt limit  next week.                             Tribute to Sue Tharp    Now, Madam President, on an entirely different matter, few public  servants know Western Kentucky and its people as well as my good friend  Sue Tharp. Sue has served as my team's Paducah-based field assistant  since 1985. She is retiring this month after nearly four decades of  uninterrupted service to the Commonwealth.   Sue holds the record for being the longest continually serving  employee from my entire career in public service. She has been with me  since day one of my Senate service.   So, today, I would like to honor this one-of-a-kind Kentuckian whose  steady leadership in Western Kentucky has been integral to my office's  mission to serve the Bluegrass and the people who call it home.   Now, when you ask Sue's colleagues to describe their coworker, you  hear one word again and again and again: dedicated. In 36 years, Sue  has scarcely missed a day in the office. She tackles each constituent  problem with her quick wit and her smile. Her knowledge of Western  Kentucky is encyclopedic. And Sue has played a key part in training  almost every other field staffer on our team, sharing hard-won wisdom  with the next generation of public servants.   So when I think of Sue's service to Kentucky, two images come to  mind. The first is Sue winning over even the most impassioned callers  to my office, whether the call started out friendly or not. Sue will  listen carefully, record their concerns, and do all she can to help.  But then she also invariably will end up discussing other favorite  topics, such as quilting. Sue is an avid volunteer at the National  Quilt Museum in Paducah. So when the conversation wraps up, Sue will be  smiling, and you know the person who just hung up on the other end is  smiling too.   The second image comes from an event called Fancy Farm, which is an  annual picnic in Graves County. It is the crown jewel of Western  Kentucky's heritage. Sue is one of the event's most enthusiastic  attendees. She often travels down early to peruse the area's many  antique stores. She loves attending the church barbecue, taking in the  speeches, and cheering with the crowd. Any politician who steps up to  that podium is guaranteed to notice Sue amidst the throng.   Sue's day job has been public service for more than three decades,  but even that hasn't soaked up all of her love and service for her  community. She is also an enthusiastic volunteer, a frequent  participant in Paducah's ambassador program, and one of the city's all- around biggest boosters.   If you sample a Paducah boat tour or roll into town for a ribbon- cutting, it might well be Sue Tharp welcoming you to town, decked out  in the ambassador's characteristic red jacket. Visit the Quilt Museum,  and it will be Sue handing you a brochure. Vacation in one of Western  Kentucky's beautiful parks, and Sue Tharp will be waving to you from  the door of her RV.   Sue's dedication to Western Kentucky and its people is boundless. For  all these years, she understood that while my staff report to me, all  of us report to the people of Kentucky. In fact, at one point I believe  Sue even lived directly across the street from our Paducah office.   So while Sue is departing our team, I am positive she isn't finished  serving Kentucky. This is just the next chapter. More time to  volunteer, more time to be generous to her friends and her neighbors,  and more time with her husband Dan and son Benjamin.   So, Sue, I couldn't be more grateful. Thank you for your decades of  hard work and for your lasting impact on the Commonwealth.                             Tribute to Jane Lee    Madam President, on one final matter, the pressing matters I  discussed at the beginning of my remarks suggest I could not find a  more appropriate time to honor the sterling staff expert who has  advised me on budget issues and appropriations for over 5 years. But,  in another sense, it pains me to say there couldn't be a worse time  because the occasion for this tribute is that Jane Lee is soon taking  leave of the Senate and taking the next step in her career.   Jane arrived in my office with a big job to do but the perfect skill  set to do it. She studied at a couple of schools called Stanford and  Columbia. She had worked in the private sector, risen through the ranks  at OMB during the Bush 43 administration, worked for a House Budget  chairman named Paul Ryan, and held leading rolls with Senate  Appropriations and Republican Whip John Cornyn.   Jane's resume was impeccable, her references unimpeachable. She was  already a force of nature on Capitol Hill, so my expectations, as you  can imagine, were high from the start. But for about 5\1/2\ years, day  in and day out, through a never-ending catalog of serious challenges,  Jane kept raising the bar higher and higher.   Jane's colleagues throughout the Senate admire her determination and  her dogged focus. She is methodical and meticulous. She grasps both the  big political picture and the finest policy details much more capably  than most people could hope to grasp either.   When you handle budget talks and funding negotiations for a  leadership office, you are kind of a hybrid player-coach to offices and  committees all across the Senate. Jane is a skilled leader. She can get  a diverse team driving toward a goal with warmth and good humor but  also tenacity and total professionalism.   For countless major bipartisan and bicameral compromise bills over  the past 5 years, Jane has been one of very last staff experts on  either side holding the pen. She is a principled fighter, but once  negotiations concluded, everyone on both sides trusted Jane to be an  honorable and honest broker. That speaks volumes.   Earlier this week, one of Jane's colleagues remarked simply, ``I  don't think I've ever worked with someone like Jane.'' This turns out  to be the universal consensus of everyone. Her knowledge and her  instincts spill outside her portfolio and make everyone look better.  The high standards to which she holds herself are infectious.   She marshals the knowledge and the relationships that come with many  years of government service but also inexhaustible earnestness, energy,  and enthusiasm for the fray.   So Jane is exactly the kind of person you would hope to find in the  government, just the kind of worker a Senate office is lucky to find,  and just the sort of public servant the country deserves.   I don't think anyone would be terribly surprised if, one day, the  Senate finds itself refamiliarizing ourselves with Jane's  qualifications in a formal capacity.   I have to note that Jane would hasten to redirect all this praise  toward her parents Michael and Jean, as well as her grandmother Hee  Soon. She is a proud daughter of first-generation Americans and small  business entrepreneurs whose love of country and commitment to hard  work have shaped their daughter's life at every step.   At clutch moments, these qualities have benefited not just me, not  just our conference, but our entire country. Today, one such time  especially stands out in my memory.   It was a year and a half ago when COVID thrust our country into a  health crisis and an economic crisis at the very same time. During the  bipartisan scramble that built a historic CARES Act, Jane, our Swiss  Army knife, wound up as my liaison to the Small Business Committee. She  poured herself into helping Senators set up, preserve, and protect the  landmark Paycheck Protection Program that saved a huge, huge number of  jobs and countless small businesses exactly like the ones she grew up  watching her parents manage.   But while Jane's commitment to her work has been peerless, her  commitment to her family is greater still. Her beloved husband Tom and  her son Mitchell and her parents and grandmother need to see more of  her than  [[Page S6803]]  her bottomless Senate portfolio has often permitted. So while the whole  institution will sorely miss her, we also join her in celebrating the  new adventures to come.   To our incredibly competent budget expert, our cherished colleague,  and one of the Senate's most talented jazz and rock-and-roll singers,  we say not just ``farewell'' and ``good luck'' but ``bravo'' on a  simply outstanding performance.
