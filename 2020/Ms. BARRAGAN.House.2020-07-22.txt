 Mr. Speaker, green spaces should be a right for  everyone, regardless of where they live or the color of their skin.  [[Page H3653]]    Unfortunately, for too many Black, Brown, and Native American  communities, parks are considered a privilege. Today, we can change  this injustice.   The Great American Outdoors Act will create more local parks in low- income and urban neighborhoods. Minority communities across the country  lack access to green spaces.   In my district, in Compton, we only have about half an acre of  parkland for every thousand residents, well below the averages in the  rest of Los Angeles County and the Nation.   Voting ``yes'' means more outdoor recreation opportunities, including  sports fields and trails. Voting ``yes'' means all kids, no matter  their ZIP Code, have the right to play on green grass and explore the  natural world.   I am proud to vote ``yes'' to secure this right for our young people  today and for future generations.    Madam Speaker, like so many here tonight, I was  inspired by John Lewis and his lifelong fight for our country to live  up to its ideals to be more tolerant, more just, and more equal.   He was fearless. He sacrificed his body, bloodied by billy clubs and  beatings from police, in hopes that future generations of people of  color would not have to.   He was my hero. I called him ``Mr. Lewis'' when I first arrived to  Congress, and I will never forget, he would say, ``Call me John.'' He  was so humble and supportive.   Hearing John Lewis tell firsthand stories of the fight for civil  rights was a privilege. Walking the Edmund Pettus Bridge with him was  something I will never forget.   We will honor his life by continuing to, and as he said, cause ``good  trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.''   As he wrote: ``Freedom is the continuous action we all must take, and  each generation must do its part to create an even more fair, more just  society.''   We will try.   Thank you, John.
