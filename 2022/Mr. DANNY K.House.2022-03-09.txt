 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 6968, suspending energy imports in response to Russia's  barbaric, inhumane, and unprovoked attacks on Ukraine and the Ukrainian  people. These imports include crude oil, petroleum, coal, coal  products, natural gas, and other products.   On March 8, President Biden issued an executive order to prohibit  energy imports from Russia, which I totally agree with. Mr. Speaker, I  support and urge passive of H.R. 6968.
