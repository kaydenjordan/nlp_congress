 Mr. Speaker, here it is, Friday. It has been a good week  in Washington. We have gotten some of President Trump's nominees  approved and through the Senate. Call them like you see them, I think.   Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has done a great job this week. I  applaud his efforts. And as a result of what President Trump has been  doing--and actually part of it is just his getting elected--has done  for our economy because people know--at least a lot of people know--he  is going to keep his word. He is already showing he is doing that, and  he has repealed some of the executive orders that have been doing so  much damage to our economy.   And when we say economy, what we mean is, the rank and file people,  the backbone of America who have been struggling, who have made less  money than they did 8 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Those are  the people we are talking about; those who have been out of work, the  94 or 95 million who have become so desperate, they pulled out of even  applying for work.   I enjoyed, to an extent, the exchange between my friend, Kevin  McCarthy and my friend across the aisle Leader Hoyer. And I get amused  when I hear Democrats quoting Senator McCain and Senator Graham-- wonderful people. Lindsey Graham, it is a real joy to be around talking  to Lindsey Graham. But if you look at positions they have taken, it  would make you think twice about quoting them as positions you wanted  to have supporting yours.   I mean, nothing stands taller than the 30 million of the 90 million  or so living in Egypt, when they rose up that June because a Muslim  brother named Morsi was seizing power. He was on his way to becoming  the Chavez in North Africa, and the people rose up. It was not only the  largest peaceful demonstration in the history of the world, it was the  largest demonstration in the history of the world.   All over Egypt, moderate Muslims, Christians, Jews, secularists, they  all rose up, went to the streets and demanded the removal of the man  who would be king, the Muslim brother named Morsi. The difference in  this king is, as many of the Egyptians have pointed out when I have  been in Cairo and other places, he wasn't just going to be king. He was  going to be the puppet of the spiritual leader of Islam in Egypt.   Some of my Egyptian friends, when I have been over there, say: yeah,  we have seen video of him taking his orders from the spiritual imam,  and he followed his leadership. So if that is true, then he wasn't just  going to be king. He was going to be a king puppet.   But the Muslim brother was removed as a result of 30 million people  rising up peacefully. Morsi only, allegedly, got around 13 million to  claim the win and made clear his opponent knew--for the original  Presidential election--that if he raised a stink about any votes being  fraudulent, they would burn the country down--that was some of his  supporters. Because the Muslim Brotherhood, if you go back and check,  when churches are burned, it is normally the Muslim Brotherhood over  there.   In Egypt, they had been anathema to representative government, to  civilized government, to nonsectarian government. They want a new  caliphate to start with basically the old Ottoman Empire and Erdogan in  Turkey; he is undoing all of the great reforms made by the great  Ataturk nearly 100 years ago, and he is undoing them.                                time  1145    There are those in Turkey who would like to see a caliphate--a new  Ottoman Empire--and it have its leadership in Turkey. They long for the  days when they ruled an expansive caliphate.   I had a reporter say: Why would you say that?   I said: Go look at a map. I know you weren't ever taught what the  Ottoman Empire was. Go look at a map and look at the countries where  our President is supporting an uprising that eventually, if we don't  stop it, will become anarchy or it will become part of the caliphate.  [[Page H965]]    The new jobs report that is just out: 227,000 new jobs. And from what  I'm hearing from constituents, these aren't just the part-time jobs or  the minimum wage jobs that the previous President bragged about. He had  to brag about it because he didn't have anything else to talk about.  People lost their full-time jobs and could only acquire part-time jobs,  and this administration bragged about those. If they got two part-time  jobs to make up for losing their full-time job, this Administration  bragged: We created two jobs.   I would submit that when you are creating two jobs by causing a  person to lose all of their benefits and full-time employment, you  haven't done such a good thing.   Fortunately, the people of Egypt did not listen to Senator McCain and  Senator Graham when they flew to Cairo and begged for the people of  Egypt to return the Muslim ``brother who would be king'' back into his  royal kingship. I know they weren't intentionally supporting an evil  ruler; it is just they didn't know. So, hopefully, they will become  more aware that it is not a good thing to support the Muslim  Brotherhood.   With regard to Australia and the alleged news about President Trump  getting into it with the leader of Australia, well, to whom is the  leader of Australia accountable? To whom does the leader of Australia  owe his allegiance?   It is the people of Australia. So when he calls or talks to President  Trump and begs or demands Trump to take these refugees that the Prime  Minister in Australia knows are a threat to the safety of the  Australian people, when he wants them out of Australia, there is a  reason--because his allegiance is not to the people of the United  States--his allegiance is to the people of Australia. So, naturally,  being allegiant to the people of Australia, he wants the dangerous  refugees out of Australia.   President Obama, basically by his actions, in effect, was saying:  Give us not your tired, your poor, the people yearning to be free, but  give us your people that yearn to destroy America because we're going  to bring them in. We're not going to vet them properly because we have  got no information to properly vet them. That's how we have been able  to let people in who had their fingerprints on IEDs that killed  Americans, and maimed Americans because we are not properly vetting  them.   Oh, yeah, we compare any information we have against what we've got.  But don't forget, as Phil Haney, the whistleblower from Homeland  Security, pointed out, he was personally required to delete massive  pages of information about terrorist ties of people coming into the  United States because they did not want those terrorist ties in the  Homeland Security database. Then he also, of course, was on his  computer when he saw somebody above his pay grade deleting things that  he personally put in about terrorist ties. They were deleting them.   So when Janet Napolitano talks about, We get a ping and we connect  the dots, she caused massive numbers of dots to be deleted. They are  not there. We don't know who we are getting. When anyone comes from  Syria--we know ISIS has taken governmental printing areas before. They  can produce official Syrian passports not with the support of the  Syrian Government, but just because they have the equipment to do it.  So when we get information saying, I am from Syria, maybe they are, and  maybe they're not. We don't know where they're from.   The FBI Director created one of the most incredible political stunts  of any FBI Director in history last summer when he stepped up and  outlined that a crime had been committed by Presidential candidate  Hillary Clinton. But then he goes on to say: But no reasonable  prosecutor would pursue this. It is incredible the extent he went to to  help Hillary Clinton.   I know there were some of my Democratic friends that got mad at him  when a week before the election he said that they were reopening the  investigation. But if you look at the circumstances, it was information  that we had FBI agents who were so upset that Comey wouldn't reopen the  investigation. When they knew some of what was in the computers that  they had gotten ahold of belonged to Anthony Weiner and Hillary  Clinton's closest adviser and confidante, Huma Abedin Weiner, the word  was we had FBI agents saying that: If you don't reopen, we're going to  have a press conference, we're going to resign, and we're going to out  you that you're protecting Hillary Clinton. So what could he do to help  Hillary Clinton but say: ``I am going to reopen the investigation?''   I commented to somebody in the media back then:         Well, of course, it may appear to help Hillary. We will       know whether that was his intent or not because you can't       examine tens of thousands of emails adequately. You can do an       algorithm search, but you can't adequately investigate them       for a crime, including false statements to the FBI, within a       week. So if he comes out before the election and says that       there is nothing here, then we know why he came out and said       that we are reopening. It was to stop FBI agents from       resigning and from outing him for protecting Hillary Clinton.    So what happens?   Two days before the election, he said: Yeah, we checked it all out.   He couldn't possibly have.   He said: We checked it all out, and there is nothing here to  prosecute.   So that same FBI Director, though, didn't help the Obama  administration. On occasion, he was calling them like he saw them; and  that is:         Yeah, we will vet these people, but when they give us       information from Syria, we have no information against       which to vet that. We have to accept it for what it is       because, yeah, we're technically vetting it against what       we have, but we have nothing, so we don't know who these       people are.    So, in the meantime, the economy is turning around.   How sad is it when we have just lived through 8 years under a  President's policies that were so abysmal for the good of America that  the economy, when adjusted for inflation, was slower than it was in the  4 years of Jimmy Carter?   I know there are some in the media that would grab 1 month and say:  See, this was a good month.   Let's look at the 8 years compared to the 4 years of President  Carter, 4 of the worst years for the American economy in history since  the Depression. President Obama, over 8 years, had a slower economy  when adjusted for inflation. That is pretty sad.   It is also sad this week to read this article from The Daily Caller:  ``Laura Wilkerson, whose teenage son was tortured and murdered by an  illegal alien in 2010, got into an emotional confrontation with House  Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi at a CNN town hall event  Tuesday night.   ``Wilkerson told Pelosi, `In 2010, one of the illegals slaughtered my  son. He tortured him, he beat him, he tied him up like an animal, and  he set him on fire. And I am not a one-story mother. This happens every  day because there are no laws enforced at the border. We have to start  giving American families first.'   ``On the issue of Pelosi and Democrats' support for sanctuary cities,  Wilkerson asked, `How do you reconcile in your head about allowing  people to disavow the law?'   `` `There's nothing, I'm sure, that can compare to the grief that you  have, and so I pray for you,' Pelosi said.''   Pelosi went on: ``But I do want to say to you that in our sanctuary  cities, our people are not disobeying the law. These are law-abiding  citizens. It enables them to be there without being reported to ICE in  case of another crime that they might bear witness to.''   ``Pelosi then asked if her son was murdered in a sanctuary city.  Josh, Wilkerson's son, was murdered just outside Houston, Texas, which  is a sanctuary city.''   So I believe in the power of prayer. I think it's one of the greatest  gifts God gave us. C.S. Lewis talked about we are here on Earth behind  enemy lines, if you would.   Can you imagine being behind enemy lines and getting messages from  your home headquarters and you refuse to open them and read them?   He says that we have a Bible. Those are messages from our home  headquarters. We ought to be reading them.   I do believe in the power of prayer, just like our minority leader,  Ms. Pelosi; but we need to distinguish between things that we should  pray for and things that we can fix ourselves. Things that are outside  our control, we  [[Page H966]]  ought to be praying about. Those things which are in our control--when  it is within your control--to return to the rule of law, enforce the  laws that exist, treat everybody fairly under the law, that's something  you don't really have to pray about. You just help us do it.   I have not met Tommy Nelson, a pastor in Denton, Texas, but I  listened to a 12-hour Bible study he did; and one of his comments on  that study in Ecclesiastes was basically what so many people say: We  don't have to worry; God is in control.   Tommy Nelson said: Yeah, God is in control, but just because He is in  control doesn't mean He wants us to lean on our shovel and pray for a  hole. When you have got a shovel in your hand, you don't have to pray  for a hole; you just start digging.   When you have got the tools to protect the American people and  enforce the rule of law, you just do it. Now, you can pray for wisdom  to help you as you go.   I know it may have been a Freudian slip--may not have been--but when  Minority Leader Pelosi was asked about illegal aliens, she referred to  them as ``our people.''   I don't know; could that be because they know when illegal aliens  vote, they vote Democrat?   We know that most dead people vote 100 percent Democrat. I have  encouraged the Republican Party: Let's don't have any group that we're  not willing to recruit votes from, and traditionally dead people vote  100 percent Democrat. Perhaps it's time that some of them started  voting Republican for a change.   In any event, the minority whip, Mr. Hoyer, was talking about a  fellow with tears in his eyes saying: Please don't repeal ObamaCare  because my son will be unable to get insurance if you repeal ObamaCare.   Well, that gets to all of us when somebody with tears in their eyes  comes to us and begs for help. The only reason he had tears in his eyes  is because of the false information being put out by the Democratic  Party, because when we repeal ObamaCare, people are not going to lose  their insurance. Some Americans have a right to be skeptical because  they were told by President Obama and all of the Democrats: No, no,  when we pass ObamaCare, nobody loses their insurance.   Well, we found out that that was a lie to millions of Americans. Some  of them were able to get insurance. Some of it ended up being Medicaid.  Most of the new people got Medicaid, which is not really the insurance  they were hoping for, but that's the insurance most people got.                                time  1200    I had 17 people come to my office in Lufkin. They were looking to  make a show and not so much to give information; otherwise, they would  have called for an appointment.   My district representative there was at a service honoring her late  father at a hospice and she forgot, in her emotional state, to put a  note on the door that she was running to that. Anyway, they made a big  deal, here is an office not occupied. Hopefully, they will have a  little sympathy for somebody in her situation.   But they weren't looking to get information to me. That is why the  reporter had more information about the meeting when my office had no  information about the meeting. If they want an appointment, we make  appointments. I am here most of the time, so I can't be there. I have  got people to meet with them.   This article, February 1, Melissa Quinn, Daily Signal:   ``Pamela Weldin's experiences with ObamaCare can be boiled down to  just a few numbers.   Since the health care law's implementation 3 years ago, Weldin, 60,  has lost her insurance four different times''--under ObamaCare. ``And  the Nebraska woman is currently enrolled in her fifth new insurance  policy in four years.''   She said: `` `Yet again, and through no fault of my own'. . . . `I'm  just sitting here minding my own business, and here we go again.' ''  She gets thrown off another insurance policy.   Anyway, she goes on to explain she has been denied coverage because  of a preexisting condition related to her career as a dental hygienist.   People are not going to lose their insurance. All we are going to do  is create the opportunity to have far better insurance policies than  you have got under ObamaCare. You are not going to get a penalty for  having better insurance than what ObamaCare required. So you don't have  to pay a penalty, and you can have good insurance and you won't be  taxed for having better insurance. It is going to be a great day for  America to do that.   That brings me to a point I want to get to next about the wall.   An article here, February 1, Virginia Hale from Breitbart, says:  ``Smuggling Migrants to Europe Now a Major Funding Source for Islamic  State.''   Well, it only makes sense that the Islamic State would figure that  out, because we had information they consulted with the drug cartels in  Mexico. As the Border Patrolmen have told me during the middle of the  night the times I have been down there, there is not an inch of the  Mexican border that is not controlled by some drug cartel. Nobody  crosses that border illegally without paying something to the drug  cartel or promising to work for them when they get to America.   What a great business model. You are selling drugs, making billions  of dollars getting it across the border illegally into the United  States, and, unlike most businesses where you have to pay the employee,  they get the employee to pay them as part of their debt repayment to  get them into the United States.   So, what a business model, making billions from selling drugs  illegally gotten into the United States, and then the Department of  Homeland Security, as one told me down on the border: They call us  their logistics, in the drug cartels, because we ship people all over  the country to cities where they need drug sales, prostitutes, mules.  We send them there, and then they have got people selling drugs for  them.   If we build a wall--and I know there are areas like where the Rio  Grande is so wide you don't need a wall, you just have people guard the  border--it cuts off the massive flow of drugs into the United States.  It means the billions of dollars going to the drug cartels that they  can use to corrupt the Mexican Government will dry up to thousands.  Drug cartels know it.   So I would submit, Mr. Speaker, the only Mexican leaders that object  to a wall and total security of our border between Mexico are either  ignorant--they don't understand that the reason they are 60-something  in world economies instead of being fourth or fifth or sixth is because  of the corruption that comes from the drug cartels. You dry up the  billions of dollars they are making with a wall and border security,  and Mexico gets in the top 10 economies. But, yes, it means the drug  cartels dry up. They are either ignorant of what will really happen  when we secure the border or they are in the pocket of the drug  cartels. Those are the only two choices.   If you are a Mexican leader and you oppose the United States  enforcing our border, you are in the pocket of the drug cartels or you  are just ignorant of why your economy is not one of the top 10 in the  world. You have got the best location. You have got two continents  north and south above you. They would be great markets. You have got  two great oceans on either side to ship. You have got incredible  natural resources. You have got some of the hardest working people in  the world in Mexico.   So why is it so far down the chain of economies? Well, drug cartels.  The wall and border security will dry them up and the Mexican people  will be free with a vibrant economy, and they will take their  appropriate place in the great economies of the world.   I have been joined by my friend from Florida, and I mean that truly.  I think the world of Matt Gaetz.   I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    If the gentleman might take a question. I appreciate  that clarity. It is clarity that has been missing for a long time.   We have people screaming that President Trump should not have put a  temporary pause that was half as long as the pause President Obama put  on. I understand there is so much stress and pressure when you are  President; he probably just forgot he put a 6-month ban, previously, on  a Muslim nation sending people in.   You made so clear the case for concern about Iran, and I am with you.  I am thrilled that we have a President that is not choosing to give our  lunch money, figuratively speaking, to the big bully in the schoolyard.   I don't know if my friend from Florida ever got bullied in elementary  school. I did. I learned early on that it doesn't help to give bullies  money. They are not going to leave you alone until you stand up to  them. Maybe they whip you, but they don't want to go through what you  put them through again by standing up to them, so they leave you alone.   In our case, we are strong enough to take on any bully; but instead,  we paid the big bully, Iran, as you pointed out, massive amounts,  billions and billions of dollars. We agreed to pay them up to $150  billion.   We have got some friends here in Congress in the House and Senate  that were so upset with the President having this 90-day pause on seven  countries. They didn't realize--I know we get so busy here that we  don't notice a lot of other things, but they apparently hadn't realized  that those seven countries were designated by the Obama administration.  One of them, Iran, a country you have talked so eloquently about, we  have people here in this body that don't think we should hold up  refugees from Iran.   As the gentleman was talking about, the Government of Iran has not  shown any good faith at all. Would the gentleman be concerned about  having people that the Iranian Government allowed to slip out of the  country and come into the United States? Do you have any problem with  President Obama's pause on that refugee surge into the United States?    Those are such great points. The counterargument is made  often to us: ``Other than the San Bernardino shootings, has there been  a terrorist attack involving a non-U.S.-born attacker since 9/11?''   There was a great article in The Federalist by Kyle Shideler on  January 30. He answers: Yes, but first of all, why exclude the San  Bernardino killers, terrorists?   Tashfeen Malik was born in Pakistan, and that attack killed 14. As  Phil Haney, the whistleblower from Homeland Security, pointed out, if  he had not been removed from the line, he would have been allowed to  secondarily question someone like Tashfeen Malik. It is worth noting,  under the Obama administration, under Jeh Johnson, and before him,  Janet Napolitano, they punished people who pointed out radical  Islamists rather than giving them positions where they could recognize  radical Islamists.   Phil Haney points out that Tashfeen Malik is actually a man's name.  The woman came, and if she had come through him, he would have asked:  Well, why do you have a man's name, and it happens to be a man who was  a terrorist centuries ago?   Well, to ask a question like that, you have to be well educated into  the history of radical Islam. Not Islam, but radical Islam.   We have spent so much money as a country and even as a Congress on  countering violent extremism. We hear from Homeland Security  whistleblowers--some of them don't want to go public yet, but we hear  from them that so much of that money was spent on conferences and  seminars teaching our Homeland Security agents, our FBI agents, our  State Department people, our intelligence people to spot Islamophobes.  They would teach them the phrases to look for when someone reported a  potential radical Islamist so that they would know that that is an  Islamophobe. That is exactly why in San Bernardino, when someone  reported this guy as a potential radical Islamist, that he was crazy,  that he was going to hurt somebody, they wrote him off as just being  prejudiced against Islam. It is because of the money spent by this  government intimidating people into refusing to notice radical Islam  and getting them punished. If they didn't find people who they named  Islamophobes, their career was over.    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    I thank the gentleman. I would also note, as this  Federalist article points out, yeah, of course, when there is a  terrorist attack, it also affects the economy. That is why Osama bin  Laden wrote about how they had only spent a tiny amount of money to  train their people from 9/11 and that it had clearly cost America  trillions of dollars, that even if they couldn't bring us down any  other way, if they could do other attacks like that, costing relatively  low amounts to them but costing us billions and trillions, they could  bring us down economically.   So it only makes sense, though, Iran wants to bring us down, so they  ought to be one of the seven that the Obama administration named as a  threat, and they were. But even just recently at Ohio State University,  Abdul Razak Ali Artan ran over several students with a car before  attacking them with a butcher knife. That was a refugee born in  Somalia, one of the seven countries that the Obama administration named  as a threat, and so President Trump took the Obama administration  seriously and named them as one of seven, that we would have not a  permanent ban but a temporary ban for 90 days. The guy ran over  numerous students at Ohio State, but our friends on the other side of  the aisle and their friends in the mass media, they refuse to notice  what is going on.   Look at Tsarnaev, the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston. As we know, Russia  notified the United States not once but twice that the older Tsarnaev  had been radicalized, and he had been to a country, and the people he  hung around with were radicals, and it seemed like they probably  radicalized him.   So what happens? Well, they get information to our intelligence  community, and, since, they have been trained for the last 8 years to  only notice Islamophobes. You can tell someone is an Islamophobe if  they complain about a radical Islamist, then you know you have got an  Islamophobe. So of course if they want to stay in the intelligence  community, they are not going to be looking. They are going to follow  their training, look for Islamophobes instead of looking for radical  Islamists. I am sure they looked into it, but, based on their training,  they have no basis to work with.   So what happens? Russia notified us again. As I understand, they  notified the FBI. And as the FBI Director commented, look, we sent an  FBI agent to interview him, and he said, basically, he wasn't a  terrorist, he was a good guy. Wow. Imagine that. Somebody who wants to  kill Americans might also lie. Who would have ever thought? Except  American juries. I have seen it as a judge. I have seen juries find  that if you will lie to them, you may do a lot worse things as well.  Well, the reverse is also true. Often, if you are willing to take  someone's life, you might just be willing to lie about it as well.   So the FBI didn't even stop there, taking the word. They didn't take  the word of Tsarnaev. They went to his mother, and apparently his  mother said: No, my son is not a terrorist. He is a good boy. He is a  good boy.   There you go, full FBI investigation. Not under the old FBI. Not the  way most FBI agents have ever been trained. But, of course, under the  last 8  [[Page H969]]  years of training of the FBI, they were afraid to ask the tough  questions.   The truth is, they don't know the questions to ask. They don't know  that you should ask about whether there has been a tremendous increase  in the amount of study of the Koran and a massive increase in the  memorization of the Koran, and a change in the appearance, and knowing  what to look for, and asking questions like: What do you think about  Qutb, the Egyptian martyr, the Muslim brother who wrote the little book  ``Milestones'' that Osama bin Laden said, along with Mr. Nasif, for  whom Huma Abedin worked at one time according to the masthead of the  publication, he credited Nasif and also Qutb's book ``Milestones'' to  radicalizing him.   If you haven't been trained with Kim Jensen's 700 pages, which were  outlawed by the FBI for a while, because he clearly explained what FBI  agents should be looking for. Mr. Jensen told me that they banned his  information, they struck it, and wouldn't allow anybody to be trained.  Under incident information, they train people what to look for in a  radical Islamist. But then they brought it back, but only for some of  the leaders. The rank and file for so long under this administration  did not get the benefit of his 700 pages that would help train. Why?  Because CAIR, the Council on American Islamic Relations, who had  implications in the Holy Land Foundation trial, the biggest supporter  of terrorism ever prosecuted in the United States, convictions all  around in November of 2008, and they should have gone on to prosecute  the named co-conspirators. The only reason they didn't is because a new  administration came in.   Khalid Sheikh Mohammed--the mastermind of 9/11, of the brutal killing  of about 3,000 Americans and other foreigners, innocent victims--has  bragged about his planning. In a guilty plea where the judge went  through, as I used to, to make sure they understood their rights, he  bragged about that and some terrorist attacks they didn't even know he  had involvement in. He was bragging.                                time  1230    And he says, if we have terrorized you, then praise be to Allah. And  he says such things as we deserve attack, we deserve to be killed in  America, anyone who is a low-life Jew or says that God has a Son.   So those of us who believe God had a Son, and He loved the world so  much He sent His only begotten Son and whosoever believes in Him shall  not perish but have eternal life, anybody who believes that is worthy  of death under the Koran, according to the brilliant teacher and  mastermind of the 9/11 attack. And then he quotes from the Koran that  anyone who tries to combine someone with Allah is worthy of death, and  that means any Christian. They have explained these things.   But Khalid Sheikh Mohammed went through an expansive hearing with a  judge explaining what all he was involved in and why he was guilty of  9/11 and praise be to Allah for all of the people that were killed on  9/11 at the Pentagon, at the World Trade Centers.   Why was he not sentenced? Because we had an election in 2008, and  before the plea was made final, we had a new Attorney General named  Eric Holder. At that point, all bets were off. They didn't follow up  the plea was withdrawn, and he still hasn't been sentenced for the  things he admitted to over 8 years ago.   Had they simply moved forward with the guilty plea, if we had had a  President for the last 8 years that made clear ``you might as well  plead guilty because nobody else is going to let you out,'' then we  would have finished the guilty plea, and he would have been  appropriately sentenced. But instead, this administration chose to send  hope to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed he might end up being one of the people  they release; because, if they close Guantanamo Bay, he either gets  moved to the United States or we let him go, maybe like we have for  some who went to Yemen and are back in the fight, or other people like  Saudi Arabia and are back in the fight.   He had real hope once President Obama came in and Eric Holder became  Attorney General, and Loretta Lynch after him, that he might get  released even after he admitted to the most important role in the  killing of 3,000 people on American soil on 9/11. He still has not been  prosecuted. They didn't follow up on his guilty plea. The plea was  withdrawn.   That man should not be allowed out of prison. He is a threat to the  world, and he is a valuable tool in the hands of radical Islam.   Well, thank God, as President Obama said, elections have  consequences. We have a President who didn't take an oath of office to  protect all of the people of Australia. He made clear that our friends  will know they are our friends, and I can see him working very closely  with the Prime Minister of Australia in the future. But leaders around  the world are now taking notice: Wait a minute. America has a President  that is not coming to us and apologizing for America's goodness and  their pursuit of freedom for as many people as they can--not  apologizing.   He is making clear, if you are our friend, you are going to feel it.  If you are our enemy, you are going to feel it. So I think Iran may  have finally met their match. We don't have an apologist to come in and  apologize for America's efforts, the blood, the treasure that has been  spent on behalf of people around the world.   And now even our Australian Prime Minister understands: Look, I want  to work with you--President Trump feels that way; he wants to work with  them, and he will work with them--but my oath is to the United States  of America and I know your oath is to Australia. I know because of your  oath to help and protect the people of Australia you want to get rid of  those refugees, some of whom may be dangerous.   I know President Obama said: Yeah, we will take the dangerous people  that may hurt Australians. Never mind we have got Americans being hurt.  We will take them.   Well, there is a different sheriff in town here in Washington, and  leaders around the world need to know that starting on January 20, the  United States is no longer going to take actions that are detrimental  to our own well-being, to the well-being of Americans, and to the  security of the United States under our Constitution. So thank God,  thank Trump, thank those that are seeing with clarity what is going on.   We will look forward to working with the Mexican leaders that realize  the only way Mexico ever achieves its rightful economic place in the  world is if a wall is built where it can be so that our border is  enforced and the drug cartels are impoverished. Then Mexico can be one  of the top economies in all the world because of the best workers, some  of the best workers in the world, and massive natural resources with  which they have been blessed. They just, so far, have not had America  be the kind of good neighbor that would help them stop the drug  cartels. Instead, we would have Presidents, administrations like the  past one, that would send 2,000 weapons to the drug cartels instead of  stopping them.   It is a new day. Thank God it is.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
