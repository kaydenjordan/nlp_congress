 Mr. President, today, I rise to honor the lifetime  accomplishments of Thomas B. Hagen, a remarkable leader, a pillar of  his hometown of Erie, PA, and a man whose commitment to public service  is unparalleled.   Tom Hagen is a Navy man, an officer with more than 30 years of  service to his country, and while he retired long ago, he has continued  to live up to the Navy's belief of ``Not self, but Country.''   You can see Tom's Navy background in one of his other passions,  historical preservation. His support enabled the Smithsonian  Institution's National Museum of American History to exhibit the USS  Gunboat Philadelphia and his efforts enabled the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania to reconstruct Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's War of 1812  vessel, the Flagship Niagara. Thanks to his efforts on behalf of these  and many other projects, Tom has helped to ensure that many historical  sites across our country will be available for future generations to  enjoy.   Tom is also deeply committed to the economic vitality of his hometown  of Erie and has spearheaded efforts to ensure that Erie is a thriving  community that serves all of its residents equitably. His support for  economic development through the Erie Innovation District has instilled  hope in many for the growth and success of northwestern Pennsylvania.  His support for the ``Empower Erie'' initiative led to the creation of  the Erie County Community College that provides a pathway for Erie  County residents to more accessible education and greater employment  opportunities. Tom has also played a key role in the purchase and  rehabilitation of countless buildings in Erie, not only revitalizing  the economy, but also creating employment.   Tom is equally committed to providing opportunities for those  struggling to better their lives. In 2015, he established the Susan  Hirt Hagen fund to identify promising ideas to address persistent  poverty, improve educational achievement, and halt economic decline. He  has sought to help the vulnerable in times of crisis through his  support for nonprofits like SafeNet, helping them take in more victims  of abuse.   Erie has had few better friends than Tom Hagen. He is not just a  friend to the city; he is the quintessential servant leader who steps  in to fill a need wherever one may be, doing so with humility and  always seeking to elevate others before himself. The care, commitment,  and support he has shown to this city and this region are remarkable.  [[Page S1460]]    From his service as a captain in the U.S. Navy, his tenure as  Pennsylvania's last secretary of commerce and first secretary of  community and economic development, to his chairmanship of the board of  Erie Insurance Group companies, Tom has a long and distinguished career  serving his country, his State, and his community.   It is an honor to call him a friend and to recognize him for his  outstanding service to his community and to the country.                            ____________________
