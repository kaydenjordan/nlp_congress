 Mr. Speaker, I would like to first recognize the hard work  and the leadership of Chairman  Bobby Scott and the entire Education  and Labor Committee on this outstanding underlying bill.   When older workers lose their jobs, they are much more likely to join  the ranks of the long-term unemployed. Unfortunately, discrimination  seems to be a significant factor in this.   Enforcement statistics from the EEOC show age discrimination  complaints are climbing. In 2000, the EEOC received roughly 16,000  complaints of age discrimination, and 17 years later, the EEOC received  20,000 complaints that year, accounting for 23 percent of all  discrimination charges filed.   As Ms. Williams mentioned, a 2018 survey conducted by the AARP found  that three in five workers age 45 and older have seen or experienced  age discrimination in the workplace.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act would restore  legal protections for older Americans and hold employers accountable  for age discrimination.   My amendment would require the EEOC to submit annual reports to  Congress on the number of age discrimination claims brought under this  act. Congress needs this information in a timely and transparent way to  ensure our older workers are being properly protected and heard.   Discrimination is discrimination, whether it be age, race, gender,  religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and all should be  treated fairly under the law.   My amendment and the underlying bill are commonsense pieces of  legislation that would restore fairness for all workers. I strongly  encourage my colleagues to support this amendments en bloc and the  underlying legislation.
