 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  legislation before us.   We are living in uncertain times. This virus has drastically reshaped  each one of our communities, and there is likely more change to come.   Today, Americans need us. They need the support and resources  provided by this bipartisan legislation. They need access to protective  equipment, a personal safety net, and economic assistance.   Workers need assurances that their economic security is paramount  because it is the American worker at the cornerstone of our economy.   In this bill, I fought so that trade workers and engineers employed  at New Mexico's national labs can continue protecting our national  security mission. We cannot let them down.   We must pass this bill for the teacher who is delivering meals to  students to make sure they don't go hungry just because they are not in  the classroom.   We must pass this bill for nurses, doctors, healthcare professionals,  and first responders who haven't slept as they provide for the sick.   We must pass this bill for rural communities that need the lifeline  to ensure seniors are fed and individuals can access healthcare when  the nearest doctor is hundreds of miles away.   We must pass this for everyone who is fighting to keep one another  safe, healthy, and afloat. We cannot let them down.   The reality we wake up to each day may change, but what remains the  same is that we face this crisis together. Like every crisis we have  faced before, we will get through this together.   Passage of this legislation is an important step, but I want every  New Mexican and every American to know that we understand this  uncertain time demands an extraordinary response. Together, we will not  let each other down, and we will meet that challenge.
