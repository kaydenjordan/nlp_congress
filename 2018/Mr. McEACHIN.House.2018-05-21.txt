 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in remembrance of a literary  giant and Richmond, Virginia, native, Tom Wolfe.   Mr. Wolfe was born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, in 1930, and  attended my own alma mater, St. Christopher's School.   A pioneer of the New Journalism movement, he worked for the  Springfield Union, The Washington Post, the Herald Tribune, Esquire,  and also wrote influential novels.   His multitude of subjects ranged from the hot rod and custom car  culture of Southern California, to the interactions of famous actors  and Black Panthers at a Park Avenue fundraiser, to the meteoric rise  and fall of a fictional New York bond trader.   In an interview, Bryon Dobell, Wolfe's editor at Esquire, said this  about him:   ``He has this unique gift of language that sets him apart as Tom  Wolfe. It is full of hyperbole; it is brilliant; it is funny, and he  has a wonderful ear for how people look and feel.''   With his passing, we have lost an important and deeply gifted writer.  I am truly saddened by this great Virginian's passing, and I send my  condolences to his friends and to his family.                            ____________________
