 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, this is the weekend before Memorial Day,  and we will be honoring the brave men and women who have served our  Nation and who gave their lives to protect the very freedoms that we  enjoy today.   Ronald Reagan said:         Freedom is never more than one generation away from       extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the       bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on       for them to do the same.    Our Nation is incredibly fortunate and grateful to have had no  shortage of those who are ready to lead that fight. Throughout our  history, brave men and women have answered the call to serve our  country. Whether they answered the call nearly 250 years ago to fight  for our independence or in recent years to combat the global threat of  terrorism, all of them are our heroes.   I have always had tremendous admiration for our servicemembers-- something instilled in me from an early age because of my dad's  military service. He was a B-17 pilot in the Army Air Corps and flew  with the Hell's Angels in the 303rd Bomb Group out of the 8th Air Force  in World War II. On his 26th mission over Germany, after leaving the  base in Molesworth, England, and flying over the English Channel to  Germany, he was shot down and captured as a prisoner of war. By the  grace of God, he survived the Nazi prison camp where he was interned  for the last 4 months of the war.   My dad went on to serve in the Air Force for 31 years and retired as  what we affectionately called a full-bird colonel. Both during and  after his service, he was an unabashed patriot and demonstrated every  day to us, his children and family, what it meant to selflessly serve  your country.   While my dad made it home after the war, many of his friends and  comrades did not. Like the great soldiers before them, and many after,  they laid down their lives in service to our country and the values we  embrace as a nation.   This Memorial Day, we remember the fallen and thank them for the  ultimate sacrifice to preserve our way of life. We mourn their loss and  celebrate the great gift they have bestowed upon us and the freedoms  they protected.   Since last Memorial Day, we have lost some incredible servicemembers  who call Texas home. In December, we said good-bye to Richard Overton,  American's oldest World War II veteran. At the ripe old age of 112, he  had a lot of wisdom to share, including a few unlikely tips for living  a long life, like enjoying a little bit of whiskey in your morning  coffee and smoking cigars.   In April, we mourned the loss of Richard Cole, the 103-year-old World  War II veteran who was part of the Doolittle Raiders. He and his  brothers in arms carried out a strike on factories and military  installations in Tokyo, against enormous odds, providing a desperately  needed morale boost after the attack on Pearl Harbor.   Just last week, we said farewell to another member of the Greatest  Generation, 100-year-old Bill Hayes. Colonel Hayes was one of the last  living Pearl Harbor veterans and spent nearly four decades serving in  the U.S. Army.   While we honor those who served in the past, we also celebrate those  serving now and the young men and women who one day will put on a  uniform.   In just a few days, I will have the privilege of speaking to young  Texans who will be attending one of our country's five prestigious  military service academies. I hold the sendoff each year in Texas to  meet the next generation of our military leaders and to thank them for  their willingness to serve our country in uniform.   Today, in advance of this holiday weekend, I would like to say thank  you to the men and women stationed across my State and the veterans who  call Texas home.   On behalf of a grateful nation, thank you to all the brave men and  women who lost their lives while fighting for our freedoms. We will  never forget your service or your sacrifice.                               DISASTER RELIEF     Mr. President, on another matter, we were all hoping that  the Senate would soon be able to vote on a disaster aid bill that would  send funds to States throughout the Southeast and Midwest that continue  to battle with the impacts of severe weather.   When a hurricane, tornado, wildfire, or whatever the case may be,  hits your State, securing funds to help with relief and recovery  becomes priority No. 1. I know because after Texas was hit by Hurricane  Harvey in 2017, I worked with the entire bipartisan Texas delegation to  secure funding that would help both with the immediate aftermath and  long-term recovery and rebuilding efforts.   We received tremendous support from our colleagues here in Congress,  as well as President Trump, in making sure that Texas communities had  the funding and resources they needed. Our State has made a great deal  of progress since Hurricane Harvey hit, and most Texans have returned  to some sense of normalcy, but the recovery process is not over.   In February of last year, Congress appropriated more than $28 billion  in community development block grants for disaster recovery, with  roughly $12 billion intended specifically for mitigation purposes.  About $4 billion of that was designated for Texas to fund projects that  will improve resiliency and help us prepare for future storms. But as  Texans who continue to recover from Hurricane Harvey have learned,  getting a disaster relief bill passed in Congress and signed by the  President doesn't mean the check is in the mail.   It has now been 15 months since that bill was signed, and Texans  haven't seen a penny of it. Despite numerous attempts to get the  funding untangled from the redtape at the Office of Management and  Budget, we are still waiting.  [[Page S3078]]    That is simply not acceptable. It is not acceptable to me, it is not  acceptable to Texans still in need, and it shouldn't be acceptable to  the U.S. Congress.   I recently introduced a bill that would ensure that the Office of  Management and Budget wouldn't stand between communities impacted by  disaster and vital funding appropriated and approved by Congress. Once  signed into law, it would establish a ``shot clock'' requiring the  Office of Management and Budget to release funds appropriated by  Congress within 90 days.   This change would apply not only to this particular block of funding  but to any funds appropriated to the States which are being withheld by  the Office of Management and Budget.   With hurricane season just about a week away, there could not be a  more critical time to act.   It is important for us to come together in a bipartisan agreement  that can pass the Senate and the House and get the President's  signature. I hope that those who are negotiating this disaster relief  bill, including this shot clock provision, will continue to negotiate  in good faith so we can reach a compromise and reach a result soon.   Communities across our country need this money for disaster recovery  and mitigation, and they are simply tired of waiting for Congress to  act. I am hopeful that any agreement will include this shot clock  provision so we can finally get the roughly $4 billion in disaster  mitigation funding untangled from Washington redtape and get it to the  Texans who desperately need it.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of the  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of the act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of H.R. 2157,  as amended, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have 3 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
