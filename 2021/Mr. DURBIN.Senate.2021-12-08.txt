Res. 29 be expired.    Therefore, for the information of Senators, there will be  two rollcall votes beginning at 6:45 p.m.    Mr. President, yesterday, Chicago reported its first case  of the new coronavirus variant, Omicron. Our State's health officials  predicted this day would come; it did. They are actively preparing for  additional cases.   The World Health Organization has identified it as a variant of  concern. It has the potential for increased transmissibility and could  possibly--I underline ``possibly''--evade some protections from  existing vaccines.   But as we begin to learn about this variant, some hopeful signs have  emerged. On Sunday, Dr. Fauci described early data on the severity of  Omicron as ``encouraging.'' Additionally, today, we received  preliminary findings that patients are better protected against Omicron  with a third Pfizer dose.   And while it is still too soon to draw any definitive conclusions-- too soon--what is clear is that the historic investments we have made-- the Senate and President Biden--these investments in public health are  paying off.   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan--which we passed earlier this year  on, sadly, a partisan rollcall without a single Republican vote-- America is more prepared. That rescue package not only funded  production and distribution of lifesaving vaccines; it paved the way  for public health officials to detect and track new variants like  Omicron. It provided more than a billion dollars toward expanding and  accelerating genomic sequencing, the process that allows us to analyze  how the coronavirus is evolving and spreading in realtime, so we can  respond.   Thanks to this investment today, America is sequencing roughly 80,000  virus samples a week. Before President Biden took office, we were  sequencing fewer than 3,000; now, 80,000 a week. That has made a world  of difference when it comes to tracking the spread of a variant.   In less than 2 weeks since the variant was discovered in South  Africa, it has been identified in at least 19 States in addition to  Illinois.   As we await more data on the risk Omicron poses to the public, here  are three things we know. First--and it bears repeating--the best  protection is to get vaccinated. Ninety-five percent of Americans are  eligible, and 70 percent have already gotten at least one shot. Within  days, we will hit the impressive milestone of 200 million Americans  getting fully vaccinated. We need to continue to promote this  incredible safety tool, and that means booster shots as well.   Second, America must continue to support the global vaccine campaign.  As I have said before, COVID doesn't know borders. As long as it is  circulating across the globe, the risk of virus mutation growing  stronger and roaring back into the United States continues to be real.   Fortunately, the Biden administration has already taken important  steps to address global vaccine inequality and get more shots to low- income countries. Just this week, USAID announced a $400 million  investment in a new global vaccine access program to deliver vaccines  to remote parts of the world.   I just got off the phone with Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham  and Women's Hospital, a prolific author, and a man who is very  insightful. He has agreed to step forward and to work with  Administrator Samantha Power at USAID. He is the right person for this  job at this very moment. So I encourage my colleagues to let him move  off the calendar and into the job as quickly as possible. We need his  expertise at USAID.   The third point I would like to make is that we need to build on the  American Rescue Plan's investment in public health. Effective public  health systems are like smoke detectors: They can alert us to deadly  dangers long before they threaten.   At the start of this pandemic, America's public health system had  been ignored and underfunded for years. That is the reason why we  proposed nearly $10 billion in the Build Back Better plan, which we are  currently working on, to improve laboratory capacity, disease  detection, the workforce, and public health preparedness. This funding  will fortify our public health system at a time when it is absolutely  necessary.    I urge my colleagues to resist any attempt to remove this  provision during floor consideration. Do not open the spigot of Federal  dollars to this predatory industry. They have syphoned off enough money  and ruined enough lives of students as it is. We shouldn't perpetuate  this terrible fraud.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, if I can be  recognized.    Let me say to my colleague from Florida, I like your  resolution, and I really think it speaks to the sentiment shared by the  vast majority--maybe even all of the U.S. Senators.   I am not certain how to pronounce this young lady's name--Peng Shuai.    Peng Shuai. Well, I will accept you as my Mandarin coach  and refer to her as Peng Shuai.   It is outrageous. She reports sexual abuse by a high-ranking official  and then she disappears and they feed us occasional videotapes.   Well, I want to join you in commending the Women's Tennis  Association, and I also want to add that I  [[Page S9018]]  think the President was correct in not only saying that we were going  to withhold any diplomats being sent over to China during the next  round of the Olympic Games, but I understand the administration is  reaching out to other countries to join us.   Whether it is the Uighers or whether it is Ms. Peng Shuai, outrageous  human rights abuses should not be ignored. And as I glance at your  resolution here, it looks like you hit the nail on the head.   So why am I reserving the right to object?   Here is something that I think would be helpful in the cause of human  rights. What if the United States of America actually had an Ambassador  in China?   Think about that possibility. We would have someone representing our  country on the scene in Beijing working for the United States, speaking  up for human rights.   Well, what is holding us back? Why won't Biden nominate somebody for  this job?   Well, it turns out he did, a man named Nicholas Burns.   Well, we all know him. He has a long record of diplomacy in Foreign  Service--service in Russia and other places. He is a key man in the  State Department and one that we can rely on. And he should be in  Beijing fighting for the causes that you and I agree on today.   What can possibly be holding him up? We need him there.   Well, it turns out he is being held up by that side of the aisle  objecting to his being called.   Well, we have a chance to resolve that today. We can pass not only  your resolution, but we can appoint Mr. Burns as the Ambassador to  China and get it done and he could be on a plane in the morning.   How about that? That would be an amazing thing to accomplish. You  take that home to Florida, and I will take that home to Illinois. It is  a good day's work.   And so, to reach that end, I ask that the pending request be modified  as follows: Notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of the following nomination: Calendar No. 525, R.  Nicholas Burns, of Massachusetts, to be Ambassador of the United States  of America to People's Republic of China; that the nomination be  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions  be in order to the nomination; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action; and then, as if in legislative  session, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of your  resolution, S. Res. 474, submitted earlier today; that the resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table without intervening action  or debate.   What an amazing bipartisan achievement that we can put together in  just a few minutes here.    Mr. President, time is wasting. We need an Ambassador to  China.   I am sorry, but I object.    I announce that the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Van  Hollen) is necessarily absent.
