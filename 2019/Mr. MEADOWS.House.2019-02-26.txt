 Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Missouri is exactly  right. It is the statutes that allow this President to do this.   The statutes don't provide for national emergencies on climate  change. They don't allow for national emergencies on gun violence. But  they do allow it in terms of this particular issue.   The President is exactly right. There is a crisis at the border, Mr.  Speaker. But not only this President recognizes it. The previous  President, Obama, in 2014, did as well when he requested $3.7 billion  in emergency spending to secure the border.   Where was the outrage then? Where was the outrage from my colleagues  across the aisle?   President Obama even went further to say that we needed to secure our  border to deter both adults and children from the dangerous journey  that they embarked on.   Where was the outrage across the aisle then, Mr. Speaker? It was not  there.   Keeping criminals, human traffickers, and drug smugglers away from  our communities is paramount.                                time  1545    Yes, indeed, we do have an opioid problem. We have actually  appropriated billions of dollars to address that. And yet, somehow, the  drugs flowing across our southern border are not a crisis?   Again, President Obama seemed to agree with this and declared a  national emergency for transnational criminal organizations,  specifically calling out Mexico's Los Zetas gang, and provided more  authority for ICE to actually combat that; a national emergency. Where  was the outrage across the aisle then?   But we don't even have to look just at the previous administration.  President Clinton also declared a national emergency to go after  narcotics traffickers.   Mr. Speaker, I just find it just unbelievable that here today, that  we have got these newfound constitutionalists across the aisle, wanting  to rein in the President's authority.   This is about defeating President Trump. I encourage a ``no'' vote on  this resolution.
