 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the colead of H.R. 3733, the  Essential Caregivers Act, to tell the stories of Americans across the  country who are desperately calling on Congress to immediately act on  this bill.   I also thank Representative Larson, who is my colead, for helping me  sponsor this bill. I am grateful to him for his leadership and his  compassion.   I have shared many heartbreaking and tragic stories before in this  Chamber, and I will continue to do so until there is action on my  bipartisan Essential Caregivers Act. Just as so many families who were  forced to helplessly watch as their loved ones rapidly declined  physically and mentally in long-term care facilities, I am not going to  give up this fight. I am just getting started.   First and foremost, the Essential Caregivers Act is a critically  important bill that would ensure the policies that were put in place  during the COVID-19 pandemic never happen again. In my home State of  New York, and many States across the Nation, families were literally  shut out from their loved ones living in long-term care facilities,  neglecting the basic needs of their loved ones at these facilities.  These decisions to isolate long-term care facility residents were fatal  and will have long-lasting impacts.    Today, I am here to share stories that go beyond my home State of New  York. I will begin by sharing a story from Alaska. This is an excerpt  from the book entitled ``Protecting Them to Death.'' This is a book  that was compiled and written by my great constituent, Karla Abraham- Conley, who lost her mother in a long-term care facility.   This is an excerpt from the book compiled using COVID-19 isolation  stories. The first one is a story from Denise Brown:         ``Ohana'' means ``family'' in Hawaiian and that no one is       left behind. This word means a lot to us. My mother's skilled       nursing facility was an hour away from her home and ours, so       they became her pseudo ohana.        She was moved there by the State of Alaska when an employee       brought COVID-19 into her extended care facility. She was       able to see us through a window once or twice a week because       she was on the ground floor at that time. We talked every day       on the phone, except for those days when she was too weak to       answer my call. Last year on her birthday, when she was in       the final skilled nursing facility that the State had moved       her to, we cooked her dinner outside her window, we sent it       in to her via a CNA. My boys built her rock towers, and we       sang ``Happy Birthday'' through the window. But the moment       they moved my mother to the second floor, I think she gave up       hope of getting stronger, of seeing the faces she loved       through the window. It was her one connection to us that       still seemed real and wasn't through a virtual visit. We lost       her on January 12, 2021.    Mr. Speaker, Ms. Brown could still be here with us today if she had  had access to an essential caregiver.   The next two stories come to us from Arizona. The first story is from  Linda Thompson, also featured in the book ``Protecting Them to Death'':         My husband is in a memory care facility. He no longer       speaks as a direct result of the isolation during the       pandemic. He uses a walker. Because he was confined to his       room, he was unable to exercise his legs. All his physical       abilities have declined significantly. Change of any kind       takes a toll on dementia residents. Knowing that he spent 17       days in a sterile room in the COVID-19 ward of his facility       is heartbreaking. He had very few symptoms but lost 20       pounds. I am still praying this never happens again.   [[Page H6721]]     If he had access to his loved ones, Mrs. Thompson's husband might  still be speaking today. But the moment he was shut off from his  essential caregivers, his health took a devastating toll.   Also from Arizona, here is the story from Anne Martinez, who lost her  mother in the pandemic, also from the book ``Protecting Them to  Death'':         Every time I visited my mother, she looked like a zoo       animal behind the patio door. She would mouth that she was       hungry or motion for what I had brought to drink. The       blueberries I left got moldy, the almond milk grew stale, and       the canned organic soups gathered dust. Nobody was giving       them to her. My dad gestured at the closed patio window how       much he missed her, and she avoided eye contact so as not to       cry. Some days I was allowed to bring home-cooked meals and       other days I was not allowed to feed her.        On the day she was transferred to a hospice care facility,       I was with her to say goodbye and could see the particles in       her dentures that had not been cleaned in weeks and blackened       food underneath her fingernails from trying to eat with her       bare hands.        I was actually relieved when they told me she had       contracted COVID shortly after being vaccinated. Nobody       deserves to spend their last years, months, weeks, or even       days, alone in a facility without their loved ones at their       side.    Anne's story is just one of thousands that are occurring across this  Nation.   I will continue sharing these stories and urging immediate passage of  the bipartisan Essential Caregivers Act. Denise, Linda, Anne, and their  families, friends, and loved ones are depending on it.                            ____________________
