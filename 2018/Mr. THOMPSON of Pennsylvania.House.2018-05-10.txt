 Mr. Speaker, I rise today about an  excellent event that will take place Saturday in communities throughout  the Nation.   The 26th annual Letter Carriers' Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive is the  country's largest single-day food drive. It is the brainchild of the  National Association of Letter Carriers in response to the need they  saw every day on their routes.   Letter carriers go into neighborhoods in every town at least 6 days a  week, and they have a keen awareness of their neighbors in need. After  receiving input from food banks and pantries, the letter carriers  determined that late spring would be the best time for a food drive  since by then most food banks in the country start running out of  donations received during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday  periods.   Known for its distinctive blue plastic bags, the Stamp Out Hunger  Food Drive provides nonperishable food to local food banks, shelters,  and meal programs across the United States.   One bag of food may seem small, but it goes a long way to stamp out  hunger.  [[Page H3919]]                                ____________________
