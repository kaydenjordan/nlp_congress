 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill.  This weekend, millions of women made it clear that they demand respect.   Instead, for their efforts, they have received a trip to 1984 where,  once again, a paternalistic White House signed executive orders  infringing on a woman's right to choose.   H.R. 7, the bill we are considering here today, is the next notch in  the Republican belt that will take away our control over our own  bodies.   I have years of experience working in family planning, and I can tell  you that this bill takes away our ability to plan our families properly  and to make decisions about our own bodies, a decision that should be  left to a woman and her physician.   Make no mistake, this isn't a healthcare issue. It is part of an  extreme rightwing political agenda that puts women's rights on the  chopping block.   H.R. 7 tells millions of women that their voices don't matter and  their rights don't count. Passing this bill will create even more  barriers for women, including women of color, trying to access quality  health care.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided and heavy-handed bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  immigrants across our country.   As an immigrant myself, I understand the sacrifices and hardships  that immigrants experience. My parents sacrificed their very small life  savings to send me to the United States at the age of 16 by myself to  pursue college. That is why I stayed in my district last Friday to host  an immigration roundtable with directly impacted constituents.   Like many of us, Mr. Speaker, they have heard reports that this new  administration intends to deport millions of people across our country  rather than working towards a comprehensive reform of our immigration  system, similar to the one that was passed in the other Chamber with 68  bipartisan votes, unfortunately, never brought to the floor of this  Chamber.   I heard from children, Mr. Speaker, afraid to go to school out of  fear that their parents will be taken away while they are at school. I  heard from people whose lives are still in limbo because they have no  idea what is going to happen next.   But despite their fear, they still are ready to stand together and  fight for their futures, and their courage and resilience is truly  inspiring. We owe it to them to fight alongside them.                            ____________________
