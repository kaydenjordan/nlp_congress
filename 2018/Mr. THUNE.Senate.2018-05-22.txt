 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  conclude my remarks regarding this upcoming vote prior to the vote.    Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for  the nomination of Dana Baiocco to be a Commissioner at the Consumer  Product Safety Commission. Ms. Baiocco has dedicated her career to  product safety and liability matters, and it is my firm belief that her  depth of experience and familiarity with consumer product safety issues  will bring an important perspective to the Commission once she is  confirmed.   Born and raised in Yorkville, OH, Ms. Baiocco attended the Duquesne  University School of Law, graduating cum laude in 1997. While still in  law school, Ms. Baiocco served as a law clerk for the U.S. District  Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In 1998, she joined the  law firm of Jones Day and became a partner in 2007, where she has  dedicated her legal career to counseling clients on product safety and  liability issues. In 2011, she became one of the founding partners of  Jones Day's Boston office, which opened that same year.   Currently, the CPSC retains a 3-to-1 Democratic majority. While the  Commerce Committee has favorably reported Ms. Baiocco's nomination, as  well as Acting Chairman Anne Marie Buerkle's nomination twice this  Congress, both have been unfairly held up by some on the other side.  The CPSC deserves a fully constituted Commission of Senate-confirmed  leaders. Ms. Baiocco's confirmation is a crucial measure of good  governance to restore balance to the Commission.   To date, I have not heard a single argument against Ms. Baiocco's  abilities. Notwithstanding her extensive qualifications to be an  effective Commissioner at the CPSC, however, some of our colleagues on  the other side have voiced concerns about her nomination on the grounds  that her career representing business clients in the consumer product  and liability space may impact her impartiality when considering issues  before the Commission. A few have also raised concerns about her  impartiality on the basis of her spouse's career as a litigator and  partner at the law firm of White and Williams.   Well, to my colleagues who harbor such concerns, I would note that  the Senate routinely confirms nominees who are lawyers with private  practice backgrounds, and we expect such officeholders to advocate for  the public interest just as zealously as they once advocated for their  clients.   I would also remind our colleagues of the role the Office of  Government Ethics plays in ensuring that nominees have resolved any  actual or apparent conflict of interests before they are even  considered by the Senate. The Office of Government Ethics has closely  scrutinized Ms. Baiocco's financial disclosures to ensure compliance  with all requirements and evaluated Ms. Baiocco's finances and  background for conflicts of interest.  [[Page S2815]]    Further, Ms. Baiocco has formerly pledged in her ethics agreement  that she would recuse herself from matters involving her firm, Jones  Day, or its clients unless issued a waiver. She also specifically  stated in her ethics agreement that she will not ``participate  personally or substantially in any particular matter involving specific  parties in which [she knows] a client of her spouse is a party or  represents a party'' unless authorized. Additionally, she has complied  with all matters concerning the management of her financial assets in  the future.   It is my firm belief that Ms. Baiocco's experience will afford a  unique perspective as a commissioner and serve the CPSC well. There is  no legitimate reason to delay her confirmation any further. I,  therefore, urge my colleagues to support her nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, tax reform is working. The results of two  surveys released last week show that tax reform is doing exactly what  it is supposed to be doing for American workers.   Our goal with tax reform was simple: make life better for American  workers. So we took action to put more money into Americans' pockets  right away. We cut tax rates across the board, nearly doubled the  standard deduction, and doubled the child tax credit. Americans are  already seeing this relief in their paychecks.   We knew that tax cuts, as essential as they were, were not enough. In  order to make life better for American workers, we also needed to make  sure Americans had access to good jobs, good wages, and good  opportunities, the kinds of jobs and opportunities that would set them  up for security and prosperity in the long term. Since jobs and  opportunities are created by businesses, that meant reforming our Tax  Code to improve the playing field for businesses so that they could  improve the playing field for workers, and that is what we did.   I am proud to report that it is working. Last week, the National  Association of Manufacturers released the results of its recent tax  reform survey, and here is what the survey showed: 77 percent of  manufacturers planned increased hiring as a result of tax reform, 72  percent planned to increase wages or benefits, and 86 percent report  they plan to increase investments, which means new jobs and  opportunities for workers. These are tremendous results, and they are  exactly what we were looking for with tax reform.   Government can make sure it isn't taking too much out of Americans'  pockets, but it can't create the jobs and opportunities Americans need  for long-term economic security and prosperity. Only businesses can do  that. But government can make sure that businesses are free to create  jobs by making sure they are not weighed down with burdensome taxes and  regulations, and that is exactly what we set out to do with tax reform.   Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the government was not helping  businesses to create jobs. In fact, it was doing the opposite. That had  real consequences for American workers. A small business owner  struggling to afford the hefty annual tax bill for her business was  highly unlikely to be able to hire a new worker or to raise wages. A  larger business struggling to stay competitive in the global  marketplace while paying a substantially higher tax rate than its  foreign competitors too often had limited funds to expand or increase  investment in the United States.   When it came time for tax reform, we set out to improve the playing  field for American workers by improving the playing field for  businesses as well. To accomplish that, we lowered tax rates across the  board for owners of small and medium-sized businesses, farms, and  ranches. We lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate, which up  until January 1 was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed  world. We expanded business owners' ability to recover investments that  they make in their businesses, which frees up cash that they can  reinvest in their operations and their workers. We brought the U.S.  international tax system into the 21st century by replacing our  outdated worldwide system with a modernized territorial tax system so  that American businesses are not operating at a disadvantage next to  their foreign competitors.   Now we are seeing the results. I will say it again. Seventy-seven  percent of manufacturers are planning to increase hiring, 72 percent  are planning to increase wages or benefits, and 86 percent are planning  to increase investments, which creates new jobs and new opportunities  for American workers.   I haven't even mentioned last week's other survey on small  businesses. The National Federation of Independent Business released a  survey last week that shows that 75 percent of small business owners  think that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have a positive effect on  their business. The survey also showed that among small business owners  who expect to pay less in taxes next year, 44 percent plan to increase  employee compensation, and more than a quarter plan to hire new  employees.   Those numbers may get even better. As the survey shows, small  businesses are just starting to explore all the benefits of the new tax  law since small businesses, unlike large businesses, don't have full- time tax departments to plan for and take into account the new tax  changes. Most small businesses spend the first part of each year  focused on preparing and filing their taxes from the prior year, not to  mention running their businesses, which means, with tax day now behind  them, they are just now having the chance to explore the benefits of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, their tax advisers--many of  whom are often small businesses themselves--have also wrapped up most  of their filing season responsibilities, so now they can help their  small business clients with factoring the new tax changes into their  business plans.   American workers had a tough time during the last administration.  Wages stagnated, and jobs and opportunities were often few and far  between. But thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other Republican  initiatives, our economy is turning around. Unemployment is at its  lowest level in more than 17 years. Economists have upped their  projections for economic growth. And the good news for American workers  just keeps piling up--more jobs, more opportunities, higher wages, and  better benefits. The American dream is roaring back, and the future is  looking bright.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
