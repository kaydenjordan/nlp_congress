 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Fisher House Foundation  amendment No. 13.   Often, servicemembers must travel hundreds or even thousands of miles  for medical care.   For more than 25 years, Fisher Houses have provided a home away from  home for the family members of those who are receiving treatment at a  military or VA Medical Center. These houses provide stability,  convenience, and one less thing to worry about for families as their  husbands, wives, sons, or daughters undergo treatment.   Each time I visit the St. Louis Fisher House at Jefferson Barracks, I  witness firsthand the dedication of the staff and the volunteers who  assist the families of our veterans and servicemembers.   An increase in funds will allow the construction of more Fisher  Houses, providing lodging to thousands of military families. We know  that a family's love is the best medicine, and good care makes the  tough days bearable.   I look forward to casting my vote in support of this important  foundation. Together, we can make the lives of those who heroically  serve our country just a little bit easier.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman for all of her leadership. I thank  the gentleman for his cosponsorship and for his yielding me this time.
