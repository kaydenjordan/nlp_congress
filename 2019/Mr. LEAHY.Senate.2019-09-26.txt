 Mr. President, I am pleased that the fiscal year 2020  appropriations bill for the Department of State and Foreign Operations  was reported unanimously by the committee earlier today. There is a  great deal in the bill that the American people can feel good about, as  the summaries released by both the majority and minority indicate.  However, as is always the case with bipartisan legislation, there are  also things that I wish were not in the bill, and there are things  missing from the bill that I wish had been included. I want to speak  about one of those.   I deeply regret that the bill does not even mention the words  ``climate change.'' That is remarkable, or perhaps a better word is  ``appalling,'' when one considers the existential threat that climate  change poses for every living thing on Earth. If Democrats were in the  majority, funding for programs to combat global warming and adapt to  climate change would be a priority in the bill. Instead, it is  completely missing.   An example is the Green Climate Fund, GCF, which was created in 2010  with the active participation of the United States. Its mission is to  respond to climate change by investing in low-emission and climate- resilient development. The GCF was established to limit or reduce  greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries and to help vulnerable  societies adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. The  United States contributed a total of $1 billion in the first 2 years of  operation of the GCF.   Then President Trump was elected. Even though, according to press  reports, the Trump Organization had previously cited climate change in  its application for a permit to build a barrier to protect a Trump golf  course from the rising sea level and increasingly powerful storms, he  continues to publicly refuse to recognize climate change as a serious  threat. Despite that hypocrisy and overwhelming scientific recognition  of the impact of burning fossil fuels on the Earth's climate, the Trump  White House withdrew from the Paris climate agreement and opposed  further U.S. funding for the GCF. Republican majorities in the Congress  fell into line, and in the past two appropriations bills, there has  been no funding for a U.S. contribution to the GCF.   The next replenishment for the GCF is scheduled for 2020. Since there  are no funds in the bill just reported by the Appropriations Committee  for a U.S. contribution to the GCF, absent an about-face by the White  House, the United States will not make a replenishment pledge. It will  be left to other countries to ensure that the GCF continues to operate.  Once again, U.S. leadership to address what many believe to be the most  ominous threat facing the world is nowhere to be seen.   Despite that inexcusable failure by the White House and the  Republican leadership in Congress, it is important to emphasize that  overwhelmingly the American people recognize the threat that climate  change poses and they want strong action to address it. They see what  is happening here and around the world, as extreme climatic events-- hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, droughts, and forest fires, coupled  with crop failures, displacement of people whose homes and livelihoods  are destroyed, and unprecedented migration flows--become more and more  frequent and destructive. They rightly fear that if we fail to act, not  long from now, these types of disasters will be exponentially worse,  and they worry about the chaos this would cause for their children and  grandchildren.   I mention this because I am confident that as soon as we have a  President who puts the lives of future generations above the profits  and campaign contributions of the fossil fuel companies, the United  States will once again become a leader against climate change and a  leading contributor to the GCF. Other countries should understand this.  Despite President Trump and his cheerleaders in Congress, the United  States has not turned its back on the threat of climate change, nor  have we abandoned the GCF. Presidents come and go, and while U.S.  support for diplomacy and programs to combat climate change is  currently suspended, the American people, and especially the younger  generation, will make sure that suspension is only temporary.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today we remember and remind the world that  nearly 1 year has passed since the premeditated murder of Jamal  Khashoggi by the Saudi Government.   That horrific crime, carried out so brazenly as if it were just a  routine job, exposed the true character of the Saudi Government not  only as it pertains to Mr. Khashoggi but to the ruthless treatment of  critics of the Saudi royal family more broadly.   While the Crown Prince systematically orders the execution of his  opponents, he has so far escaped punishment for the murder of Mr.  Khashoggi and for the lies about that crime.   Multiple Saudi officials, including the Foreign Minister, Minister of  Interior, and others--all members of the royal family--flagrantly and  shamelessly lied to the world, repeatedly changing their story.   The Crown Prince called Khashoggi a ``dangerous jihadist.'' That too  was a lie.   The Saudis, who have refused to turn over Mr. Khashoggi's remains,  insist that the men who were arrested are the only ones involved in the  murder. No one who knows anything about the Saudi royal family, which  is the Saudi Government, believes that.   Despite all the incriminating evidence and all the lies, the White  House continues to ignore its own intelligence experts and the U.N.  Special Rapporteur, relying instead on the Saudi royal family to  investigate itself. What a sham.   This crime reminds us that journalists the world over who shine a  spotlight on corrupt, repressive governments risk their lives and the  safety of their families. They are threatened and killed for nothing  more than doing their job.   Today we are also concerned about the fate of hundreds of courageous  pro-democracy activists who have recently been arrested for protesting  against corruption and repression in Egypt. Journalists, members of  opposition political parties, and civil society activists in Egypt are  routinely persecuted, denied due process, and subjected to prolonged  physical and psychological abuse.   If the Saudi royal family can escape punishment for the premeditated  murder of a Washington Post journalist, what does that say to  journalists everywhere? What does it say about our own government, if  we accept that?   I want to remind the Saudi Government, the White House, and the State  Department that we do not--and we will not--accept that. Jamal  Khashoggi was murdered, and there is no reasonable doubt about who is  culpable. Justice will be done--no matter how long it takes.                            ____________________
