 Madam Speaker, I rise to thank and welcome Pastor  Wright. Pastor Wright serves as pastor of my home congregation, Holy  Cross Lutheran Church and School in Collinsville, Illinois.   He received his undergraduate degree from Concordia University in  Austin, Texas, and a master of divinity from Concordia Theological  Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He is currently pursuing a master of  sacred theology at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri.   He has served as a pastor for the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod  since 2006. During that time, he has also served as a resource hospital  chaplain, hospice chaplain, and on multiple boards.   His wife, Keri, is the help, support, and love of his life. They have  four beautiful daughters. Katie is 12; Gwen, 10; Lilli, 10; and Magie,  also 10.   Yes, you heard it right, triplets.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, it is great to be out here with my friends  on both sides of the aisle. As many know, I have announced I am not  going to run for reelection. One of the successes is because of what  Chairman Young was able to do in the last Congress.   Mr. Chairman, I have been to the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I  don't want to debunk the view. Alaska is bigger than the whole  continental United States. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a  small area where no one is at. I have been there. I hope you get there.  It is a flat coastal plain. This would be like putting a drilling rig  that is the size of a football field on the State of South Carolina. We  can't debunk those arguments.   My father-in-law worked on the pipeline. He was a communications  microwave guy. There are thousands of jobs.   Also, an insidious part of this plan is we know that the pipeline has  to have oil in it to flow. We know that we need to continue to have  exploration up there so that there is enough oil to keep that pipeline  operating.   My friends in the environmental left organizations want to shut down  the pipeline. This will make sure it doesn't get shut down.
