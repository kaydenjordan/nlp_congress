 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my constituents are discouraged. They are  fed up with political elites who have failed to represent them, and  with special interest groups who, too often, put impractical dogma  before practical policy.   In the Rust Belt region I represent in upstate New York, the impact  of this has been devastating: devastating job losses, economic  stagnation, and the massive out-migration of people and jobs, the  largest in the Nation.   In my district, Mr. Chairman, decline has bred despair, which has  spurred a host of other problems. In light of all this, I was elected  to Congress with a strong mission to reverse the tide and to revitalize  our upstate communities to the greatness and innovation they once  experienced.   I am the voice for my constituents who have been left behind, and I  am fighting to bring my district back on path toward individual  prosperity and economic revival.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment uniquely achieves both. There is nothing  new or groundbreaking about my amendment. Simply put, it reinstates a  domestic sourcing provision for stainless steel flatware that was in  law for 30 years without issue. My amendment adds stainless steel  flatware back into the Berry amendment.   For 30 years, American-made flatware was covered under Berry.  However, the provision was removed in 2006 after Oneida Limited, the  only Berry-compliant manufacturer, ceased domestic operations.   In the void left by Oneida's departure came Sherrill Manufacturing, a  company in my district that, since 2008, has produced 100 percent  American-made flatware. And since 2008, Sherrill has been among the top  providers of flatware to the Department of Defense and GSA, fulfilling  more than $6.8 million in Federal contracts over an 8-year period.   All these products are being produced in the formerly closed factory  using refurbished Oneida Limited equipment, and also providing jobs for  many of the same employees who lost their jobs from Oneida's closure  after decades of service to that same closed factory. In fact, GSA has  repeatedly found Sherrill's flatware to be offered at fair and  reasonable prices, which is why the agency already purchases flatware  from Sherrill, independent of any domestic sourcing requirement.   Some domestic sourcing requirements may raise costs. No evidence has  been submitted to support the claim that my amendment will do that.  This alone should allay any concerns that taxpayers would be on the  hook for overly expensive flatware, should my amendment be adopted. But  if it isn't enough, then there is this:   My amendment retains all existing waivers under Berry, which means  that, if Sherrill's flatware becomes too expensive or is of poor  quality or insufficient quality, the DOD can find other sources.   Ultimately, Mr. Chairman, whenever we can create domestic sourcing  opportunities that reduce our military's dependence on imported goods  and strengthen domestic supply chains without significantly raising  procurement costs, we should. And this is what my amendment does.   Reinstating the Berry amendment's domestic sourcing requirement  represents a clear continuity in Federal procurement policy, not a  stark divergence. As I said, this provision was in effect for 30 years.   Thus far, there is one Berry-compliant manufacturer that happens to  be in my district and there should not be a problem with that, as we  hope many more producers return to the United States, where their  businesses were founded to provide robust competition.   I also support this amendment for the simple reason that it is good  policy. It gives a leg up to a robust domestic supply chain that spans  five States while reducing our military's logistical dependence on  imports.   Moreover, for the 30-year history of the Berry amendment's flatware  provision, there was only ever one domestic producer. Under the Berry  amendment, this is all that is required. And in Sherrill's case, we  know it is a producer that has a track record of offering flatware at  market rates.   Mr. Chairman, in districts like mine across the country that have  rusted-out factories that line the landscapes of far too many of my  communities, today we have an opportunity to fix this problem and  restore the once great Empire State and our Nation to the manufacturing  strength it once enjoyed. I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan measure.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), my colleague, for some comments.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of New York  State Trooper Joel R. Davis.   Trooper Davis was tragically killed in the line of duty on July 9,  while responding to a domestic disturbance call in the town of Theresa,  in upstate New York. Another victim was also tragically killed in this  terrible accident.   Trooper Davis was a father, son, husband, and a friend to many. He  was deeply involved in his community, and also served as the  commissioner of a local youth league baseball team. Trooper Davis was  well-respected by all those who worked with him and beloved by  everyone.   As New Yorkers, we stand in solidarity to mourn the life of Trooper  Davis, a dedicated public servant and a life that was too soon lost. At  this heartbreaking time, we offer our condolences to his family,  community, and colleagues alike.   It is at times like these that we come together and pause to extend  our gratitude in all law enforcement in our State and across the Nation  who risk their lives every day to protect us and to keep us safe.   We are grateful for their dedication, service, and bravery of  outstanding members like Trooper Joel Davis, who will rest in peace.                            ____________________
