 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee for his leadership, and, in particular, Representative  Cicilline for his courage and his leadership in bringing this bill to  the floor.   It is long past time that we end discrimination against those in the  LGBTQ community in our country, and that is why I am so proud to  support the Equality Act.   Fairness, equality--these are core American values. And yet today, in  many States across the United States, Americans can be fired, can be  denied a mortgage, or they might struggle in being able to obtain  housing, all because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.   That ends with the passage of the Equality Act. Every American is  equal under the law.   And so I would say to my friends at Out Boulder County back home,  thank you for your activism. To my friends at One Colorado, thank you  for your activism. To every LGBTQ American who has stood up and has  fought for equality over a generation, I say thank you.   And to the Members gathered here today, I implore you: Let's join  together, and let's pass the Equality Act today and end discrimination  once and for all.
