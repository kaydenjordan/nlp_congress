 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we recently passed the 1-year anniversary  of President Biden's inauguration. It is a natural time for taking  stock of the first year of his Presidency.   In President Biden, we were supposed to get a leader--a leader at  home and on the world stage. The grownups, we were told, were back in  the room. But the truth of the matter is that President Biden's first  year in office has been marked by a lack of leadership more than  anything else.   Again and again, President Biden has simply abdicated his  responsibilities. Take perhaps the two defining domestic crises of the  Biden Presidency: our inflation crisis and our border crisis. In both  cases, the response of the President and his administration has by and  large been to stick their fingers in their ears and pretend the crises  don't exist. Sure, the President or his people make a gesture toward  the problem every now and then, but mostly, you would be forgiven for  thinking that neither the border crisis nor the inflation crisis was  even on the President's radar.   Migrants continue to pour across our southern border in massive  numbers, creating a humanitarian, enforcement, and security nightmare.  And the President? Well, he appears to believe that if he ignores the  problem long enough, it will go away. When he does talk about  immigration, it amounts to a green light to the cartels and traffickers  to keep leading migrants to our borders. That is why I recently joined  more than 100 lawmakers in requesting that the Department of Homeland  Security's inspector general investigate the Biden administration's  border failures.   Between the President's rhetoric and his failure to take any  meaningful action to address the influx of illegal immigration, it is  no surprise that we saw more than half a million attempts to cross our  southern border illegally in the current fiscal year's first 3 months  alone--half a million.   Meanwhile, American families are struggling with the worst inflation  in 40 years--40 years. The last time inflation was this bad, ``E.T.''  was just premiering, and ``Return of the Jedi'' hadn't even come out  yet. American families are struggling with huge increases in the price  of the most basic necessities, from food to fuel. And the  administration's response? Mostly crickets.   Of course, President Biden hasn't just been largely ignoring this  crisis; he actually helped create it. The so-called American Rescue  Plan Act the Democrats passed and the President signed into law in  March of last year helped produce the sky-high inflation we are  experiencing. But instead of addressing the resulting crisis, the  President has been focused on passing another massive government  spending bill that would almost undoubtedly worsen our inflation  problem. Yes, his solution to our inflation crisis is to double down on  the strategy that helped produce so much inflation in the first place.   Meanwhile, Americans are wondering if their paychecks will stretch to  afford the sharp increases at the grocery store and in gas prices,  utility bills, household commodities, and the list goes on.   On the world stage, of course, the defining moment of President  Biden's first year was his disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. The  President's arbitrary, chaotic withdrawal was a real low point for our  country. Thirteen of our military men and women died in a terrorist  attack during the evacuation from Kabul. We abandoned thousands of  individuals who had worked with us in Afghanistan and whom we had  promised to protect and left behind hundreds of American citizens. The  President, who was supposed to restore our standing on the world stage,  left our allies wondering if our word could be relied on, not to  mention the fact that the disastrous withdrawal left our country in a  more precarious national security position.   Meanwhile, the President's recent press conference left serious  questions as to how well he is likely to handle another pressing  national security, and that is the issue in Ukraine. Casually  dismissing a possible ``minor incursion'' into Ukraine's sovereign  territory did not inspire confidence in the President's ability to  stand up to Russia.    We can't afford missteps and walk backs. Putin is looking to test  America and NATO's resolve, looking for any hesitation or division. I  hope the President and the majority party will take seriously the  threat to Ukraine, utilize any remaining levers of American influence  to deter a renewed attack, and, if Putin proceeds, make him immediately  realize it was a miscalculation.   Perhaps the biggest thing the President was going to do--the most  important way he was going to be a leader--was to pull our country  together. That was the defining theme of President Biden's inaugural  address.   I quote:         Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:       Bringing America together. Uniting our people. And uniting       our nation.    Contrast that speech with the speech that book-ended the other end of  his first year, his speech in Georgia on election legislation. We went  from a President who wanted to unite our Nation to a President who  refers to his political opponents as enemies.   ``We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors,'' the  President said in his inaugural address. ``We can treat each other with  dignity and respect.'' In his Georgia speech, by contrast, the  President's political opponents became not only adversaries but enemies  and racists, all for the crime of disagreeing with the President's  vision of election reform.   The President's complete condemnation of half the country was  striking. I lost track of the number of people he implied were racist.  The President assumed bad faith on the part of those who disagree with  him. Missing from his speech was any shred of recognition that perhaps  Americans of good will can disagree on election legislation. No, if you  disagree with the President, you are a racist. Like Hillary Clinton  before him, it is clear that President Biden conceives of a large  portion of the American people as deplorables. The President repeatedly  referred to justice in his Georgia speech. Perhaps he should consider  the profound injustice of baselessly suggesting half the country is  racist.   In his inaugural address, the President said, ``We must reject a  culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even  manufactured.'' I have been profoundly disappointed to see the  President and many of my Democrat colleagues manipulate the facts about  State election bills to support their desire for a Federal takeover of  elections.   Manipulated facts were a hallmark of the President's speech in  Georgia, as he tried to twist a mainstream election law into Jim Crow  2.0. His attempts were particularly ironic given that the State he was  complaining about offers greater opportunities to vote than are offered  by the President's home State of Delaware.   Days later, at a press conference marking his first year in office,  the President laid the groundwork for future division and disunity by  suggesting that the 2022 elections could be illegitimate if Democrats'  election legislation doesn't get passed; that is, I assume, if  Democrats don't win. It was yet another profoundly disappointing remark  from a President who was supposed to take the lead in bringing this  country together.   One year into the Biden Presidency, it has become clear that the  President of the inaugural address--the President whose whole soul was  committed to uniting our Nation--has long ago disappeared. The  President has not only failed to unite the country, but, as his ugly  and divisive speech in Georgia made clear, he has come to regard anyone  who opposes his policies with active hostility and contempt.   Just 1 year--1 year--after dedicating himself to uniting our country,  the President is dividing Americans into supporters and enemies. ``We  must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus  urban, conservative  [[Page S425]]  versus liberal,'' the President said in his inaugural address. It is  too bad the President's actions have not matched his words.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
