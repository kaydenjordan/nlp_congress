 Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous  question, we will consider an amendment to the rule to replace the  socialist $5 trillion tax-and-spend reconciliation instructions from  the fiscal year 2022 budget with a new call for committees to draft  legislation to reduce the deficit, to combat runaway inflation and help  get Americans back to work.   This country has been through a lot in the past year under one-party  rule by the Washington Democrats and President Biden.   We have an inflation crisis; we have an energy crisis; we have a  border crisis; and we have a supply chain crisis. Contributing to it  all is a leadership crisis in the Oval Office.   With all of these problems, you would think Democrats would finish  the year addressing just one--just one--of those issues.   But instead, Mr. Speaker, we are here on the last day of session for  the year, and Democrats have chosen to spend this valuable time  attacking former President Trump and his staff, attacking members of  the Republican Conference, and they have even found room to include a  $2.5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling.                                time  2120    In fact, since Speaker Pelosi took the gavel in the House in 2019,  House Democrats have added more than $9 trillion--House Democrats since  2019 have added more than $9 trillion to the national debt, which is  more than the combined deficits under all 72 years that Republicans  have ever been in the majority.   The American people, Mr. Speaker, they deserve a Congress that is  focused on the problems that they are facing in their everyday lives; a  Congress that is delivering on policies to stop the runaway rise in  prices, a problem that has now reached a 40-year high.   Even President Biden's budget in May predicted inflation at 2  percent, Mr. Speaker. We are now at over 7 percent, the highest  inflation in 40 years.   The White House administration says that inflation is a high-class  problem, Mr. Speaker. I will tell you, the people across America  believe it is a real problem. They care about the prices in the grocery  store. They don't care about the prices in the stock market.   But you know what, House Democrats argue and say inflation is  transitory, yet now they are finally agreeing that these rising costs  in prices are actually having a real impact.   We could be working on legislation to actually help American families  by reducing the cost of energy during the winter.   To do that, we need to get rid of the reconciliation instructions in  the Democrats' budget, the same reconciliation plan that has paralyzed  Washington for months as Democrats fought over how to spend $5  trillion.   Even the Congressional Budget Office on Friday confirmed that what  passed out of this Chamber a few weeks ago does not cost zero. It cost  $5 trillion.    Mr. Speaker, the official congressional  scorekeepers said on Friday that the build back broke bill that passed  out of here a couple weeks ago did not cost $1.5 trillion, did not cost  $2 trillion, but cost $5  [[Page H7811]]  trillion. But this administration will say it costs zero.   The American people see right through it. They see right through this  mess. And they know one thing. They know that this is nothing but  hogwash. It is hogwash, Mr. Speaker. And we should instead replace all  of these reconciliation instructions to bring forward a plan to reduce  the deficit and stop the inflation that is destroying family budgets.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  defeat the previous question, so that we can actually work on  legislation to help American families at the supermarket, to help  combat a price spike that is pushing working families to the brink and  to actually provide some real solutions this week on behalf of the  American people whom we represent in this body.
