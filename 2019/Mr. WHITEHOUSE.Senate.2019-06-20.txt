 Mr. President, it is my great honor to join Senator  Brown of Ohio here on this 50th anniversary.   The image of a river aflame is engraved in our collective memory. For  Ohioans, for Senator Brown, and for all others who care about our water  and environment, the Cuyahoga River remains a rallying cry.   Time magazine ran a piece in 1969 calling it this: ``Chocolate brown,  oily, bubbling with subsurface gasses, it oozes rather than flows.''   No fish lived in it. It was too dangerous for drinking or swimming.   ``The lower Cuyahoga has no visual signs of life, not even low forms  such as leeches and sludge worms that usually thrive on wastes,'' a  Federal report said.   Virginia Aveni, captain of a vessel charged with cleaning up, told  the Plain Dealer that the river ``was a complete gel almost of  petrochemicals.'' There was a ``sheen and thickness of the river . . .  . it was totally jammed with downfall from upstream'' and had ``every  kind of litter you can imagine.''   Today, waterfowl are back, and paddlers enjoy themselves. It has been  named River of the Year for 2019. Fish from the river are now safe to  eat. A river that inspired a generation to act in the name of our  environment has rewarded that effort.   By the time a spark jumped off a nearby passing train and lit the  river on fire in 1969, it was no surprise. The river had burst into  flames 13 times before between 1868 and 1969. This is the most  economically damaging fire, in 1952, which cost over $1.3 million--$12  million in today's dollars.   An earlier fire in 1912 was the deadliest, killing 5 people.   What was different this time? America paid attention.   Of course the Cuyahoga was not our only polluted waterway. The  Potomac River in Washington, DC, was, to describe it in Time's words  ``stinking from the 240 million gallons of waste [that] were flushed  into it daily,'' and ``Omaha's meatpackers [filled] the Missouri River  with animal grease balls as big as oranges.''   Americans wised up to what we were doing to our planet. We grew tired  of unchecked industries using our common assets as their dumps, and  things changed. It produced some of the most significant environmental  and public health protections in history: the December 1970  establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, the 1972  amendments to the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Lead-Based  Paint Poisoning Prevention Act, the Ocean Dumping Act, the Safe  Drinking Water Act, the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, and  the Toxic Substances Control Act. And, of course, there was the big  one--the National Environmental Policy Act.   Each one had broad popular support. Each garnered bipartisan support.  It is hard to imagine that today, but it happened.   The American people have made hard-earned progress protecting our  waters in the last 50 years. We want to swim in our lakes. We want to  fish in our rivers. We want to drink from our streams.   We do not want to go back to the days when rivers oozed, but the  Trump administration has the clear aim of allowing industry donors to  pollute more and faster.   The price for this is paid in our rivers, on our lands, in our  oceans, and in our climate. Right now, in our atmosphere and oceans, we  are approaching the kind of environmental catastrophe that befell the  Cuyahoga, only magnified many times over.   Let's ensure that the Cuyahoga did not burn in vain and that the  lessons of the Cuyahoga River, Love Canal, Deepwater Horizon, and other  preventable disasters are not repeated by us, now on a global scale. We  took bipartisan action to protect our environment before. If we can  break the devil's grip on the fossil fuel industry here, we can do it  again.
