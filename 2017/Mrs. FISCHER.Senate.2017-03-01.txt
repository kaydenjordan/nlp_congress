 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so  ordered.  [[Page S1521]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize a pivotal moment in  our Nation's history. On this day, 150 years ago, the Territory of  Nebraska became the 37th State to enter the Union.   Let me tell you the story of Nebraska. In a deep and powerful way, it  is the story of America. America grew up in Nebraska. We were the first  State admitted after the Civil War, but our admission was first vetoed  by President Andrew Johnson. It was the only time in American history  that this had happened. The reason? President Johnson disagreed with a  fundamental condition of Nebraska's statehood--that Black men be  allowed to vote.   Fortunately, Congress overrode this veto, and on March 1, 1867,  Nebraska became a State. I said before that Nebraska's statehood was a  pivotal moment for our country. Nebraska gave America a chance to be  better.   By bringing Nebraska into the Union, our country turned away from  slavery forever. We turned toward the truth about humankind--that  everyone is precious in Heaven's eyes. By making Nebraska a State,  America reached for a future more closely aligned with that truth.   Since that new birth of freedom, our Nation has taken many more  steps--some bold strides, some stumbles--but always we seek to be more  fully the country we were made to be. At a crucial moment, Nebraska  strengthened our commitment to do that. Nebraska renewed America's  identity.   As a State, Nebraska had not only hard but also humble beginnings.  They called it the Great American Desert. In the early 1800s, the  famous military officer and explorer Zebulon Pike shrugged us off,  saying simply: ``Not a stick of timber.'' A few years later, geologist  Edwin James and MAJ Steven Long gave us this review: ``The land was  uninhabitable by a people depending on agriculture.''   Today, wagon ruts can still be seen on Windlass Hill on the Oregon- California Trail, where settlers passed through. They were looking for  greener pastures.   Well, last year Nebraska ranked No. 1 in the Nation in beef exports.  The State ranked No. 1 in both the number of mother cows and cattle on  feed. We are the beef State. We are Corn Huskers. With both corn and  cattle, we produce high quality protein products that are sought by  consumers all around this globe. We are No. 1 in the Nation in great  northern bean production, popcorn production, and irrigated acres of  cropland. Nebraska agriculture is diverse and it is expansive.   We also have more miles of river than any other State. As we sit over  the great High Plains in the Ogallala Aquifer, water flows to seven  other States from Nebraska. Our abundant supply of groundwater makes us  leaders in producing soybeans, wheat, pork, and grain sorghum.   But I am getting ahead of myself.   In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act. It made  Americans really a simple offer: Strike out west, cultivate 160 acres  of surveyed government land for 5 years, and at the end of that time,  the land would be theirs. Families crossed the plains in covered wagons  to take Mr. Lincoln up on that offer, and this time they stayed. In  fact, the law's very first claimant was a doctor and a Civil War  veteran named, fittingly enough, Daniel Freeman. So powerful was his  dream that Dr. Freeman filed his paperwork just a few minutes after  midnight on New Year's Day, 1863, the day that law went into effect.  His homestead lies just outside of Beatrice, NE, where today we find  the Homestead National Monument of America. In this vast and ruthless  land, the homesteaders made the American dream real. They tilled the  earth, first to feed themselves and then to feed the world.   Nebraskans made the Great American Desert into one of the greatest  agricultural exporting regions in world history. They did this in part  by scientific discovery. Developments in agricultural technology,  including the center pivot, pioneered in Nebraska, have allowed  Nebraska ag producers to feed the world. Nebraska continues to lead the  Nation in center pivot irrigation technology, and today we are home to  the four largest irrigation companies in the United States.   Other technological breakthroughs came in transportation, especially  rail. These developments helped us to connect our communities and our  country. The route of the First Transcontinental Railroad runs through  my State. Today, Bailey Yard in North Platte is the world's largest  railroad classification yard. In addition, Nebraska now connects her  families by 97,000 miles of public roads. Well, that is a far cry from  those wagon ruts. These improvements allow us to continue that noble  work which we gladly accept of feeding the world.   I would like to take a moment to reflect on something. Nebraska not  only helped America find its moral compass again, but our State also  shows what wonders a free and virtuous people may work, and it reveals  the relationship between the two. When you seek the right thing first  and you work at it hard, amazing things follow. This is true not only  in our rural areas but also in our cities.   Omaha began as the ``Gateway to the West.'' Pioneers and immigrants  made it a mighty city in its own right. From the former stockyards to  the strong family businesses and Fortune 500 companies that you will  find there today, the fingerprints of hardworking, dedicated people  cover every inch of concrete.   Omaha leads in banking, insurance, telecommunications,  transportation, and in medicine. Last year, the University of Nebraska  Medical Center was ranked fifth in America among the best medical  schools for primary care. I think Dr. Daniel Freeman, America's first  homesteader, would be proud of that, but I doubt if he would be  surprised. This is what happens when we work hard and let ourselves be  guided by goodness.   It happened in Lincoln, our State capital, which was renamed after  President Lincoln was assassinated. It happens in our Nebraska  Panhandle towns and in our cities along the broad and braided Platte  River, all along our I-80 corridor, and in so many rural small towns  across our State. Nebraskans are a people who are engaged in  manufacturing, technology, ag business, education, and the arts. We are  strong people, and we build strong communities.   I have to say another word about doing the right thing. In 1879,  Nebraska was the site of the first time that American Indians had their  day in court, when Standing Bear made his famous statement: ``I am a  Man.'' The U.S. district court eventually ruled what we all know to be  absolute truth--that a person is a person. Here again, Nebraska gave  America the opportunity to be better. There are many other moments.   Nebraska was the first State in which women were the two major party  candidates for Governor, when Kay Orr, a Republican, defeated Helen  Boosalis, a Democrat, in 1986.   I am on the Senate floor honoring the State I love on its 150th  anniversary. I encourage you to come and see what the good life is  about. See our cities--their industry, their creativity, their  culture--where our innovators work new wonders, so much so that we are  now called Silicon Prairie. Feel the thrill of Memorial Stadium, which  becomes our third largest city on a game day. Shout ``Go Big Red'' and  cheer on the Huskers. Delight in our opera and ballet. Breathe in our  small towns. Stop in at a family-run bakery. Have lunch at a local  cafe. Enjoy some of the national food sensations that began in  Nebraska: Kool-Aid, our Reuben sandwich, and, of course, runzas.   Enjoy local favorites, like kolache, kuchen, fried tacos, and pork  chili. Enjoy a Nebraska rodeo. Ride out to our rural areas, where, as  Poet Laureate Ted Kooser says, the ``pickup kicks its fenders off and  settles back to read the clouds.'' Be awed by the vastness of Nebraska,  which gives us perspective on things great and small. Learn from  Chimney Rock, our western buttes, and the Pine Ridge, how to stand tall  no matter the weather or the season of life. Be soothed by the  Sandhills--the largest grass-covered sand dunes in the world and God's  own cattle country. Find peace in the song of the Sandhills cranes.  Take in the Central Flyway, where millions of migratory birds fly,  including our State bird--the western meadowlark. See our gently  rolling eastern hills. Canoe our  [[Page S1522]]  rivers, fish our trout streams, and relax on our lakes. Follow the  trails that tell the story of our history and the roads that lead to a  bright future. See Nebraska at night, under a sky filled with stars.  Know why people travel from all across the world simply to stargaze.   Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Willa Cather, who grew up in  Nebraska, wrote of the West: ``Elsewhere, the sky is the roof of the  world; but here the Earth was the floor of the sky.''   We are a people of the Great Plains, the prairie, the Sandhills. We  remember our enduring sources of strength--faith in God, reliance on  family, and a habit of hard work. These things give us a sure footing.   For America for 150 years, Nebraska has been a place to look up and  begin again, a land of vast possibility, of opportunity, a place to  dream and to realize dreams--a model for America and the envy of the  world.   Congratulations to the people of the great State of Nebraska as we  celebrate our rich history, the exciting present that we are building,  and the brighter future we will have in our next 150 years.
