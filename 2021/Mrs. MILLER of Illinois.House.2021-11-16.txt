 Mr. Speaker, some Members of this body have  called to defund the police. Sadly, while crime is on the rise, we have  Democrat Governors across the country who are implementing anti-police  policies.   In Illinois, our Governor signed legislation to eliminate bail and  put offenders right back on the street. He released dangerous inmates  because of COVID and refuses to work with ICE to deport illegal  immigrants. The result, as we all know, is that our neighborhoods are  less safe and the job of law enforcement is more dangerous. People want  and need police protection. Americans appreciate and support our  police.   Tragically, this past year we lost a brave officer from Champaign,  Illinois. In the line of duty, Officer Chris Oberheim was killed and  Officer Jeffrey Creel, his partner, was shot three times while  returning fire. He survived. Like so many law enforcement officers  around our country, Officer Oberheim and Officer Creel put the people  of their community first ahead of their own safety.   Officer Oberheim's life and service will not and should not be  forgotten. I cannot imagine the loss and the pain that his family  suffers day by day. They continue to be in my thoughts and prayers.   Misguided policies from ignorant politicians have turned Chicago into  a war zone and are making our communities less safe. Criminals are  allowed to steal thousands of dollars of merchandise and many are not  being charged. Soft-on-crime policies embolden criminals.   I promise to always back the blue and stand with our police. May God  bless our law enforcement.                            ____________________
