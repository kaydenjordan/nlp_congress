(2) NTIA defined.--In this subsection, the term ``NTIA''       means the National Telecommunications and Information       Administration.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1345, the NTIA Policy and  Cybersecurity Coordination Act, led by the gentleman from Utah's Third  District and the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania's Seventh District.   As our world becomes more increasingly digitized and interconnected,  the importance of robust cybersecurity measures cannot be overstated.  Cybersecurity threats, whether originating from State actors, criminal  organizations, or malicious hackers, pose significant risks to our  national security, economy, and the privacy of our citizens.   The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks  underscore the urgency of addressing this ever-evolving challenge. The  NTIA Policy and Cybersecurity Coordination Act bolsters our Nation's  cybersecurity posture by strengthening the coordination between the  National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA,  and other relevant Federal agency.   The bill renames the existing NTIA Office of Policy and Analysis and  Development to the Office of Policy Development and Cybersecurity and  codifies the existing activities of the office.   H.R. 1345 seeks to promote effective information sharing,  collaboration, and response efforts established in the Secure and  Trusted Communications Networks Act.   Moreover, the legislation facilitates public-private partnerships to  develop and implement cybersecurity policies related to the  communication networks.   By encouraging collaboration between government agencies and  stakeholders, we can work together to address cyber threats and  vulnerabilities more effectively.   This bipartisan legislation passed out of the Energy and Commerce  Committee by a vote of 44-0, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  1345.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman just stated, this bill  encourages collaboration between government agencies and stakeholders  so that we can work together to address cyber threats and  vulnerabilities more effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage by the House, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1338) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide  authority for certain licenses, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1338         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1338, the Satellite And  Telecommunications Streamlining Act, led by the chair of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.   Over the last several years, the satellite marketplace has changed  drastically. Every American now expects fast, reliable access to the  internet no matter where they are, and satellite communications  networks play an important role in bridging the digital divide.   Today, new innovations in the satellite marketplace now enable speeds  comparable to the other internet service providers. This new and  enhanced satellite service is especially important in rural Ohio and  other rural areas across America.   For Americans who have never had internet, satellite broadband can  enable families to connect with distant relatives, children to complete  their homework and receive an education online, and users to access  telehealth services.   The new speeds and low latency provided by satellite communications  networks are enabled by several advancements in technology.   First, some new satellite communications networks operate in low- Earth orbit, which means their radio signals do not have to travel as  far as other satellite communications signals. As a result,  communications networks offering low-Earth orbit can provide lower  latency services that can deliver a better experience for consumers.   Additionally, some new satellite communications networks have more  satellite radio stations in their network than satellite communications  networks that were licensed many years ago. In some cases, there are  thousands of radios, all of which work together in concert to provide  faster, more reliable connectivity service.   Finally, investment and innovation in new satellite communications  networks have led to novel proposals to use electromagnetic spectrum in  new ways. By their nature, satellite communications networks serve  global markets and therefore share the use of electromagnetic spectrum.  The complex design and architecture of these satellites, as well as how  they utilize spectrum, has led to more advanced satellite service  offerings.   However, all of this change has amplified the challenges with the  Federal Communications Commission's licensing process. A regulatory  process that once contemplated only a handful of applications has seen  dozens of applicants seeking new applications, modifications to  existing applications, and new uses of spectrum that the old regulatory  regime was not designed to address.   To provide needed direction to the FCC and promote competition and  innovation, the Satellite And Telecommunications Streamlining Act is  the first legislation in decades to modernize the regulatory framework  for licensing commercial satellite communications networks.   H.R. 1338 would bring our licensing framework for satellite  communications into the 21st century, especially as we compete against  other countries like China that seek to dominate the United States.   The legislation would establish a statutory framework at the FCC that  provides a streamlined process for considering new satellite  communications licenses, modifying existing ones, and facilitating the  deployment of innovative communications technologies.   In addition to bringing next-generation satellite connectivity to  Americans and the world, H.R. 1338 would also promote U.S.  technological leadership. By creating a regulatory environment that  invites investment and rewards innovation, we can turn the United  States into the destination of choice for licensing satellite  communications systems for providers around the world.   While the use of spectrum must be coordinated internationally,  ensuring timely access to predictable, reliable use of shared spectrum  in the United States will send a signal that the government wants to be  a partner, not a roadblock, to deploying next-generation technologies.   This is key as the United States looks to defend America's  technological leadership against China. The Satellite And  Telecommunications Streamlining Act will ensure the United States'  regulatory process doesn't hold back American innovation. China can act  unilaterally to approve changes to their satellite communications  system and spectrum usage, which is a far cry from the competitive,  market-based spectrum licensing system in the United States.   In order for the government to be a partner and not a roadblock, it  must make sure that innovative, new satellite spectrum technologies  make it from the lab to orbit in a timely manner. H.R. 1338 will ensure  that there is a fair regulatory regime built on an objective,  performance-based system that facilitates the investment needed to  maintain our technological leadership.   Also, the FCC currently has authority under the Communications Act to  attach conditions to licenses for satellite communications systems to  ensure licensees are acting in the public interest. This authority has  been upheld by the courts.   The Energy and Commerce Committee wants to ensure that the FCC does  not become a space traffic cop and try to manage space traffic  management functions or provide space situational awareness  information. We added rules of construction to clarify that the FCC  does not have the authority to be that space traffic cop and to affirm  that nothing in H.R. 1338 would expand the existing authority the FCC  currently has regarding orbital debris and space safety.    The rules of construction also clarify that nothing in H.R. 1338  grants the FCC the authority to carry out functions provided under 10  U.S.C. 2274 related to the provision of space situational awareness  services and information.   The FCC uses its current authority to attach conditions to spectrum  licenses relating to orbital debris and  [[Page H3925]]  space safety capabilities to prevent harmful interference among  satellite systems and avoid granting licenses to potentially unsafe  satellite communications systems that would jeopardize space safety and  exacerbate orbital debris.   This legislation is good government. It provides statutory direction  and boundaries to the FCC rather than allowing it to retrofit old laws  for the new marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1338, the Satellite  And Telecommunications Streamlining Act, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the chair of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn), from Florida's Second District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Weber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard from so many of our speakers this  afternoon about how essential H.R. 1338 is to promote effective  information sharing, collaboration, and response efforts to establish  the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019.   The legislation facilitates the public-private partnerships to  develop and implement cybersecurity policies related to the  communications networks. By encouraging this collaboration between the  government agencies and stakeholders, we can all work together to  address the cyber threats and vulnerabilities more effectively.   Again, this piece of legislation passed out of the Energy and  Commerce Committee. We worked together on this in a bipartisan manner,  and with a vote of 44-0, that bill came out of committee. It is a good  piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 1338, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 682) to facilitate access to electromagnetic spectrum for  commercial space launches and commercial space reentries, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 682         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 682, the Launch Communications  Act led by the gentlemen from Florida's Second and Ninth Districts.   Over the last decade, the American commercial space industry has  dramatically reduced the cost to enter space, revolutionizing the  industry. Investment has increased, and innovation has flourished. The  number of commercial space launches has increased dramatically.   Unfortunately, our Federal processes have not kept pace.   To launch satellites into orbit, launch providers need access to  certain radio frequencies, known as spectrum, which requires  coordination between several Federal agencies.   H.R. 682 will take important steps to streamline the process for  commercial space launch providers to gain access to the frequencies  they need when they need them and ensure that a lack of coordination  between Federal agencies does not hamper the thriving commercial space  economy.   No space launch should be threatened because approval for their  spectrum access is caught up in bureaucratic delay.   This legislation would provide more certainty to commercial satellite  operators that when they make the investment in satellite technologies,  they will be able to launch them into space.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 682, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the  Second District of Florida (Mr. Dunn), who is the sponsor of the  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this legislation would provide more certainty  to our commercial satellite operators so that when they make the  investment in satellite technologies, they will be able to launch them  into space.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 682, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
