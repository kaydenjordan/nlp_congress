 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair for yielding the time,  and I want to thank my friend, colleague, and fellow New Englander, Mr.  Cicilline, for his courage, his perseverance, and, frankly, his  political talents at moving this bill forward and bringing us here  today. And I am not going to cry in my minute.   I am proud that my home State of Maine is among the 21 States that  has already enacted these protections. For almost 15 years, Mainers  have stood against bigotry to provide equal access to housing,  employment, and public establishments for our LGBTQ community.   And, guess what. The sky did not fall when we passed protections,  and, in fact, our State is a better, more inclusive place because of  it. Having guaranteed civil rights for our LGBTQ neighbors means we  value the health, safety, and dignity of every Mainer.   But LGBTQ Mainers should have the same rights they enjoy in our State  when they are outside of our State. This Congress must stand together  in recognizing the humanity and the civil rights of all LGBTQ people,  wherever they may live or travel.   The Equality Act will ensure LGBTQ citizens have equal access to  employment, education, housing, credit, and all public services--public  services which their tax dollars fund, by the way.   It is time to extend these civil rights to everyone, no matter who  they love or how they identify. I urge my colleagues in the House to  recognize that we must equally protect all members of our community  under the law.   Let's pass the Equality Act.
