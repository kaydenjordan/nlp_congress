 Mr. Speaker, we know that the Republican tax plan is a  massive, unconscionable giveaway to millionaires and billionaires. We  know that it will blow up the deficit and do nothing to raise wages or  create solid middle class jobs.   What we don't know, Mr. Speaker, is how much the GOP tax proposal  will personally benefit Donald Trump. That is because, unlike every  other American President, Donald Trump has refused to disclose his tax  returns.   Trump claimed that he couldn't release his returns throughout the  campaign because he was ``under audit.'' But, Mr. Speaker, he never  provided any concrete proof. More importantly, the IRS confirmed that  being under audit in no way prohibits someone from making their returns  public. In fact, President Nixon did just that while he was in office.                                time  1745    More recently, when The Economist magazine asked Trump about  releasing his returns, he said: ``I don't know. That's a very  interesting question. I doubt it. I doubt it . . . Nobody cares about  my tax return except for the reporters. Oh, at some point I'll release  them. Maybe I'll release them after I'm finished. . . .''  [[Page H8426]]    That is right, Mr. Speaker, we will have to wait until Trump leaves  office just to find out just how much money he made thanks to his own  tax reform bill. And my Republican friends are apparently just fine  with that. There is a shocker. They don't care that Donald Trump is  using his office to enrich himself. They don't care that we can't even  say with any certainty exactly how much richer he is going to get. They  don't care about the debt. They don't care about the deficit. They  don't care about making our tax system fairer. Literally, the only  thing they care about and that truly matters to House Republicans is  that they get to cut taxes for the richest Americans, the people who  need a tax cut least of all.   Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump does not need a tax cut, neither does  Secretary Mnuchin or Secretary DeVos or Secretary Tillerson or Paris  Hilton, but they are going to get one if Republicans have their way.   In 2012, Paul Ryan said: ``We have a debt crisis right in front of  us, and what brings down great empires, past and future, is debt.''   In 2013, Paul Ryan said: ``Our debt is the biggest threat to this  country. We have to tackle this problem before it tackles us.''   In 2016, Donald Trump said: ``I am the king of debt. I love debt.''   It certainly seems like Speaker Ryan has come around to President  Trump's way of thinking. Republicans are planning to add $1.5 trillion  to our national debt, and they couldn't be happier about it.   Here is the simple reality, Mr. Speaker. Republicans only care about  deficits when they want to cut spending on programs for the poor or for  veterans or for the elderly or for our children. Republicans only care  about debt when they want to slash Social Security and Medicare. Mr.  Speaker, Republicans only care about debt and are only fiscally  responsible when there is a Democrat in the White House.   The American people are now seeing right through this hypocrisy, just  like they see right through Donald Trump's excuses about his tax  returns. They want us to reject this Republican tax plan, and it is  about time we started listening to them.
