 Thank you to my distinguished colleague from  the Virgin Islands. It is an honor to be with you this evening, and  thank you for your hard work and helping us to keep families healthy.  Thank you also to CBC Chairman Richmond for organizing this important  Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out for more than 975,000  residents of Illinois, including nearly 240,000 children that my  Republican colleagues are plotting to strip of their health insurance.   This bill, the so-called American Health Care Act, ends the guarantee  of quality, affordable, and accessible health care. This bill puts  politics before people. But it isn't the politics that matters.   Mrs. Johnson affording her cancer treatment matters. A 5-year-old  dying because her parents can't afford a transplant matters. Keeping  our neighbors healthy no matter what street they live on or what their  ZIP Code is will keep us all healthy.   So I must ask: What are my Republican colleagues thinking?   This bill was introduced at night, but the cover of darkness cannot  hide the fact that this bill will kill tens of thousands of Americans  every year. The dark of night cannot hide the reality that, because of  this bad bill, more Americans will die of cancer, nor can it conceal  the fact that millions of older Americans will be punished by the  Republican's new ``age tax.''   Conversely, the Affordable Care Act protects older Americans from  insurance companies who want to use their age as a reason to charge  thousands and thousands more. While this bill from my Republican  colleagues was written to empower insurance executives, the Affordable  Care Act protects everyone. It includes unprecedented healthcare access  safeguards for America's elderly, people living with disabilities,  children, and young adults.   Meanwhile, the GOP's American Health Care Act reduces consumer  protections. The American people will be left with more expensive  healthcare coverage plans, and 24 million will lose their healthcare  insurance completely, 14 million next year.   A disproportionate number of those losing insurance will come from  African-American, Latino, Asian-American, and Pacific Islander  communities. They will be women and children or older Americans,  especially those living on the edge.   As chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, I am  working to close the gap in healthcare disparities that is plaguing  these communities. This bill will make these disparities even worse.   And for the record, the ACA more than halved the uninsured rate in  the African-American community and halved the national uninsured rate.   But the recent Congressional Budget Office report makes it clear that  this will not continue in a positive way. In less than 10 years, 52  million Americans will be uninsured under the GPO's  [[Page H2228]]  plan. The majority of these will be our grandmothers, grandfathers,  great-aunts, and great-uncles.    Under the Speaker's plan, my State, Illinois, will have to cut  Medicare eligibility. More than 53,000 constituents will lose their  health care just because of this provision. The GOP also plans to  defund Planned Parenthood, a decision that means 60,000 residents of  Illinois will go without lifesaving cancer and STI screenings.   The list of the not very good, very bad things from the Republican  healthcare bill go on and on and on. It will make us sicker.   It also raises the national debt, and it kills at least 1.2 million  American jobs. And it stops us from reaching what should be our  ultimate goal: the ability of every American to live a long, healthy  life.   Mr. Speaker, can we finally get serious and call this bill, your GOP  healthcare bill, what it really is: the Trump don't care bill.   Well, the Congressional Black Caucus cares. The House Democrats--and  hopefully some House Republicans--care, and they will care enough to do  the right thing and will oppose this bill.    Besides the District of Columbia, we have been  to South Carolina. We have been to a couple of places in Los Angeles as  well as Oakland to deal with the issue of AIDS. Also, of course, in my  town of Chicago, we have had healthcare seminars; and, actually, we  have had big health fairs so we can make sure that people get back-to- school checks, mental health checks, and AIDS checks. We gave food to  people that might be in food deserts.   So we really tried to be well-rounded and also tried to educate  people. And going forward this week, we do plan to be on a call with  ministers all across the United States so they know exactly what is  going on and how they can help their constituents in this fight against  this new healthcare bill.                                time  1945     Mr. Speaker, actually, of the top 10 diseases  African Americans die from, African Americans die more from 8 out of  the top 10.   So this new bill is not going to send us in a better direction, and  we don't want to keep those statistics. We want to do better, and we  were doing better, especially around the area of cancer. We want to  keep going in the positive direction, not the negative direction.   So we don't want to see this bill passed, and we want to educate as  many people as possible and encourage them to call their Congressperson  and Senator.
