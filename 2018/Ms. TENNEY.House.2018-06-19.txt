 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding  so much time to me in favor of this legislation that I coauthored with  my colleague, Ms. DelBene, on this bipartisan piece, H.R. 5723, the  Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, in my district and across the Nation, the opioid  epidemic has ravaged communities, torn apart families, and ended the  lives of everyday Americans. Opioid abuse and drug-related deaths are  rising at alarming rates. In my rural New York district, drug-related  deaths rose over 350 percent in the short period from 2012 to 2016.   Each day, I continue to hear from families across the 22nd district  that have been impacted by this epidemic. They share deeply moving and  personal stories of loss and struggle, and they always urge me that  more needs to be done.   Mr. Speaker, they are right. This is why the people's House has taken  significant, bipartisan action to pass record funding for addiction  treatment and prevention and to stop the flow of illicit drugs coming  across the border. This is not the time to let up.   During an opioid roundtable that I held in my district, I heard from  members of my community who told me that often an opioid prescription  is the only option for pain management offered after a complicated  surgery or a procedure as routine as a root canal.   This anecdotal evidence is backed up by the hard truth that, in 2016,  there were 66.5 opioid prescriptions per 100 people. Mr. Speaker, that  amounts to more than 214 million total opioid prescriptions.   The Expanding Oversight of Opioid Prescribing and Payment Act seeks  to find out what is fueling these prescriptions. This bipartisan bill  requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, or MedPAC, to  research and identify adverse incentives in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs that lead to an overprescription of opioids versus readily  available nonopioid alternatives.   Medicare and other insurance providers often do not cover nonopioid  alternatives for pain, and this legislation seeks to understand why.  Once we are able to understand the cause, we can change Medicare policy  to reduce demand for opioids to address chronic pain and provide  patients with safer, nonaddictive, nonopioid alternatives for pain.   Opioid overdose is now the leading cause of death for Americans under  50. We must take action.   Mr. Speaker, combating this epidemic starts by eliminating any  incentives that cause our constituents to become addicted to opioids  and other prescription drugs in the first place.   I want to thank my colleagues, Ms. DelBene, Mr. McKinley, and Mr.  Sanford, for joining me in this bipartisan effort, and I appreciate the  work of Chairman Brady and every member of the Ways and Means Committee  who worked to help us get this far. I want to say a special thank you  to Representative Roskam from Illinois for providing me this  opportunity to speak on behalf of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues support this legislation.                                time  1645
