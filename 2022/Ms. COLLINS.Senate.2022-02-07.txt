 Mr. President, through a legendary broadcasting career  spanning more than seven decades, Maine's Dewey DeWitt was the ``Voice  of Aroostook County.'' Dewey passed away on January 5 at 99 years of  age, but his voice and his contributions will never be forgotten.   As a native of the county, a longtime fan, and a friend, I offer my  deepest condolences to his family. In this time of sorrow, I am sure  they will find comfort in knowing how much Dewey meant to so many.   Dewey first went on the air in 1950, the year a radio station began  operations in Houlton, the Shiretown of Aroostook County. When a  television station began broadcasting from Presque Isle a few years  later, Dewey was the first person seen by viewers.   Like many others in Northern Maine, I grew up listening to Dewey.  From interviews with public officials to the daily news to high school  basketball, he kept us informed.   Indeed, the hallmark of Dewey's career was his devotion to local  sports, especially high school basketball. It is estimated that Dewey  called the play-by-play of more than 3,000 games over the years.   Every sportscaster has that one indelible memory that stands alone.  For Dewey and me, it was a memory we shared with people throughout the  region. In 1969, when I was a student at Caribou High School, our boys'  basketball team won its first-ever State championship on a last-second  shot by Mike Thurston from beyond midcourt. I was at that exciting  game, but it was Dewey's voice that brought that thrilling moment to  listeners across Maine. More than a half-century later, Dewey could  still recall that game and that shot in vivid detail.   Although Dewey retired from daily broadcasting some years ago, he  remained active with a frequent show on WHOU radio called, ``Talk of  the Town.'' Whenever I visited Houlton, I loved stopping to see Dewey  for a chat.   Dewey's interviews were a shining example of how it should be done.  He was always informed and insightful, with a keen understanding of how  national issues affected the people in his audience. In our most recent  interview, in October of 2021, he asked probing questions about border  security, the appropriations process, our national debt, and pandemic  recovery, among other important topics.   Dewey DeWitt's work was recognized by the Maine Sports Hall of Fame,  the Maine Basketball Hall of Fame's Legends of the Game, and the Maine  Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. But I know that the tribute  that meant the most to him was the affection people throughout  Aroostook County will always have for him. I join them in celebrating  his remarkable life and in recognizing him for a voice that brought us  together as a community.  [[Page S546]]                                ____________________
