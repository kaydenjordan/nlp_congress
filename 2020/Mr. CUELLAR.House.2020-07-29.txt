 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member  Graves and their staff for the wonderful work that they did for putting  this bipartisan bill together, and also Chairwoman Grace Napolitano.   Mr. Speaker, for the last 14 years, I have been working in Congress  to advocate for the full authorized funding of Laredo, Texas' Chacon  Creek Restoration Project.   The Army Corps now, once we get this done, can carry out the flood  risk management and ecosystem project totaling about $52 million. The  flood mitigation component will evacuate 250 homes from the floodplain,  from Lake Casa Blanca all the way down to the Rio Grande along the  Chacon Creek.   This ecosystem restoration component will also include 417 acres of  wetland and riparian restoration. This is a natural treasure that we  have in Laredo, Texas, and it will provide hundreds of acres of new  recreational and educational parklands.   Mr. Speaker, the Chacon Creek is a tremendous natural resource in  Laredo, and I thank the ranking member and committee staff for doing  this great work.
