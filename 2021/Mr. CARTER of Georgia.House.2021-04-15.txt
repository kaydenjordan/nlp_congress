 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Jack Marshall Jones, Jr., of Savannah, Georgia, who, sadly,  passed away on April 3 at the age of 84.   Jack was born in Savannah and went on to graduate from the University  of North Carolina, Chapel Hill with a degree in economics.   As an active member in the Savannah community, Jack served on several  boards, including Armstrong State University Foundation, Savannah  Country Day School, and the Savannah Rotary Club.   Jack was also a founder and director of First Bank of Savannah and  the Savannah Bancorp.   In his free time, Jack enjoyed exploring the Wilmington River and the  treasure of our beautiful coast.   However, it was his loving relationship with his wife of 60 years,  his family--including his granddaughter and a former member of my  staff, Caroline--and friends that fulfilled him.   I am thankful for the immense impact he had on the Savannah  community, and I know his legacy will remain.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all those  who knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
