 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to offer an amendment to remove section  4208 from H.R. 1.   Section 4208 is a dangerous provision of this bill that will put  people's private information on display and put their personal security  at risk.   This section aims to forbid anonymous speech. Throughout American  history, anonymous speech about political matters has played a vital  role. From the Federalist Papers, to those who supported the civil  rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, many in history had very  legitimate fears of having their identities uncovered and relied on  anonymous speech to show their support for certain policies and  initiatives.   Section 4208 removes the protection of anonymous speech forever. By  requiring public reporting of the private information of individuals,  partnerships, associations, and any group of people who spend $500 or  more on political advertising--which is a very broad definition in this  bill--we put individuals at risk.   Furthermore, we drastically limit free speech and destroy the First  Amendment. Notably, the courts have already begun to warn against the  constitutionality of similar provisions in State law. We cannot allow  this to stand. Not only will it cause a security problem for these  individuals but, as we have seen, people could lose their jobs, be  shamed, or even worse.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
