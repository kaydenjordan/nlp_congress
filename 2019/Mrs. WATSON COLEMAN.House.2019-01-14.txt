 Mr. Speaker, I would like to share a letter I  received from a constituent last week. He writes:   ``Being out of work and not knowing how many days or weeks it will  take to get back to work leaves me worried. These days off are no fun.  So please, make them worthwhile by standing firm against the stupid  Trump wall.   ``This colossal waste of government funds could be spent doing so  many worthwhile projects: fix the water in Flint, Michigan; hire more  people to process the paperwork of people who want to be citizens; give  more people access to healthcare.   ``If Democrats cave during this shutdown, it will all be wasted.   ``We Federal workers are unhappy, but we've been through this before.  We can stand the wait and the frustration. What we cannot stand is the  racism, cruelty, and criminality of this administration.  [[Page H535]]    ``We are with you. Please be with us.''   Mr. Speaker, my constituents are ready to go back to work. They  resent having their livelihoods being used as bargaining chips, and  even in this shutdown, they are very unhappy. They just want to do  their work, and they are asking us to do ours.                            ____________________
