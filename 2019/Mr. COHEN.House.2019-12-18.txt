 Mr. Speaker, from our founding, the United States has been  a special nation, a city upon a hill. Our values are enshrined in our  Constitution: liberty, equality, and opportunity. We are a self- governing people where every person is equal before the law. In the  United States, we don't have a king. We choose our leaders. We vote.   Generations of Americans have fought, and some have died to secure  these inalienable rights. The Constitution begins: ``We the People of  the United States.'' That is us. It is not ``we the leaders of Russia,  Ukraine, or China'' or ``we the Democrats'' or ``we the Republicans.''  It is: ``We the People of the United States.'' All Americans--and only  Americans--get to have a say in our elections.   Donald Trump used the high power of the Presidency to pressure a  foreign nation to besmirch his perceived primary political opponent. He  corrupted our elections and compromised our national security so that  he could keep power--not power for the people, power for himself. In  2016, Candidate Trump called for foreign interference when he said:  ``Russia, if you are listening. . . .''   In 2019, President Trump sought foreign interference when he needed a  favor from Ukraine to intervene in the 2020 election. President Trump  attacked and is a continuing threat to our system of free and fair  elections.   Like all of you, Mr. Speaker, I took an oath to support and to defend  the Constitution. I urge my colleagues to abide by that oath and stand  up to President Trump's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. To  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I appeal to your patriotism  and implore you to defend free and fair elections and preserve the  Constitution.   God save the United States of America.
