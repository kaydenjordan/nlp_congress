 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and memory of West Virginia's Circuit Court Judge John Yoder, who  passed away on June 7, 2017.   Judge Yoder served on the 23rd Judicial Circuit, which included  Berkeley, Jefferson, and Morgan Counties in the eastern panhandle of  the Second Congressional District, which I represent. He practiced law  in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, for 23 years.   Judge Yoder earned a bachelor of arts degree at Chapman University,  and then studied law at the University of Kansas. He also obtained an  MBA at the University of Chicago.   John Yoder was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983 to serve  as the director of the asset forfeiture office for the U.S. Department  of Justice. He continued his distinguished career as a public servant,  including two stints as a West Virginia State senator before being  elected as circuit court judge.   Judge Yoder is one of the early pioneers of State drug courts and was  well known for his big heart and compassion. I join all West Virginians  in keeping Judge Yoder's family and friends in our prayers. He will  truly be missed.  [[Page H5926]]                                ____________________
