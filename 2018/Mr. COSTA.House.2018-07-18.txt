 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to speak about our  national parks and our parks and recreational opportunities.   I grew up in California's San Joaquin Valley, where we are blessed  with some of the Nation's most beautiful lands. Like many, I spent my  youth exploring local Fresno recreational areas and the California  State parks.   My family and I, many times, visited Kings Canyon National Park and  one of the crown jewels of all national parks, Yosemite Valley, seen in  this striking photograph.   Wallace Stegner, famous writer, historian, and environmentalist, once  said: ``Our national parks are the best idea we ever had. Absolutely  American, absolutely democratic, they reflect us at our best rather  than our worst.''  [[Page H6477]]    July is Parks and Recreation Month, and I urge everyone across this  great country to visit our parks and recreational areas. It is great  for our families and for all of us. Share in something that reflects  America at our best.   Let us also remember that wildfires are a regular threat to our parks  during this season. Fires are, sadly, burning as we speak today near  Yosemite National Park and throughout the West.   Our thoughts and prayers are with those brave men and women fighting  those fires, and their families, while protecting some of America's  most precious resources.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, immigration is one of the more important issues that we  must face around here. It is one we take seriously. This debate, sadly,  is more about politics, in my view.   Our decisions affect people's lives and America's future. We must  stop these partisan ``gotcha'' bills, empty-messaging resolutions, and  ideological hijacking of our policy discussions. Rather, we must come  together and do our work and create a fair and effective immigration  system, one that reflects our values.   We must have and we need bipartisan, comprehensive immigration laws  to fix our broken immigration system, much like was done in 2013.  Unfortunately, it didn't pass. Then we must smartly enforce it.   We have big challenges. We must take care of the Dreamers stuck in  DACA limbo; we must reunite families who are separated, secure our  borders--yes, we must--using every effective means possible; and we  must bring undocumented neighbors out of the shadows.   I will vote for this resolution, but it is not about abolish or  support ICE.    Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this resolution, but it is  not about abolish or support ICE. I respect the need for interior and  immigration enforcement, and I have concerns about how this  administration is doing it.   Enough of political games, catering to the loudest and most extreme  voices in both parties. Let's check our ideology at the door. Let's get  to work on bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform. That is what the  people want us to do.
