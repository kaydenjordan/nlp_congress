 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S1952]]     Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the anniversary of one  of the most significant legislative achievements in American history,  the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also  known as ObamaCare.   I rise in strong opposition to the American Health Care Act, a  callous and carelessly written bill that would roll back progress and  strip health insurance from millions of Americans.   I rise on behalf of people like Chrystal from my home State of  California. You see, I know Chrystal. She works in my dentist's office.  In early 2011, just after I was elected attorney general of California,  I went in for a checkup. It had been a while since I had seen her.  Chrystal asked me how I had been, and I asked her how she had been, and  then she shared with me great news. She was pregnant.   As a dental hygienist, she was working for a few different dentists  and wasn't on the payroll of any of them as a full-time employee. This  was before the ACA was in place, so Chrystal was on private insurance  with only basic coverage, just enough to cover her annual exams.   When Chrystal found out she was pregnant, she went to her insurance  company to apply for prenatal coverage. She was denied. When I asked  her why, she told me that they said she had a preexisting condition. So  you can imagine I asked her: Are you OK? What is wrong? What is the  preexisting condition?   She told me she was pregnant.   When she applied to another healthcare company for insurance, again,  she was denied. Why? Preexisting condition. What was it? She was  pregnant.   So this young woman was forced to go into her sixth month of  pregnancy before she received a sonogram. Instead, thankfully, there  was a free clinic in San Francisco, so she could get her prenatal care.   Thank God she had a strong and beautiful baby boy. His name is  Jackson. They are both doing well today.   Thank God that situation is no longer the reality for millions of  Americans.   I share Chrystal's story to remind us what America's healthcare  system looked like only a few years ago.   We should not forget that before the ACA, 48 million Americans lacked  health insurance. That is more people than the entire country of  Canada.   Before the ACA, when these people got sick, they had three choices:  Go without treatment, go to the emergency room, or go broke.   Before the ACA, 129 million people--almost one out of every two  Americans--could be denied insurance coverage because of preexisting  conditions. And the minute you got sick, your insurer could dig up some  flimsy reason to drop your coverage. You could be denied coverage for  chemotherapy or insulin if you had cancer or diabetes. You could be  denied prenatal coverage if you were pregnant, like Chrystal. You could  even be denied health coverage if you were a victim of domestic  violence.   Before the ACA, healthcare costs were crushing low-income and middle- class Americans. Premiums--which, of course, are those monthly bills  that we all pay for our insurance--were going up and up. Sky-high  medical bills were the No. 1 reason Americans went broke, causing them  to sell their homes, their cars, and even pawn their jewelry to pay off  their debts.   One of the worst things about facing the healthcare system without  coverage before the ACA was that it left you feeling utterly alone.  Most Americans know what I am talking about: that knot in your stomach  when you know there is something wrong with your health or the health  of your child or your parent, but you are not sure what it is, whether  it can be fixed or whether your insurance will cover it, and the  frustration, the anger as you try to make sense of the fine print and  codes on the medical bill that has so many zeros.   How many of us have walked into an emergency room with a loved one  and felt time just stop? Maybe it was with your child who was running a  fever or having trouble breathing. Maybe your partner is being rushed  in with a possible heart attack. All you will know is that something is  wrong. All you know is that you are overwhelmed and scared, and you  know that you should not also have to fight on the phone with an  insurance company or wonder if a doctor will even see you at all. That  is how millions and millions of Americans experienced our healthcare  system.   It was not right or fair. So the ACA set out to make things better,  and 7 years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the Affordable  Care Act into law. It finally extended good, affordable health  insurance to Americans like Chrystal all across the Nation. Vice  President Biden was absolutely right when, at the time, he said that it  was a ``big''--and then I will not quote the next word; let's call it  blanking--``deal.''   It is a shame that people have been playing politics with this law  and with America's health. The former Speaker of the House said that  the ACA would be ``Armageddon.'' A Republican Presidential candidate  who now sits in the Cabinet called the ACA--and these are his actual  words--``the worst thing that has happened in this nation since  slavery.''   Earlier this month, the President of the United States tweeted that  the ACA is ``a complete and total disaster.'' Well, I say: Tell that to  the people of California because when a State wants to make the ACA  work, it works--whether that is California or Kentucky, and real people  living real lives know it.   For example, I recently heard from Myra from Sherman Oaks, CA, who  was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. She wrote:         Before ObamaCare, my husband and I lived under constant       stress due to our lack of good health insurance.    But, because of the ACA, Myra told me:         We had a Silver Blue Shield plan that covered . . . well       over a million dollars in bills to date. I am happy to report       I am now well, but without insurance, I was facing a death       sentence. Without the ACA, we would certainly have had to       sell our home to pay my bills and try to figure out how to       make ends meet.    She wrote that it covered well over a million dollars. That is what  the ACA does.   Here is how Cindy of from Oakley, CA, has experienced real life. She  wrote:         My daughter was diagnosed with an eating disorder at 13       years old and I can directly thank the excellent care       received at Kaiser Northern California for her good health       today at age 17. Without the ACA and the mental health parity       it helps provide . . . I would not have had treatment options       available to me.    Again, coverage for mental health treatment--that is what the ACA  does.   Honoree, a single mom from Samoa, CA, living with a spinal cord  injury that has kept her from working for 3\1/2\ years, wrote to me and  said:         I wanted to let you know that I love ObamaCare! My       healthcare has steadily improved since the ACA was enacted. .       . . I can't tell you how AMAZING it felt to get my teeth       cleaned and cared for after waiting more than a decade.        I walked around for weeks saying, ``thanks, ObamaCare!''       whenever I sensed how good my teeth felt.        I would be saddened to see the ACA get scrapped. It's made       a huge difference in our lives. Actually, I'd be more than       saddened, I'd be very scared.    Again, this is testimony about the ACA, in this case about dental  coverage and improved healthcare. That is what the ACA does.   I will state that I believe there is a huge disconnect between the  over-the-top criticism of the ACA and the law's actual impact. There is  a disconnect between the politics and how people are actually living  and thriving under the ACA. In fact, in a recent poll, one in three  Americans didn't even realize that the ACA and ObamaCare were actually  the same thing, and they are. So, everybody, let's be clear about this.  The Affordable Care Act is ObamaCare, and ObamaCare is the Affordable  Care Act.   We all know, of course, that there are ways to improve the ACA, but  ending it is not the answer. The truth is that the ACA has largely done  what it was supposed to do--expand, protect, and reduce--expand  coverage, protect consumers, and reduce the pace of rising healthcare  costs. Thanks to the ACA and Medicaid expansion, 20 million  [[Page S1953]]  more Americans have health insurance. That is the population of the  entire State of New York. Thanks to the ACA, premiums are going up at  the slowest rate in half a century. Thanks to the ACA, doctors are  innovating and providing better preventive care, from keeping people  out of the hospital to delivering healthier babies. Thanks to the ACA,  insurers cannot set lifetime limits on your care, meaning your  insurance company won't tell you in the middle of a cancer treatment  that they have paid all they ever will. Thanks to the ACA, millions of  underserved Americans in rural towns and in cities and everywhere in  between have access to care for the first time. Thanks to the ACA,  young people can stay on their parents' insurance until they are 26.  Thanks to the ACA, 55 million women have insurance that works-- mammograms, checkups, and birth control with no copays. When you pick  up your prescription at the pharmacy and see that the bill is zero  dollars, well, that is the ACA. And thanks to the ACA, you can't be  discriminated against if you have a preexisting condition, including  that preexisting condition called being a woman.   Of course, navigating the healthcare system is still daunting, but  things are better. There are now some rules of the road to keep  insurance companies from taking advantage of you during some of life's  most vulnerable moments. Because of the ACA, because of ObamaCare, you  can sleep a little easier at night and know that your care will be  there when you need it.   Let's fast-forward to today. Today, we mark the seventh anniversary  of this historic life-changing law. But all that it covers and protects  could also be ripped away, and that is because of the American Health  Care Act, the Republican healthcare plan on the House side. That is  what it will do--rip it all away.   They have done their best to mislead folks about their plan. They  have criticized objective news reports, and they even questioned the  Congressional Budget Office--which, as we know, is, by the way, a  nonpartisan, independent office which crunched the numbers and found  that this new plan would cause millions of Americans to lose insurance  coverage.   Before we leap on to this new bill, let's all ask some key questions.  Let's all take a good look at what this plan really would and would not  do.   First, will this bill provide insurance for everybody, as President  Trump promised? Well, the answer is no. In fact, the independent  Congressional Budget Office says that under the GOP plan, 24 million  Americans will lose their health insurance by the end of the decade.  That is equal to the population of 15 States combined.    Who are these people? These are middle-class families, our Nation's  teachers, veterans, truckdrivers, nurses, and farmers. These families  include those who struggle with opioid addiction, have a child that  needs support for autism, or have an aging parent who needs a nursing  home. This bill threatens them all.   Let's ask: Will the plan help the folks who need care most? The  answer is no. The House Republican plan's flat tax credits are based  only on age, with no consideration of income level. So what that means  is that a 40-year-old cashier making $10,000 gets the exact same amount  as the 40-year-old banker making $74,000 a year. It doesn't matter  whether you live in downtown Manhattan or the Cleveland suburbs or  rural Alaska.   Let's ask: Will monthly costs go down for low-income and middle-class  families who are stretched horribly thin right now? The answer is no.  According to that same independent analysis, the Republican plan will  immediately increase American families' premiums by 15 to 20 percent,  with higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs after that. In the next  decade, a person in their fifties could see their insurance costs go up  850 percent. Their insurance costs can go up 850 percent.   Let's ask: What about our seniors--will their monthly costs go down?  Sadly, the answer is no. The Republican plan lets insurers charge  seniors five times as much as other Americans, meaning that high  cholesterol your doctor diagnosed could cost you $3,200 more a month.   Let's ask: Will all women still have access to affordable family  planning? The answer is no. This new bill will give Americans choice in  healthcare, but the women of America will not have choice. The bill  denies women tax credits if they get a plan that covers abortions. It  prohibits Planned Parenthood from providing care for millions on  Medicaid. Some 2.5 million patients choose Planned Parenthood every  year, including roughly 1 million in California. They should be able to  see the provider they choose and trust.   Let's ask: Will this new plan protect Medicaid, as President Trump  promised? Well, the answer is no. Medicaid covers many people whose  jobs don't offer healthcare, and it also pays for half of all the  births in this Nation. It supports people with disabilities and  children with special needs. Most people don't realize that Medicaid is  the primary payer for treatment of opioid addiction and substance  abuse. But this new plan being offered by House Republicans would roll  back Medicaid coverage and cut nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid benefits  over the next decade.   Let's ask: Does the plan put American families ahead of insurance  companies? The answer, tragically, is no. Under this plan, if you lose  your job and it takes more than 2 months to find another, you will be  charged a 30-percent penalty on top of the monthly costs you are  already paying. That money goes right into the insurance company's  pockets.   So, by now, you are probably wondering: Who exactly does this bill  help? Well, here is your answer. It gives millionaires a $50,000  average tax cut every year. It gives the top 0.1 percent in this  country a $195,000 tax cut every year. It gives insurance companies a  $145 billion tax break over the next decade. The President and the  Speaker want you to believe that this plan is good for American  families, but under their bill, the only thing that gets healthier are  the insurance companies' bottom line.   As far as California is concerned, this bill would devastate our  families. Here are the facts, and, frankly, here is the fight. Over 5  million Californians have received insurance through the Affordable  Care Act. I say they are worth fighting for.   Since the ACA went into effect, California's uninsured population has  been cut almost in half, from 17 percent to about 7 percent. I say they  are worth fighting for.   Medi-Cal went from covering 8.5 million Americans to 13.5 million  today. One in two children are covered under Medicaid. I say they are  worth fighting for.   The community clinics and health centers that so many Californians  rely on would be cut back or closed. I say they are worth fighting for.   A UC Berkeley study estimates that repealing the ACA would cost  California up to 200,000 jobs, everyone from home healthcare aides and  janitors to workers in retail, restaurants, and accounting. I say they  are worth fighting for.   I rise today to emphasize that it is really important that we  understand the everyday consequences of this bill. We are talking about  real people. If you are a farmer in the Central Valley on Medicaid, you  can lose that coverage. If you are a Los Angeles senior with diabetes,  you may no longer be able to afford coverage on the individual market.  If you are a family in Shasta County with a child dealing with a  prescription drug addiction, substance abuse treatment likely will not  be covered. If you are a couple in Humboldt County with an ailing  parent, your request for home health services could be denied. These  are the kinds of Californians and the kinds of Americans who this plan  would hurt.   When these folks wake up at 3 a.m. worrying about an ache or pain or  their next chemo appointment, when they wake up with that concern and  that thought at 3 a.m., I promise you, they are not thinking about that  through the lens of being a Republican or a Democrat. They think about  themselves as fathers, mothers, parents, daughters and sons, and  grandparents. They worry about their health needs and how their health  needs will affect not only themselves but their loved ones. These  concerns are not about politics. These are universal concerns, and we  have all been there.   It is because all of us share these concerns and because all of us  would be badly harmed by this new plan that  [[Page S1954]]  this bill is opposed by the American Medical Association, the American  Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the American  Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Diabetes  Association, and the AARP. They are the most respected medical and  patient advocacy groups in this country, and they know what is at  stake.    Ultimately, I believe this bill is not just about medicine or math; I  believe this is about morals. The plan that the House is voting on  today is a values statement, and it is not a good one. As our former  President said about the ACA, this is more than just about healthcare;  it is about the character of our country, and it is about whether or  not we look out for one another.   I think we need to take a good, hard look in the mirror and ask: Who  are we as a country? Are we a country that cuts the deficit by cutting  care for our most vulnerable?   Let's look in the mirror and ask: Are we a country that gives tax  breaks to insurers while giving higher medical bills to patients?   Are we a country that tells seniors and cancer patients and women  ``You are on your own''?   Are we a country that sees healthcare as a privilege for a few or a  right for all?   I believe that is what we have to decide.   The ACA is not perfect. It can be strengthened, and I am willing to  work with anyone who will work in good faith to do that, but it is time  to stop playing politics with public health.   Our government has three main functions: public safety, public  education, and public health. We shouldn't be turning these  responsibilities into partisan issues. Instead, we should be figuring  out how to improve the lives of all Americans, whether we are  Democrats, Republicans, or Independents.   People are counting on us, people like one of my constituents in Kern  County--a woman who is suffering from lung disease, who said:         We are not asking for much . . . decent healthcare. . . .       Don't take it away. . . . Make it better.    I say to my colleagues: Do not take away American people's  healthcare. Let's make it better.   I yield the floor.
