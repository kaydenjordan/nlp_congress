 Madam Speaker, today I rise in  opposition to the unfair and unprecedented process that is being used  by my colleagues across the aisle to smear the duly elected President  of the United States and make a mockery of American justice.   Since the day he was sworn in, Democrats have dismissed their duty as  the majority party to lead this country. Instead, their agenda has  revolved around their desire to oust the duly elected President.   Since hearings with Robert Mueller, Joseph Maguire, and others did  not yield their desired results, Democrats have changed their tactics.  Those publicity stunts backfired.   So what has been their response? Hold Soviet-style, closed-door,  ``guilty until proven innocent'' investigations.   President Trump deserves due process, and the American people deserve  transparency and fairness; but, more importantly, Congress should be  tending to the business of the people by passing substantive  legislation instead of continuing to waste taxpayer time and money on  yet another witch hunt.                            ____________________
