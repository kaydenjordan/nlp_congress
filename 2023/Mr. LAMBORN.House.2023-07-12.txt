 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Chairman Rogers' leadership  on this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in favor of the Fiscal Year 2024 National  Defense Authorization Act. This bill prioritizes our military,  safeguards their rights, and puts forward a fighting force that will  stand against those who threaten the United States of America.   As chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I have had the  distinct honor of working closely with my colleagues on the House Armed  Services Committee on this year's NDAA. This bill fully funds  modernization of our nuclear triad, establishes the nuclear sea- launched cruise missile as a program of record, prevents the Biden  administration from attempting to retire any element of our nuclear  arsenal, and prohibits them from sharing nuclear information with  Russia until the Russians reciprocate.   Additionally, the bill removes outdated missile defense policy  limitations and crucially requires and funds acceleration in our  development of hypersonic capabilities.   Finally, it advances our organization in military space, including  with the establishment of a space national guard.   My colleagues in the House will be pleased to know that this bill  also takes significant steps to end wokeness in the military by banning  critical race theory and ending DEI overreach. Our military is not a  social experiment. It is a fighting force that should be empowered to  prioritize those missions.   To this end, the bill includes a 5.2 percent pay raise for  servicemembers, expands opportunities for military spouses, and expands  access to childcare and schools for military families.   I also thank Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts for his  bipartisan efforts as ranking member of the subcommittee.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
