 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against  the President's newly released budget request.   When I began reading this budget request, only one word came to mind,  at least that I can say here--awful:   It is an awful budget for American families struggling to make ends  meet who haven't had a raise in years.   It is an awful budget for older Americans who paid into Social  Security with the promise that it would be there for them.   It is an awful budget for local businesses who can't get their  products to consumers because of our crumbling roads and bridges.   It is an awful budget for common sense, with unnecessary spending on  a border wall that the American people will pay for.   It is an awful budget because it sets the stage for even more waste,  fraud, and abuse in government.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, the only group that this budget isn't awful for  is the President and his friends.   The President calls this an America First budget, so why is it  leaving so many American families behind?   I urge my colleagues to completely reject this awful budget that  doesn't create jobs, doesn't uplift families, and doesn't make any  sense.                            ____________________
