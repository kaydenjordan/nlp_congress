 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, both parties used to agree that the  thorough review of a Supreme Court nominee's record was essential to  fulfilling our constitutional advice and consent obligations as  Senators.   When Elena Kagan was nominated 8 years ago, even though Democrats  were in the majority and Republicans were in the minority, Chairman  Leahy joined with Republicans to request all of Elena Kagan's records  from her time in the White House. Now the shoe is on the other foot. We  are in the minority; they are in the majority. But rather than applying  the previous, bipartisan standard, the Republican majority is refusing  to join with Democrats in requesting Brett Kavanaugh's complete record.   At issue is Brett Kavanaugh's time as Staff Secretary in the Bush  White House. Republicans argue we don't need to see papers from that  part of his career; Democrats argue we most certainly do. Republicans  are being hypocritical and sophistic.   In both cases, we said that we needed all of the papers. Why? Because  this is such an important job, and we ought to see the complete record  of whoever the nominee is.   Now they are saying: Well, counsel is OK, but Staff Secretary isn't,  and Kagan wasn't a Staff Secretary. So what? So what?   The relevant standard is all of the records, no matter what jobs they  had, and Republicans are trying to come up with a difference for  reasons that people are asking why. Are they hiding something? Is  Kavanaugh hiding something? What did he do when he was Staff Secretary  that he doesn't want the American public to see?   The Republicans say that the job of Staff Secretary wasn't so  important, merely a paper pusher. Bull. The Senate doesn't need to see  anything from that period, they say, because the job was unimportant.  Second, they say that his years as a judge should preclude him from  having to provide paperwork from his earlier work as a top White House  official.   The Republicans keep moving the goalposts. They keep changing the  standards to suit their needs to accomplish their goal--a hard-right,  anti-middle-class, anti-choice, anti-healthcare Supreme Court. That is  their goal. They can't accomplish it here; they can't accomplish it in  the House; they can't even accomplish it with President Trump because  those are elected branches of government, and the public pushes back.  But with judges, they can, so they keep moving the goalposts and  changing the rules time and again.   Their arguments don't withstand scrutiny. Let's take the first one:  The job of Staff Secretary wasn't so important. That is a laugher.  Brett Kavanaugh himself has said that ``my three years as Staff  Secretary for President Bush--were the most interesting and in many  ways among the most instructive.'' If he feels they were most  instructive, why shouldn't the American people see what instructed him?  By his own account, during his time in the White House and as Staff  Secretary, Judge Kavanaugh attended meetings with world leaders from  the Pope to Vladimir Putin. He participated ``in the process of putting  legislation together,'' and he talked to the President of the United  States about how he should pick someone for the Supreme Court. In fact,  Judge Kavanaugh said his time as Staff Secretary made him a ``better  interpreter of statutes.''   Over and over again, Judge Kavanaugh has said that this was an  important position and it critically informed who he is as a judge and  who he will be, should he be confirmed--I hope he isn't--to the Supreme  Court. So the argument the Republicans have made that Staff Secretary  isn't an important job is virtually laughable and a coverup for their  fear of letting all the records out.   The second argument we are hearing is that it is gratuitous and  unreasonable to ask for documents from Brett Kavanaugh's career before  he became a judge. Well, they have amnesia on the other side. Nine  years ago, when this body was considering the nomination of Sonia  Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, Senate Republicans on the Judiciary  Committee requested all of the paperwork from her tenure at the Puerto  Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund.   Sotomayor was a judge for 15 years--3 longer than Judge Kavanaugh-- and still Republicans, just 9 years ago, said they needed ``minutes  from the board meetings'' that Justice Sotomayor attended as far back  as 29 years before her confirmation hearings. Here is what Senator  Sessions said in 2009:         The [Puerto Rican legal defense fund] documents may provide       insight into [Sotomayor's] judicial approach. . . . The       American people have a right to know this important       information about President Obama's nominee.    Guess what. Senator Leahy, then chairman, joined Sessions in  requesting those documents. Democrats have been very open about their  nominees--our nominees--and we have let the full records come out. We  are not afraid of who they are. But when the Republicans are in charge,  they come up with all of these elliptical, sophistic, and fundamentally  hypocritical arguments about why that record shouldn't be made  available. We have never heard those from Democrats. It is just unfair.   So when my friends from the other side say that we don't need all of  Kavanaugh's documents because White House Staff Secretary isn't an  important job, we ask: Isn't it a more important job than being part of  the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, from which you  demanded records? Of course it is.  [[Page S5397]]    It seems each time Democrats demonstrate that our request is 100  percent consistent with the Senate's bipartisan precedents, we hear  some new, strained, contorted rationalization from Senate Republicans  as to why a new, partisan approach is called for now and why the Senate  should avert its gaze from Judge Kavanaugh's work as one of the most  senior officials in the White House. Republicans keep moving the  goalposts in what I can only characterize as a flimsy and transparent  attempt to mask their own hypocrisy.   Again, there is an obvious, looming question: What are Republicans  trying to hide in Judge Kavanaugh's record? What don't they want the  public to see? Why are they making such hypocrites of themselves in  coming up with these solipsistic arguments that when they were in the  minority and President Obama nominated people, they should get all the  records, but not now?    If there is nothing to hide for Judge Kavanaugh, then let the  sunlight shine. Let the records come out.   My Republican friends seem to think that some Democrats have  announced their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh, and that means the full  Senate doesn't deserve to have access to his records. Frankly, it is  rich to hear this from the Republican leader. People are rolling their  eyes. He refused to consider any nominee by President Obama--it didn't  matter who it was--mere hours after we received the news of Justice  Scalia's death. It was one of the most shameful chapters in the Senate.  I know there is gloating on the hard right: Wasn't that a brilliant  move?   It is going to go down in history as one of the low points of the  Senate, and Senator McConnell will have to bear that on his shoulders.  I say that even though he is my friend.   I say to my Republican colleagues: This is not about Democrats. This  is not about individual Senators and how they might vote. It is about  the American people. We have an open government. The American people  deserve a chance to hear the full record, make their judgments, and let  their elected representatives know now, before the nominee is voted on  and in November.   When Elena Kagan's documents were requested by the Senate, they were  almost immediately posted online for everyone to see, and they are  still there. You can look them up. This isn't about how some of my  Democratic colleagues may vote on Judge Kavanaugh; this is about hiding  critical information about a Supreme Court nominee from the American  people.   This is simple. Senate Democrats are following a bipartisan  precedent; Senate Republicans are not. Republicans are playing a  partisan game in hopes of withholding and hiding relevant information  from the Senate and the public.   I will make one final plea to my colleagues on the other side, who  seem to think the whole thing is just a political game and that there  is nothing deep or sincere about the foundation of this Republic. This  is not a game. This is a nomination for a lifetime appointment to a  seat on the Supreme Court of the United States. It is one of the most  important votes any of us will ever cast. The American people expect  and deserve that the Senate take its constitutional duty seriously. I  hope our Republican colleagues will stop their partisan, self-serving  games and let the Senate do its job.                                  Healthcare    Madam President, on healthcare, a year ago this week, the Senate  defeated a partisan attempt by President Trump and Senate Republicans  to repeal the healthcare law. Since that ignominious defeat, where John  McCain showed such courage and looked so much better than so many of my  other colleagues across the aisle in what they are doing now, the Trump  administration and congressional Republicans have sabotaged our  healthcare system, raising costs on American families, driving up  premiums, reducing the quality of care. For what reason? There seems to  be hardly any reason, other than political spite.   President Trump is an expert on political spite. We all know that.  Our Republican colleagues just march blithely behind him. They hate the  Affordable Care Act so much that they are willing to take a torch to  our healthcare system, even though it hurts millions of average  Americans.   The Trump administration is trying to gut protections for Americans  with preexisting conditions through the courts. The administration has  directed the Justice Department not to defend the constitutionality of  preexisting conditions and at the same time is pushing Judge Kavanaugh  onto the Bench.   Remember, President Trump said that his ``judicial appointments would  do the right thing, unlike Judge Roberts on health care.'' Make no  mistake about it, America, Judge Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme  Court puts the future of protections for preexisting conditions in the  spotlight.   I would like every Republican Senator to go home and defend that. Go  home and defend that they want to repeal protections for preexisting  conditions; go home and defend that they want to put on the Bench a  nominee who is likely to do so because President Trump said so.   In a recent Kaiser poll, voters ranked continuing preexisting  conditions as the most important healthcare issue in the upcoming  campaign. By 58 to 27, voters said that since President Trump and  congressional Republicans have made changes in the law, they are now  responsible for any problems with our healthcare system moving forward.   Almost a year after the Republican healthcare bill went down, those  numbers should be a stark warning to my Republican colleagues. The  American people do not want endless political sabotage. They want lower  costs, better quality, more stability, and, above all, they want to  keep the protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.   Republicans go down the road of sabotage at their own peril. I urge  my colleagues, instead, to join Democrats in defending preexisting  conditions in court, as Senator Manchin, Senator Casey--who has been  such a leader on healthcare, whom we will hear from in a minute--and  other Democrats have asked us to do.   I yield the floor.
