 Mr. President, I am here for now the 21st in my  series of speeches about the scheme to capture and control our Supreme  Court, a scheme to which rightwing special interests have devoted  hundreds of millions of dark money dollars. The ingredients in this  noxious cocktail are creepy rightwing billionaires, phony front groups,  amenable justices, large sums of money, and secrecy.   This month, we have gotten a whole new look at how these ingredients  mix.   According to extraordinary reporting by ProPublica, for more than 20  years, Justice Clarence Thomas has accepted luxury trips, virtually  every year, from billionaire Harlan Crow without disclosing them. Here  is how ProPublica described it:         [Thomas] has vacationed on Crow's superyacht around the       globe. He flies on Crow's Bombardier Global 5000 jet. He has       gone with Crow to the Bohemian Grove, the exclusive       California all-male retreat, and to  [[Page S1160]]       Crow's sprawling ranch in East Texas. And Thomas typically       spends about a week every summer at Crow's private resort in       the Adirondacks.    One of those trips has been valued at more than $500,000.   We have heard from civil servants who have to report a gift of $5.  This Justice received a gift of a trip that they valued at $500,000. It  was a trip to Indonesia on Crow's private jet, followed by, and I quote  here, ``nine days of island-hopping . . . on a superyacht staffed by a  coterie of attendants, and a private chef.'' And that is just one  excursion. No telling how many others there were.   None of this was disclosed. The supposed rationale was that it was  all ``personal hospitality.'' So let's set aside for one second the  question of whether this actually was personal hospitality. Let's  presume that there was personal hospitality here somewhere. What that  overlooks is the problem of the personal hospitality exemption, which  covers exemption from disclosure of ``food, lodging, or entertainment  received as personal hospitality of an individual.'' Food, lodging, or  entertainment--not transportation, not travel, not trips on Harlan  Crow's private jet.   ProPublica was able to identify multiple trips that Thomas took on  Crow's jet, and each one of those trips seems to be a slam dunk  violation of this provision--not food, not lodging, not entertainment.  Transportation.   It does not stop there. Additional reporting by ProPublica revealed  more of Crow's undisclosed generosity. In 2014, Crow purchased from  Thomas and his relatives three properties in Georgia, including the  home where Thomas's mother lives. There seemed to be more collateral  gifts in the form of renovations and an agreement that Thomas's mother  would live there rent-free for the rest of her life.   There is much more to learn about this transaction, but back to the  disclosure, here is what the law requires for property disclosures. It  requires the disclosure of any purchase, sale, or exchange during the  preceding calendar year which exceeds $1,000 in real property, other  than property used solely as a personal residence of the reporting  individual. If it is not your home, if it is any other real property,  and if it is worth more than $1,000, the law requires that it be  reported. Thomas disclosed none of this on the annual disclosure forms  required by law.   This law applies across the government. This isn't something special  for the Supreme Court. But transparency is especially important for  judges, who must recuse themselves from cases if there is even an  appearance of impropriety.   Purchasing Thomas's property and offering him free international  vacations weren't the only favors bestowed by the billionaire. In 2011,  the New York Times reported on him having ``done many favors for the  justice and his wife,'' including using his company to finance what the  Times called ``the multimillion-dollar purchase and restoration'' of a  property where Justice Thomas's mother used to work; donating $175,000  to a Savannah library project dedicated to Justice Thomas; giving  Justice Thomas a $19,000 Bible that belonged to Frederick Douglass; and  ``providing $500,000 for Ginni Thomas [his spouse] to start a Tea  Party-related group.''   Well, could any of that raise an appearance of impropriety or was it  purely ``personal,'' nothing to do with the Court? Well, let's have a  look at a picture that shows us a little illumination of that.   This is a painting that Harlan Crow commissioned during one of  Thomas's visits to Crow's private, lakeside, Adirondack retreat. On the  right here is Crow himself. Next to him is Justice Thomas.   Crow sits on the board of two conservative organizations that file  briefs before the Supreme Court. Crow is also a donor to the Federalist  Society, from which Trump's infamous Supreme Court list emerged. By the  way, dark money surged into the Federalist Society during that period.  Crow is also a political donor to Republican politicians.   Investigation would show whether all this amounted to enough business  before the Court to create a conflict of interest, but the Supreme  Court won't permit any investigation of its members.   Here on the left is the infamous Leonard Leo, the man behind that  Trump Supreme Court list, whose three new Justices created the far- right supermajority that Justice Thomas now enjoys. Leo's front group,  the Judicial Crisis Network, bought the campaign ads for the three  Justices, paid for with dark money.   Here is a graphic I have used before showing Leonard Leo's flotilla  of front groups that he uses. He has more. This is just one assortment  of his front groups.   Here is the Judicial Crisis Network, which took checks as big as $17  million from anonymous donors and used that money to spend on ads for  the confirmation of the three new Justices.   Leo is the one who helped the rightwing billionaires knock out  Harriet Miers. Do you remember when she was a nominee for the Supreme  Court by a Republican President? Knocked her out to make room for none  other than Sam Alito to get onto the Court.    The campaign Leo oversaw by the billionaires to capture the Court has  been tallied at more than $580 million--$580 million--much of it dark  money. And he recently received from another creepy rightwing  billionaire a $1.6 billion slush fund into yet another 501(c)(4) front  group.   So it is deeply misleading to claim that Justice Thomas never  vacationed with people who had business before the Court. Leonard Leo's  business is the Court. The creepy billionaire's campaign was to capture  the Court. Leo was the billionaire's contractor for construction of the  Court that dark money built.   Personal hospitality. After Thomas gets on the Court, a major  Republican donor befriends him, with half a million dollars for his  spouse's activist group, a renovated home for his mother, and lavish  undisclosed vacations, at which Thomas was sometimes accompanied by  rightwing activists at the center of the scheme to capture the Court.  And we are supposed to believe this is all legit? I don't think so.   Guess who else doesn't think so. Justice Thomas, who knew this  smelled enough that he broke the disclosure law repeatedly to keep it  secret.   Guess who else doesn't think so. Ask other Federal judges. They can't  get away with this personal hospitality nonsense. They know that this  is wrong and that it is embarrassing to the judiciary. That is why the  Judicial Conference just cracked down on the personal hospitality  shenanigans of their supreme court colleagues.   Thomas is feeling enough heat that he even released a public  statement. ``Early in my tenure at the Court,'' he said, ``I sought  guidance from my colleagues and others in the judiciary, and was  advised that this sort of personal hospitality . . . was not  reportable'' and that he has ``always sought to comply with disclosure  guidelines.''   Wow, where to begin. First, who ``advised'' Thomas that this  ``personal hospitality . . . was not reportable''? Whoever it was, they  were wrong. I have spoken before about this personal hospitality issue.  The reporting exemption for personal hospitality covers ordinary gifts  of ``food, lodging, and entertainment'' from friends and family. There  is not an exemption for transportation, for all that flying around the  world in private jets. It just isn't there.   We don't know who advised him, but I can pretty surely tell you who  didn't advise him; that is, the formal committees of the Judicial  Conference that advise on ethics and financial disclosure issues. They  have committees for this. That would be the obvious place to go for  real advice. Yet all indications are that he did not. I suspect that  Thomas knew they would not like the facts that he would have to  disclose if he were to ask them in candor to offer an opinion on his  situation. He also, I suspect, knew that he would not like the answer  he would get. So he just didn't file.   The recent definition of ``personal hospitality'' that the Judicial  Conference announced in response to 2 years of urging from me was  intended to clarify what was already prohibited--a clarification that  every other branch had already issued. And the reporting law never  exempted private jet travel.   Thomas actually knew this because he had reported flying on Crow's  private jet before, back in 1997. What changed?  [[Page S1161]]    Federal law is crystal clear on the need to report real estate  transactions worth over $1,000. The law is so clear that CNN reported  yesterday that Thomas will amend his disclosure report to include that  sale.   According to what CNN called ``a source close to Thomas,'' Thomas  ``has always filled out his forms with the help of his aides,'' and he  didn't think he needed to report the sale because he didn't make any  money off it. Well, that excuse might be believable if the statutory  language weren't so clear--crystal clear--and if Thomas weren't what  one commentator has called a ``repeat offender'' at disclosure.   In 2011, Thomas had to amend 13 years' worth of financial disclosure  reports to add his wife's income from the Heritage Foundation, a dark  money, conservative outfit which also files amicus briefs at the  Supreme Court. He said it was a ``misunderstanding.''   Here is what he misunderstood: Financial Disclosure Report form; B,  spouse's noninvestment income. ``If you were married during any portion  of the reporting year, complete this section.'' Income: None or date  and source. That is not complicated. Those instructions are simple.  And, like his private jet travel, Justice Thomas had reported his  wife's income before, back in 1996. What changed?   Congressman Hank Johnson and I sent a bicameral letter to Chief  Justice Roberts urging him to get his courthouse in order and set up a  means to investigate these and other serious allegations of  misconduct. We also sent a letter to the Judicial Conference calling  for the Conference to refer Justice Thomas to the Attorney General for  failure to report his real estate transaction with Crow.    Here is how that works under the ethics law:         The head of each Agency, or the Judicial Conference, shall       refer to the Attorney General the name of any individual       which such official or committee has reasonable cause to       believe has willfully failed to file a report or has       willfully falsified or willfully failed to file information       required to be reported.        The Attorney General [in turn] may bring a Civil Action       against any individual . . . who knowingly or willfully fails       to file or report any information that such individual is       required to report.    That is not complicated.   And the Supreme Court is completely alone here in this peculiar  approach to these issues. Wherever else you go in government, you will  find an ethics code, and you will find a process for investigating and  enforcing the ethics rules.   Congress has Ethics Committees. The executive branch has an ethics  office and inspectors general. Federal courts have their own ethics  process. Only the Supreme Court has none of that. No designated place  to submit complaints. No investigative mechanism to review complaints.  No impartial panel to decide complaints. No transparency.   All of that needs to change if we are to rebuild confidence in our  highest Court.   Without investigation, it is impossible to determine if Justice  Thomas violated still another Federal law by participating in cases  implicating his wife's political activities. We need investigation to  find out whether he broke that law.   Without investigation, there is no way to evaluate the ethics of the  20-year, $30 million private judicial lobbying campaign run by  rightwing political activists who wined and dined Justices Thomas,  Alito, and Scalia--the three Justices who, as the New York Times  described it, ``proved amenable.'' Amenable.   Without any prospect of investigation, there is little reason for a  Justice to comply with the ethics standards. When there is no ref,  there is ultimately no rules. The rule that clearly pertains is that it  is not OK to judge one's own case. That rule is so obvious, I hardly  need to state it, and that rule is so old it is in Latin: ``Nemo judex  in sua causa.'' No one should be judged in their own case. We know that  Justice Thomas is familiar with this rule because he cited it in an  opinion he wrote just a few years ago when he noted that ``At common  law, a fair tribunal meant that `no man shall be a judge in his own  case.' ''   This good old rule, grounded in history and tradition, the present  Supreme Court constantly and flagrantly flouts. That must stop. The  Justices have lost the benefit of the doubt--240 years the Court went  without needing this, but this Roberts Court has squandered the  public's confidence with its behavior, and now there must be rules and  process.   The Senate Judiciary Committee, along with my subcommittee, will hold  a hearing to consider these issues. I hope our colleagues will take it  seriously. Congressman Hank Johnson and I have introduced the Supreme  Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act, which would solve a lot of  this mess--this big, tragic, unnecessary, self-inflicted mess.   Let me conclude where I began, with that noxious cocktail of creepy  rightwing billionaires, phony front groups, amenable Justices, large  sums of money, and secrecy. It is a toxic brew. The ethics failures at  the Court are just one part of that stinking cocktail. We have Justices  picked in some backroom at the Federalist Society by creepy  billionaires to put on a list for Donald Trump. We have Justices who  came through a confirmation process so tainted with influence that the  FBI was breaking its own procedures in background investigations and  Senators were pulling screeching 180s on confirming Supreme Court  Justices in an election year. Flotillas of front group amici--amici  curiae--who won't tell who orchestrates and funds them appear in Court  to tell those Justices what to do. And the Justices, with astonishing  statistical reliability, do as they are told.    To get the results they want, the Justices smash through precedent,  violate so-called conservative judicial principles, make up false  facts, and change the applicable legal standards. All of this mess--all  of it--is the product of that toxic brew of creepy rightwing  billionaires, phony front groups, amenable Justices, large sums of  money, and secrecy.   For now, let's at least fix the ethics mess and bring the Supreme  Court into alignment with the rest of the Federal courts. The highest  Court should not have the lowest standards.   To be continued.   I yield the floor.    If I may interrupt the distinguished Senator from  Alaska for 1 minute to do some closing business and then leave her the  floor.                            ____________________     On behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the  following Senate resolutions introduced earlier today: S. Res. 160,  161, and 162.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be  agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate  completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m. on  Wednesday, April 19; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that following the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 28,  S. 870; further, at 11:30 a.m., the Senate vote on the Paul and Hagerty  amendments as provided under the previous order; that following the  disposition of the Hagerty amendment, Senator Tuberville or his  designee be recognized to make a motion to proceed to Calendar No. 35,  S.J. Res. 10; that the time until 4:15 p.m. be equally divided between  the two leaders or their designees and with the final 15 minutes  equally divided in the same form; that the Senate recess from 3 p.m.  until 4 p.m. to allow for the all-Senators briefing, with the time  counting equally to both sides.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order,  following the remarks of Senator Murkowski, to whom I express gratitude  for her courtesy.
