 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank the Capitol  Police and all of those who really created a miracle in the midst of a  potential bomb threat just about a week ago here in the United States  Capitol again, and to thank them for their astuteness and to recognize  that, in spite of all of our commentary from our friends on the other  side about the border, that the most serious threat here in the United  States is domestic terrorism, and there evidenced an individual,  whatever his condition was, wanting to bomb the Capitol.   I thank them for their honest and serious work and again credit them  for their leadership.   Finally, let me say that as we move toward the Voting Rights Act,  H.R. 4, it is crucial because Texas Democratic representatives will be  here over the next 2 days, the same people who had a civil arrest and  were stalked in their own State because they refused to go to a session  that was nothing but denying rights to vote to Texans--minorities,  ethnic minorities, language minorities, denying them the right to vote.  H.R. 4 is crucial.   I thank them for their bravery and their service.   Let's get on with passing H.R. 4.                            ____________________
