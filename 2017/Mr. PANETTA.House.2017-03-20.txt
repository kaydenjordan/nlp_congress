 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1029, the Pesticide Registration  Enhancement Act of 2017.   Once again, Madam Speaker, I stand before you to urge the passage of  H.R. 1029. As we know, the Environmental Protection Agency is  responsible for regulating the sale, use, and distribution of  pesticides. To facilitate and expedite that pesticide approval process,  pesticide manufacturers have long supplemented the EPA's annual budget.  This system allows the products to be reviewed in a timely manner,  without sacrificing environmental and safety protections. It is truly a  win-win for both manufacturers and consumers, and, as you heard Mr.  Davis speak about, it is a clear example of government at its best. It  is exactly why I enjoy working on the Committee on Agriculture. It is  exactly why I enjoy working with people such as Rodney Davis. We have a  bipartisan, effective, public-private legislative solution for a more  predictable pesticide evaluation process that literally helps  everybody.   The Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act, H.R. 1029, is an  exceptional piece of legislation not only because it is supported by a  unique coalition of pesticide registrants, environmental groups, and  agricultural labor representatives, but H.R. 1029 provides a more  effective, predictable, and transparent pesticide evaluation process.  It promotes shorter review periods for reduced-risk pesticides and  enhances scientific and regulatory activities related to farmworker  protection.   My district on the central coast of California is not only bountiful  in its agriculture, it is absolutely beautiful with its environment.  Therefore, we on the central coast work hard to find that balance of  being known as the salad bowl of the world and one of the most scenic  places in the world. That is why our agriculture producers are the most  thoughtful stewards of the land and recognize the need to protect the  environment and the natural resources.   This legislation facilitates that balance. This legislation provides  a unique coalition building and encourages the agriculture industry to  work with environmentalists. Thus, H.R. 1029 helps all of us who live  and work in our community and, ultimately, our country. That is why I  am absolutely honored to speak in this debate, humbled to share the  floor with Representative Davis, and why I urge all my colleagues to  support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this is exactly why we are here today in a bipartisan  way. The gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta) said it right: this  affects his industry, and it affects his home area. As he likes to say,  it is the salad bowl of America. I have been there, and I have seen the  crops they grow. The crops I grow are much different in central  Illinois, the crops that are grown by the farmers that I am proud to  represent, but they all have to have a successful PRIA reauthorization  to be able to grow those foods that we here in America continue to feed  the world with and that we see in our grocery stores and on our  supermarket shelves.   Madam Speaker, I want to say thank you because this bill is  essential, as we in central Illinois go out and take care of things  such as making sure the weeds don't pop up in our yards. Every single  small business that decides to put down product and pesticides to  ensure that lawns in central Illinois continue to prosper as the spring  and summer unfold, this is essential to their success.   This is essential to our farmers, who are looking to get their fields  ready to go plant, the stewards of the land, the best stewards of the  land, as Congressman Panetta said. It assures them that they are going  to be able to get that seed into the ground and, with the hope and  prayers of rain and moisture, that it is going to grow and that we are  still going to have a marketplace for those products.   The risk that our farmers take every single year, when they risk and  leverage their family incomes in many cases, in hopes that a seed is  going to grow and a plant is going to grow, and they are going to be  able to sell that, they need the certainty that this bill will actually  give them. That is why I am proud to be here as the author, proud to  stand with my colleagues.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1029, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
