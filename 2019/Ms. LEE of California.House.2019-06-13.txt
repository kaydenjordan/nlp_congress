 Mr. Chair, I thank Madam Chair for her  leadership and for yielding time.   I rise in strong opposition to this amendment, which would strike the  provision in the bill that increases funding for international family  planning and reproductive health programs.   Women around the world deserve access to the full range of  reproductive healthcare, and the Fiscal Year 2020 State and Foreign  Operations bill will help to ensure that.   USAID provides vitally needed family planning funds to overseas  health centers. Evidence has shown that USAID family planning programs  have had important, real-world effects on the health of women and  families worldwide, resulting in fewer unintended births, abortions,  and miscarriages.    Funding for our international family planning programs has also  helped reduce maternal and infant deaths, a goal that has strong  bipartisan support.   Mr. Chair, I have been around the world, to Africa and to other  countries and continents, and have talked with families in villages,  women and their spouses with maybe five, six, seven children.   I have visited these villages with Republicans. And their first  request to us is to help them with family planning. They know that it  is so important in terms of planning the births of their children and  in terms of just the stability of the family and the empowerment of  women that family planning services be available.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to  oppose the amendment.
