 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on a quiet war  that has plagued our Nation for years. It is not the type of warfare we  typically consider, but this war's implications are just as grave. It  is a war being waged on our soil, in our communities, and exploiting  discourse among friends, family, and neighbors. It is a war intended to  divide our great Nation in order to weaken our unity and our  resilience.   The tactics of this warfare are not always apparent, making it  possible for any citizen to become a casualty of this dangerous  campaign against the United States. The war I am referring to is the  disinformation war against Western democracies being waged by the  Russian Federation.   Russia's disinformation campaign against the United States started  before the 2016 Presidential election. In 2013, the Chief of Staff of  the Armed  [[Page H3348]]  Forces of Russia stated: ``The very rules of war have changed. The role  of nonmilitary means of achieving political and strategic goals has  grown, and, in many cases, they have exceeded the power of force of  weapons in their effectiveness. The focus of applied methods of  conflict has altered in the direction of the broad use of political,  economic, informational, humanitarian, and other nonmilitary measures-- applied in coordination with the protest potential of the population.''   Last month, General Philip Breedlove testified before the House Armed  Services Committee stating: ``Russia sees the West, and in particular,  a unified West, as an adversary. Waging a conventional war against the  West would be unfavorable to Russia. As such, it has used hybrid  warfare to break up Western unity.''   He went on to say: ``Exploiting divisions in U.S. society and  promoting a `culture war' is one key element of Moscow's efforts to  weaken the West.''   In 2015, Russia's disinformation campaign against the United States  impacted my home State of Missouri. Research conducted by U.S. Air  Force Lieutenant Colonel Jared Pier found that the same Russian trolls  involved in the 2016 Presidential election interjected themselves in  the 2015 protests at the University of Missouri with the goal of  inciting further unrest and spreading discord and fear. The Russian  account @fanfan1911 tweeted: ``The cops are marching with the KKK. They  beat up my little brother. Watch out.''   The tweet was then retweeted by Twitter bots and hundreds of real  Twitter users who fell victim to the hoax. Lieutenant Colonel Pier's  research found that this same Twitter account later changed its tweets  to all German and spread rumors about Syrian refugees provoking unrest  in Germany during the height of the refugee crisis. In 2016, the  account switched back to English and began tweeting about the 2016  Presidential election.   Russia's interference in the 2016 Presidential election by spreading  disinformation on social media is troubling, and it showcases Russia's  success in weaponizing the internet. Russia has exploited political  divisions with the intention to cause individuals to question the  legitimacy of our democracy. That is Russia's ultimate goal, not to  sway the outcome of elections, but to call into question the very  foundations that make our democracy strong by provoking mistrust and  instability into democratic institutions.   As Americans, we must wake up and band together to fight against  Russia's tactics. In Missouri and around the country, we have our own  interfamily squabbles. Brothers and sisters may have arguments, but the  minute the neighborhood kid picks on one of us, we defend each other.  It is time that we face the reality that Russia is exploiting our  American family disagreements and making them far worse.    Instead of placing blame on each other and further polarizing our  Nation, we should turn toward each other to develop a defense strategy  to counter Russia's propaganda machine. Russia is instigating fights on  both sides of the aisle. They do not care about American political  parties, but rather the demise of Western democratic institutions. It  is time that we stop Russia from infecting our family with their  disinformation virus.   I call on all Americans to judge inflammatory posts with a wary eye.  We need to quit being naive, allowing ourselves to become a pawn of  those who want our undoing.   The internet is now a battlefield. It is critical that we consider  the source of all information we receive. That information could be  from a Russian bot in St. Petersburg. It is time to stand united, talk  to each other, and work together to solve the challenges of our times.                            ____________________
