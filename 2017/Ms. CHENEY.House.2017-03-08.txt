 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 174 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 174         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1301) making       appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal       year ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  The chair of the Committee on Appropriations may       insert in the Congressional Record not later than Wednesday,       March 8, 2017, such material as he may deem explanatory of       H.R. 1301.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 174,  which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 1301, the  Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal 2017. I would like  to thank, in particular, Chairman Frelinghuysen, Chairman Granger, and  Ranking Member Visclosky for their hard and dedicated work on this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, we have no higher obligation as elected representatives  of the people of this great Republic than ensuring for the security and  defense of our Nation. We are gathered here at a tremendous time of  action and achievement across an array of crucial policy areas,  regulatory relief for the citizens and businesses of our Nation,  restoration of authority to our States and local communities, tax  reform, ObamaCare repeal and replacement, and the list goes on.   President Trump is doing what he promised during his campaign, and it  is an honor to serve the people of Wyoming at this historic moment.  But, Mr. Speaker, it is no exaggeration to say that if we fail to  provide the resources our military needs to defend our Nation, if we  fail to do what is necessary to ensure America's Armed Forces remain  superior to all others in the world, if we fail to provide the support  our men and women in uniform need to recover from 8 years of  devastating policies, nothing else we are doing in this body will  matter.   Mr. Speaker, the need is urgent. As we meet today to debate the 2017  Defense appropriation, our Nation faces a more complex and grave threat  environment than we have faced at anytime since World War II, and  possibly, Mr. Speaker, more than at anytime in our history. For 8  years, our adversaries' strength has grown, while our relative  capabilities have stagnated and, in some instances, declined.                                time  1230    North Korea continues its ballistic missile launches as it threatens  our allies and interests.   The Iranian nuclear agreement has bought time for Iran to continue to  advance its nuclear weapons program, as it reaps the windfall of at  least $1 trillion of U.S. taxpayer funds provided to it by the Obama  administration. Iran continues to threaten U.S. naval vessels in the  Strait of Hormuz, support terrorism across the Middle East, and test  ballistic missiles despite its U.N. obligations.   China is rapidly building up its military, and it is targeting, in  particular, technologies to try to level the playing field with our  capabilities. It continues to threaten freedom of navigation and trade  in the South China Sea, and to conduct cyber operations against the  United States.   Russia has invaded Ukraine, threatens Eastern Europe and the Baltics,  is violating INF Treaty obligations, and openly threatening the use of  nuclear weapons.   Al-Qaida today exists in more counties than ever before, and ISIS  continues to recruit and hold territory as it plans and launches  attacks against the West.   Most of the actors I just mentioned are also responsible for cyber  attacks against the United States.   Against this backdrop, Mr. Speaker, the U.S. military is vastly  under-resourced. At a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing,  the vice chief of staff of the Army told members that of the 58 brigade  combat teams, only three are ready to ``fight tonight.'' The vice chief  of naval operations, Admiral William Moran, recently testified that  more than half of all Navy aircraft are grounded due to maintenance  issues and an inability to acquire the necessary parts. Our nuclear  force is aging, even as our adversaries continue to make advancements  in their own nuclear forces and capabilities. Our Air Force is the  oldest, smallest, and least ready it has ever been.  [[Page H1605]]    These stories and shortfalls, Mr. Speaker, exist across nearly every  aspect of our military. America's fighting men and women are the  greatest fighting force and the greatest force for good our world has  ever known. They deserve the resources to do their job.   We have prevailed over great challenges in the past, from our  unlikely and miraculous founding, through our Civil War, two world  wars, the Cold War, and the early years of the war on terror. We must,  Mr. Speaker, marshal our forces to do so again. To prevail, Congress-- this Congress--must do its job.   That job begins with passing this 2017 Defense Appropriations bill.  Then, Mr. Speaker, we must repeal the Budget Control Act and end  sequestration. There is a rational and responsible way for us to  undertake defense budgeting. The process in place today is neither.   The last time our military was able to assess the threats we face and  then recommend the necessary funding levels to defeat those threats was  fiscal year 2011, over 6 years ago. We must return to this standard  budgeting process. In describing the effects of sequestration several  years ago, our current Defense Secretary put it this way: ``No foe in  the field can wreak such havoc on our security as mindless  sequestration is achieving today.'' We must end this practice with all  speed.   This should not be a partisan issue, Mr. Speaker. It has not been in  our past. Since World War II, every American President, Republican and  Democrat alike, has understood the importance of American military  superiority of ensuring a world in which America and our allies set the  rules.   Threatened by the Nazis and the Japanese, Franklin Roosevelt and  George C. Marshall knew America had to be the ``arsenal of democracy.''  At the beginning of the Cold War, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and  John F. Kennedy roused the Nation to defeat freedom and liberty against  communism. John F. Kennedy knew America had to be ``the watchmen on the  walls of freedom.'' In the 1980s, President Reagan oversaw the defense  buildup we are still benefiting from today. He knew that ``war comes  not when the forces of freedom are strong, it is when they are weak  that tyrants are tempted.'' And in the aftermath of 9/11, it was George  Bush and Dick Cheney who kept us safe, who knew we could not win this  war on defense, who understood we had to have a military strong and  capable enough to deny terrorists the safe havens from which they plot  and plan and launch attacks against our fellow citizens.   Mr. Speaker, now it is our turn. Across the globe, our adversaries  challenge us, from China to North Korea, to Iran, to Russia; across the  Middle East, in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Thirty-four years ago,  Ronald Reagan described our duty at another time, against another  enemy, this way:         It is up to us in our time to choose, and choose wisely,       between the hard but necessary task of preserving peace and       freedom, and the temptation to ignore our duty and blindly       hope for the best while the enemies of freedom grow stronger       day by day.    Mr. Speaker, we can no longer ignore our duty while our enemies grow  stronger. We must take the first step today to begin rebuilding our  military. H.R. 1301 is that first step. It increases defense spending,  provides a full pay raise for our servicemen and -women, and begins to  address our readiness shortfalls. This bill provides funds based on our  military's priorities for fiscal year 2017 and gets us off the cycle of  continuing resolutions, which are doing real damage to our readiness  and capacity.   Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow for consideration of  H.R. 1301, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the vice chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What is incomprehensible to me is that our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle seem so fundamentally confused about what the actual  issue before us today is. The issue before us today is whether or not  this House is going to undertake its fundamental, most important, most  sacred obligation under our Constitution and provide for the defense of  this Nation.   Now, they can choose to dedicate their time to another very important  topic. It is a hugely important topic and one that we will have many  days to debate and discuss on this floor. Unlike under the previous  leadership, Speaker Pelosi, our leadership, Speaker Ryan, has not told  us we have to pass the bill before we know what is in it.   Today, the issue before us in this House is whether or not we are  going to provide for the defense of this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would say that not knowing what they are talking about is something  with which our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are quite  familiar. Accounts of public input really bear little  [[Page H1609]]  relationship to what actually happened when ObamaCare itself was  drafted in the dark of night.   Imagine what it must be like if you are tuning in to this  conversation and this discussion thinking that the U.S. House of  Representatives is taking up the rule to debate, discuss, and pass our  FY17 Defense Appropriations. Instead, what we are hearing is a list of  when bills were posted online--a list--which, as I said, bears little  reality to what actually happened when ObamaCare was passed.   Now, those are hugely important issues. I am incredibly proud of the  job we are doing as Republicans in this body to help save a collapsing  healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, I think there is no higher duty and obligation we have  than to ensure that our military is second to none. No matter what kind  of a job we do, as important as that is to repeal and replace  ObamaCare, if we fail to address this fundamental issue and fail to  provide the resources our military needs, nothing else we do in this  body matters.   I believe, frankly, that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  owe our men and women in uniform, they owe the policymakers at the  Pentagon, they owe those people who are serving this Nation the respect  of talking about the resources they need to do their job and focusing  on the true issue before us today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We on this side of the aisle are more than happy to talk about health  care. We are more than happy to talk about the really crucial work that  is underway to rescue our healthcare system from the collapse and the  train wreck of ObamaCare, which my colleague's party put into place in  the dark of night with no reading of the bill.   We are thrilled actually that our bill is 120 pages and that it is  readable and that it is available online right now. So when he leaves  the floor, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Massachusetts can go read  the bill.   It is also not surprising that our colleagues do not want to talk  about our national defense because the record of the last 8 years, the  record of the last President is unparalleled in American history. The  mess that we are having to clean up with respect to our healthcare  system is matched perhaps only--and maybe even exceeded--by the damage  that was done to our military and to our national security under the  last administration.   We think, on this side of the aisle, that it is crucially important  that we do our job when the time is now to debate, discuss, and vote on  this bill and address this topic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Taylor).                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. GALLAGHER).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. McSally).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1301 is the first step we must take in rebuilding our military.  It is only a first step. We must also repeal the Budget Control Act and  end sequestration if we are going to truly address our shortfalls. We  must return to a rational budgeting process at the Pentagon, where  spending is based upon defending the defeating threats to this Nation,  not arbitrary and devastating across-the-board cuts.   Mr. Speaker, nearly 70 years ago, President Harry Truman addressed  this body about the growing Soviet threat to Eastern Europe. He said:  ``There are times in world history when it is far wiser to act than to  hesitate. There is some risk in action. There always is. But there is  far more risk in failure to act.''   President Truman continued: ``We must be prepared to pay the price  for peace or, assuredly, we shall pay the price for war.''   Today, Mr. Speaker, I urge that we begin to pay the price for peace.  I urge support for the rule and for the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 174 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 2. In rule XXI add the following new clause:        13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a bill or       joint resolution proposing to repeal or amend the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the       Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of       2010 (PL 111-152), or part thereof, in the House, in the       Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, or in       the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means,       unless an easily searchable electronic estimate and       comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional       Budget Office is made available on a publicly available       website of the House.        (b) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraph (a).                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
