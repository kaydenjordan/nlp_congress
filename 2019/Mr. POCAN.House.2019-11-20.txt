 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for all the  work that he has done on behalf of his constituents, the people of  Chicago, and really the people of the entire country.   I know this is the gentleman's second event today alone on behalf of  workers, and I thank the gentleman for his outspoken representation on  behalf of people who need a voice in Congress. I think we heard earlier  tonight there are about 200-plus lawyers in this body. A majority of  Congress are millionaires. Not to say that if you are a millionaire,  you can't empathize with working people, but it is another thing to  come from a background like I do.    I had a union specialty printing shop, a small shop for nearly three  decades, a member of International Union of Painters and Allied Trades,  IUPAT, for nearly three decades.   I can tell you the benefits that have happened for my family and the  people I work with by having good, union-supporting wages and good,  union-supporting benefits and why that matters so much.   The problem we have right now in this country and the problem that we  have across so many States is an organized effort going after working  people by going after their ability to have a voice in their workplaces  by having unions. We have watched attacks across the country, including  in my home State of Wisconsin, where States have gone to a so-called  right-to-work law. What that is often referred to as a ``right-to-work- for-less'' law because when you get these laws often, on average,  people lose over 3 percent in pay in States that do this. But we have  watched those laws happen across the country.   Federally, under the Trump administration, we have watched laws that  make it harder for working people who win the legal right to form a  union, through a union election. They run into all kinds of stumbling  blocks. All too often, there is no legal recourse against an employer  who violates the rules or stacks the deck against people and doesn't  allow that vote to actually form that union.   That is the real problem that we are facing. That is what we are  talking about tonight with the PRO Act. That is what we are trying to  address in Congress.   What I think is so very important to raise is the reason people want  to have a union is because it will help not only their family but their  communities by lifting up everyone. When you have a union job, you are  more likely to get more pay and better benefits than people who are not  in union jobs.   That is why the public support is so strong right now for unions with  64 percent support for unions, one of the highest percents we have seen  in this country. And 67 percent of people 18 to 34, millennials, even  more than the population as a whole, see this as a way to have a voice  in their workplace.                                time  1945    Here are some of the things they support: expanding union rights,  banning right-to-work-for-less laws, ensuring a first contract for new  unions--if you  [[Page H9116]]  vote for a union, you should be able to get a contract for your union-- making so-called independent contractors employees, and protections for  workers on strike.   All of those things I just mentioned are included in the PRO Act. All  those things could be possible for workers across the country.   We know that when we have had the least amount of income inequality  in our country, back in the 1950s, is when we had the greatest  representation of people in unions. Now that we have got one of the  smallest amounts of people--about 11 percent, nationwide, in public and  private employee unions--we have the greatest gap in income that we  have had in this country.   There is no surprise there is a lot of pushback from not only people  on the other side of the aisle, but from the United States Chamber of  Commerce, which is not your local business in your chamber of commerce,  but it is the big businesses in this country that don't want to take  care of their workers. Instead, they want to send all the profits up to  their shareholders, so very few get a lot and everyone else gets the  crumbs that are left over.   Just to give you an idea of some of the actions we see by these  companies: 75 percent of private-sector employers hire outside  consultants to run antiunion campaigns when workers try to form a  union; 63 percent force their employees to attend closed-door meetings  to hear antiunion propaganda; and over half of employers threaten  workers in these meetings, they threaten their jobs.   You have a one-in-five chance, if you are a union organizer, of  losing your job because, right now, you can get away with it with this  administration and how they enforce our labor laws.   But here is the reality. If you don't have a union in your company  right now, this is what you get when you have a union:   Health insurance: 75 percent of people in a union participate in job- provided health insurance versus about 48 percent nationwide;   Pensions: 70 percent of people versus 13 percent nationwide;   Paid sick leave: 91 percent of people who are in a union have paid  sick leave, and the median weekly earnings are $207 more a week. That  is $11,000 a year more if you are a member of a union, in a similar  job, than if you are not.   That is the real reason we see the attacks on working people trying  to have a voice in their workplaces, and that is why we see people not  trying to lift this bill.   This is so important that, in this Congress, we take this bill up in  the House of Representatives and we pass this bill and we give,  finally, an edge to help push a little more assistance to workers who  want to have a say in the workplace than what employers have had  because of this administration, because of States that have passed bad  laws, that make it harder, again, to have a say in your workplace.   This is an important piece of legislation. The Congressional  Progressive Caucus has made this issue a priority. We are going to make  sure there will be a vote this session in Congress. We are going to try  to make the Senate take this up as well.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Chicago. His help on this and  so many issues has been so very important. We are going to do  everything we can to get this done this session.
