 Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the gentleman a couple of  questions, but I want to preface my questions by saying I think that  this is a terrible lost opportunity for serious, bipartisan legislation  to address the problem of eminent domain abuse that has been taking  place across the country and has been for several decades. I recommend  to everybody a report of the Cato Institute by David Boaz, which  summarizes what is taking place around the country.   One of the worst perpetrators of eminent domain abuse in the country  is a business developer named Donald Trump. In the mid-1990s, he built  the casino and the hotel in Atlantic City, but he wanted to evict a  woman named Vera Coking, who was exactly in the same position as Mrs.  Kelo would be in a decade later.   She had lived in this Victorian house at the end of the boardwalk in  Atlantic City for several decades, but Donald Trump wanted to build a  VIP limo parking lot to go with the existing hotel. He offered her some  money and she said: No, thank you. My family has lived in this house  for a long time. We want to stay here. Our kids go to school here.   He offered her a little bit more money and she said: No, it's not for  sale. We are going to stay here.    So they created something called the Casino Reinvestment Development  Authority, controlled by, essentially, the Trump Corporation, but they  got the city to do it, and they tried to force her out. Luckily, the  Cato Institute and some libertarian lawyers defended her rights.   But the legislation that is being brought forward today by the  Republicans now on a totally partisan basis would do nothing for people  in the situation of Mrs. Coking or Mrs. Kelo, because it doesn't give  them any rights to sue. All it says is we are going to cut off money to  government agencies.   It would be like saying: Well, in a case like that, we will cut off  money to every city and town in New Jersey, not just Atlantic City, but  to Newark, New Jersey, and to Freehold, New Jersey. We are going to cut  off money all over the State.   It has got nothing to do with the actual problem. It doesn't help the  people who are actually suffering under the problem of eminent domain  abuse.   If we want to help them, let's give them a Federal right of action;  or, if all you can do is cut off Federal money, cut off the particular  city that is involved, but not every city or county that is receiving  money under a Federal program.   Mr. Nadler made a point which I thought was really interesting, which  is that this is a solution that doesn't address the problem. If we want  to save people from getting evicted from their homes under the Kelo  decision, which President Trump applauded and said he supports 100  percent, but if we want to save people from policies under the Kelo  decision, shouldn't we give them rights rather than make some kind of  Federal subsidy decision which is of constitutional question, in any  event?    I yield to the gentleman from New York.    Reclaiming my time, rather than giving actual rights to  people in the position of Mrs. Kelo or Mrs. Coking, who is going to be  forced out of her house in Atlantic City, this, instead, places a very  broad burden on the government and in such a way that it, I think,  renders the whole legislation constitutionally suspect.   Mr. Speaker, don't we have constitutional decisions that say the  government or Congress can't go so far as to punish an entire State  government for something that one municipality does? Doesn't it seem  like it is sort of going nuclear in order to get a mosquito?   I yield to the gentleman from New York.                                time  1600     Isn't that what the Medicaid decision was all about?    Doesn't it also say that we can't threaten to drive you  out of the Medicaid program entirely because you refuse to accept one  particular program that we want to impose upon you?    Not only is this legislation completely illusory in terms  of not really helping people who have the problem, but it might just be  struck down.   Mr. Speaker, how can you cut off the people of Newark, New Jersey, or  Freehold, New Jersey, because of something that happens in Atlantic  City, New Jersey? It doesn't even help the people in Atlantic City, New  Jersey, who are facing the problem with the big real estate developer  who has bought up all the political power to try to drive somebody out  of their home.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4100, the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association  Charter Amendments Act of 2017, provides the Federal Bar Association,  FBA, with the organizational flexibility it needs to fully meet its  contemporary mission, and I support it.   The original 1954 charter created a framework that has effectively  served FBA for the last six decades. During these years, the Foundation  has strengthened Federal jurisprudence, advanced legal education, and  promoted effective legal practice.   The organization's initiatives have also directly improved the lives  of our people. For example, one of its community outreach programs, the  Wills for Veterans Initiative, is a pro bono project where FBA chapters  provide will drafting and signing services for veterans in their  communities. I know a number of my constituents who participate have  very much enjoyed working on this project. Another initiative  establishes a mentorship program for law school students to work with  experienced attorneys.   The current FBA charter must be amended to allow the organization  greater flexibility of operation and growth. For example, the existing  charter codifies strict membership and governance requirements that  constrain member development and nimble governance of the organization.  This rigidity presents serious challenges as the organization seeks to  expand its critical charitable and educational initiatives.   H.R. 4100 makes technical fixes to the FBA charter that will give the  FBA the needed flexibility. For instance, in the place of legislatively  fixed membership criteria, it permits the FBA to proactively establish  and update membership criteria through the bylaws process. Similar  provisions authorize enhanced flexibility in the composition and duties  of the members of the board of directors.   In general, this measure would enable the FBA to swiftly meet its  organizational needs and overcome the challenges of the times.   I want to note, for the Record, that while the language of the bill's  proposed nondiscrimination provision prohibits discrimination on the  basis of, among other things, sex and sexual orientation, it does not  explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity, as  most of the new antidiscrimination legislation does.   While the prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex already  covers gender identity discrimination, the FBA's current diversity  statement expressly states that the FBA should not exclude persons  based on gender identity.    In light of this, and because it should be made clear that everyone  is protected against invidious discrimination, I hope that when the  Senate takes up our measure, it will explicitly clarify that this  language includes protection against discrimination on the basis of  gender identity. I know that Congressman Cicilline of Rhode Island  wants to address this point as well.  [[Page H6620]]    I believe that H.R. 4100 will help the FBA to flourish for many  decades to come. I strongly support this bill. I look forward to the  FBA's continued positive involvement in our Nation's legal system, and  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, given that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals  has determined that title VII sex discrimination includes  discrimination against people based on their gender identity, it seems  somewhat petty and churlish to exclude those words from the language of  this charter. I hope that this will be corrected when the legislation  goes through. Otherwise, I consider this a very fine bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   S. 2245, the Knowledgeable Innovators and Worthy Investors Act, or  KIWI Act, is bipartisan legislation to allow citizens of New Zealand to  participate, along with the people of more than 80 other countries, in  the E-1 and E-2 visa programs for treaty traders and treaty investors,  so long as New Zealand provides the same reciprocal treatment to  citizens of the United States.   I favor this commonsense bill that will facilitate trade by making it  easier for New Zealanders to invest here and will lead to the creation  of new jobs in the United States.   The E-1 treaty trader program provides temporary visas to employees  of firms engaged in substantial trade with our country. The E-2 treaty  investor program provides temporary visas to foreign investors who make  substantial investments in American enterprise.   These visas help increase trade with and direct investments in the  U.S. More than 80 countries already participate in the programs,  including almost all of our democratic allies and trading partners. Yet  New Zealand, one our closest and dearest allies, is not on the list.   There are already many New Zealand companies in the U.S., just as  there are many of our companies in New Zealand. In 2016, our two  countries engaged in approximately $12 billion of bilateral trade in  goods and services; and the U.S. is already the second most popular  destination for New Zealand foreign investment, accounting for 17  percent of all foreign investment by New Zealanders in 2016, for a  total of $3.2 billion dollars.   Bringing New Zealand into the E-1 and E-2 programs will increase  trade and bilateral investment flows, helping both of our countries  accelerate economic growth and job creation.   While so much of our foreign policy is consumed today with dangerous  and counterproductive trade wars against our allies, which is harmful  to our farmers, especially our soybean, corn, and livestock farmers, I  am glad that this bill will actually strengthen ties with one of  America's closest and most steadfast allies.   Congratulations are in order for Senator Hirono, who championed this  bill in the Senate, where it passed last month by unanimous consent. I  also congratulate my Judiciary colleague, Darrell Issa, who authored  the companion bill in the House. They both deserve credit for  identifying this deficiency in our immigration laws and working across  the aisle to craft a smart solution that has gained broad support in  the body for adoption. Our country will be more prosperous and so,  presumably, will be New Zealand as a result of their efforts.   I also want to thank Chairman Goodlatte and Chairwoman Ileana Ros- Lehtinen of the Foreign Affairs Committee for their support and work on  behalf of this important legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support S. 2245, the KIWI Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
