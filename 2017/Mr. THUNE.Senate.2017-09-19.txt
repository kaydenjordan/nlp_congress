 Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of  my Commerce, Science, and Transportation committee intern Alison  Cheperdak. Alison hails from Hopkinton, MA, and is in her third year at  George Washington University Law School.   While interning on the Commerce Committee, Alison assisted the  Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security. She  is a dedicated worker who was committed to getting the most out of her  internship. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Alison for  all of the fine work she did for the committee and wish her continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________
