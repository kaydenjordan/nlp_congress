 Mr. Speaker, recently, I spent time listening to  farmers, large manufacturers, and leaders of smaller companies in my  district express their frustrations on how tariffs are affecting their  bottom line.   I visited a steel fabrication company, an architectural aluminum  design company, and a brewery. Although these companies vary in  product, they all shared one common fear: wondering what would be their  fate in the presence of these ill-advised tariffs.   I listened to farmers offer feedback on how they are affected.  Agriculture is one of Missouri's top industries, bringing in about $88  billion a year. Most farmers tell me that the recently announced USDA  payments are helpful, but that, ultimately, in their words, ``we want  trade, not aid.''   I met with local chambers of commerce and business councils, and, for  those I didn't even have a chance to visit, I created a survey on my  website. What I learned is this: These tariffs are deeply damaging to  these businesses in ways that those who promoted them perhaps never  even contemplated.   Hundreds of thousands of jobs may be in jeopardy because of these  tariffs. For example, Harley-Davidson, a company that I was able to  bring to Kansas City during my term as mayor, suddenly announced that  they were closing the plant and moving overseas. They left nearly 1,000  workers unemployed overnight. Now, just imagine, if you multiply that  around the country, what kind of instability has been created.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that this administration will recognize that  these tariffs are unstable to the community and then move to end this  trade war today.                            ____________________
