 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5439) to provide for a single point of contact at the  Internal Revenue Service for the taxpayers who are victims of tax- related identity theft, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5439         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR TAX-RELATED IDENTITY                     THEFT VICTIMS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury (or the       Secretary's delegate) shall establish and implement       procedures to ensure that any taxpayer whose return has been       delayed or otherwise adversely affected due to tax-related       identity theft has a single point of contact at the Internal       Revenue Service throughout the processing of the taxpayer's       case. The single point of contact shall track the taxpayer's       case to completion and coordinate with other Internal Revenue       Service employees to resolve case issues as quickly as       possible.        (b) Single Point of Contact.--        (1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a), the single       point of contact shall consist of a team or subset of       specially trained employees who--        (A) have the ability to work across functions to resolve       the issues involved in the taxpayer's case, and        (B) shall be accountable for handling the case until its       resolution.        (2) Team or subset.--The employees included within the team       or subset described in paragraph (1) may change as required       to meet the needs of the Internal Revenue Service, provided       that procedures have been established to--        (A) ensure continuity of records and case history, and        (B) notify the taxpayer when appropriate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5439, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that modernizing the IRS' ability to  administer our Tax Code is a critical next step following the passage  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am pleased that today we are  considering H.R. 5439, which creates a single point of contact at the  IRS for identity theft victims.   I introduced this legislation with my good friend, Representative   John Lewis. He and I have worked tirelessly over the last few years to  protect the identity of taxpayers, having introduced legislation that  has passed the House and was signed into law in 2015 that took steps to  help reduce identity theft.   I was proud to reintroduce with him this Congress the Stolen Identity  Refund Fraud Prevention Act that has nearly 20 bipartisan cosponsors  and which included the provision that we are considering today.   Identity theft has become a growing concern in Ohio and across the  United States. Unfortunately, it seems as if there is now constant news  of individuals having their identities stolen due to massive data  breaches. It is one of the most costly crimes to consumers and  businesses, and it is the fastest growing white-collar crime in America  according to the Federal Trade Commission.   As many of my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee have heard,  I, myself, was also the victim of identity theft not too long ago. I  understand the frustration, fear, and sense of helplessness that many  feel when learning that a criminal has stolen their identity.   In 2016, a criminal stole my personal information and filed a return  with my name, my wife's name, our Social Security numbers, and other  personal information. The thieves even had a W-2 from the U.S. Congress  that contained a fake version of my information. I didn't learn about  this fraud until I received an IRS notice questioning a return I had  filed--even though I had not yet filed.   Each year, thousands of families trying to resolve this same sort of  headache have to prove to the Federal Government that they are who they  say they are. That included me, right along with everyone else,  creating this tremendous call volume the IRS receives on a given day. I  had to go through that same process.   People thought: Wow, you had to go through the same process trying to  get through to the IRS?   I said: Yes, I did. I had to reexplain my story every time I called.   This commonsense legislation will simply require the IRS to establish  a single point of contact at the IRS for taxpayers who have been  impacted by identity theft. This will help everyday Americans who have  had to deal with the stress and inconvenience of having their identity  stolen get the service they deserve from the IRS.   I thank Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and the Ways and Means  Committee staff for moving this legislation forward, and I encourage my  colleagues to support its final passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this commonsense legislation is a strong step forward in  ensuring that the American people receive the customer service that  they  [[Page H3371]]  deserve from the IRS should they have their identity stolen.   Along with my personal story, I have heard from countless  constituents and Ohioans who have been frustrated by the hoops that  they often need to jump through to get their identity theft concerns  addressed, all the while dealing with the fear and anxiety of having  their identity stolen. This bipartisan legislation will provide relief  by requiring a single point of contact within the IRS for victims of  identity theft.   Again, I want to thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) for his  support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
