 Madam President, our country is sickened and outraged  by the senseless evil that struck Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, TX,  only yesterday. According to early reports from authorities, it appears  that a deranged young man tried to murder his own grandmother, then  crashed his car, and then ran into an elementary school and began  killing.   At least 19 young children and 2 teachers were murdered--murdered-- for no apparent reason at all. These innocent kids were simply going to  school. They put on their backpacks, said goodbye to their parents, and  headed off for another day of learning and friendship. There were only  2 days left before summer break. And because of this maniac, at least  19 of these kids never made it home.   One of the victims was a 10-year-old girl whose father described her  as ``full of life, a jokester, always smiling.'' A 10-year-old boy who  loved sports and art had just received his honor roll certificate a few  hours earlier. His mother says he was thrilled--thrilled--about moving  up into middle school next year.   It is literally sickening--sickening--to consider the innocent young  lives that were stolen by this pointless, senseless brutality; to  consider the parents and families who sat waiting at the civic center,  waiting to either be reunited with their son or their daughter or to  learn they never would be.   The investigation is still underway. The authorities will continue to  learn exactly what happened and how. In the meantime, we are also  praying for the Border Patrol officer who, according to reports, was  wounded after he responded to the scene, and for all the law  enforcement, paramedics, and first responders whose dedication  yesterday saved lives.   Most of all, the entire Nation's hearts are broken for the victims  and for their families. Words simply fail.   Yesterday, the Uvalde school superintendent said:         We're a small community [and] we're going to need your       prayers to get us through this.    We pray fervently that in the midst of this nightmare of grief, our  Heavenly Father will make manifest to  [[Page S2678]]  those families his promise in Psalm 34 that ``the Lord is near to the  brokenhearted.''                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, gas prices have set new alltime  record highs every day for more than 2 weeks. Overall inflation is the  worst it has been in more than 40 years. And the Biden administration  is preparing to follow their botched Afghanistan retreat with a  disastrous nuclear deal that would help Iran and hurt America.   But this week, the Senate Democrat majority is not taking action on  any of those things; the Senate is instead spending the week cramming  more far-left bureaucrats into the executive branch, where they will  keep making these problems even worse.   Later today, Senate Democrats want to confirm as Assistant  Administrator for EPA someone who has previously researched the  environmental impact of football tailgating and concluding it would be  best for the environment if the authorities--listen to this--banned  charcoal grills and gas generators. This is no joke. Dr. Christopher  Frey literally coauthored a research paper that argued that ``the most  environmentally responsible policy would be . . . a universal ban on  idling, charcoal grills, and old generators''--just the nominee the  American people need confirmed by Memorial Day weekend.   So, honestly, where do they find these people? The same nominee wrote  in defense of the illegal, job-killing so-called Clean Power Plan. As a  past chairman of the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, he  worked to politicize its work from outside.   Things aren't going any better at the committee level. This morning,  the HELP Committee deadlocked on the nomination of Kalpana Kotagal,  whom President Biden wants to put on the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission. Ms. Kotagal is a liberal plaintiff's lawyer who is best  known for rewriting Hollywood legal contracts to push movie casting  toward racial quotas, gender quotas, and sexual orientation quotas. The  President has found the one person in America who thinks liberal  Hollywood is not woke enough.   The nominee also has a record of hostility to American energy. She  has been both an official spokeswoman and a registered lobbyist for a  far-left group that wants to eliminate fossil fuels. She is on the  board of another organization that has frivolously sued the State of  West Virginia over energy issues.   The American people know Washington Democrats' policies hurt working  families. They have seen that in our colleagues' legislation. And it is  more of the same when it comes to the nominees they are picking to  design and carry out their tsunami of regulations.
