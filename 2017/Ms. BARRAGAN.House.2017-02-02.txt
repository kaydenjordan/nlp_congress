 Mr. Speaker, last Saturday night, I was at Los Angeles  International Airport. I went out to show unity and stand with those  that stand against this ban. I think it is wrong. I think it is  unconstitutional and unAmerican. But what I saw there was startling.   I want to tell you the story of Fatema. Fatema is a legal permanent  resident. She got a notice in the mail that she was about to be sworn  in to become a U.S. citizen on February 13. She was traveling with her  1-year-old son who is an American citizen. She was the victim and was  being detained. Reports from lawyers on the ground were that she was  being pressured to sign away her right to be a legal permanent resident  right after they had sent somebody back, a student, who had a visa to  be here.                                time  1715    I was there, along with one of my colleagues, Judy Chu, fighting,  trying to get to the detainee to make sure that she had access to an  attorney. I asked to go to CBC, the Customs and Border Protection.  Conveniently, they were shut down. They had closed the office.   So I asked somebody: Can you walk me down to the arrivals so I could  talk to somebody?   They wouldn't do it. I got a telephone number. I called. None of my  questions were answered. They wouldn't answer a single question: Were  any of my constituents being detained? Could I get a lawyer to  somebody?   They wouldn't even say yes or no. All I was told was I had to call  this Washington, D.C., number--a 202 number. Now, it was Saturday  night. It was 7 p.m. on the Pacific Coast.   I called. I left a message, asking for a return call. I didn't get  one. I demanded, with my colleague, that we get a briefing privately,  behind closed doors, outside the press. We didn't get one.   As a matter of fact, when I called back, I asked: Who is your  manager? Who are you answering to?   She said: The President.   Oh. You have talked to Donald Trump?   It was really disturbing. And then she hung up on me--and I am a  Member of the United States Congress. I couldn't get any answers to try  to protect the very constituents that we fight for, the constituents  whom we represent. It was very disturbing.   These immigration orders are unsettling, but they are also a  disservice to the Customs and Border Protection when you don't give a  heads-up, when you don't have a warning on how things are going to be  carried out. This led to mass confusion not just at LAX, but at  airports across the country.   I hear often that this affected just a small number of travelers, but  it affected a lot more than that. We saw the  [[Page H925]]  masses of people coming out. We saw lawyers who had to go down there  and give their time. A shout-out to the ACLU and to the attorneys at  public counsel and to so many other attorneys who went down there and  gave their evenings, their time, and who have been standing up and  fighting for people in court to get people to come back.   Just today, at Los Angeles International Airport, there was a press  conference held to welcome back the one person who was allowed to come  back--an Iranian citizen who was deported and sent back, who was  forcibly removed on Friday night even though he had a legal right to be  here. Hopefully we are going to hear more of these stories, but it  shouldn't be that way. People should not show up at the airport and get  on a flight in a country in which they have a right to be just to have  to turn around and be sent back after being detained for hours on end.  This isn't right.   As a Member of Congress, I will work to ensure that the Federal  Government obeys the Constitution, respects our history as a nation of  immigrants, and does not unlawfully target anyone because of one's  national origin or faith.
