 Mr. Chairman, will the Senator yield?    Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I am  here as living proof that he is not the Lone Ranger on this. The  committee has worked diligently. We may not be as passionate as he is,  but the committee has worked diligently to get higher education done.   It is a farce to come in here and think that we are going to pass a  2-year House bill to fund historically Black colleges. Nobody has more  historically Black colleges in their State than I do. What they want-- they want predictability, permanent funding. The chairman is willing to  do that, but part of the condition to do that is to sit down and, now,  quit talking and pass higher education. Reduce the FAFSA application to  one page. Let these students go out--and their parents--and be able to  fill this out and not miss an education because they can't go through  the laborious process.  [[Page S6648]]    What the chairman has laid on the table is reasonable. The committee  has talked about it for years. Now it is time to act. It is not time to  act on one little piece of it for temporary funding. It is time to  provide permanent funding for that and to do the rest of higher  education.   As proud as I am of our being the home of the majority of Black  colleges and universities, I also have about 70 other colleges and  universities in North Carolina, and they are the beneficiaries of  everything else that is in this education bill.   Compromise is not about ``Take what I have'' and not give anything  else. We have been trying to work, with the chairman and the ranking  member working together, to find compromise for 5 years. Many times the  chairman has come to me and said: I think we can do it this year. Well,  we have to have willing partners on the other side of the aisle. Today  is a live example of where it is either their way or no way.    I hope we can get back, and, before we leave this year, we can get  this package passed. It is really simple: Just commit to do what we all  have sat down and talked about for 5 years. If there are minor changes  that need to be made, let's make them in the next day or two. But to  say that we are going to wait until next year and be here a year from  now when that timeframe has run out, let me assure you, if the chairman  is not here to object to this request, I will be here to object to this  request.   The time to talk is over. The time to act is now.   I thank the chairman for yielding.    Madam President, Senator Thom Tillis and I would like to  recognize the distinguished service of a great North Carolinian. After  a 25-year career with the North Carolina Farm Bureau, Larry Wooten is  stepping aside as president at the end of this year. President Wooten  has been a steadfast advocate for agriculture and rural North Carolina.   Larry has worked tirelessly to advance initiatives that strengthen  and improve our State's rural communities. He is an exemplary servant  leader that has always encouraged others to ``give back'' to the  organizations, the communities, and the State that have provided them  with opportunities for growth and advancement. He is a founding member  of the NC Rural Economic Development Center where he served on the  board of directors and executive committee. He has also served with  distinction on the American Farm Bureau Board of Directors, the NC  Board of Agriculture, the Agricultural Consortium Board, and the Rural  Prosperity Task Force. He has served as chair of the American Farm  Bureau Foreign Trade Committee and on USDA's Agricultural Policy  Advisory Committee, APAC.   Most significant, however, is the impact Wooten has had on North  Carolina agriculture. In his role as president, he has been an  effective voice for agribusiness and farmers--educating leaders and  lawmakers about the State's largest economic sector and helping shape  sound State and national policy for its future. A lifelong farmer from  Pender County, North Carolina, Larry knows firsthand the positive  impact of a sound agricultural education, research, and extension of  that research onto his farm. Larry was a key influencer in the  inclusion of NC State University's Plant Sciences Building in North  Carolina's Connect NC Bond Referendum, as well as supporting the  university's efforts to create new paths for more rural students to  earn their NC State degree. Wooten, through his leadership of the Farm  Bureau, has been a tireless supporter of NC A&T State University's  Small Farms Initiative. All these efforts will create pathways for  North Carolinians to have an oversized positive impact on farming and  economic development in our state and nation.   Larry Wooten is a remarkable leader who put the wellbeing of our  state and its citizens above his own. It is through the work of  selfless leaders like Larry that North Carolina has become a state  where the weak have an opportunity to grow strong, and the strong can  grow great.                            ____________________
