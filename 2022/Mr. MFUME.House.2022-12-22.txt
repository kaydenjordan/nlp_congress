 Madam Speaker, I stand here in full support of the passage  of S. 1942, the National Heritage Area Act, which includes provisions  from my bill, the Baltimore National Heritage Area Act, and creates a  full reauthorization of the Baltimore National Heritage Area. The  Baltimore National Heritage Area stretches over a majority of  Maryland's 7th Congressional District, and includes important sites  such as the Basilica of the Assumption, Mt. Clare Station and  Roundhouse, and Edgar Allen Poe House. By reauthorizing this National  Heritage Area through 2037 and updating the Area's map, this bill will  secure federal support for Baltimore's most precious sites.   I grew up in Baltimore, amongst many of these historical sites, and I  am thrilled to have provided this federal support to help preserve and  celebrate the place I call home.   With reauthorization, federal support will continue to go towards  local agencies and nonprofits who preserve and promote Baltimore's  pivotal role in our nation's story and make strategic investments in  cultural heritage tourism projects.   The annual economic impact of the Baltimore National Heritage Area is  more than $750 million, 6,400 jobs and $61 million in state and tax  revenue. The Heritage Area has served more than 15,000 youth from  underserved communities and provides continuous operation and program  support to 35 historic museums, cultural attractions, and historic  neighborhoods through a competitive grant program. I would like to  thank Mr. Sarbanes and Mr. Ruppersberger of the Baltimore delegation  for helping me advocate for this reauthorization, and thank Senator  Cardin for introducing an identical reauthorization bill in the Senate.  I urge full passage of this bill.
