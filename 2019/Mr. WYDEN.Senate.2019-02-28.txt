 Mr. President, February marks the anniversary of the  massive, peaceful protests against Bahrain's repressive regime in 2011.  Bahraini citizens, men and women of all ages and backgrounds, demanded  more accountability from their leaders and more agency in their lives.   Instead of sitting down with the protestors as leaders in Oregon or  Washington, DC, often do, Bahrain's rulers unleashed the country's  security forces on them. I am afraid that it has now become a rather  sad tradition of mine to remind the Senate of these events, and so  before February gives way to March, I just wanted to offer a few words  on why this issue continues to resonate.   Bahrain held elections in November 2018, but they were hardly on the  level. ``The Economist'' termed them ``unfair.'' The head of Human  Rights First called them ``fake elections.'' The Project on Middle East  Democracy and Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain said  they were a ``sham.'' The list goes on.   This should come as no surprise to anybody paying attention to  development in Bahrain because the regime banned opposition parties  from participating altogether. That is not exactly a recipe for a free,  fair, or legitimate outcome.   Indeed, the regime has spent the past couple years detaining,  intimidating, and silencing the political opposition.   But don't take my word for it, that's how Amnesty International  characterized the situation before the November elections.   The repression extends far beyond the ballot box. Human rights  advocates say the regime has arbitrarily stripped hundreds of  individuals of their citizenship in the past few years.   Human Right Watch indicates that the regime closed the last remaining  independent newspaper in 2017. Freedom House says the regime continues  to bully journalists and to persecute those who are critical of the  regime.   Bahrain is a longtime U.S. ally in a tumultuous region. My intent  with these annual statements is neither to insult the Kingdom nor to  demand the administration cut ties.   No, the point of these statements is to make it clear that I believe  the United States should always promote basic rights and values and  further, that I believe the United States must--must--hold its friends  and partners to a higher moral standard.   I was concerned that the previous administration did not do more to  push Bahrain's rulers on this point, but I am deeply disappointed that  the Trump administration seems hell-bent on setting a new low.   The President himself has made clear that he views the world through  a transactional lens and is willing to overlook rights violations in  the name of arms sales or greater defense cooperation.   So it is hardly surprising to read that Trump administration  officials fail to raise human rights concerns with their Bahraini  counterparts.   This must change. I hope it will change. And I hope that the influx  of new members of Congress following the 2018 midterm elections will  cause it to change.   Today I renew my call on Bahrain's monarchy to stop brutally  repressing peaceful protest, to release political prisoners like  Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and Nabeel Rajab, and to offer Bahrainis a greater  voice in their country's future.                            ____________________
