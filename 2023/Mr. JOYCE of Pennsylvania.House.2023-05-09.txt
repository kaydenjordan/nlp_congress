 Mr. Speaker, since President Biden took  office and put a stop to the construction of a wall along our southern  border, more than 1.3 million illegal immigrants have entered our  country and avoided apprehension.   Now, as title 42 is set to expire, a mass of migrants from Central  America have formed at our points of entry from McAllen, Texas, to San  Diego, California. This represents both a security and a humanitarian  crisis, as resources are strained and migrants overwhelm our Border  Patrol agents, allowing more deadly drugs to continue to spill into our  great United States.   In March, fentanyl seizures increased by 25 percent just from the  prior month. We have seen the deadly toll that fentanyl-related  substances have on our communities. In the past 2 years, more than  14,000 pounds of this deadly drug have been seized, enough to kill  every man, woman, and child in America.   The problems on the border are widespread, and so far in 2023, 80  people whose names appear on the terrorist watch list have been  apprehended at our southern border. These statistics show the danger of  this administration's failed and negligent border policies.   Our Commitment to America means offering an alternative that, once  again, puts Pennsylvania families first. It is time to pass the Secure  the Border Act. It is time to end catch and release. It is time to  increase the number of Border Patrol agents. It is time to finally  complete construction of the border wall on our southern border.   What Americans need right now is a Nation that is safe, not more  hand-wringing from the Biden administration. The time is now to finally  protect our southern border.                            ____________________
