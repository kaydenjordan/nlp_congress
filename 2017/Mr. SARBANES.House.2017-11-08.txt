 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Republican tax  plan, a tax plan that is of, by, and for the wealthy and well  connected.   How do we know this?   Yesterday, a Republican Congressman told a Capitol Hill reporter:  ``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever call me  again.' ''   There you have it, a window into the true motivation for this bill.  It is a massive giveaway to the big donor class. It slashes the  corporate tax rate, guts the estate tax to benefit millionaires and  billionaires, and creates a new loophole so the superwealthy can  disguise their income.   What is worse, this Republican tax bill would be devastating for  millions of middle- and lower-income Americans. It attacks the State  and local tax deduction and the mortgage interest deduction. It  eliminates tax deductions for medical expenses and student debt. It  increases the deficit by approximately $1.5 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, Americans deserve a better deal.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the Hydropower Policy  Modernization Act of 2017 because it weakens States' rights to protect  their own water quality.   Under the Clean Water Act, States have the right to protect their  water by setting water quality conditions on hydropower licenses. This  bill would constrain that authority, forcing States to issue rushed  conditions using incomplete scientific data, or surrender their  authority to issue conditions at all. In short, the choice that States  have to protect their water and their people is to either do it poorly  or not at all.   We had a fix for this. We had an amendment to H.R. 3043, but it was  not made in order. It would have preserved the critical role States  play in protecting local water quality by exempting their rights under  the Clean Water Act from the bill.   For Marylanders in my State, this issue is bipartisan and hits close  to home. FERC is currently considering the relicensing of a  hydroelectric dam on the Susquehanna River. The Susquehanna provides 50  percent of all of the freshwater that reaches the Chesapeake Bay,  making it a critical driver of the Bay's water quality. Any new FERC  license will need to have conditions that protect the Susquehanna and  the Bay from the sediment and nutrient pollution built up behind the  dam. That is why even Republicans in our State, the secretary of the  environment, and secretary of natural resources sent a letter urging  Congress to strike the provisions in this bill that would limit  Maryland's ability to set water quality conditions.   I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  in this body, who so often remark on the importance of protecting  States' rights from usurping Federal agencies, have refused to protect  States by bringing this critical amendment to the floor.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3043.                                time  1415
