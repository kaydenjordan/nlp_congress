 Mr. Chairman, I would like to take a moment to thank  the chairman and the ranking member for their support of my  commonsense, bipartisan amendment that strengthens our commitment to  rural America.    The Essential Air Service is a critical link for residents and  businesses in small and rural communities by linking service to hub  airports in 36 States. EAS serves as an important economic tool in  local communities.   Page and Show Low, Arizona, in my district, are two communities that  benefit from EAS, which allows businesses there to access larger  markets and compete on a level playing field. My amendment simply  requires the comptroller general to analyze the impact any proposed  reforms to EAS it reports to Congress would have on the local  communities that depend on the program.   At a time when rural America is still recovering from economic  recession, we should be working together to revitalize communities and  create jobs. EAS is a vital resource in many of these communities  across America, and we must continue to protect it. I thank Congressman   Don Young for cosponsoring this amendment and being a stalwart  champion for EAS.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for including it in their en bloc  package.
