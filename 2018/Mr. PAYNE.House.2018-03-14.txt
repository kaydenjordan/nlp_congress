 Mr. Speaker, the NRA--the NRA--the NRA stands for ``No  Republican Action.''   It has been a month since 17 children and their teachers were gunned  down while at school in Parkland, Florida. It has been more than 5  years since 26 children and their teachers were slaughtered in Sandy  Hook.   In both of these instances, the same weapon was used: an AR-15  semiautomatic assault rifle.   And Congress still has taken no action to end gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, there have been more than three dozen moments of silence  related to gun violence since the Sandy Hook massacre. There have been  zero moments of action.   As those of us who are married or have children know, the silent  treatment doesn't work at home. Well, it surely isn't working in  Congress. There are dozens of reasonable gun safety bills pending in  this esteemed legislature, but the majority party is giving the  American people the silent treatment.   NRA: No Republican action.   Meanwhile, between the moments of silence, around 7,000 children have  been killed by guns since 2012.   NRA: No Republican action.   Let us take action on Mr. Cicilline's assault weapon ban to end the  flood of new semiautomatic assault weapons onto the streets.   Let us take action on Mr. Thompson's bill to strengthen the  background checks.   What is the problem with making sure that we check each person's  background? Does the NRA say that that is wrong, too?   There is no Republican action.   Let us take action on my Safer Neighborhoods Gun Buyback Act to  encourage people to safely, freely make the economic decision to self- disarm and dispose of most of their violent weapons.   Mr. Speaker, the NRA spends tens of millions of dollars in our  elections. I received a grade of F. It is the first F that I have ever  gotten that I was proud of.   What do the American people get?   They get no Republican action. Let us end the silence of inaction.                            ____________________
