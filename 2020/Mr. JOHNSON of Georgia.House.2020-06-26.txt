 Mr. Speaker, Article IV, Section 3.1,  provides that new States may be admitted by Congress into this Union.  There is absolutely no requirement for a constitutional amendment.   I was born and raised in Washington, D.C., spending my formative  years in this great domain, and I grew up knowing that my parents paid  taxes but had no voting representation in Congress.   It was paradoxical that I learned in school that the cries of  patriots, ``No taxation without representation,'' did not apply to the  people of this great domain.   We obeyed the same laws and paid the same taxes as our fellow  Americans, but we had no hope in taking part in the governance of  America.   I thank the Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton for keeping hope alive.   I am here today to say that it is time to end the legal  disenfranchisement of a population larger than the States of Vermont  and Wyoming. This vote is long overdue, and I intend to vote in favor  of D.C. statehood, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
