 Mr. President, today I am on the floor to talk about the  men and women in uniform, our police officers who protect us every day.  They are here in the Capitol protecting us in the Chamber. They are in  Ohio protecting the citizens of Ohio, and they do it every day. They  put their lives on the line for us in many cases.   This is National Police Week, a week when tens of thousands of police  officers come to Washington, DC. They come to the police memorial. It  has been a wonderful week because I had the opportunity to meet with  law enforcement officers from Ohio, today, yesterday, and the day  before. We have seen them on the streets. We have seen them in uniform.  Their opportunity to come here is to talk about the important issues  that relate to our law enforcement but also to pay tribute to their  fallen colleagues.   Sadly, Ohio has lost its share of officers recently. Officers who  have lost their lives in the line of duty include two so far this year  and four last year.   On February 2, Clermont County Detective Bill Brewer was shot and  killed after responding to a call from a suicidal man who was armed at  an apartment complex just east of Cincinnati, in Clermont County.  Detective Brewer served at the sheriff's department for 20 years, and  was widely respected.   The funeral was amazing. There was an overwhelming number of people.  Grateful citizens showed up and law enforcement from our entire region  and, in fact, law enforcement from even other States. At his service I  had the honor of presenting his widow and young son with a flag that  had flown over the U.S. Capitol, in honor of him and in gratitude to  his family.   On that day, County Sheriff Steve Leahy said of Detective Brewer:         He was an outstanding man. He was a good father, a good       husband, a good friend, a good employee. He's what this       country needs more of.    I agree with Sheriff Leahy.   On January 4, Colerain Township Police Officer Dale Woods was hit by  a vehicle while working at the scene of an automobile accident, and he  passed away 3 days later as a result of his injuries. Police Chief Mark  Denney remembered Woods as a hero who once saved a baby inside a hot  car and also ran into a burning building to save a blind woman. That is  the type of selfless and courageous officer he was. He represented the  best.   Last July, Cleveland Patrol Officer Vu Nguyen, a 25-year veteran of  the department, collapsed while taking part in police training  exercises. Vu was known as a people person, someone who cared a lot for  his fellow citizens and always went the extra mile to help anyone who  asked. His family said that was the reason he became a police officer,  because he wanted a job where he could help people. That is what police  officers do.   In June of last year, Mentor Police Officer Matthew Mazany was struck  and killed by a hit-and-run driver while assisting another officer  during a traffic stop. Officer Mazany had served with the Mentor Police  Department for 14 years. He was beloved by his fellow officers, by his  family and friends, and by his entire community.   This morning I had the opportunity to visit the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial, here in Washington, DC. I was able to  see the inscribed names on the wall there of thousands of law  enforcement officers we have lost over the years. If you haven't been  down there, it is a powerful experience.   There were also beautiful memorials set up around those walls with  wreaths, flowers, photographs, magazine articles, newspaper articles,  and other information about officers whom we lost in the last year,  including these two officers from Westerville, OH, who were  [[Page S2904]]  tragically murdered last year while serving their community and all of  us.   On February 10, 2018, Westerville Police Officers Anthony Morelli and  Eric Joering were fatally shot while responding to a 911 call. Sadly,  it was fatal. They had rushed to the scene. They had arrived to help.  They were under fire. Officer Joering was killed at the scene. Officer  Morelli died in surgery later that day.   I have had the great honor of meeting the families of both of these  fallen officers--amazing women and amazing kids. Linda Morelli and Jami  Joering are incredibly strong women and incredibly strong mothers. I  was able to express condolences and gratitude from all Ohioans for  their husbands' service.   The memorials I saw today were a moving tribute to those two police  officers, two fallen officers who served their fellow Ohioans with  honor. Soon their names will be inscribed on the police wall I talked  about at the memorial. Their names will be inscribed there for the ages  for all of us to see and so that we can all remember the ultimate  sacrifice they and other officers have made for us.   We continue to hold up their families and the families of the fallen.  We continue to hold them up in our prayers and to show our support and  express our enduring gratitude.
