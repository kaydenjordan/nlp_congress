 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 888 reaffirming the  State of Israel's right to exist.   I thank my good friend from New York, Mike Lawler, for introducing  this timely, extremely important, and ever-necessary resolution.   Mr. Speaker, Israel is the only state in the world whose fundamental  right to exist is openly denied by other states. Some of them,  including Iran, even call for Israel's complete destruction and support  transnational terrorist organizations to work toward its demise.   It is also the only state in the world whose fundamental right to  exist is constantly undermined and challenged by intergovernmental  organizations, such as and most shamefully of all, the United Nations.   The anti-Semitism motivating those who deny Israel's right to exist  is apparent, but it is important to connect, as this resolution does,  the denial of Israel's right to exist, to anti-Semitism, and to connect  them both as enabling causes to the monstrous crimes Hamas has  unleashed on Israel.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitic bigotry is at the root of  the U.N.'s hostility toward Israel, which is ugly, evil, and manifests  itself at almost every U.N. entity.   On November 8, I chaired a hearing of my subcommittee, and we called  it United Nations' Bigotry Towards Israel.   We heard expert testimony from Hillel Neuer, the executive director  of U.N. Watch; and Jonathan Schanzer, the senior vice president for  research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.   Hillel Neuer testified: ``Teachers and schools at the U.N. Relief and  Works Agency, which runs education and social services for  Palestinians, regularly call to murder Jews, and create teaching  materials that glorify terrorism, encourage martyrdom, demonize  Israelis, and incite anti-Semitism.''   He further said: ``In 2022 alone, UNRWA received $344 million in U.S.  funding. Yet, a March 2023 report by U.N. Watch and Impact-SE  identified 133 UNRWA educators and staff who were found to promote hate  and violence on social media, and an additional 82 teachers and other  staff affiliated with 30 UNRWA schools who were involved in drafting  and distributing hateful content to their students.''   That is just the tip of the iceberg.   Jonathan Schanzer testified that: ``The U.N. doesn't recognize Hamas  as a terrorist organization. Nor does it recognize Hezbollah either.  That means U.N. resources can be and regularly are provided to members  of those terrorist groups.''   Mr. Speaker, according to the great human rights defender, Nathan  Sharansky's famous 3-D test for anti-Semitism, which he articulated at  a hearing that I chaired way back in 2004, criticism of Israel is  nothing less than anti-Semitic when it passes over into the  demonization of Jews and Israel, delegitimizes the Jewish state, or  applies double standards; that is, one standard for Israel, and another  for every other country on Earth.   That is what many U.N. entities and agencies do every single day.   Yesterday, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, the JTA, reported on the  latest example of the double standard and said: ``Nearly 50 days after  Hamas' attack on Israel left 1,200 dead, and after weeks of criticism  over its silence about allegations of sexual violence during the  attack, the women's rights group, U.N. Women, issued a statement  condemning the terror group on Friday.   Then it deleted the post.''   Here is what it said originally:   `` `We condemn the brutal attack by Hamas on October 7 and continue  to call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages,'  read the initial statement posted on U.N. Women's Instagram page.   It was soon replaced with a statement that dropped the condemnation  of Hamas and only called for the release of hostages.''   Mr. Speaker, there are so many examples.   In 2022, the U.N. General Assembly targeted Israel in a total of 15  harshly critical resolutions, compared to 13 country-specific  resolutions for the entire world: China, North Korea, Iran; 13 for all  of them combined, 15 for Israel.   In large measure, it is because of the U.N., which unquestionably is  the world's foremost legitimizer of anti-Semitism, that it remains  necessary, 75 years after the founding of the great State of Israel, to  reaffirm its right to exist.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from New York, and  my friend from Florida, for authoring this important resolution.                                time  1815
