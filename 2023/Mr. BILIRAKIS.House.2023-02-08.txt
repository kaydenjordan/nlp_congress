 Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 185, which will lift the  CDC's burdensome mandates for international travelers into the United  States.   Frankly, I can't believe the mandate is still here, but I talk to my  constituents who have family that want to come to the United States,  international travelers, and they can't come because they don't want to  take the vaccine. That is their right.   We need to lift this. I thank my colleague, Mr. Massie, for his  leadership on this particular piece of legislation.   This past week, my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce  Committee have held hearings and markups focused on competitiveness  versus China, ensuring American companies lead the globe.   This morning, we also held a long-overdue Oversight Committee hearing  with the CDC, and I challenged them to think of the impacts their  mandates are having on the travel and tourism section.   The Biden administration's onerous vaccine mandates for workers,  citizens, and international travelers have been disastrous for our  economy and have done very little to mitigate public health concerns,  as my colleague stated.   Republicans have made it clear: We are tired of mandates and  overregulation. This legislation will remove these mandates so travel  can resume into the country and so we can make our Nation competitive  again on the international stage.   We have the Brand USA program that advertises our Nation's hidden  treasures. They are everywhere, but the travel sector hasn't been able  to be fully unleashed, thanks to the CDC. We know, historically, that  the industry in my home State of Florida--but it is not just my home  State--has accounted for more than $80 billion in revenue and 1\1/2\  million jobs annually.   Let's get our economy back on track. This makes so much sense, this  particular bill. Let's remove this ridiculous mandate.
