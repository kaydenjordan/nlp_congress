 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for his  leadership on this amendment and his words today. I will have more to  say about the amendment in a moment.   Mr. President, as Senator Sanders mentioned, his amendment that we  are working together on, amendment No. 1119, will do the following, and  it is right in the text of the purpose section of the amendment, to  provide additional resources to restore the $1 trillion in cuts to  Medicaid paid for by reducing the Republican tax breaks for the  wealthy. That is the quick summary of what we are working on.   I think it is also important to put this amendment in the context of  discussions we are having in the Senate and, I am sure, throughout the  country; that is, the tax proposal put forth by the administration as  well as the Republican leadership, the so-called unified tax proposal.  This is a Republican proposal that comes before the country. I think it  is essential to read both the tax proposal along with the budget we are  debating on the floor together.   There are a lot of ways to describe what the tax proposal is all  about. I will describe it very bluntly, in my own words. This tax  proposal is, for sure, a giveaway to the wealthy. The superrich do  quite well. Big corporations do very well. The middle class does not do  well at all at the end of the day.   Why do I say that? Because there have been a number of analyses done  of the proposal. Even the proposal, as it stands now, will have more  analyses done when the bill is actually introduced, but in terms of  what is on paper now, you have, for example, the Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities stating that by the year 2027--at the end of the 10  years--80 percent of the tax cut goes to the top 1 percent.   There is another analysis that is even more pointed in terms of the  year. You don't have to wait until 2027 to figure out what is happening  to the top 1 percent. Here is what the Tax Policy Center says with  regard to the tax benefit that accrues to the top 1 percent and also  what would accrue to the top 0.1 percent. The top 1 percent is roughly  those making above $730,000. The top 0.1 percent, of course, is even  higher. Here is what the Tax Policy Center said in September based upon  the proposals so far. Table 2 in the report says the following:  Starting in 2018--the assumption here is that the tax proposal as  currently crafted would happen this year. If it were to pass this year,  in 2018--the 2018 tax year--the top 1 percent would get a tax cut of  $146,470. That is the first year of the tax cut for the top 1 percent,  $146,000. How about the top 0.1 percent, a very small number of  extraordinarily wealthy Americans? They get $747,580--roughly, $747,000  in a tax cut. That is just in year one. We could provide more examples  year after year, but you get the picture that a lot of the tax cuts, if  there are any, will be shifted to the top 1 percent and the 0.1  percent.   When they do that, when they have a proposal that points in that  direction  [[Page S6514]]  in terms of the tax bill, what happens in the budget bill that is  related to that?   It is very simple. The budget bill will cut Medicaid, as Senator  Sanders referred to, by over $1 trillion. The exact number is $1.056  trillion over 10 years. Let's call it a $1 trillion cut to Medicaid  over 10 years. That is, basically, what it is. With regard to Medicare,  the cut is $473 billion in the budget. Now, the difference between the  two bills--or the two proposals, really--is that the budget proposal is  a bill. So we know the exact details there. The tax proposal has some  specificity, and some areas are not as specific, but the benefits to  the wealthy are rather specific.   The Republican plan is to use the proposed $1.5 trillion in cuts to  those two programs--when you add the $1 trillion cut to Medicaid to the  $473 billion cut to Medicare--to pay for the $1.5 trillion tax cut to  corporations. I think it is obscene to cut those programs and then use  those dollars for a corporate tax cut. Notice that nothing about that  is connected to the middle class and that nothing about that is focused  on folks who are trying to get into the middle class. It is really a  corporate tax cut that is paid for by cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.   I will limit my remarks today to Medicaid because that is what this  amendment is about. This amendment seeks to restore at least the  Medicaid cut of $1 trillion. So that is what we are focused on.   What is Medicaid? There are a lot of ways to describe it, but  Medicaid covers 40 percent of all of the children in the country. If  you are in Medicaid and you have the opportunity to take your child to  the doctor and get checkups and all of the benefits that you get from  Medicaid, you get to benefit from what is called early periodic  screening, diagnosis, and testing. So a child who might be from a low- income family--and is, in the case of Medicaid--not only gets coverage  but benefits from the early screening, early diagnosis, and early  testing. All of those benefits go to that child, and 40 percent of the  Nation's children are covered by Medicaid.   The other number to know, which is rather startling, is that 60  percent of all of the children in the country who have disabilities are  covered by Medicaid. Of course, that is not limited to children from  families who have lower incomes. You could have a family who has a  rather high income--a middle-class income or much higher than that--who  might have healthcare through the family's employer, but if the child  has a disability, especially a profound disability, the family relies  on Medicaid. So that is the program that we are talking about.   We know, as well, that Medicaid covers half of all of the births in  the country. There are millions of births every year that are covered  by Medicaid.   How about nursing homes? Medicaid pays for nursing home care for our  parents, our grandparents, and our family members. If that were not the  case, on average, you would see something on the order of $75,000 in  terms of annual expenses, which would force countless middle-class  families out of their homes and deplete their hard-earned savings. That  would be a big expense if it were not for the benefit of having  Medicaid in the context of one's long-term care in a nursing home.   In addition to paying for 45 percent of all of the births, the other  45 percent is that of school districts in the country that use Medicaid  funds to pay for medical and therapy services for kids in school who  are receiving special education. We could go on and on.   Let me make one other point.   I mentioned that 60 percent of children with disabilities are  covered. The Medicaid Program also makes it possible for millions of  people with disabilities, including adults, to live in their own  homes--to have the dignity, even having a disability, of staying in  their own homes. Medicaid also makes it possible for those with  disabilities to get to work and to be an active part of the workforce.  The program also helps to fund schools to be able to provide the  physical, occupational, and speech therapy services to students with  disabilities. For all of these reasons and more, what we seek to do  with this amendment is to restore the more than $1 trillion cut to  Medicaid.   We all have the opportunity in the Senate to receive letters from  constituents--sometimes handwritten, sometimes typewritten, sometimes  by way of email, or otherwise--who communicate to us about the issues  of the day. One of the most compelling letters that I have ever  received in the context of healthcare and, particularly, in the context  of Medicaid is from Pam Simpson. She is from Southeastern Pennsylvania.  Pam wrote to me and described in rather specific detail about the  challenges her son, Rowan, faces as a child with autism spectrum  disorder and what his life was like before Medicaid and what his life  was like after Medicaid. I will not dwell on the ``before.'' I will  focus on how his life has changed with Medicaid.   Pam tells me that in late January of 2016 she applied for medical  assistance for her son Rowan. She goes on to write about the wraparound  services that came from Medicaid after her son Rowan was enrolled,  which included a behavioral specialist consultant and a therapeutic  staff support worker to help her son Rowan. It reads that the  behavioral specialist evaluated Rowan while he was at daycare and ``put  a treatment plan together to help guide the therapeutic support, who  was then able to provide support to Rowan while he was at daycare. The  wrap-around services have been a Godsend.'' That is what we were told  in the letter from Pam Simpson.   I will conclude because I know that we are short on time.   Pam Simpson described the before and after. Then, in the letter, she  was pleading with me to make sure that I do not take any steps that  will cut Medicaid. She wrote about the adverse impact on her family  and, obviously, the adverse impact on her son Rowan, who is the  recipient of Medicaid.   In addition to reminding me about his circumstances and hers, she  concluded the letter in this way:         Please think of my 9 month old daughter, Luna, who smiles       and laughs at her brother daily; she will have to care for       Rowan later in her life after we are gone. Overall, we are       desperately in need of Rowan's Medicaid assistance and would       be devastated if we lost these benefits.    She is one mother from one family who is talking about the adverse  impact of there being cuts to Medicaid. I would urge my colleagues to  support this amendment to make sure that the $1 trillion that has been  taken away from the Medicaid Program is restored in this budget bill  that we are debating today.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Michelle Rozo  of my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of today's  proceedings.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
