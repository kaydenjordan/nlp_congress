 Mr. President, this is a very popular piece of  legislation. As the Senator from California pointed out, the Senate has  unanimously passed this on two previous occasions, so hopefully this  third time is the charm.   What it does is unlocks COVID-19 relief money that States and local  jurisdictions have that they no longer need for that purpose, but it  allows them now more flexibility to spend it on infrastructure and  disaster relief and the like. The best part about it is, it doesn't add  one penny to the debt.   We would ask for a voice vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All those in favor?   The majority leader.
