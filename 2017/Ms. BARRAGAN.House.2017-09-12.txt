 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3284, the Joint  Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, in a crisis like the attacks of September 11, 2001, our  Nation's first responders--police officers, firefighters, and emergency  medical personnel--take on enormous responsibilities. They contain the  situation, care for the injured, and keep people safe while putting  their own lives at risk. These weighty responsibilities are central in  terrorism-related crises.   Today there is an appreciation of the importance of the whole-of- Nation response where efforts among diverse stakeholders, including  nontraditional first responders, are well coordinated and thoroughly  planned.   The Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop Series is a program  where one-day events are hosted across the country that bring people  together who play a critical role in keeping their city's residents  safe during a terrorist attack. The multicity series is a collaborative  effort among Federal, State, local and private sector entities that  empowers cities to provide the best response to an organized,  coordinated, and multisite terrorist attack.   One of these workshops was conducted in Los Angeles, near my  district. I represent the Port of Los Angeles--America's port. It  touches every congressional district and faces a variety of threats  that require coordinated preparation and response from Federal, State,  and local agencies.   Enactment of H.R. 3284, the Joint Counterterrorism Awareness Workshop  Series Act, would codify this important program in law. Specifically,  H.R. 3284 requires the FEMA Administrator, in consultation with the  Directors of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, to establish a Joint Counterterrorism Workshop  Series.   Importantly, this bill requires that, at the conclusion of each  event, the FEMA Administrator, in consultation with the NCTC and FBI  Directors and officials from the participant city hosting the workshop  series, provide all participants with an after-action report that  includes key findings about lessons learned and best practices from the  event, and potential mitigation strategies and resources to address  gaps identified during the event.   I strongly support this counterterrorism training program, and I  believe that Congress should show its support for the program by  enacting this legislation. I urge my House colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3284 is an important piece of legislation that has  strong support on both sides of the aisle. It empowers officials and  individuals on the local level to come together to make their  communities more secure.   This workshop series helps address new, evolving terrorist threats.  It also enhances the ability of State and local jurisdictions to  prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from terror attacks  here in the homeland.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3284, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my friend's bill, H.R. 2453, the  DHS Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, 16 years ago, Americans were jarred by the spectacle of  the mighty Twin Towers collapsing and fires at the Pentagon and in a  Pennsylvania field. The perpetrators of the attacks sought to bring the  United States to its knees. While, without question, a deep wound that  may never fully heal was inflicted on the heart of this Nation on that  day, we remain strong and resolute.   We emerged from that devastating experience more determined and with  lessons learned about the need for better information sharing,  interoperability, and coordination.   One major reform was the establishment of the Department of Homeland  Security as a multimission agency, which today has 240,000 men and  women serving in a range of capacities at our land, air, and seaports,  as well as in the field, working to protect critical infrastructure  from cyber and other attacks.   The DHS Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program Act seeks to  provide DHS employees with the opportunity to do a rotational  assignment within the DHS' Intelligence and Analysis division.   By establishing this program, officers and analysts across the DHS  who have a passion for keeping our Nation secure would be provided the  opportunity to develop or broaden their intelligence and  counterterrorism skills. Organizations with such programs find that  they yield benefits far beyond what the individuals who participate  learn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation.                                time  1230    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2453 was overwhelmingly approved by the Committee  on Homeland Security. The rotational program that it authorizes has the  potential to not only provide some dedicated DHS employees a boost in  morale and fresh perspective on the mission, but also to enrich DHS'  contributions to the intelligence enterprise.   Mr. Speaker, as such, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2453,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2427, Pathways to Improving  Homeland Security at the Local Level Act.   Sixteen years ago, the terrorist attacks of September 11 brought home  the reality that terrorism prevention and preparedness is a shared  Federal, State, and local responsibility.  [[Page H7237]]    Today, the Department of Homeland Security's training catalog is a  primary resource for State and local jurisdictions to find  opportunities to enhance their counterterrorism and preparedness  capabilities. H.R. 2427 seeks to ensure that, going forward, this vital  resource remains available to the first responder community.   Specifically, H.R. 2427 directs DHS' Office for State and Local Law  Enforcement to produce and distribute an annual catalog of DHS'  training, programs, and services for State, local, and tribal law  enforcement.   Further, to ensure that this information is shared throughout the law  enforcement community, the Pathways to Improving Homeland Security at  the Local Level Act requires this comprehensive catalog be posted on  the DHS website, as well as on the Homeland Security Information  Network.   My district is home to the Coast Guard, DHS personnel, and officials  from the Port of Los Angeles, who all have to work together to prepare  and respond to threats. This bill would provide the information they  need to work together and get the necessary training.   This measure, which was introduced by my Democratic colleague on the  Homeland Security Committee, Representative Val Demings, highlights the  importance of equipping law enforcement with necessary tools so that  they can quickly adapt and discover new ways to evolve with the current  terrorist threat landscape.   Enactment of this bill will further strengthen the Department's  partnership with State and local law enforcement to help protect the  homeland.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2427 is an important piece of legislation that has  strong support on both sides of the aisle.   Consideration of this measure today is particularly timely, as this  week we remember those who sacrificed their lives and ran toward danger  during the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. We owe it to their  memory and to the men and women that today stand on the front lines to  ensure that they have access to the training and tools they need to  keep their communities secure.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2427, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2470, the Homeland Threat  Assessment Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, since the attacks of September 11, 2001, which claimed  the lives of over 3,000 innocent people, the terrorist threat has  metastasized and is decentralized. That was how then-DHS Secretary John  Kelly described it in April. He went on to warn that ``the risk is as  threatening today as it was that September morning almost 16 years  ago.''   Whereas, in 2001, there was a centralized, well-funded terrorist  organization planning and carrying out major attacks, today the  landscape is a patchwork of small cells and lone wolves eager to  embrace violence in furtherance of their terrorist ideology.   Today, we consider H.R. 2470 a bill that requires DHS to conduct an  assessment of the terrorist threat to the homeland on an annual basis.  The factors to be considered include: data on terrorist incidents and  activity in the U.S.; current and potential future terrorist tactics;  cyber threats, particularly those to critical infrastructure and  Federal IT networks; threats to surface and aviation transportation;  and the efficacy of foreign terrorist propaganda.   In my district, these threats are an everyday reality for the Port of  Los Angeles, which has the largest container volume in the country and  faces threats to their shipping, cybersecurity, and infrastructure.  This bill will help DHS assess those threats and provide the right  response after an incident.   We learned from the September 11 attacks about the importance of  recognizing and analyzing the ever-evolving terrorist threat landscape.  This annual assessment will ensure that DHS comprehensively examines  all forms of terrorism and extremism that could damage the homeland  today so that, as a nation, we can be vigilant.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to again express my support for this  bill and highlight a particular provision that seeks to strengthen  interagency collaboration on examining the threat.   The provision requires DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis to  continue working with fusion centers, which are the focal points for  sharing threat-related information between Federal, State, local, and  private sector partners.   DHS must continue to address and improve the Nation's fusion centers'  capabilities in gathering, analyzing, and sharing threat-related  information between partners on every level.   I thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers) for sponsoring this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
