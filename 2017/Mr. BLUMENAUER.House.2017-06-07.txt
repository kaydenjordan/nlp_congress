 Mr. Speaker, May 26 was a dark moment in my  community, as a hateful tirade toward two young women, evidently based  on their race and faith, led to tragedy.   In the face of this menacing behavior, three brave Portlanders  intervened to protect these young women. Two lost their lives, another  had his throat slashed. They were Ricky Best, Taliesin Myrddin Namkai- Meche, and Micah David-Cole Fletcher. Micah  [[Page H4688]]  David-Cole Fletcher survived the ordeal, still expressing hope and  compassion.   That dark moment and bright example of courage and compassion has  prompted soul-searching in my community. There has been a tremendous  outpouring of support and a commitment to help the vulnerable. We all  think about whether we would have had that courage.   Who knows what might have happened to those two young women if those  courageous people had not intervened. Based on what happened, it is  highly likely that they would have been physically assaulted, injured,  or worse.   We think this is a wake-up call for all of us to protect the  vulnerable, to resist intolerance, and to condemn behaviors and  language that would incite violent behavior. We all have a stake in  this so that we don't have more victims and that these three brave  people's sacrifice was not in vain.   I respectfully request the Chamber observe a moment of silence.
