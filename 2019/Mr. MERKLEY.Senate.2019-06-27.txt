 Madam President, our Founders recognize that no decision  carries more consequences than the decision of whether to go to war.  They were well familiar with the carnage of human lives and blood,  injuries, and treasure that our initial war, the War of Independence,  brought.   As we stand here several hundred years later, we recognize the wars  in between; that more than 400,000 Americans died in World War II, that  more than 50,000 Americans died in the Vietnam war, and that more than  4,000 Americans died in the war in Iraq. Those are just some  indications of the enormous impacts and consequences of a decision to  go to war.   It was an issue that the Founders struggled with in a republic: Where  should this immense power rest? Should it rest with one individual--the  President--or are the consequences too great to have the judgment of a  single person carry the decision to its completion?   After intense debate, after many arguments, the Founders became very  clear that this power should never rest in the hands of a single  person; that it should not just be one body but two bodies--the House  and the Senate--that should weigh in on the issue of war. The  consequences being so profound, they could not leave it to the  idiosyncrasies or the biases or the misjudgment of a single individual.   It was in fact one of the defining arguments about the difference  between a King and a President. A King could make that decision, with  often horrific consequences for the people of the kingdom, but not in  the United States of America. This is why it is so deeply embedded in  our Constitution. In Article I, section 8, under the enumerated powers  of Congress, are simply the words ``to declare war.'' That power is  vested in Congress, not the President.   The Founders weighed in time and again about this. Turning to James  Madison, the father of the Constitution, he commented:         The constitution supposes, what the History of all       Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of       power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has       accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to       the Legislature.    He went on:         The power to declare war, including the power of judging       the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the       legislature.    Madison continues:         The executive has no right, in any case, to decide the       question, whether there is or not cause for declaring war.    He was the father of our Constitution. That led to this document that  vests the power to declare war with Congress, not the President.   George Washington, the father of our Nation, said: ``The constitution  vests  [[Page S4594]]  the power of declaring war in Congress; therefore no offensive  expedition of importance can be undertaken until they shall have  deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a measure.''   This was the Commander in Chief speaking. This was the hero of the  American Revolution speaking. This was the man most trusted to be the  first President of the United States, who was to steer the course and  make sure the Presidency did not become a kingship. And his conclusion?  ``[T]herefore, no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken  until after they shall have . . . authorized such a measure.''   This is enormously at odds with the vision our colleague from  Arkansas presented on the floor--dismissing the role of Congress,  dismissing the Constitution, and instead saying let the President, as  Commander in Chief, do what he will. That was not the vision.   George Mason of Virginia--if you stand in DC, you can look across the  Potomac River, and you can see a monument to George Mason. He made  notes of the Constitutional Convention. George Mason remarked that he  was ``against giving the power of war to the executive'' because the  President ``is not safely to be trusted with it.'' That was the point,  that no one individual, no matter how wise--not even a George  Washington--could be trusted with this decision. George Washington, as  President, agreed with this completely, that despite his expertise as a  Commander in Chief, it was not to be the judgment of one person.   Thomas Jefferson, one of the most brilliant minds our country has  ever produced, commented: ``We have already given in example''-- referring to the Constitution--``one effectual check to the dog of war  by transferring the power of letting him''--the dog of war--``loose  from the Executive to the Legislative.'' So he is commenting on the  Constitution and saying: We have put a check on the dog of war by  putting that power in the legislative body, not the executive.   Jefferson became President. Did he change his mind when he became  President? His initial quote I gave you was from 1789, but later he  became President of the United States. And what did he think then? He  thought the same exact thing, just as President Washington had.  Jefferson said: ``Considering that Congress alone is constitutionally  invested with the power of changing our condition from peace to war, I  have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force in any  degree which could be avoided''--his message to Congress in 1805.   He recognized what the Constitution did. Are we going to recognize  the constitutional vision? Now, there may be folks in this Chamber who  simply disagree with the Founders and say that Congress is too  complicated, that the power to declare war and the power to go to war  should be vested solely in the Commander in Chief. Well, then, come and  present a constitutional amendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate. You  took an oath to the Constitution of the United States, and that oath  says that power rests in this body.   If you want to change the Constitution, then, have the guts to come  down here and propose doing so. I guarantee it will be roundly defeated  because the wisdom of our Founders that it is a mistake to give the  power of war to one person is wise and does stand the test of time.   Alexander Hamilton noted the following:         The Congress shall have the power to declare war; the plain       meaning of which is, that it is the peculiar and exclusive       duty of Congress, when the Nation is at peace, to change that       state into a state of war. . . .    Alexander Hamilton said: ``exclusive duty of Congress'' and ``the  plain meaning'' of our Constitution.   This viewpoint continued to carry the day far into the future.  Abraham Lincoln was speaking in 1848, and he said:         The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making       powers to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the       following reasons.    Those are Lincoln's words.         Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their       people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the       good of the people was the object. This, our [Constitutional]       Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly       oppressions and they resolved to so frame the Constitution       that no one man should hold the power of bringing this       oppression upon us.    In the words of these great leaders of America--Washington, Hamilton,  Mason, President Lincoln--all point to the power and wisdom of putting  the decision about war with the House and the Senate, not the  President.   Now, this resolution before us says: Mr. President, there is no  foregoing authorization to go to war against Iran. It says: Any  authorization has to come after debate specifically on that topic.   And why is this? Because we have heard from the administration that  they want to use the 2001 authorization for the use of military force,  an authorization specifically about al-Qaida in Afghanistan, to  authorize war with Iran. Nothing could be more convoluted, and that is  why we need to stand up and say: That is wrong. That is not right.   Anyone who pays even just a modicum of attention knows that the  resolution to take on al-Qaida in Afghanistan is very different than  going to war against the Shiite Islam nation of Iran. But we have to  say it because the administration has been trying to prepare the case  saying this 2001 resolution somehow has a link that authorizes war.   And why are we so concerned at this moment? Why are we here on the  floor in this debate? Well, it is because the drums of war are beating  loudly. It is because the President has deployed the Abraham Lincoln  carrier strike force to the Gulf to threaten Iran. It is because the  President has preplaced a squadron of B-52 bombers to be ready to bomb  Iran. Why are we so concerned--when we have a National Security Advisor  who has said that no agreement can ever be reached with Iran and we  have to bomb them and when we have a Secretary of State who says that  no one has ever stood up to Iran and we have to teach them a lesson, or  words to that effect, and we have a President who has proceeded to say  that any attack will be met by great and overwhelming force?   So envision these preplaced forces. And, in fact, the President has  declared that a section of the Iranian military, the Revolutionary  Guard is a terrorist force. Add all of that up, and the President is  talking about looking for a trigger to apply great and overwhelming  force. That is why we are here. A response in proportion to defend a  direct attack on the United States is authorized by the War Powers Act.  That is honored by the resolution that is before us, the Udall-Paul- Kaine amendment that is before us. That is honored. But as for the use  of great and overwhelming force the President is threatening, that is  war. That has to come before this body.   The President went on and said: ``In some areas, overwhelming will  mean obliteration.'' So for any attack? And we have heard the Secretary  of State say if there is a Shiite force in Iraq that we can tie to  Shiites in Iran and some communication, we will consider that an attack  by Iran--looking for a trigger to go to war. And the President has said  any act will be met with overwhelming force.   Not under our Constitution. You want that authority? You come here.  You want to change the Constitution? Then, come here. I say this to my  fellow Senators: Do you want to change the Constitution? Bring your  amendment to the floor of the Senate to change the Constitution.   The Constitution speaks clearly. The President has no authority to  apply overwhelming force or obliterating force and conduct a war  against Iran. Make your case here or honor the Constitution.   We are in a troubling and difficult time, and I would like to see  every Member of the Senate down here talking to each other about this.  That is the gravity of the consequences. It is not a few Members who  are here to stand up for our Constitution and the vision of wisdom in  our Constitution. This is the time, before there is that trigger in  which the President responds with great and overwhelming force and  before he responds with obliterating force. Now is the time to pass  this amendment put together in a bipartisan fashion that lays out the  fundamental requirements of our Constitution and the fundamental  requirements embraced by the Founders and the fundamental requirements  repeated and honored by the greatest Presidents who have ever served  our Nation.  [[Page S4595]]    Let us not allow the vision of our Constitution to be shredded. Let  us honor our responsibility when we took an oath in office to defend  it, and let us honor the wisdom of holding that debate on the floor,  should the President ever ask us for such authorization to go to war  against Iran.   I yield the floor.
