 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 575) expressing  the sense of the House of Representatives that all stakeholders in the  deployment of 5G communications infrastructure should carefully  consider and adhere to the recommendations of ``The Prague Proposals'',  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 575         Whereas 5G, the next generation (5th generation) in       wireless technology, promises the next evolution of       communications and information technology services,       applications, and capabilities across every sector of       business, government, entertainment, and communications;        Whereas the United States, Europe, China, and others are       racing toward 5G adoption and upgrading existing networks,       which will drive subsequent advances in artificial       intelligence, machine learning, smart homes, smart cities,       robotics, autonomous vehicles, and quantum computers;        Whereas 5G will make possible the automatization of       everyday activities and the use of the full potential of the       Internet of Things;        Whereas these developments, while evolutionary, could       include risks to important public interests, including       privacy, data security, public safety, and national security;        Whereas in a highly connected world, disruption of the       integrity, confidentiality, or availability of communications       or even the disruption of the communications service itself       can seriously hamper everyday life, societal functions, the       economy, and national security;        Whereas the security of 5G networks is crucial for national       security, economic security, and other United States national       interests and global stability;        Whereas operators of communications infrastructure depend       on a complex supply chain of technology from a global market       of suppliers and service providers;        Whereas government security officials and experts from 32       countries came together in Prague in May of 2019 to work out       guidelines for the deployment and security of 5G networks;        Whereas representatives agreed that ``[m]ajor security       risks emanate from the cross-border complexities of an       increasingly global supply chain which provides [information       and communications technology] equipment. These risks should       be considered as part of the risk assessment based on       relevant information and should seek to prevent proliferation       of compromised devices and the use of malicious code and       functions.''; and        Whereas the Prague 5G Security Conference adopted security       recommendations, which have come to be known as ``The Prague       Proposals'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved,       SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.         The House of Representatives--        (1) urges all stakeholders in the deployment of 5G       communications infrastructure to carefully consider adherence       to the recommendations of ``The Prague Proposals'' (as       described in section 2) as they procure products and services       across their supply chain; and        (2) encourages the President and Federal agencies to       promote global trade and security policies that are       consistent with ``The Prague Proposals'' and urge our allies       to embrace the recommendations of ``The Prague Proposals''       for their 5G infrastructure.       SEC. 2. PRAGUE PROPOSALS.         The text of ``The Prague Proposals'' is as follows:        (1) ``Policy''.--        (A) ``Communication networks and services should be       designed with resilience and security in mind. They should be       built and maintained using international, open, consensus-      based standards and risk-informed cybersecurity best       practices. Clear globally interoperable cyber security       guidance that would support cyber security products and       services in increasing resilience of all stakeholders should       be promoted.''.        (B) ``Every country is free, in accordance with       international law, to set its own national security and law       enforcement requirements, which should respect privacy and       adhere to laws protecting information from improper       collection and misuse.''.        (C) ``Laws and policies governing networks and connectivity       services should be guided by the principles of transparency       and equitability, taking into account the global economy and       interoperable rules, with sufficient oversight and respect       for the rule of law.''.  [[Page H42]]         (D) ``The overall risk of influence on a supplier by a       third country should be taken into account, notably in       relation to its model of governance, the absence of       cooperation agreements on security, or similar arrangements,       such as adequacy decisions, as regards data protection, or       whether this country is a party to multilateral,       international or bilateral agreements on cybersecurity, the       fight against cybercrime, or data protection.''.        (2) ``Technology''.--        (A) ``Stakeholders should regularly conduct vulnerability       assessments and risk mitigation within all components and       network systems, prior to product release and during system       operation, and promote a culture of find/fix/patch to       mitigate identified vulnerabilities and rapidly deploy fixes       or patches.''.        (B) ``Risk assessments of supplier's products should take       into account all relevant factors, including applicable legal       environment and other aspects of supplier's ecosystem, as       these factors may be relevant to stakeholders' efforts to       maintain the highest possible level of cyber security.''.        (C) ``When building up resilience and security, it should       be taken into consideration that malicious cyber activities       do not always require the exploitation of a technical       vulnerability, e.g. in the event of insider attack.''.        (D) ``In order to increase the benefits of global       communication, States should adopt policies to enable       efficient and secure network data flows.''.        (E) ``Stakeholders should take into consideration       technological changes accompanying 5G networks roll out, e.g.       use of edge computing and software defined network/network       function virtualization, and its impact on overall security       of communication channels.''.        (F) ``Customer--whether the government, operator, or       manufacturer--must be able to be informed about the origin       and pedigree of components and software that affect the       security level of the product or service, according to state       of art and relevant commercial and technical practices,       including transparency of maintenance, updates, and       remediation of the products and services.''.        (3) ``Economy''.--        (A) ``A diverse and vibrant communications equipment market       and supply chain are essential for security and economic       resilience.''.        (B) ``Robust investment in research and development       benefits the global economy and technological advancement and       is a way to potentially increase diversity of technological       solutions with positive effects on security of communication       networks.''.        (C) ``Communication networks and network services should be       financed openly and transparently using standard best       practices in procurement, investment, and contracting.''.        (D) ``State-sponsored incentives, subsidies, or financing       of 5G communication networks and service providers should       respect principles of fairness, be commercially reasonable,       conducted openly and transparently, based on open market       competitive principles, while taking into account trade       obligations.''.        (E) ``Effective oversight on key financial and investment       instruments influencing telecommunication network development       is critical.''.        (F) ``Communication networks and network service providers       should have transparent ownership, partnerships, and       corporate governance structures.''.        (4) ``Security, privacy, and resilience''.--        (A) ``All stakeholders including industry should work       together to promote security and resilience of national       critical infrastructure networks, systems, and connected       devices.''.        (B) ``Sharing experience and best practices, including       assistance, as appropriate, with mitigation, investigation,       response, and recovery from network attacks, compromises, or       disruptions should be promoted.''.        (C) ``Security and risk assessments of vendors and network       technologies should take into account rule of law, security       environment, vendor malfeasance, and compliance with open,       interoperable, secure standards, and industry best practices       to promote a vibrant and robust cyber security supply of       products and services to deal with the rising challenges.''.        (D) ``Risk management framework in a manner that respects       data protection principles to ensure privacy of citizens       using network equipment and services should be       implemented.''.     DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res.  575.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 575. This bipartisan  legislation was introduced by Mr. Flores and Mr. Soto, both of whom are  members of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee, which I  chair.   The bill before us expresses the sense of the House of  Representatives that all stakeholders in the deployment of 5G  communications infrastructure should carefully consider and adhere to  the recommendations adopted at the Prague 5G Security Conference in May  2019 known as the Prague Proposals.   These proposals serve as a cybersecurity framework for the adoption  and deployment of 5G networks and were agreed upon last year in Prague  at a meeting of over 30 Western-allied nations, as well as technical  experts and equipment manufacturers. This framework acknowledges the  risks posed by untrusted 5G network equipment offered by Chinese  telecom providers such as Huawei.   The Prague Proposals form the basis for a coordinated approach to  shared security as we begin to transition to the next generation of  wireless network technologies.   The Communications and Technology Subcommittee has done extensive  work this Congress on security implications of 5G technologies. I thank  Mr. Flores and Mr. Soto for the good work they have done in bringing  this important legislation to the floor. I also thank the Committee on  Foreign Affairs and Chairman Engel for working with the Energy and  Commerce Committee to advance this legislation.   Madam Speaker, this is a good bill.

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2881, the Secure 5G and  Beyond Act, which directs the President to develop the Secure Next  Generation Mobile Communications Strategy in consultation with heads of  the FCC, NTIA, and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the  DNI and the Secretary of Defense. The bill then requires the  development of a strategy implementation plan to be carried out by  NTIA.   This bipartisan legislation was introduced by Ms. Spanberger and five  other House Members, including Mrs. Brooks of Indiana and Mr.  O'Halleran, both members of the Communications and Technology  Subcommittee, which I chair.   The Secure Next Generation Mobile Communications Strategy is intended  to:   First, ensure the security of 5G and future generations of mobile  telecommunications systems and infrastructure in the United States;   Second, assist our mutual defense treaty allies and strategic  partners in maximizing the security of 5G networks and infrastructure  and future generations of mobile telecommunications systems in their  countries; and   Finally, protect the competitiveness of U.S. companies, the privacy  of American consumers, and the integrity of standards-setting bodies  against political influence.   As our Nation works to deploy 5G wireless technologies and develop  next generation communications networks, we need a national strategy  that brings together an all-of-the-above government approach to  ensuring this critical infrastructure. We also need to work with our  strategic allies and international partners to ensure the security of  their communications networks as well.   Madam Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation. I applaud  Ms. Spanberger for introducing it. I urge all my colleagues to support  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield 2  minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran), a valuable  member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield 5  minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).  [[Page H46]]         DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   I want to recognize the good work the gentlewoman from Virginia has  done on this bill. A former CIA agent, and someone that knows a lot of  these issues inside and out, she has worked very hard, and brought us a  very good piece of legislation.   It is a good bill. I urge all my colleagues to support it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand  the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I move to  suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4500) to direct the Assistant  Secretary for Communications and Information to take certain actions to  enhance the representation of the United States and promote United  States leadership in communications standards-setting bodies, and for  other purposes, as amended.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4500.    DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4500, the Promoting United  States Wireless Leadership Act of 2019. This bipartisan legislation was  introduced by Mr. Walberg, Mrs. Dingell, and Mrs. Brooks.   The Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2019 directs  the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to  encourage participation by American companies and other stakeholders in  standards-setting bodies, such as the 3GPP and the IEEE, and to offer  technical assistance to those stakeholders that elect to participate in  the course of developing standards for 5G networks and future  generations of communications networks.   Other governments around the world are engaging in the standards- setting process for 5G and other advanced telecommunications  technologies. Countries such as China and Russia are doing so directly  and through companies that are closely allied with their governments.   This engagement is, at least in part, intended to skew the standards  for these next-generation technologies to favor their national  interests and their companies.   This legislation will give the stakeholders the ability to better  engage in policy choices that are being made today by these standard- setting bodies, and which will have far-reaching implications for the  development of 5G and other advanced communications technologies in the  future.   We want to ensure that the United States continues to lead the world  in advanced communications technologies and deployments and ensuring  that these standards meet the needs of the United States and our  partners. This is critical to that end.   I want to thank Mr. Walberg. I want to thank Mrs. Dingell and Mrs.  Brooks for the good work they have done in bringing this important  legislation to the floor.   I would also like to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs and  Chairman Engel for working with the Energy and Commerce Committee to  advance this legislation.   This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                    Washington, DC, January 3, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H.R. 4500, Promoting United States       Wireless Leadership Act of 2019, the Committee on Foreign       Affairs agrees to waive formal consideration of the bill as       to provisions that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs.        The Committee on Foreign Affairs takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any issues within our       jurisdiction.

Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, January 6, 2020.

I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees from your Committee to       any House-Senate conference on this legislation.        I will place our letters on H.R. 4500 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     DOYLE of Pennsylvania.
