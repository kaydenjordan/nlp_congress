 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding me time.   I am especially grateful that she has introduced the Uyghur Policy  Act, which is particularly timely given the mass spontaneous protests  we see arising in China.   It is particularly pertinent, given that the spark for the popular  demands for freedom was a horrific incident that occurred in Urumqi in  the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where due to Xi Jinping's  draconian zero-COVID lockdown policy, at least 10 people were burned to  death with many, many more injured.   The bill follows, I would point out, upon an amendment that I had  offered at the House Committee on Foreign Affairs markup on June 30,  2021, to the EGLE Act that called for the creation of a special envoy  for the Xinjiang region. Such focus is particularly necessary, given  the amount of repression directed by the Chinese Communist Party at the  Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim Central Asian people, including  the Kazakhs and the people from Kyrgyzstan.   Xi's genocide--and it is Xi Jinping's genocide; he is directly  responsible for this. We know that there are recordings of him saying,  ``show no mercy,'' as people are being dragged into concentration  camps, as my two previous colleagues pointed out. Forced abortion,  forced sterilization, and a whole host of human rights abuses are being  committed each and every day, right up to this very moment, and it  shows no signs of abatement.   In short, this bill is timely. I believe it is necessary, and I urge  my colleagues to give its strongest support.
