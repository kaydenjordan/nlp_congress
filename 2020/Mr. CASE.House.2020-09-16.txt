 Madam Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for  H.R. 4990, the Election Technology Research Act, of which I am a proud  cosponsor.   My return to Congress in 2019 was prompted in part by my membership  in Issue One's ReFormers Caucus, a nonpartisan group of more than 200  former Members of Congress, governors, ambassadors and cabinet members.  This committed Caucus, whose slogan is ``fix democracy first'', is  focused on a range of reforms essential to returning government to the  people.   Central to these reforms are much higher and broader participation in  our elections and enhanced faith in the validity of our election  results. Election security is in turn the critical foundation of  participation and faith. It should be and largely is a universal goal,  especially given continuing, emerging and expanding threats to our  election systems.   This bipartisan measure would help ensure that our elections are  secured by the most advanced and best voting technology. It authorizes  federal research to establish and maintain the highest standards  possible, and establishes a Center of Excellence in Election Systems to  regularly and thoroughly test the security and accessibility of voting  systems and certify voting system technology.   This measure passed our House Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology with unanimous support because the Committee recognized the  critical need for federal resources and leadership on this issue. It  also was endorsed by my Blue Dog Coalition because it advances our own  commitment to national security and accessible democracy.   I thank Congresswoman Sherrill for her leadership on this important  issue, and urge full House passage.
