 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the en bloc  amendment which includes an amendment I offered to increase funding for  the Environmental Protection Agency's Science Advisory Board to review  the strengthening transparency in regulatory science--or so-called  secret science--proposed rule and decrease funding for the EPA  Administrator's executive management account.   I thank Chair McCollum for her leadership in increasing funding for  the EPA's Science Advisory Board in the underlying bill.   As a cornerstone of its regulatory process, the EPA relies on peer- reviewed science. Unfortunately, the proposed strengthening  transparency in regulatory science rule would preclude the use of the  best available science. The rule undermines scientific integrity,  jeopardizes bedrock public health and environmental standards, and  endangers the EPA's ability to fulfill its mission. It would impede, if  not eradicate, the agency's work to protect Americans from significant  risks to human health and the environment.   Not surprisingly, the EPA ignored science when developing this  proposed rule. The EPA failed to consult with their own Office of the  Science Advisor, and they limited the Science Advisory Board in the  scope of the board's review.   The proposed rule would have chilling consequences for the EPA and  for every person who benefits from clean air and clean water. This  amendment will direct the Science Advisory Board to provide a  comprehensive review of the entire proposed rule before it is  finalized. We must defend science.   I, again, thank Chair McCollum and also Representatives Tonko,  Sherrill, and Fletcher for their support, and I urge the Congress to  support the en bloc amendment.
