 Mr. Speaker, today I stand here to honor and  thank the courageous servicemembers and veterans who have served and  protected this Nation.   I was appalled when the President, the Commander in Chief, referred  to them as ``losers'' and ``suckers.''   These brave men and women sacrificed for us, some giving their lives:   Veterans like my constituent JL Demps, Jr., a U.S. Army Specialist,  who at 18 was deployed and had to leave his wife and 2-month-old son;   Or Manuel Suarez Rodriguez, who was drafted out of high school to  serve in the Army's 2nd Infantry Division in Korea;   Or Gary Malfield, a Comms Officer, who served in Vietnam reviewing  heartbreaking messages on the status of Marines who were wounded or  killed.   Gary put it best by saying, ``Many of them lost their lives, but none  of them were losers.'' I couldn't agree more. They deserve better, Mr.  Speaker, and should never be disrespected the way this President did.                            ____________________
