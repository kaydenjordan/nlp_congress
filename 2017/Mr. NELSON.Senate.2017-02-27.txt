 Mr. President, I, too, support Wilbur Ross. I know him.  He lives in Palm Beach. I think he is a very good selection to be our  next Secretary of Commerce. He is certainly qualified to do this job.  He gave extensive answers during his confirmation hearing before the  Commerce Committee. He has accumulated significant experience in  dealing with the international business community, and he has detailed  to the committee--in our examination of him, he detailed many of his  ideas.   There have been some questions that have been raised about some of  his business ties, particularly involving some of his foreign  activities. One example is the Bank of Cyprus, which has significant  levels of Russian investment. In the wake of the former National  Security Advisor, General Flynn's resignation and under the overhanging  question of the unlawful Russian involvement in a U.S. election, I  certainly thought that it was prudent to get Mr. Ross's assurances on  this matter in his dealings with the Bank of Cyprus and certain  Russians who were involved in the Bank of Cyprus, so on February 16, I  sent him a letter, along with four other members of the Commerce  Committee, requesting information on any contact Russian investors in  the Bank of Cyprus may have with officials from the Trump campaign or  the Trump organization. I have spoken with Mr. Ross on at least two  occasions since sending him the letter, one of those being today. He  has verbally reiterated to me that he only had one meeting,  approximately an hour, with one of the bank's Russian investors and  that it occurred in 2014. The timing is important--2014--because that  was before the Presidential campaign. He also assured me that he knows  of no loans or interaction between the bank and anyone affiliated with  the Trump campaign or organization.   Mr. Ross has been forthcoming with me, and I believe him in what he  has told me, that it is true to his belief. But I want to say that at  the same  [[Page S1435]]  time, the White House and the way they have handled this matter is not  doing Wilbur Ross any favors. There are a number of Senators on the  Commerce Committee who are extremely troubled and frustrated that the  White House has chosen to sit on Mr. Ross's written response to the  questions I and other Senators have posed, and they have refused to  provide them to the Senate prior to tonight's vote. This is despite  repeated phone calls to the White House--repeated phone calls. It is  also despite repeated phone calls from me to Mr. Ross to ask him to get  the White House off the dime since he has told me he has already filled  out the answers in writing--they are just sitting in the White House.  So there is someone in the White House who is making the decision that  they don't want the Senate to have, in writing, what Mr. Ross has told  me verbally in a private conversation.   If that is any indication of the level of transparency Congress and  the American people can expect from this White House, then it appears  that there is going to be a lot left on the floor and there is going to  be the appearance of being in the dark on a lot of important matters.  That is not the way you do confirmations. You do it in a collaborative  fashion, especially when you have a good nominee like Wilbur Ross. The  President proposes, the Congress disposes. The President nominates, the  Congress confirms.   Not only is this lack of transparency unsettling, it is behavior that  everyone in this Senate should agree is unacceptable and should not be  tolerated. I do not want this to be taken out on Wilbur Ross because of  the administration's secretive behavior. Instead, as I said at the  outset, following my colleague, the chairman of the committee, I am  going to urge our colleagues to support his nomination, but the problem  is that Wilbur Ross is going to get fewer ``yes'' votes than if the  White House would release his written statements to all of those  Senators' questions.   As I said, I know Wilbur Ross. He is a good man. One of the reasons,  aside from this problem of communication with the White House, is that  Wilbur Ross brought forth candid answers about the work of the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. That agency, which is a  part of the Department of Commerce, impacts the daily lives of every  single American. NOAA provides the satellite data that is critical to  observing hurricanes and severe weather and everyday forecasts that we  have now come to rely on, that we pull up on our smartphones to find  out what the weather is going to be. Where do you think that comes  from? A lot of it comes from data from NOAA satellites.   Through the National Weather Service, NOAA provides the weather  forecasts that drive this economy, answering questions like whether a  farmer's crops are going to get rain today or warning of dangerous  tornadoes, particularly plaguing the State of the Presiding Officer. Of  course, we remember the ones that just devastated parts of Georgia and  Florida just a few weeks ago.   The National Ocean Service tells us if ships will have enough  clearance to get their cargo into a port on time because it often  depends on the tide as to how much depth there is with that heavy load  of cargo, if they can get in the channel.   NOAA also provides world-class science regarding atmospheric  conditions, including climate change and its impacts. My State of  Florida, the impacts of climate change--we are ground zero. It is not  unusual now that at seasonal monthly high tides, the streets of Miami  Beach are flooded, and city wellfields have now had to be moved further  to the west away from the Atlantic Ocean because of the rise of sea  level and therefore the saltwater intrusion into the freshwater  aquifer. Since 2006, Miami Beach has flooded significantly more often  than it used to. Rain-related flooding events in southeast Florida have  increased by 33 percent, and tide-related flooding has increased by a  whopping 400 percent. That is not good for business.   We simply cannot afford to deny what is happening. The impacts of  climate change are affecting Florida. They are also affecting a lot of  other places around the world, read: Bangladesh.   NOAA quite literally saves lives and property, so naturally I fully  expect any nominee for Secretary of Commerce to unequivocally support  the ability of the experts at NOAA to do what they do best: collect the  data, do the research, and provide critical products and services to  the public free from political interference and free from censorship.   The Department of Commerce has three Nobel laurate scientists who are  employees. While some of the nominees for other key administration  posts have either been less than forthright, less than committal, or  less than knowledgeable about the very real threat posed by climate  change, Wilbur Ross candidly and explicitly assured me during his  nomination hearing in our Commerce Committee that he believes--and I  will quote him--that ``science should be left to the scientists.'' I  urge his fellow Cabinet nominees to follow suit. Don't do what we have  seen--the intimidation techniques of saying that you can't use the term  ``climate change'' or ``sea level rise.'' Let the scientists do their  work. Wilbur Ross also assured me that he would work collaboratively  ``to address the impacts of changes in sea level and ocean temperatures  on coastal communities and fisheries.''    So I want to say to the Senate that I appreciate Wilbur Ross's  candor, his commitment, and his recognition that the important weather  and climate work being done in NOAA directly benefits commerce. I am  confident he is going to follow through.   I also want to thank him, at his age, for offering himself for public  service. This is a very schooled, experienced individual.   I hope this hiccup with the White House not being transparent and not  returning what he has already written as answers to the Senator's  questions--this problem--is going to disappear and, that rather than  hinder him, as they have, they will instead support him, as they  should.   For that reason, I am here to ask my colleagues to vote yes on Wilbur  Ross's nomination.   I yield the floor.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, creating jobs, fostering economic  growth, maintaining sustainable development, and improving standards of  living of all Americans are central tasks for any administration, and  they are the mission of the Commerce Department.   Congress created the Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903, and  then renamed the Department of Commerce in 1913 as the offices working  on labor were transferred to the Department of Labor. Through 12  bureaus and nearly 47,000 employees, the Department runs programs that  affect broad swaths of the American economy.   The Department includes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, which warns of dangerous weather, charts seas, and  protects ocean and coastal resources. The Department includes the  Patent and Trademark Office, which fosters technology and innovation,  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, headquartered  in Gaithersburg, MD, which promotes innovation and industrial  competitiveness. The Department includes the Census Bureau and Bureau  of Economic Analysis, which provide economic data to help business and  policymakers make intelligent decisions. The Department includes the  International Trade Administration, which ensures that Americans have  access to international markets and safeguards Americans from unfair  competition. And the Department includes the Economic Development  Administration to promote job growth in economically distressed  communities.   To run the Commerce Department, President Trump has nominated Wilbur  Ross, Jr., a 79-year-old private-equity billionaire with extensive  holdings and extensive potential conflicts of interest. I have real  questions about whether Mr. Ross is out of touch with ordinary  Americans. And I have real questions about whether Mr. Ross's personal  interests will conflict with his job as Commerce Secretary, if he is  confirmed.   The Commerce Secretary enforces our trade laws, including against  major trade competitors like China. Last year, Mr. Ross told Bloomberg  TV that he had extensive holdings in China. Mr. Ross said, ``We have-- various portfolio  [[Page S1436]]  companies have almost 20 factories doing one thing or another over  there.'' And the New York Times reported that Mr. Ross is vice chairman  of the Bank of Cyprus, making him a de facto business partner with  Viktor F. Vekselberg, one of Russia's most prominent businesspeople and  a person with ties to the Kremlin. Several newspapers have reported  that Mr. Ross plans to keep millions of dollars invested in offshore  entities whose values could be affected by policies that he implements  as Commerce Secretary. Mr. Ross reported plans to hold on to  investments in an oil-tanker company and 10 other entities that invest  in shipping and real estate financing, according to Federal financial- disclosure and ethics filings cited in the reports.   I have questions about Mr. Ross's ability to work for Americans.  Starting in the 1990s, Mr. Ross ran an investment firm that specialized  in distressed assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission said that  Mr. Ross's firm had failed to disclose how it calculates its fees for  some funds, which led to investors to pay roughly $10.4 million of  management fees that they should not have in the decade leading up to  2011.   The Commerce Secretary is a part of the President's economic team;  yet Mr. Ross appears all too willing to play fast and loose with fiscal  showdowns. When, in April 2011, Bloomberg's Mark Crumpton asked Mr.  Ross whether S&P's downgrade of America's credit rating is ``a step in  the right direction,'' Mr. Ross said it was. Ross said: ``Well I think  it's a step in the right direction in that it will put pressure on the  Democrats in the Senate and on the President to go along with some of  the Republican reviews about really cutting the budget deficit and  ultimately cutting the total indebtedness of the United States. So in  that limited sense I think it is a step in the right direction.''   Mr. Ross was all too quick to dismiss the strain that a furlough put  on Federal Government workers. In October 2013, CNBC's Betty Liu had  this exchange with Mr. Ross:         Ross: I think shutting down the government--so-called       shutting down the government, which it's not really shut       down--        Liu: What do you mean?        Ross: Well, many parts of it are still quite open. And it's       just at the fringe that it--that it really matters.        Liu: Yeah, but tell that to the government workers though       who are furloughed, right?        Ross: Yeah, but they're going to get their pay. They know       they'll get their back pay. So I don't see that that's a       permanent damage.    Mr. Ross was all too quick to dismiss the pain of homeowners who lost  their homes in the financial crisis. Bloomberg TV's Betty Liu had this  exchange with Mr. Ross:         Ross: I think you have to look far and wide to find a home       owner who's an actual victim. These are all theoretical       things. They're mostly technical problems that the banks did       wrong. To the best of my knowledge--        Liu: I think it'd be really hard to find, to pinpoint down       to individuals, right?        Ross: Well there's never been a case that I know of where       someone was dispossessed who didn't have a mortgage and       wasn't in default.        Liu: What do you mean?        Ross: Well all these claims that there was robo signing and       all these imperfections, that's true. Those were not what       should be. But the real question is was anyone actually       dispossessed wrongly.        Liu: Of their property.        Ross: Yeah, incorrectly. And I don't think you find a       single case.    The Commerce Secretary oversees the NOAA and the National Weather  Service. But in a conversation with Fox Business's Neil Cavuto, Mr.  Ross was dismissive of the reality of climate change. Mr. Ross said:  ``Well, I think unless the weatherman can tell me if it will rain  tomorrow why would I believe you can make a 100 year forecast. So, I'm  skeptical about the underlying basis.''   And so President Trump has nominated to be Commerce Secretary a  person who has so much wealth and so many foreign interests that it  appears that it will be difficult for him to work in the interests of  middle-class Americans. His extensive foreign business interests call  into question his ability to fight to enforce America's trade laws. Mr.  Ross has expressed cavalier attitudes toward economic brinksmanship and  shown little concern for the people laid off or who lose their homes as  a result. And Mr. Ross has expressed an open skepticism toward the  reality of climate change that calls into question his ability to run  the agency that does research into global climate. For these reasons, I  cannot support his nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of  the floor be granted to Harry Knight, a detailee from the Department of  Commerce, during the pendency of the first session of the 115th  Congress.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
