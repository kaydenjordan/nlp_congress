 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the State  champion football program at Blessed Trinity High School in Roswell,  Georgia.   Under the leadership of Head Coach Tim McFarlin, the Blessed Trinity  Titans finished with 13 wins and just 2 losses to earn their first ever  State football championship title this past season.   The 4A class in Georgia is a tough one, and I congratulate the other  teams in this bracket for their efforts as well. But with the  outstanding leadership and mentorship of Coach McFarlin, the Titans did  prevail.   Last week was also Catholic Schools Week. I had the pleasure of  visiting Blessed Trinity Catholic School. During my visit, I included  time with the AP government students, as well as with students in their  STEAM program, which focuses on science, technology, engineering, arts,  and math.   My thanks to Principal Brian Marks, and to all of the students and  the faculty there for a terrific visit and for being such a great part  of the community in the Sixth District.                            ____________________
