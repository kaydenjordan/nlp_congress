 Mr. Speaker, dozens of Americans are being detained in  foreign countries, and this has been brought to everybody's attention  by the latest deal in Russia. These families deserve answers from our  State Department about what is being done for their cases.   One of these folks is an east Tennessean, a marine named Matthew  Heath, who is being held in communist Venezuela. Right now, his family  is back in Tennessee, wondering when their boy will come home and what  will happen to him in the future.   Mr. Speaker, they deserve real answers from the State Department, not  just some bureaucratic nonsense. When it comes to cases like this, the  Federal Government needs to be totally transparent, at least with  folks' families.   On the poster beside me, you can see a picture of a mural placed here  in Washington, D.C., by artist Isaac Campbell. I spoke with Isaac this  week. The mural is meant to draw attention to the dire situation. It  depicts 18 of the 64 detained Americans, including Matthew Heath.   The mural isn't permanent. It will wash away with the rain and with  normal wear and tear. That is what it is meant to do. As we watch the  mural deteriorate, we are left to wonder what is going to happen to  these individuals by the time it disappears. Are they going to come  home, or will they be abandoned by our government?   Their moms and dads, brothers and sisters, loved ones and kids  deserve answers from our State Department about what is really  happening to their loved ones.                            ____________________
