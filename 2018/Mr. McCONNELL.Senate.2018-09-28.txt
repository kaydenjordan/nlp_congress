 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6897, which was received  from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 567, S. 2515.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read the third time.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read  the third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res.  632 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be  [[Page S6398]]  agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 661, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 662, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the House  message to accompany H.R. 6, the opioids bill. I further ask consent  that the majority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion  to concur; that there be up to 4 hours of debate on the motion, equally  divided in the usual form; and that following the use or yielding back  of that time, the Senate vote on the motion to concur with no further  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, for the information of all of our  colleagues, there were two very significant developments today.   This morning, the Judiciary Committee reported out Judge Kavanaugh  favorably. All 11 Republican members of the Judiciary Committee voted  in favor of reporting him out with a favorable recommendation. No. 2,  we will shortly move to proceed to the Kavanaugh nomination, and I am  pleased to announce that all 51 Republican Members of the Senate  support the motion to proceed to the nomination. One hundred percent of  the Republican conference supports proceeding to the Kavanaugh  nomination.   Now, in committee, they reviewed the most pages of documents ever  produced pertaining to any Supreme Court nomination--literally,  hundreds of judicial opinions from his tenure on the Court of Appeals  for the DC Circuit and 5 days of hearings during which Judge Kavanaugh  testified for nearly 40 hours. Judge Kavanaugh testified on every  topic, from complicated legal subjects to sensitive personal matters,  and there were statements and testimony from countless personal  friends, classmates, coworkers, former clerks, and other associates.   So the picture that has emerged from all of this is clear: Judge  Kavanaugh is one of the most qualified and most impressive Supreme  Court nominees in the history of our country.   He has excelled at the highest levels of legal scholarship. He holds  two degrees from Yale and, for years, has lectured at Harvard Law  School. He has issued more than 300 legal opinions from what is widely  considered the second highest court in the Nation. Several have  subsequently been cited in the Supreme Court's own majority opinions.  Along the way, he has built an outstanding reputation within the legal  community for his clear and thoughtful writing and his exemplary,  fairminded judicial temperament.   Judge Kavanaugh's qualifications have been affirmed by his peers and  by renowned legal scholars from across the ideological spectrum. One  self-described liberal Democrat who advised him at Yale Law School said  that Judge Kavanaugh ``commands wide and deep respect among scholars,  lawyers, and jurists.''   This praise has been echoed by hundreds of character witnesses who  have testified before the Senate or written us letters to praise Judge  Kavanaugh's personal character and his integrity in the strongest  terms.   The committee has also thoroughly investigated the last-minute  allegations that have been brought forward. The evidence that has been  produced either fails to corroborate these accusations or, in fact,  support Judge Kavanaugh's unequivocal denial, and, in some cases, the  accusers have even recanted their baseless allegations.   All in all, this is a nominee who has received what many have  considered the gold standard of judicial qualification--a rating of  unanimously ``well qualified'' from the American Bar Association.   So this is a nomination that deserves to move forward, and that is  precisely what is happening.   I commend our colleagues on the committee for sending this impressive  nominee here to the floor with a favorable recommendation.   Now we will keep the process moving. The full Senate will begin  consideration of Judge Kavanaugh's nomination today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand the Senate has received a  message from the House to accompany H.R. 302.    I move that the Chair lay before the Senate the  message to accompany H.R. 302.    I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate  amendment.  [[Page S6399]]     I send a cloture motion to the desk on the motion to  concur.    I move to concur in the House amendment with a further  amendment.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.

I have an amendment to the instructions.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 5 p.m. on Monday, October 1, the Senate  resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 302, as if  in legislative session; further, that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, the  Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur;  further, that if cloture is invoked, the Senate remain in executive  session and the postcloture time continue to run as otherwise under the  rule; finally, that upon the use or yielding back of the postcloture  time, the Senate vote, as if in legislative session, on the motion to  concur.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1127.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  majority leader and the senior Senator from Arkansas be authorized to  sign duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions during the upcoming  recess of the Senate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 3 p.m., Monday,  October 1; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date and the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand in recess under the previous  order.  [[Page S6400]]    Thereupon, the Senate, at 6:21 p.m., recessed until Monday, October  1, 2018, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
