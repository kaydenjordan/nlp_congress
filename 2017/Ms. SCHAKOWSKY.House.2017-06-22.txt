 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Raskin for yielding  to me.   I am very proud and excited to be here because we have so much at  stake right now.   I wanted to point to this incredible photo that we blew up from  today's news. Fifty people with disabilities were forcibly removed and  arrested outside Senator Mitch McConnell's office today. They were  there to protest what could happen to them and the 10 million Americans  who rely on Medicaid to live a life--often still struggling, but a life  with more dignity because they have Medicaid.   I want to take some time to thank them for so passionately but  peacefully resisting against the cruel Republican bill to repeal the  Affordable Care Act. People were pulled out of their wheelchairs and  ejected at the order, I presume, of the leader of the Senate to make  space in front of his office. They were exercising their freedom to  protest for themselves and for others in their situation. As I said, 10  million Americans with disabilities rely on Medicaid.   The Affordable Care Act incentivizes States to offer home and  community-based care under Medicaid. The Republican bill would undo  that. It would make it very likely that States would eliminate that  home care and community-based care.   Now, I have worked for years with people with disabilities, and I  know some of them have struggled to get out of nursing homes and to be  able to live in the community which, by the way, is actually less  expensive than taxpayers paying for people to be in nursing homes. This  has been a tremendous battle for the disability community to be able to  live independently.   That ability is threatened. By the way, even the amount of money that  would go to nursing homes would be cut dramatically, or could be.   Right now, one-half of the cost of nursing homes and home care and  community-based care is paid for by Medicaid, and $800 billion was cut  out of the House bill. I hear that the Senate bill is even worse. So  this monstrosity of a bill would do a countless amount of harm to  millions and millions of Americans. Just about everyone will be  affected.   So, today, I want to focus on the damage it would do to two groups in  particular: Americans age 50 to 64 and people with disabilities whom we  saw represented by the courageous protesters today outside Senator  Mitch McConnell's office.   This bill would impose a crippling age tax on people 50 to 64 years  old, which means that they will be either unable to afford insurance  altogether or be forced to pay thousands more for it every year.   This is the same age tax that was in the House's version of the bill.  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office gave this example: It  estimated that a 64-year-old who makes $26,000 a year could see his or  her premiums rise by over 800 percent. That would be in the area of  about $14,000 a year. How does that work? There is simply no way she  would be able to keep her insurance.   The Senate bill would allow individual States to undermine the  essential health benefits package that is in the Affordable Care Act  that ensures older Americans have insurance that actually covers the  services they need. Without those essential benefits, insurance  companies could end coverage for prescription drugs, for cancer care,  for emergency care, and much more.   On top of those attacks on Americans age 50 and older, the bill also  guts--as I pointed out--the Medicaid program which is absolutely  essential for people with disabilities, both young and old.   Medicaid pays for nearly half of all long-term care in our country,  and that includes, as I said, not just care provided by nursing homes,  but home and community-based and personal care services that allow  people with disabilities to live independently, sometimes to even  travel to Washington, D.C.   We fought really hard to provide those home and community-based  services. We expanded access to them in the Affordable Care Act. This  mean bill not only undoes the progress, it moves us backwards by  slashing Medicaid funds and turning it into a capped program, capping  the amount of money that may go to every person. The Senate bill is  even meaner than the House. Caps would rise more slowly and cause even  more damage.   So it is no wonder that the AARP, the Alliance for Retired Americans,  the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the  National Council on Independent Living, the Consortium for Citizens  with Disabilities, the American Medical Association, and the American  Nurses Association, really all the providers of healthcare, say no to  this disastrous bill.   It spells disaster for anyone who depends on Medicaid. That includes  pregnant women, infants, children, people with disabilities, and  adults--including low-income seniors. The bill is also devastating for  women's health. It defunds Planned Parenthood. Let's remember Planned  Parenthood is often the only clinic within driving distance of people  in rural areas.                                time  1800    Sometimes it is the only clinic available in medically underserved  areas for things like cancer screening, primary care, birth control,  testing men and women for HIV/AIDS, et cetera. It defunds Planned  Parenthood and targets private insurance plans that would cover  abortions.   So we really have to ask ourselves: Who benefits from this bill? Who  wins if TrumpCare were to pass?  [[Page H5105]]    Well, there is an answer. The ultrawealthy individuals who get a  massive tax break from this bill--that is why they want to cut all  those hundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicaid--they are the  winners.   Insurance, prescription drug, and medical device companies also get a  huge tax break in this so-called healthcare bill.   Yes, they call it a healthcare bill that benefits only the healthy  and the wealthy. I know which side and whose side I am on.
