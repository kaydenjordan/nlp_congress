 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for yielding.   In Oregon and across the country, people have worked hard to provide  themselves and their families with a secure retirement by contributing  a portion of their income to pensions.   But now, through no fault of their own, too many of these hardworking  Americans find that their pension plans are struggling, and without  intervention, these plans will become insolvent, putting the retirement  security of about 1.3 million people at risk.   The bipartisan Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act, the  Butch Lewis Act, will help protect retirees, workers, and employers by  creating the Pension Rehabilitation Administration to issue bonds to  finance loans for critical and declining status multiemployer pension  plans. Importantly, this bill does not cut benefits for workers and  retirees, benefits they have earned.   Workers, families, businesses, and retirees are counting on Congress  to address the growing retirement security crisis in our country and  protect the benefits workers have earned over their lifetime. This  bipartisan bill is one important piece of the solution to address the  multiemployer pension crisis, and I urge all of my colleagues to join  me in supporting it.   I thank Chairman Scott and Chairman Neal for their leadership on this  issue.  [[Page H7326]]
