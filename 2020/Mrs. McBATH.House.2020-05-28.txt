 Mr. Speaker, this is not the time to back down.   In my home State of Georgia, hardworking Georgians have been laid  off, small businesses have had to close, and families are worried about  the health and well-being of their loved ones.   Americans everywhere are counting on us to help them get through this  crisis as safely as possible. This is what we are sent to Washington to  do: to protect and to uplift our communities in a time such as this.   We must work together, Republicans and Democrats, to make a  difference in the lives of those we represent when they need us most.   This is the time to give America hope.   This is the time to govern with our hearts, and not partisan  politics, because we can get through this pandemic together, stronger  and more unified than before.                            ____________________
