 Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to assess the  feasibility of establishing a National Heritage Area in the Great  Dismal Swamp, as part of an effort to study, recognize, and preserve  the historic and natural treasures within this region.   As we continue to celebrate Black History Month, this bill  underscores the ties between the natural landmark and African American  history. The Great Dismal Swamp contains one of the largest collections  of artifacts from maroon colonies, and it served as both a home for  early colonial Free People of Color as well as one of a few known  water-based stops for freedom seekers on the Underground Railroad. The  Great Dismal Swamp also encompasses historic and ancestral lands of  Native American tribes such as the Nansemond Indian Nation and the  Haliwa-Saponi and Meherrin Tribes.   Today, the Dismal Swamp offers unique educational opportunities,  recreational adventures, and environmental benefits. It is an important  wildlife refuge for an impressive and diverse list of animal, insect,  and plant species. If designated as a National Heritage Area, local  communities will have access to technical assistance and advice from  the National Park Service while maintaining full ownership, authority  over decision-making, and stewardship of the biodiverse land.   I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Mark Warner on this  bill, and I am thankful to Congressman Donald McEachin's leadership on  this effort in the House with Representatives Bobby Scott, G.K.  Butterfield, and Elaine Luria. There is great potential for community  and economic development stemming from a National Heritage Area  designation. I  [[Page S900]]  look forward to such grassroots, community-driven development, and plan  to personally contribute to the boosted tourism and recreation. As a  student of history I am looking forward to learning more from the trove  of culture and history the Dismal has to offer.   I encourage the Senate to consider this legislation to help  highlight, study, and conserve the unique ecology and cultural history  contained in the Great Dismal Swamp for generations to come.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Grassley):   S. 473. A bill to amend the CARES Act to extend the subset for the  definition of a small business debtor, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
