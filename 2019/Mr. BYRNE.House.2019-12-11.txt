 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with sadness in my heart to  honor Officer Bill Clardy III of the Huntsville Police Department.   Officer Clardy, a decorated 14-year veteran of the department who  also served with distinction in the Iraq war, was tragically shot and  killed recently during a drug investigation. Officer Clardy was  assigned to a strategic counterdrug team called the STAC Team, leading  a task force of Federal and local law enforcement agencies to make drug  busts across north Alabama.   Sadly, the Clardy family knows well the sacrifices of service.  Officer Clardy's father, Billy Clardy, Jr., was killed in a car crash  while on duty in 1978.   We owe it to Officer Clardy not to forget him or his sacrifice.  Officer Clardy's reputation for service and for caring for his  community is unmatched.   Officer Clardy was a Huntsville hero, and he is an American hero. He  will be greatly missed.   Our thoughts, our prayers, and our support now are with the Clardy  family. We embrace you with our love. We offer you our support. In the  days to come, we pledge to you, we will not forget his sacrifice.                            ____________________
