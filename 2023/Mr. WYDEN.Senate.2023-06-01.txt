 Madam President, I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and  Senate Democrats will keep this Chamber on time.   There are three important reasons to vote against this amendment.  First, it would be an even bigger Republican handout to wealthy tax  cheats--nearly $200 billion. Second, at a time when Congress is  supposed to be debating fiscal responsibility, this amendment double  counts billions and billions of dollars by increasing the deficit with  more spending on defense contractors and bigger handouts to wealthy tax  cheats.   Finally, this Senate should focus on better service to taxpayers,  improved information technology, and ending the free ride once and for  all for wealthy tax cheats.   I urge colleagues to oppose the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 125    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  amendment.    Madam President, I rise in opposition.   The bipartisan package importantly negotiated between Speaker  McCarthy and President Biden, in fact, makes specific rescissions to  unused COVID funds while protecting important funding for programs that  are still necessary to support our community.   This amendment, colleagues, goes beyond the McCarthy-Biden agreement.  This amendment would take an ax to nearly all of the funding in the  Recovery Act and several other COVID bills, even if the communities are  still depending or planning on using that money.   Blue States or red States, pass this amendment and you risk default.  I strongly urge a vote against this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 134    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the  amendment.
