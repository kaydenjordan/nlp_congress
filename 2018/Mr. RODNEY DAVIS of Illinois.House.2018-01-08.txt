 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lynn  Raney, who passed away on December 28. He was a talented artist, a  dedicated State worker, an admired teacher, and a respected member of  our central Illinois community.   Lynn found great joy in serving others. I got to know him during his  time working in public service for the State of Illinois.   There was never a day that Lynn did not have a smile on his face,  even in the midst of difficult family health tragedies. As a matter of  fact, Lynn Raney helped set up a press conference where he found out he  was being laid off from the State of Illinois by a new Governor.   I have no doubt that Lynn will be remembered well for his talent as  an artist. Not only did he teach art to high school students, but he  was known for the care and creativity he put into his annual Christmas  cards. Just before this Christmas, I received one of his cards, and I  will cherish it even more after his passing.   I am proud to honor Lynn today. He left a lasting impact on everyone  who knew him. He was a good friend, a devoted husband, and a loving  father, who will be missed by many. My thoughts and prayers are with  his family during this difficult time.                            ____________________
