 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Like so many Texans, I grew up in a household that honored a  tradition of gun ownership for hunting, for collection, and for  sportsmanship, and also honored gun safety. I was taught to shoot by my  uncle, Raymond O'Rourke, jail captain and the chief marksman in the El  Paso County Sheriff's Office.   I also live in a State that has a license to carry process which  requires safety training, though 18 States do not. Texas requires that  someone who has a license to carry be 21 years or older, though 15  States do not. Texas requires that those who abuse their partners not  be allowed to have a license to carry, though 14 States do not. Texas  does not grant licenses to violent offenders, though 22 States do.  Texas does not grant licenses to people convicted of stalking, though  21 other States do.   What H.R. 38 does, Mr. Speaker, is it subjects every Texan and every  El Pasoan whom I represent to the lowest common denominator in the  United States. It will make our State less--not more--safe. That is why  I oppose H.R. 38, and I ask all my colleagues to join me in doing the  same.
