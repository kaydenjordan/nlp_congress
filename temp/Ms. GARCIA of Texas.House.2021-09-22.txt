 Madam Speaker, women's freedom to choose their  reproductive care is under attack by politicians who want to control  their decisions.   A woman's freedom to make a decision on this very private, personal  matter should be respected and should be left to her alone together  with her family and her doctor and guided by her faith.   Politicians and government should have no control. Yet 3 weeks ago,  my home State of Texas passed one of the strictest abortion bills in  the country which on its face is unconstitutional.   Politicians in Texas are trying to control women's freedom to choose  and the progress that we have made in the last 50 years. It also allows  anyone--anyone--in the country to file a lawsuit against a provider,  family, friend, clergy, Uber driver, Lyft driver, and anyone who  assists a woman seeking an abortion. If successful, the plaintiffs get  $10,000.   In fact, just last week two individuals, not even from Texas, filed  lawsuits against a doctor from San Antonio who publicly acknowledged  that he had performed an abortion outside the legal limits of this  Texas law. One of the plaintiffs even admitted that his reason for  filing this suit was the $10,000 bounty. He needed the money.   This is outrageous and must be stopped. Texas already has some of the  most restrictive abortion laws in the country.   Before this law entered into effect, my home State already required  women to get mandatory sonograms, and we also have a 24-hour waiting  period. Now this law makes existing restrictions even worse.   Texas has almost 7 million women aged 15 to 49 out of a total of 75  million in this age group in the entire country. So we make up now one  in ten of the U.S. women of reproductive age. All these women all over  Texas now have no choices. Now, effectively, Roe v. Wade is  meaningless.   Madam Speaker, women's freedom to choose what to do with their bodies  is hanging by a thread, and Congress can't sit idle.   Last week, I visited Planned Parenthood's headquarters in my district  and heard horrific stories about how this draconian law is affecting  women in my region.   On September 1, the day that Texas law took effect, one Texas woman  learned she was about 5 weeks pregnant--and still within the new legal  limits in the Texas law to obtain an abortion in Texas. But at the same  visit she also learned that she had COVID-19. By the time she would  finish her quarantine period it would be too late to get an abortion in  Texas and she would then have to go out of State for care.   On September 2, Planned Parenthood providers saw a patient for an  ultrasound that showed she was under 6 weeks and still within the new  legal limits of the Texas law. When she came back the next day after  the State mandated 24-hour waiting period, the second sonogram showed  she had passed the new legal limit. Overnight she lost access to an  abortion in Texas.   Here is another story. A few days after the Texas law took effect, a  woman walked into the Planned Parenthood's health center after trying  to self-manage an abortion. Having no money or resources, she had  turned to the internet where she found some abortion tea. She took it,  and it didn't work. The ultrasound showed she was past the new legal  limit, and doctors in Texas couldn't help her. She too was now forced  to seek care out of State or to continue with her pregnancy.   Then, Madam Speaker, I am sure you heard about tropical storm  Nicholas. The storm made landfall during some patients' State mandated  24-hour waiting period. They were hunkered down. They couldn't get to  the clinic, and the clinic was closed. They lost their right to an  abortion during that time period.   Another case I heard of was from a 44-year-old patient, already a  parent, who didn't think she could have any more children but learned  that she was pregnant at 7 weeks, just past the legal limits of the new  Texas law. This patient was never planning to stay with her current  partner and now, due to this pregnancy, feels pressured to remain in  that relationship.   Madam Speaker, these cases are heartbreaking, and I am sure we will  hear more and worse because women's lives are at risk. And although I  am encouraged to know the Justice Department is acting on this,  Congress needs to act, and this is why we must pass H.R. 3755.                            ____________________
