 Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support my bipartisan amendment regarding an essential medical isotope.  This amendment that I have introduced, along with Senator Portman,  would achieve three simple goals: It would safeguard and improve  patient access to critical health screenings, it would promote medical  innovations needed for cutting-edge diagnostics and new treatments, and  it would move us away from our dependence on foreign sources of medical  isotopes, while supporting America's medical innovation industry.   Let me explain quickly why my amendment is needed. The United States  does not currently produce the medical isotope our healthcare system  uses the most. This isotope is used in medical screenings and helps  50,000 patients per day in the United States by providing early  detection and enabling treatment of cancer and heart disease.   U.S. patients are currently relying on supplies of this key isotope  that come from Canada, the Netherlands, and South Africa. This raises  costs and risks supply disruptions. Mind you, this isotope only lasts  for 3 days.   For security in the healthcare system and certainty in patient access  to essential medical tests, which are often needed in urgent  situations, we must develop a domestic supply of these isotopes. The  Department of Energy has been working diligently with the private  sector to develop sources that are made in America, and this amendment  would dedicate $20 million to ensure that work continues so we can  secure domestic production as soon as possible.   I urge my colleagues to support this important and bipartisan  amendment.   I yield back.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
