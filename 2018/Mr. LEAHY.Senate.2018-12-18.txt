 Mr. President, before I begin, I would note my long  friendship with the Presiding Officer. I was delighted to see him come  back to the Senate. I wish him well now as he leaves the Senate. He is  always welcome, by both Democrats and Republicans, when he comes back.   I realize the Presiding Officer is constrained and cannot respond to  whatever I say about him, but I assure him that I will stay within the  Senate rules and say only nice things because that is all I know about  him.  [[Page S7749]]                                     FIRST STEP Act    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Minnesota who has  just spoken. She, like me, is a former prosecutor. I have often said  that is the best job I ever had. My wife, Marcelle, reminded me of some  of those times at 3 a.m., when I was going to murder scenes, and that  maybe it is easier to be in the Senate where you can sleep all night.   A lot of us who have been prosecutors, both Republicans and  Democrats, or those who have been defense attorneys, Republicans and  Democrats, have come together. Because of that, the Senate is  considering passing probably the most significant bill to reform our  criminal justice system in nearly a decade.   The First Step Act takes modest but important steps to remedy some of  the most troubling injustices within our sentencing laws and our prison  system. It is my hope that this bill represents not just a single piece  of legislation, but a turning point in how Congress views its role in  advancing criminal justice because there will be a lot of advances we  must look at.   I have been working to bring fairness to our criminal justice system  for decades, both before I was in the Senate and since I have been in  the Senate. For far too long, the legislative response to any and all  public safety concerns was as simple as it was flawed: No matter the  perceived ill, we turned to arbitrary and inflexible mandatory minimums  to cure it. That knee-jerk response, I believe, is changing. I truly  believe the error of mandatory minimum sentencing is coming to an end.   Today is a glowing recognition that one-size-fits-all sentencing is  neither just nor effective. It routinely results in low-level offenders  spending far longer in prison than either public safety or common sense  requires. It comes at a steep human cost, especially in communities of  color. It also comes at a steep fiscal cost that leaves us less safe.  The United States houses more prisoners and has higher incarceration  rates than any other country in the world. This is not something for  Americans to point to with pride. The cost of housing Federal offenders  consumes nearly one-third of the Justice Department's budget. Because  public safety dollars are finite, this strips critical resources away  from law enforcement strategies that have been proven to make our  communities safer.   By taking steps to responsibly reduce our prison population, we can  save both money and reduce crime. That is a lesson states across the  country have already learned. Prison rates and crime rates can fall  together. It is past time for the Federal criminal justice system to  catch up with the States.   Five years ago, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee--and drawing  on my own experiences as a prosecutor--I convened hearings and advanced  the core pieces of legislation that now form the basis of the FIRST  STEP Act. Despite strong bipartisan votes in Committee at the time,  some doubted we had the support needed to ensure passage on the Senate  floor. Each year since then, an expanding group of dedicated Senators  and advocates have methodically built support for these reforms. Today,  that support is outstanding. It's not just bipartisan; it is nearly  nonpartisan. And with the efforts of Senator Durbin, who has been  championing these efforts as long as anyone, along with Senators  Grassley, Whitehouse, Lee, Booker, and others, we now stand poised to  pass meaningful criminal justice reform for the first time in a decade.   It is true, this legislation doesn't go as far as I would like. Far  from it. I support ending mandatory minimum sentences. I would prefer  we do more to fix racially disparate treatment. I would like to see the  full elimination of the existing crack-powder cocaine disparity--a  glaring injustice we must eventually address. You can have a well- respected person on Wall Street or in a law firm or anywhere else spend  a certain amount of money for powder cocaine. You can have somebody in  the inner city spend exactly the same amount for crack cocaine. We have  told the person who has the good social standing: What a terrible thing  you have done. You may have to spend a few weekends volunteering at  soup kitchens, and we hope you don't do it again. The person from the  inner city, spending the exact same amount on crack cocaine, is going  to have a mandatory sentence in prison.   I would like to see a broader judicial safety valve and additional  retroactive activity. Any laws that we consider unjust today were just  as unjust yesterday or a year ago or even a decade ago.   But this is the nature of compromise. You don't get everything you  want. And when I look at the scope of reforms before us today-- including a modest expansion of the safety valve, retroactive  application of the Fair Sentencing Act, a reduction to some of the most  indefensible mandatory minimums on the books, as well as reforms to add  evidence-based practices to our prison system and reentry efforts--I  believe this is a historic achievement.   The FIRST STEP Act also includes my Second Chance Reauthorization  Act, which I introduced with Senator Portman. Our bill both extends and  improves Federal grant programs providing reentry service to ex- offenders. That includes employment assistance, housing, substance  abuse treatment, victim support, and more. Almost every single offender  in our justice system, someday, is going to be released. We owe it to  both them and to the communities where they will live in to ensure they  can lead productive lives.   In many ways, the FIRST STEP Act represents the best of the Senate.  It represents what this institution is capable of when Senators listen  to each other, and when they come together to solve complex and  contentious issues, instead of exploiting them for momentary political  gain. When Senators are willing to be patient, to compromise, and to  persist through inevitable setbacks, real progress is possible.   Senators, no matter what their political party, understand that each  one of us is here to be part of the conscience of the Nation, and we  should work together. For the remaining Members of the Senate who are  not yet ready to support this legislation, I hope you will reconsider.  I hope you will review the breadth of bipartisan support, both here in  the Congress, in the White House and in the broader stakeholder  community. I hope you will consider why even important law enforcement  voices like the Fraternal Order of Police and the National District  Attorneys Association support this bill.   For the Members who do support the FIRST STEP Act, I hope you will  continue to work to reform our criminal justice system in the years  ahead. Many of our lives are based on decades-old, misguided  assumptions, and they don't reflect evidence-based practices. There is  still so much work to be done, and injustices and racial disparities to  address.   This week, we are showing what is possible. By working together, we  can continue to enact meaningful legislation in the years to come that  will keep us safe, save money, and prove America is a nation of  fairness and second chances. This is a carefully negotiated compromise.   I hope all Members will vote no on amendments to this carefully  negotiated compromise and vote yes on final passage. This former  prosecutor would be very happy if we do.   There is a Senator seeking recognition.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
