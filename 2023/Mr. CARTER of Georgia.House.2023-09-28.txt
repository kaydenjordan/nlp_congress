 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dal  Cannady as he steps away from the WTOC news network for a new role as  communications director for Bulloch County.   Mr. Cannady worked 27 years at WTOC, providing fair and accurate  coverage as WTOC's bureau chief. During his time at WTOC, he covered  very important stories, such as Fort Stewart/Hinesville helping fight  the war on terror, the tomato patch murder in Long County, the Santa  Claus mini-mart murder in Toombs County, and many other stories.   His work at WTOC was defined by compassion, intelligence, and  kindness.   WTOC labeled him as the person who knew things before everyone else,  the person who knows who to call, and the person who knew how to ask  tough questions respectfully.   I know WTOC and their viewers will miss Dal's expertise, but we are  thrilled to see him move on to a new role in the Bulloch community.                            ____________________
