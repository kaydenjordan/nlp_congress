 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Mr. Michael  Nguyen, an American citizen and resident of my home district,  California's 45th Congressional District.   Mr. Nguyen left Vietnam in 1975, 44 years ago. The Vietnamese  Government arrested Michael last summer, almost a year ago, while he  was traveling and visiting elderly relatives. Michael has now been  detained in Vietnam for over 11 months.   We still don't know what crime he is alleged to have committed or  what, if any, evidence the Vietnamese Government has to justify his  detention and his upcoming trial.   My office has asked repeatedly for this information, but we have been  told that we won't know these basics until Michael is taken to court  later this month. His family won't know these basics until then.   To make matters worse, for the vast majority of these past 11 months,  Michael was being detained without formal charges at all. We now know  that Michael is being charged for allegedly violating article 109 of  the Vietnamese Criminal Code, activities against the government. This  is a charge that Vietnamese officials have used in the past for  arbitrary arrests.   By all accounts, Michael is a good man. He was an active member of  his community and church in Orange County. I have met his family  numerous times, and his wife, Helen, was my guest for the State of the  Union.   He has four beautiful daughters, all school age, who miss their  father very much. He is a dad who makes breakfast for his girls in the  morning and was their primary caretaker.   He was a small business owner, and he is an American citizen with no  criminal record here in the United States.   He hasn't been able to speak to his family during this entire time,  nearly 1 year. Instead, the Vietnamese Government permits only monthly  visits by the U.S. State Department. I thank our State Department  officials for visiting him, enabling him to hear messages from his  loved ones, and working to ensure his health during this long  detention.   But that isn't enough. His family is suffering. Michael's wife,  Helen, has taken on a second job while acting as a single mom to their  four young girls. His daughters have trouble sleeping and focusing at  school.    This entire situation is unjust. Michael was held without formal  charges for over 9 months, and we still have been presented with no  evidence. That is not how an American citizen should be treated abroad.  We expect our partners to show respect for human rights and the rule of  law.   I am grateful that so many of my colleagues, Republicans and  Democrats, continue to join me in calling on the Vietnamese Government  to do what is right. This is not a partisan issue.   Respectfully, I demand that the Vietnamese Government provide Michael  with a fair resolution to his case and return him safely to the U.S.  and to his family as soon as possible.   I will continue to work to secure Michael's release until he is  reunited with his family and brought home to his country, the United  States of America.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to the fiscal  year 2020 appropriations bill that would increase funding for the  Senior Medicare Patrol program.   Every year, we lose more than $60 billion to fraud and abuse in  Medicare. Money lost to fraud means fewer dollars available for needed  services and a decreased quality of care for all.   Senior Medicare Patrol supports both Medicare and Medicaid  beneficiaries by helping them to detect and report healthcare fraud.  Each year, this program helps both seniors and the Federal Government  recover or avoid losing billions of dollars.   I am proud to say that California's Senior Medicare Patrol program is  based in my district and in my hometown of Irvine. The program is  administered there by California Health Advocates.   CHA recently received its performance measure numbers from the Office  of the Inspector General for 2018. Through the program, it reached  200,000 California beneficiaries, families, and caregivers with fraud  prevention messages; hosted nearly 3,000 outreach events; and recruited  over 600 volunteers across the State to fight for seniors and families.   I thank those 600 volunteers in California and more than 5,000 across  the country, many of whom are retired and are on Medicare themselves,  for their tireless efforts.   Last year, the Office of the Inspector General of HHS investigated a  case in Los Angeles in which a doctor and a recruiter were found guilty  for their roles in frequently billing Medicare for clinic, hospice  services, and durable medical equipment that patients either didn't  need or didn't receive. This fraud cost Medicare and patients $33  million.   Senior Medicare Patrol helps stop fraudulent actors, saving the  system money.   Rising as well are lab schemes in which labs are offering cancer  screens using genetic testing, but really, these labs are collecting  Medicare numbers for potential medical identity theft or billing  Medicare for expensive genetic tests that no one needs. These costs are  passed on to Medicare, taxpayers, or to the patients themselves.   Recently, California Health Advocates issued an alert in nine  languages about these fraudulent tests. Because of this alert, senior  centers that have been approached by those executing these schemes have  shut them out, armed with the knowledge they need to protect their  patients from fraud.   I am proud to be here today to ensure that this program receives the  funding it needs. As a consumer protection advocate, keeping seniors  and taxpayers safe from fraud is a top priority.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, I thank the chairwoman for her remarks, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to the  fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill that would provide essential  funding to the Health Resources and Service Administration, HRSA, for  its critical research to create a strategy to address intimate partner  violence.   Intimate partner violence is a critical public health issue that  affects millions of women, men, children, and families. The HRSA  strategy uses research to help partners identify and address key social  determinants of health and their interactions with the impacts of  intimate partner violence through awareness, screening, and treatment.   Building on studies from the VAWA health program, HRSA has used this  funding to couple the strategy with a program known as Project Catalyst  to foster intimate partner violence response and health collaboration  at the State level.   More than 25 percent of women and 11 percent of men have experienced  sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner  in their lifetimes, and I am one of them.  [[Page H4620]]    My three children and I were able to move forward with our lives,  staying in our community and our home. I found help to heal our family  and let us rebuild our lives, and I relied on essential healthcare  resources in this process. That rebuilding brought me here to advocate  for survivors who escaped the cycle of violence and to speak on behalf  of those who haven't.   Each year, millions suffer in silence. Our healthcare workforce needs  the tools and knowledge necessary to support every single victim of  intimate partner violence. The funding through HRSA's strategy to  address intimate partner violence includes the integration of intimate  partner violence responses into HIV, home healthcare, and numerous  other women's programs.   This fiscal year 2020 request will create dedicated funding under  programs at HRSA specifically focusing on community health centers that  provide essential local primary and mental healthcare.   My district in Orange County is home to eight community health  centers. I hope that with the growth of this program, more of these  providers will have the opportunity to address intimate partner  violence.                                time  0315    We need funding to complete the work necessary to implement HRSA's  strategy and for the growth of Project Catalyst to add more States to  this initiative.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, it is not eating cake to want women to be  safe in their homes and from their partners.   I know a lot about tough decisions and about priorities, and I have  faced tough decisions about how to protect my own family. And I am  proud that it is a priority of mine and of my Democratic colleagues to  support full funding to stop intimate partner violence.   Madam Chair, I respectfully ask for the support of all of my  colleagues in this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to the  fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill which would require the Secretary  of Health and Human Services to provide the Appropriations Committee  with detailed monthly State enrollment figures.   My amendment requires that these figures include State enrollment  numbers, disaggregated by race, ethnicity, preferred language, age, and  sex.   It is important to get detailed information on who is enrolling and  who isn't in ACA coverage. By understanding trends, we can look for  populations that are being missed or underserved.   In particular, under this administration, progress that we had made  in reducing the uninsured population has stalled. According to the  latest census data, in 2017, for the first time since the passage of  the ACA, the Asian American uninsured rate remained virtually flat at  6.4 percent, while the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander uninsured  rate increased from 7.7 percent to 8.3 percent.   Previously, disparities in uninsurance rates among these communities  had been eliminated because of coverage expansion from the ACA.  [[Page H4621]]    Groups engaging in enrollment work have fewer resources because of  this administration and, therefore, must engage in more targeted and  limited outreach.   Even further, this data is from 2017, before the administration  launched even more aggressive attacks to dismantle our healthcare  system after they failed to repeal it without a replacement.   Our next census will show how the attacks of 2018 and 2019 will  affect enrollment numbers, but we need the information that essential  monthly enrollment data can tell us long before the census is  published.   By better understanding where gaps exist and in which groups we are  seeing negative trends in insurance enrollment, we can better focus  essential outreach and education. In particular, this will help  organizations serving hard-to-reach populations and communities of  color.   While CMS has provided an annual detailed enrollment report, it has  failed to provide more regular updates on enrollment during the year  and also has failed to provide detailed enrollment data showing  enrollment for race subgroups or data to show how people are enrolling.   This amendment would provide the necessary transparency into  enrollment trends.   I am proud to represent a diverse district, and I came to Congress to  serve and represent their needs. I hope this amendment will be an  essential step forward to helping Congress and the country better  understand how we are failing communities of color and how we can  provide more accessible care.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Chair, this amendment would ultimately save  dollars, as explained by Chairwoman DeLauro. It would reduce  uninsurance rates, particularly in populations that are receiving less  care.   This is, ultimately, a bill that will reduce the costs of our  healthcare system by making all of our communities healthier. It is a  bill about equity, but it is also a financially responsible bill.   I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
