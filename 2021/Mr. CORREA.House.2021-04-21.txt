 Madam Speaker, when the President first announced his  Muslim ban, I immediately went to LAX. I went because constituents were  telling me that they couldn't get their relatives into the U.S.  Individuals who were traveling to the U.S. that had been approved  by the U.S. State Department could not enter the U.S. I saw people who  thought they were here for a regular, routine visit approved by the  U.S. Government denied--denied on a whim.    This bill is simply about making sure that no future President--Obama  or Trump--will ever be able to deny entry into the U.S. based on  religion or race. That is what the bill is. It is not about any  specific President. It is about doing the right thing in America.
