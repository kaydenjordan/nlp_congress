 Madam President, this week I cast my vote in support of  the nomination of Kyle Duncan to serve as a judge on the Fifth Circuit  Court of Appeals. Mr. Duncan has been a successful trial and appellate  attorney, as well as a law professor at the University of Mississippi  School of Law. He was the assistant solicitor general for the State of  Texas and the appellate chief for the State of Louisiana. He has tried  cases at the State and Federal levels and has argued twice before the  U.S. Supreme Court. The American Bar Association has reviewed his  nomination and has rated Mr. Duncan ``well-qualified.''   Some have criticized Mr. Duncan for his work on certain high-profile  cases. Nearly all nominees for the Federal courts who come before the  Senate have advocated for various positions. Some of them have been  involved in controversial, high-profile cases. In considering a  nominee's fitness to serve on the bench, we should consider whether  they have the intellect, the temperament, and the respect for precedent  to fairly and faithfully uphold the law.   One case that Mr. Duncan litigated has been mischaracterized in a way  that suggests he is biased against the LGBT community. Mr. Duncan's  opponents argue that his work in V.L. v. E.L., in which the opposing  party was a lesbian, demonstrates this bias. What these critics fail to  mention is that Mr. Duncan's client was also a lesbian. The matter was  a custody case involving two women in a same-sex partnership. As his  cocounsel in the case, Randall W. Nichols, has described in a letter to  the Senate Judiciary Committee, dated November 27, 2017:         I note that some may criticize Mr. Duncan for representing       clients in the same-sex marriage litigation. It must not go       without notice that our mutual client, E.L., was a same-sex       woman asserting a strong, albeit ultimately unsuccessful,       legal argument. Mr. Duncan represented our mutual client       without once making an issue of her sexual orientation,       without once displaying any personal bias, and without once       indicating a desire to advance any agenda other than winning       the case for E.L.    Mr. Duncan has testified to the Judiciary Committee that he would  follow all applicable precedents of the Supreme Court and Fifth  Circuit. He demonstrated his deference to precedent during his time  representing the State of Louisiana. While the Supreme Court was  deciding the Obergefell case on the constitutionality of same-sex  marriage laws, Mr. Duncan was representing the State of Louisiana in a  challenge to its marriage law. Following the Court's decision, the  Fifth Circuit instructed the parties in the Louisiana case to explain  whether Obergefell resolved the matter for the court.   The very next day, Mr. Duncan filed a letter explaining that, despite  Louisiana's disagreement with the Obergefell outcome, the Fifth Circuit  must follow the new Supreme Court precedent and strike down Louisiana's  law. While still representing the State, Mr. Duncan announced that  married same-sex couples would be able to have both of their names on  their children's birth certificates. Mr. Duncan's actions following the  Obergefell decision demonstrate that he will respect precedent and  faithfully follow the law.   By contrast, in a similar case, the lawyers for the State of Arkansas  continued to fight over whether Obergefell required States to issue  birth certificates with the names of both same-sex spouses. Unlike Mr.  Duncan, they resisted the Obergefell precedent all the way up to the  Supreme Court and lost. That case, Pavan v. Smith, confirms that Mr.  Duncan did the right thing in advising the Fifth Circuit to apply the  Obergefell precedent.   It is also noteworthy that the attorney who argued against Mr. Duncan  in the Louisiana case strongly supports his nomination. In an opinion  article published in ``The Hill'' on March 25, 2018, Paul Baier, who is  now a law professor at Louisiana State University, describes Mr. Duncan  as a ``magnificent nominee for the Fifth Circuit who ought to be  swiftly confirmed.'' He goes on to describe Mr. Duncan's qualifications  in the following way:         I always appreciated and respected Kyle's advocacy for his       client and his respect for the humanity of the same-sex       couples who would be most affected by the case. While I       disagreed with many of his arguments, often emphatically, I       never found a trace of bias, bigotry, or any disrespect       towards the same-sex individuals in the case.        Kyle knows well the difference between the advocate's role       for his client (in the same-sex marriage case, the State of       Louisiana) and what he would be called upon to decide as a       judge on the Fifth Circuit. I maintain this view of Kyle even       having faced off against him in the highly charged atmosphere       of same-sex marriage litigation. His ability to act as a       judge and not advocate will surely carry over to other       questions of public importance facing the Fifth Circuit.    The advice and consent role given to the Senate in the Constitution  is one of  [[Page S2478]]  the Senate's most solemn duties and one to which I give the utmost  care. I apply no litmus test with respect to a nominee's personal  beliefs, and have voted for judicial nominees whose personal views  differ from my own, but evaluating whether a nominee possesses an  ability to set aside emotion and personal views while applying the laws  in a neutral and impartial manner is critical.   In this regard, I believe Mr. Duncan will be faithful to the rule of  law. He has pledged to the Judiciary Committee and to me that he will  follow all precedents of the Supreme Court, and his actions in the  Louisiana same-sex marriage case are evidence that he will do this,  even if he disagrees with the outcome. I support his confirmation.                            ____________________
