 Mr. President, I wish to celebrate the Urban  Affairs Coalition in recognition of their 50th anniversary. Founded in  1969 as the Philadelphia Urban Coalition, the Urban Affairs Coalition  works tirelessly to tackle a number of diverse issues that immediately  affect communities throughout the Greater Philadelphia Region.   A robust group of organizations, the Philadelphia Urban Coalition was  founded after the assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., with the goal of solving their communities' social and economic  problems. In 1991, the group merged with the Urban Affairs Partnership  to create the Greater Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition and in 2010  shortened the name to the Urban Affairs Coalition. They have managed  over $1 billion of social investment since their founding.   Today, the Urban Affairs Coalition consists of over 75 organizations  working to achieve unity among government, business, neighborhood, and  individual initiatives to improve the quality of life in the region,  build wealth in urban communities, and solve emerging issues. The  coalition works towards this mission in three different ways: backing  nonprofits through fiscal sponsorship, capacity building, and  professional development; working to improve life chances for the youth  and young adults; and providing economic opportunity to low-income  households, working families, and disadvantaged businesses.   Through their extensive work, the Urban Affairs Coalition helps  children and young adults climb the economic ladder, educates the  community on job opportunities and financial advice, and provides  access to capital for minority entrepreneurs. The coalition is  committed to supporting nonprofits by helping them run backroom  operations, allowing nonprofits to focus on public service.   In addition to helping their community, the Urban Affairs Coalition  recognizes local leaders at their annual banquet. They present the Doer  Award, the Living Legacy Award, and the Community Leadership Award to  those who make efforts to improve and support their communities. The  Urban Affairs Coalition consistently looks to form new partnerships and  is working to raise $1 million in the 2020 fiscal year to create a UAC  Legacy Fund, which will further support educational and charitable  activities.   Additionally, I wish to commend Ms. Sharmain Matlock-Turner, the  president and chief executive officer of the Urban Affairs Coalition.  This year marks Ms. Matlock-Turner's 20th anniversary in her role. She  also serves as the cofounder and chair of the West Oak Lane Charter  School, a school in Northwest Philadelphia where 92 percent of students  are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. West Oak Lane prides  itself on strong ties with higher education organizations. These  relationships begin by focusing on educating the next generation of  innovators. Ms. Matlock-Turner was one of three Philadelphia leaders to  win a scholarship to Harvard Business School's Nonprofit Leaders'  Summer Program in 2005, and she has since won awards from CASA  Philadelphia, the American Red Cross, and many other organizations.   The work of the Urban Affairs Coalition and Ms. Matlock-Turner have  been crucial to providing countless children and young adults a  fighting chance at a brighter future. Community improvement is their  continuing mission, and I thank them for their hard work on behalf of  Pennsylvanians. I wish them the best of luck on their future  efforts.                            ____________________
