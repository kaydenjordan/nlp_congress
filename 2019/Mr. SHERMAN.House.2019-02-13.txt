 Mr. Speaker, I was in my office watching these tributes  to the dean, and after a while I couldn't just sit there and watch. I  realized this is an hour devoted to remembrances from his colleagues  from Michigan, and I thank Congressman Kildee for allowing a humble  Californian to participate.   America is healthier because of John Dingell. Less tobacco is smoked  now than decades ago because of John Dingell. Our air is cleaner. Our  water is cleaner. We are healthier, and we are closer to completely  universal healthcare than we have ever been in our history because of  John Dingell.   Not only is our environment healthier and our bodies are healthier,  our country is healthier because of what John Dingell did to move  forward the fight for civil rights in this country.   John is the dean of the Michigan delegation, but he belongs to us,  too. He is the dean of the House. He is the dean of the House for all  time. I doubt that any Member will ever match his record of tenure, but  I know that no Member will ever match his record of accomplishment.   So we have had so many new Members come to the House this year  wondering how to learn, how to be an effective Member, and how to serve  their country. They could not do any better than to study the life of  John Dingell in his nearly six decades of service to this country and  to this House.   I am so pleased that Debbie Dingell continues to serve the district,  a district served by John and John's father. I thank the gentleman from  Michigan for inviting a California member and taking just a bit of his  time.
