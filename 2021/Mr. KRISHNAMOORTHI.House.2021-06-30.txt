 Madam Speaker, I rise to salute my departing  chief of staff, Mark Schauerte, for his devoted service to my office  and to my constituents.   Mark and I have been friends since the third grade, having grown up  in Peoria, Illinois, and today Mark is one of my most trusted advisers.  His intelligence, decency, and grit informed every initiative  undertaken by my office.   I will miss Mark's daily presence and his warm sense of humor. My  loss, however, is his family's gain, and I am glad Mark's lovely wife,  Chris, and his son, Eddie, will now enjoy more of Mark's time.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mark for his dedicated, stalwart public  service, and I thank him for his friendship of more than 40 years. I  wish Mark great success in this new chapter of his life.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues to  support this en bloc amendment, which includes mine and Representative  Porter's amendment to improve booster seat safety.   In December, my Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer  Policy released a concerning report on the safety of booster seats for  children. Booster seatmakers have been marketing their booster seats as  safe for 30-pound children, a standard not recommended by experts. And  these makers have been left largely unregulated when it comes to side- impact testing.   Some makers gave passing grades to booster seats because the seat  maintained its structural integrity. Meanwhile, the dummy was damaged.  And we all know what a damaged dummy equates to: The severe spinal cord  or other injuries to a child.   We expect the products we buy to be tried and true, but, sadly, that  is not the case with booster seats. And when it comes to our children,  we cannot continue to stand idly by.   My amendment would require NHTSA to revise their recommended minimum  weight for a booster seat to 40 pounds, and would require booster  seatmakers to produce labels that display recommendations clearly for  parents.
