 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for  bringing this legislation to the floor.   I have several comments that I would like to make in response to my  friend from Houston, Ms. Jackson Lee, about this legislation and about  what it is and, more importantly, what it is not.   I served 22 years on a criminal court in Houston, Texas, felony  cases, saw about 25,000 people work their way through my court. Before  that, I was a prosecutor for 8 years in State court. Mr. Speaker, I saw  a lot of people charged with criminal conduct, and this legislation is  necessary because of some problems that the system has created.   As the chairman pointed out, pretrial release is a relatively new  concept in our justice system. When a person comes and is charged with  a crime, generally speaking, in most jurisdictions, there are four ways  in which that individual can be released until their day in court:   One way is to put up a cash bond, where they put up the cash to the  sheriff's department sometimes, and after the case is over with, they  get that cash back.   Another way is to go through a bonding agency where they pay a  bonding agency a percentage and they, the bond company, are responsible  for making sure the person appears in court. If they don't appear, the  bonding company loses the entire bond money.   There is a personal recognizance bond, where an individual comes to  court and tells the judge and promises: Judge, I will come back to  court for my trial.                                time  1445    It is an agreement between the judge and the individual.   And then there is the pretrial release system.   The pretrial release system is similar to personal recognizance,  except the person is supposed to be supervised by a government agency,  usually called the pretrial release agency, that makes sure that that  person abides by certain conditions, doesn't leave town, and that  pretrial release agency is usually run by the local judiciary or the  justice system like the county, four different ways.   This legislation deals only with the pretrial release programs in our  Nation, the 300 pretrial release programs.   The Citizens Right to Know Act is really not reforming pretrial  release, it is an accountability portion of pretrial release to let  people know how the Federal money is being used to operate.   Each year, millions of dollars in Federal grant money goes to State  and local pretrial release agencies to operate those programs. These  programs allow the accused individual to be released and await trial,  usually to stay in the jurisdiction.   However, some jurisdictions overuse the programs and release many  repeat and dangerous individuals with no  [[Page H3860]]  oversight by anybody. They are just released into the community.   Some of these released individuals disappear from the justice system  indefinitely. We don't know how many do because there is no reporting  of people under the pretrial release program to the Federal Government  when they receive Federal funds.   In many cases, repeat, violent, and hardened criminals participate.  As a result, in jurisdictions across the country, taxpayers are  literally bailing out individuals with a long criminal record on a new  criminal offense.   All across America, terrible crimes are being committed by  individuals who are bailed out on a pretrial release program because  there is no accountability of the program.   This bill is an accountability bill. Who is being released? What  types of cases are being released? How many people repeat a crime while  they are out on pretrial release?   We don't know because those records are never kept. So if the  taxpayers are going to fund pretrial release programs, as they should  in local jurisdictions, let the pretrial release program report back to  the Federal Government the results of the program. Is it working? Is it  not working? That is what we need to know, and we have no idea today.   It doesn't have anything to do with determining who is released on  pretrial release, it just wants these organizations to report back to  the Federal Government because the public has the right to know if the  program is working.   Right now, that is neither collected or reported in any systematic  fashion.   Why not? Why don't these pretrial release programs in the country  say: Yes. It is working. Everybody comes back, or a great percentage  comes back. Or: No. It is not working. People disappear. They commit  crimes. We don't know, Mr. Speaker.   All this bill does is help pretrial release let us know and let them  know and the public know, is the pretrial release program working in  that jurisdiction?   You are using Federal money to operate the program, therefore, report  back to the Federal Government on how that program is working or not  working.   It doesn't change the pretrial release program, except it requires  accountability. For too long, we have not allowed or required  accountability of what takes place under the pretrial release program.   It does not collect data on each pretrial release defendant to  determine if these agencies are effective in ensuring that defendants  adhere to their pretrial requirements and whether the defendants  actually show up for trial. It collects it on all defendants that the  pretrial release program must report to the Federal Government.   Congress must be able to determine the effectiveness of these  programs, and without basic information like this, Congress can't  ensure that the programs are working around the country.   Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers need to know if their resources are being  spent wisely, and that communities are being protected.   There have been numerous cases where individuals were released on  pretrial release bonds, and they had a long criminal record, and they  commit another offense.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter regarding pretrial  release programs.                                                   October 27, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Grassley,      Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Gentlemen: We are writing to express our strong support for       HR 2152, the Citizens Right to Know Act, sponsored by Rep.       Ted Poe (R-TX). The legislation has been referred to the       House Judiciary Committee.        This legislation is long overdue. It requires pre-trial       release agencies receiving federal funds to report to the       Department of Justice, who participates in their programs,       including participant:        Criminal history, including previous charges filed        Previous failures to appear for trial        Previous and current non-compliance infractions        Currently these pre-trial release programs aren't required       to report any information about the defendants released       through their programs. Basic information on defendants is       neither collected nor reported in any systematic fashion. The       DOJ only collects data from pre-trial release agencies       related to crime rates and trends in the aggregate. It does       not collect data on specific participants and programs. Thus,       there is no mechanism to determine if pre-trial release       agencies are effective in ensuring that defendants adhere to       their pre-trial release requirements or whether these       defendants actually show up for trial.        Without this legislation, policymakers and taxpayers have       no ability to determine the effectiveness of taxpayer-funded       pre-trial release programs. And without such data, hundreds       of federally funded pretrial release programs lack sufficient       accountability to U.S. taxpayers. This lack of accountability       has allowed many repeat and violent offenders to get out of       jail on our tax dollars.        Until the 1960's, principal options for the accused were       ROR (release on one's own recognizance) commercial bail or       incarceration. Commercial bail ensured the appearance of the       defendant in court at no cost to the taxpayer. Pre-trial       release programs began in the 1960's for the purpose of       securing release for indigent, non-violent offenders who       couldn't afford monetary bail.        However, over the last four decades, pre-trial release       programs have expanded well beyond their original scope and       purpose. Today there are over 300 pre-trial release programs       nationwide whose participants routinely include violent and       repeat offenders, many of whom are able post a commercial       bond and have done so in the past. In many instances, the       federal government has become a major source of funding for       pre-trial release programs.        If Congress continues to fund pre-trial release programs,       then Congress must be able to determine the effectiveness of       such programs. Taxpayers deserve to know if their limited       resources are being spent wisely and their communities are       being protected.        We believe swift passage of H.R. 2152 will provide greater       transparency for pre-trial programs, greater accountability       for taxpayer funds, and increased public safety for our       communities.            Sincerely,          Patricia Wenskunas, Crime Survivors; Mark Klaas, Father             of Polly Klaas, Klaas Kids Foundation; Ronald Lampard,             Criminal Justice Reform, Reform Task Force, American             Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC); Jim Backlin,             Christian Coalition; Colin Hanna, Let Freedom Ring; Kay             Daily, Coalition for a Fair Judiciary; Susan Carleson,             American Civil Rights Union; Harriett Salerno, Crime             Victims United; Beverly Warnock, Parents of Murdered             Children; Gary Bauer, American Values; Jim Gilmore,             Free Congress/American Opportunity Foundation; Beth             Chapman, Professional Bail Agents Association; Larry             Cirignano, Children First Foundation.     Mr. Speaker, the Citizens Right to Know Act simply  states that if a State or local jurisdiction is going to use Federal  money for a pretrial release program, they must report to the Federal  Government information on who participates in the program, the criminal  records of those individuals, the appearance rate at trial, and the  previous failure to appear of those programs.   I also want to be clear that any State or local jurisdiction that  does not report this information will lose the portion of Federal funds  which they use for pretrial release programs only. Other Federal funds  will not be affected that go to, for example, Byrne grants. I just want  to clear that up because my friend, Ms. Jackson Lee, mentioned that  they are going to lose all Federal funds. No. They just lose the funds  that apply to Federal pretrial release programs if they don't report  those statistics.   There is some question about the privacy of individuals. If States  have a law to protect the privacy of certain persons on pretrial  release, this bill does not change that. This bill says that if the  State has those privacy laws for individuals, which some do, that is  fine. That will not be affected or overruled by this Federal law.   I think that this legislation is necessary to see if these programs  are working. If they are working, maybe we ought to expand them. If  they are not working, maybe Congress needs to reform the pretrial  release program.   This legislation enjoys widespread support. One of those supporters  is the National Association of Police Organizations. I include in the  Record a letter indicating their support.                                             National Association of                                       Police Organization, Inc.,                                        Alexandria, VA, May 9, 2017.      Hon. Ted Poe,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Poe: On behalf of the National Association       of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to you to       express our support for the Citizens' Right to Know Act of       2017, H.R. 2152.  [[Page H3861]]         NAPO is a coalition of police unions and associations from       across the United States that serves to advance the interests       of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal       advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,       NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and       associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and       more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to       fair and effective crime control and law enforcement.        Each year, millions of dollars in federal grant monies go       towards state and local pre-trial release programs, which       allow accused criminals to await their trial at home, rather       than in jail These programs, which in many cases serve       repeat, dangerous criminals, often operate with little       oversight, putting public safety at risk. Increased oversight       of these programs would decrease the possibility of the       accused committing crimes while on pretrial release or simply       disappearing to avoid facing justice.        The Citizens' Right to Know Act addresses the lack of       oversight of these programs by mandating that federally-      funded pre-trial service agencies publicly report on program       participants, including if they have a history of criminal       behavior, whether they appear for their trail, and whether       they have ever previously failed to appear for trial. As       federal dollars are going towards bailing out criminals, this       Act helps ensure that the accused face justice and our       communities are protected.        We look forward to working with you to pass this important       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                William J. Johnson,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this so we can know  exactly what is taking place with Federal funds that are being used to  keep people and let people, as Ms. Jackson Lee pointed out, out of jail  without having to use some other type of system. And if it is working,  let's expand it. If it is not working, maybe Congress needs to be  involved to make sure that people do show up for trial, because that is  the whole key of a bond, is to release the person under some type of  bond, like a pretrial release bond, but we want them to appear in  court.   I had cases in my court where people were released on pretrial  release bonds; they would show up for trial. I had cases in my court  where they were released on pretrial release bonds, and they are still  running loose years later.   We don't know the statistics of who is released and who comes back  and who is released who never comes back.   This legislation just wants a report to Congress so we can decide on  reforms if necessary in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me time.    Mr. Speaker, when a person is arrested and charges  are filed, usually, now, in our country, they don't sit in jail waiting  to see a judge for weeks or months. They see a judge within 24 hours.  They appear in court. The judge sets bail. This is all public record,  including the name and what the person is accused of. It is already  public record. So it is not something that is new.   The judge sets bail and determines if the person can afford a lawyer  or not and appoints a lawyer right then, within 24 hours. I think that  is marvelous in our country. I remember the old days when that did not  happen.   This idea that we are denying a person's right of privacy, it is  public already, people who are charged with crimes.   My friend from Georgia said pretrial release works. It is a proven  thing to work. Well, how does he know that? Because he says so? We  don't know if it works or not.   Mr. Speaker, in April of 2017, 26-year-old Christian Rogers was  walking along the street in New Jersey and he was shot 22 times. His  assailant, Jules Black, a 30-year-old from Vineland, New Jersey, had  just been arrested 4 days earlier by the State police and charged with  possession of a handgun. He was released on pretrial release and had a  long criminal record.   Christian Rogers is just one example of a victim who was killed  because of the pretrial release program. So I would disagree with my  friend from Georgia that it is working. We don't know the statistics.   I told you this earlier when I spoke. I was a judge in Harris County  for 22 years. People were released on pretrial release. The very people  who are released on pretrial release are the people that my friend from  Texas is talking about: people who can't afford a surety bond, people  who can't afford any kind of bond.   So pretrial release serves its purpose and it serves it to a specific  part of the community, but we need to know if it is working, if these  people come back for their day in court or they don't come back for  their day in court or if they commit a crime while they are on pretrial  release. We don't know the statistics.   All this legislation says is let's audit pretrial release across the  country and see if it is working, see if it is not working, see if we  can make improvements. That is all it is. It is an audit. It is not  denying anybody any rights under the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I think the legislation is a good idea. We need to know  if taxpayer money is working. I appreciate the extra time the chairman  has given me.   Mr. Speaker, that is just the way it is.
