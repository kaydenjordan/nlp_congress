 Mr. President, I join my colleague in supporting this  very important reauthorization, the Native American Housing Assistance  and Self-Determination Act, NAHASDA. This has been 10 years in the  making. This has seen process, this has seen input, this has seen  extraordinary effort, and, as the chairman of the Indian Affairs  Committee has noted, this process has led to a place where we were able  to incorporate this into the NDAA last Congress. Earlier this year, we  moved it out of committee by voice vote.   We need to move it. People need housing. It is a priority in so many  of our States. I thank those who have been working with us over the  years to  [[Page S3725]]  accomplish this, and I would ask for strong support in this body for  housing within our American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian  communities.
