 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from New  York for yielding me this time. I thank the chair, as well, for his  work on this effort. I thank my friend and colleague from Ohio (Mr.  Chabot) for his work on putting this resolution together. I know Mr.  Levin, Ms. McCollum, and others, have also expressed a tremendous  interest in this issue, and I am very pleased and happy about that.    In late August, after attacks on outposts, Burma's military and  security forces launched a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against  the Rohingya in Burma. The response has been grossly disproportionate.  The attacks by the military against the Rohingya civilians have been  systematic, organized, and ruthless.   Amnesty International says:         The Myanmar military has killed hundreds of Rohingya women,       men, and children, including babies; raped women and girls;       and carried out targeted burning of entire villages.    And that is just what we know of.   The authorities have terrorized the Rohingya people so cruelly that  more than 600,000 Rohingya people have fled Burma to neighboring  Bangladesh. Even before the attacks, the Rohingya were often  effectively denied access to proper healthcare and education, as the  chairman has indicated, many just barely getting by.   But the most disturbing thing of all, at least so far, there is no  light at the end of this tunnel. Still today, Burma's authorities are  blocking adequate humanitarian aid to many who need it, denying  critical food aid to many men, women, and children.   As a result, those Rohingya who do remain in Burma are getting  hungrier, they are getting weaker, and they are becoming even more  vulnerable. But instead of trying to resolve the issue, many  authorities are denying that this has happened at all.   So, Mr. Speaker, I have had enough. I think we have all had enough.  The United States certainly cannot solve every problem in the world,  but there are some things that we can and that we must do. Imposing  sanctions against the perpetrators of atrocities in Burma is one of the  things that we must do.   Doing so will send an important signal that we are watching and we  are not standing by idly. It will signal that we want to see the  recommendations of former Secretary General Kofi Annan carried out. It  will signal that there is a cost to pay for carrying out atrocities. It  will signal that the world won't simply turn away.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum  recently released an important report on the Rohingya, called, ``They  Tried to Kill Us All.'' The title should say it all, ``They Tried to  Kill Us All.'' What clearer message do we need before we act? The time  for action is now.   I also want to thank the Government of Bangladesh for the  humanitarian relief to the Rohingya people that they have offered.   I want to call on our friend, Aung San Suu Kyi, to do everything that  she can to protect the Rohingya from further ethnic cleansing and  genocide.   I want to thank Pope Francis for his courage in speaking out and  using the term ``Rohingya.''   I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.   I thank my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee for giving  this issue the attention that it needs and deserves.
