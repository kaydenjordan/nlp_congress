 Mr. Speaker, I want to rise in the wake  of the devastation of Hurricane Florence to profoundly thank the  bipartisan leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee, of the Appropriations Committee, and of the House for  working with North Carolina's Governor and with our bipartisan  congressional delegation to include $1.68 billion in Community  Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery funding to help communities  in North Carolina, South Carolina, and across the country recover from  natural disasters declared in calendar year 2018.   CDBG-DR funding is critical for restoring housing, business, and  infrastructure affected by Hurricane Florence. These funds constitute a  robust down payment, and I look forward to working with colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to complete the job once full estimates are  available.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to say it is very, very reassuring--it is  heartening--to the people of North Carolina and South Carolina to have  this commitment from the Congress of the United States as our long  process of recovery begins.
