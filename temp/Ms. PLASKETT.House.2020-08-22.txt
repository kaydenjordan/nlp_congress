 Madam Speaker, first, I thank the Postal workers across  this Nation who work so tirelessly to ensure we receive our mail in a  timely fashion and are now doing it under tremendous difficulty. Almost  every business, from the largest corporation to the smallest hometown  operation, relies on the Postal Service.   But for those businesses, those families--medicine, food, and goods  are in jeopardy, not from a foreign adversary and not from war, but  from attack within our borders, from those in charge, from the  Postmaster General.   Why?   What is the primary purpose?   It is to subvert an election.   Today and Monday we will combat that attack. We will give the funding  and the procedures necessary to restore and support the U.S. Post  Office.   We have also responded to the unanimous request of the Trump- appointed Postal Board of Governors for $25 billion in much-needed  emergency operational relief.   For over 200 years, neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night  has stayed these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed  rounds. Let it not be on our watch that this legacy ends.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today we vote on a bill that would block  an attack on the U.S. Postal Service. By doing so we are blocking an  attack on an American institution, on our American way of life, and on  democracy. By responding to the unanimous requests of the Trump- appointed Board of Governors of the Postal Service for a funding of $25  billion and restoring operations to January 1 levels, we will literally  be saving lives.   The necessity of this vote and the necessity of this legislation  shows the peril to our democracy that this administration has placed us  all in, our elders, our veterans, our businesses, and our vote.   We will go further than just voting, and we will have that hearing on  Monday on the Oversight and Reform Committee led by Chairwoman Maloney  to speak with the Postmaster General to examine some of his, shall we  say, creative decisions.   We want to examine the operational and organizational changes at the  Postal Service that have resulted in delivery delays across the  country, including the delays of goods and services for small  businesses and families, as well as critical medicines.   In my district of the Virgin Islands we are hostage to the U.S.  Postal Service. We cannot drive to big-box stores, never mind medicines  for our elders or our veterans.   We will review the impact of these changes on the rights of eligible  Americans to cast their vote through the mail in the November  elections, but we will also have a few closing questions for Mr. DeJoy.   Is Mr. DeJoy thinking about that senior who won't receive their  medicine on time due to his policies?    Has he thought about the veteran who served our Nation and can't get  their prescriptions to heal?   Has he considered rural Americans who have to drive 20 miles to the  nearest post office?   Has he thought about any of these people?   Or is he, like the President, only concerned about his own self- interest?
