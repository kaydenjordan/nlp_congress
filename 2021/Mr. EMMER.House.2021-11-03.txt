 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of St. Cloud  area school district superintendent Willie Jett. Willie will be  retiring from his role as superintendent at the end of this school  year, ending 8 years in service to the district.   During his tenure, Willie has been an advocate for students, a leader  for faculty, and an ally to parents. When the district experienced  challenges, Willie focused on a student-centric approach to education.  Willie's leadership prioritized the performance of each student and  provided the support they needed to thrive.   Willie led the St. Cloud school district through times of crisis and  change. He helped schools rebuild after fires and successfully  navigated the COVID-19 crisis. Willie oversaw the construction of the  new St. Cloud Tech High School and an early childhood education center.  Willie even participated in one of our Congressional telephone  townhalls to answer questions about remote learning for families across  the St. Cloud community.   Willie remains a friend and leader in our community. Willie's  presence in the St. Cloud school district will be missed.   Madam Speaker, I thank Willie for all of his work, and I wish him  good luck in the next chapter of his life.                            ____________________
