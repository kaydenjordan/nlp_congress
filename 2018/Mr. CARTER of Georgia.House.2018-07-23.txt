 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague's bill, the  ACCESS BROADBAND Act.   Mr. Tonko's legislation would move to establish an office of Internet  Connectivity and Growth at the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration to coordinate and track Federal funding for  broadband across every agency.   This is important because the Federal Government's grant system can  oftentimes be confusing and disjointed, making it difficult for  communities and organizations to find grants they may be eligible for.  As a result, they may be losing out on opportunities, especially when  it comes to broadband needs.   Our rural communities continue to struggle, and one area that has  been proven to be a boon is access to high-speed internet. By  encompassing all of these grants into one area, we can help assist  communities and organizations across the country in their search for  Federal grant funding.   Access to broadband is a recipe for growth, allowing people to take  and create new opportunities that may not have been there before. That  is why I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Sergeant First Class Christopher Celiz, who passed away in the line  of duty at the age of 32.   Sergeant Celiz was assigned to Hunter Army Airfield in the First  Congressional District of Georgia.   On July 12, he was struck by enemy small arms fire during a combat  operation in Afghanistan. Sergeant Celiz was immediately taken for  medical treatment, but passed away from his injuries.   His regiment commander described him as always leading from the front  and being a national treasure who led his Rangers with passion,  confidence, and an infectiously positive attitude.   A husband and father, I will keep Sergeant Celiz's family in my  thoughts and prayers.   Because of Sergeant Celiz's service and bravery, he has been awarded  the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service Medal.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in discussing how  Americans are better off now.   Two years ago, I told the First District of Georgia about our Better  Way Agenda, our bold agenda to tackle some of our Nation's greatest  challenges and improve the lives of everyday Americans.   Now, 2 years later, I am thrilled Americans are experiencing the  results. We have instituted sound, progrowth policies, and the economy  is booming.   Now people are no longer asking: Where are the jobs? Instead, thanks  to tax reform, rolling back burdensome regulations, and more, we have  more job openings than job seekers.   Just last week, I visited a local business called Game Changers, with  locations in Richmond Hill and Savannah. While there, I learned their  revenue is up at both of their locations. They are hiring new employees  at both locations, and they have increased wages and given bonuses to  their employees.   It is incredible to hear these stories of how local small businesses  and hardworking Georgians are thriving again.   That is not all. As the proud Representative of every branch of the  military, I have been fighting for our troops, veterans, and military  families because they deserve better. Republicans have taken historic  actions to rebuild our military and fix the VA.   After years of neglect, we have provided new investments in training,  equipment, and personnel to reverse the damage of the last decade.  Members of our military put their lives on the line for our country,  and we are working to provide the support to ensure they are the most  well-prepared and well-equipped force on the planet.   Finally, we have made major strides to make our communities safer,  including fighting the opioid epidemic. The House has passed more than  50 bills combating this crisis that is killing 115 Americans every day.   The list goes on and on. House Republicans are fighting every day for  Americans in Washington to deliver results, not rhetoric. I hear it  from small businesses, big businesses, and citizens in the First  District all the time. Americans are truly better off now.
