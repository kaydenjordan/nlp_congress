 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and  legacy of Dick Griffin, a towering figure in Buffalo's legal community  and one of our leading citizens.   Dick worked to make Buffalo a more just place as a champion of the  civil rights movement in the courtroom and as a trusted adviser to  national and local civil rights leaders.   An attorney for 64 years, he was admired and respected widely for his  talent, capability, and legal mind, so much so that later in his  career, he was called upon to arbitrate some of the toughest regional  legal issues, including that of compensation for the victims of the  tragedy of Flight 3407.   He cared deeply about his community and played an active role in  civic and philanthropic efforts to improve parks, public spaces, and  whole neighborhoods.   We mourn the loss of Dick Griffin today and extend our condolences to  his wife and my friend, Dr. Jane Griffin, and their children Mary,  Anne, Thomas, and Richard.
