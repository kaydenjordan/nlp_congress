 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, as you know, the greater Houston area, my  home, was devastated by Hurricane Harvey. That was 10 months ago. We  are still working to recover, and Texas is not alone. Florida, Georgia,  Louisiana, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands  were impacted by a shattering hurricane season.   And we can't just focus on the last storm season. The 2018 hurricane  season started on June 1. Tropical Storm Alberto hit the Florida  Panhandle on May 25, 6 days before hurricane season. NOAA says that  there is a 75 percent chance this Atlantic hurricane season will be  near or above normal.   That is why we must act now to prevent damage from huge floods like  Harvey. Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the Bipartisan  Budget Act to provide critical Army Corps funds to rebuild our  communities and prepare for the next storm. Even though that money has  been allocated, the work has not begun. While that is partly due to red  tape at the Corps, once work begins, we need to move that process  quickly.   My amendment is simple. It says that the Army Corps needs to expedite  previously authorized projects in the declared disaster areas of Texas,  Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.  Virgin Islands. These projects will provide critical help for  communities that are still recovering and mitigate future flooding and  damage.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al  Green).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member  DeFazio for clearing the way for this amendment to be voted on on the  House floor.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues who cosponsored this amendment,  and I ask all of my colleagues to vote for this flood protection  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
