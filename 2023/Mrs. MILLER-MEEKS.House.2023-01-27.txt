 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Iowa  Biodiesel Board on their recognition by the Clean Fuels Alliance  America for their contributions to clean energy.   Since the Iowa Biodiesel Board was created in 2007, they have been  instrumental in making Iowa the number one biodiesel producing State in  the country.   Biofuels are critical in the United States' goal of energy  independence. They have created jobs throughout Iowa and the country  and reduced overall greenhouse gas emissions.   I am proud to represent a State that recognizes the advantages of  biofuels and organizations like the Iowa Biodiesel Board for promoting  biodiesel throughout the country.   As we continue pursuing clean energy production, I hope my colleagues  will look to Iowa and organizations such as the Iowa Biodiesel Board as  an example of an ``any-of-the-above'' approach.   In order to leave a cleaner, healthier planet for our children and  grandchildren, we must enact policies that promote a variety of energy  sources where they work best.   I want to congratulate Iowa Biodiesel Board for their commitment  toward clean energy and being a recipient of the Clean Fuels Initiative  Award.                            ____________________
