 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the  chairman of the Conservative Party of New York and my good friend, Mike  Long, who has stepped down from this position after decades of service.   Mike Long was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in southern  Queens. In 1959, Mike Long dropped out of the 12th grade to enlist in  the United States Marine Corps. He felt strongly that his duty was to  our country.   That commitment to sacrifice and service above self is a common  thread throughout Chairman Long's life. He served on the New York City  Council for a term representing Brooklyn, and he stepped up to become  chairman of the Conservative Party, a position he held for 30 years,  which is a testament to his character, commitment, work ethic, and  determination to stand up for his principles.   He is a lifelong advocate for limited government, economic freedom  and opportunity, constitutional liberties, and improving the lives of  everyday, hardworking New Yorkers. He is one of the rare political  leaders in New York who has earned deep respect from both his political  allies and his political opponents.   I am proud to count him as a true friend, and I want to thank him,  his wife, Eileen, and his family for his lifetime of service to New  York State and the United States of America.                            ____________________
