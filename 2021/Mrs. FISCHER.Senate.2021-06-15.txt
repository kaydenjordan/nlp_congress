 Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about  S. 1.   This bill says that politicians and unelected bureaucrats who spend  their entire careers in the same few square miles of Washington, DC,  know how to run Nebraska's elections better than Nebraskans. I was glad  to see the senior Senator from West Virginia come out against S. 1 and  provide some much-needed honesty about what some Democrats' true  intentions are with this bill.   I think he summed up this issue well when he wrote in his op-ed:  ``Today's debate about how to best protect our right to vote and to  hold elections, however, is not about finding common ground, but  seeking partisan advantage.''   As I said at the Rules Committee's markup for S. 1 a few weeks ago, I  simply cannot understand why so many of my Democratic colleagues would  like to hand over the control of our elections to the Federal  Government.   To take one example, this bill would allow candidates for the Senate  to receive Federal funding for their campaigns through a new program  supported by Federal dollars. That would include a 6-to-1 match for  contributions up to $200, meaning that, if a donor gives $100, Federal  dollars coming from taxpayers would match that with $600 more.   During the bill's markup, I offered an amendment to prevent sitting  Members of the Senate from benefiting from this windfall, but it was  rejected by all of my Democratic colleagues on the committee. This does  not help voters make informed decisions. This only helps those of us  who are already here in Congress. The changes S. 1 proposes only get  more radical from there.   This bill would effectively turn the bipartisan six-member Federal  Election Commission--the agency that oversees the financing of Federal  elections--into a five-person panel subject to partisan control by  giving the sitting President the power to appoint an independent fifth  Commissioner to the agency. Because only a slim majority would then be  needed to make a decision, this Commissioner could act as the deciding  vote on issues that have historically been bipartisan.   If Senate Republicans were still in the majority and I told you that  our leader wanted to pass a bill that would tip the balance of the FEC  toward our party, those on the other side would object, and they would  be right to do so. This Commission must remain truly bipartisan, and  that is done by having equal Democratic and Republican membership.   S. 1 would also repeal an appropriations amendment that helps ensure  the IRS does not infringe on the First Amendment rights of taxpayers  who contribute to nonprofits. Allowing the IRS to possess this  information when it is not a campaign finance enforcement agency only  empowers bad actors at the agency to target groups that it dislikes.  This is especially problematic given the recent leak of sensitive  taxpayer information, and the IRS's history of targeting tax-exempt  applicants solely based on their political leanings.   Also, this bill would not only allow people to register to vote at a  polling place on election day without presenting any form of  identification, it would tell the 36 States that have some form of  voter ID laws on the books now that those laws would be illegal. This  is despite the fact that a majority of Americans supports requiring  photo ID  [[Page S4538]]  to vote, and it flies in the face of the practices of other  democracies, like Germany, the United Kingdom, Norway, and France,  which all require voters to verify their identities before casting  their ballots.   Despite all of the revolutionary changes this bill proposes, the most  disheartening thing might be that it was introduced to solve a problem  that doesn't actually exist. More people voted in last year's elections  than ever before, including a record 76 percent of voters in my State  of Nebraska. In the middle of a pandemic, voters turned out in historic  numbers to make their voices heard.   Defenders of this bill can't say that this turnout was an issue, so  they have tried to scapegoat States like Georgia and Florida, which  have recently passed new election laws. President Biden went as far as  to call Georgia's bill ``Jim Crow in the 21st century'' before  admitting that he was speaking about a very early draft, not the bill  that actually became law.   Reality gets in the way of that narrative, too, as Georgia's bill is  less restrictive than the laws of more liberal States like New York and  Delaware. Reasonable people can disagree about the best way to conduct  elections, but it is disingenuous to say that something is voter  suppression or undemocratic just because you may not agree with it.   I hope we can agree that we all want to make sure that all American  voters are able to make their voices heard in our elections. To see  that in action, you only have to look at States like Nebraska. We have  been a ``no excuse'' State for absentee and early voting for years,  which means that anyone who has already provided an ID when registering  to vote can vote by mail for any reason whatsoever. In fact, a bill  that originally allowed for mail-in voting in Nebraska was the first  bill I introduced and passed as a State legislator in 2005.   Many other States go out of their way to make it easy to vote,  regardless of which party is in power and regardless of whether they  are red States or blue States. That is the beauty of the American  system. Each State can do as it sees fit and respond to events like the  COVID-19 pandemic while still producing positive reforms. By keeping  States free from Federal mandates, we are allowing them to innovate and  introduce the changes that work best for them.   Washington, DC, isn't what makes America great. Our 50 States, each  with its own history and its own needs, are what make this country so  unique.   This bill jeopardizes that diversity, and it would do away with a  system that works well and replace it with one that would be partisan,  divisive, and, frankly, chaotic.   I think we would be making a terrible mistake if we pass S. 1 as it  is currently written.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to recognize the  100th anniversary of Oregon Trail Days. This Nebraska tradition honors  our State's history as one of the first stops on the Oregon Trail.  Settlers would start their journey on the banks of the Missouri River,  passing through Kansas before turning north into Nebraska. Their  journey took them through hundreds of miles of central and western  Nebraska, including past Chimney Rock, the most noted landmark on the  Oregon Trail's nearly 2,200 miles.   Oregon Trail Days has commemorated this pioneer history every year  since 1921, when it started as a small, 1-day parade. Today, this  festival has grown into a 4-day celebration that takes over the town of  Gering in the Nebraska Panhandle for 1 weekend each July. Oregon Trail  Days has something for everyone: Visitors can enjoy concerts, parades,  an arts and crafts fair, sporting events, food shows, car exhibitions,  and even a chili cook-off. This is a wonderful opportunity to get  together and remember the adventurous spirit of the pioneers who  settled our land, and who built strong communities for their families  across Nebraska.   Mr. President, I am honored to commemorate the 100th anniversary of  Oregon Trail Days here in the Senate. Here is to 100 more years of this  beloved tradition.                            ____________________
