 Madam President, we are here today because  Republicans are seeking a national ban on abortion. And if we say it  once here, we should say it 10 times, 100 times, because literally  months ago it would have been virtually unimaginable--first, that Roe  v. Wade would be struck down and, second, that Republicans would  propose a national ban on abortion.   Women across Connecticut and the country are scared and angry. And to  those who say those fears and outrage are illusory or unjustified, all  you have to do is read their words. Listen to what they say. They are  promising the American people that there will be a national ban on  abortion.   And to the people of Connecticut who think we have a safe haven  because our legislature and Governor have courageously established  protections for Roe v. Wade and for women who come to Connecticut  seeking abortion services and for doctors who depend on our safeguards,  there will be no safe haven in this country--none, nowhere--if  Republicans go where they say, explicitly, they are heading.   I trust women with their doctors and their clergy and their family to  make decisions about when and whether to become pregnant, whether to  have children, and when to terminate a pregnancy short of term. I trust  women--not the government, not politicians--to make these preeminently  important decisions.   And I promise the people of Connecticut I will not back down. I will  not stand for this kind of national ban on abortion.   Republicans have said, historically: We will let the States decide.  It should be a matter of State legislatures making these decisions.   This ban on abortion takes away power from women and from States,  contrary to their promises over years and years about States' rights.  But more than a theoretical or hypothetical argument about the powers  of State legislatures or the allocation of responsibility in our  Federal system, this law will have destructive and catastrophic  consequences for millions of women. It will impair the everyday lives  of women and families across America.   It is not just a woman's issue. It is on all of us to say we will not  back down; we will not stand for a national ban on abortion.   It is part of a tireless and seemingly boundless campaign against  women's rights, but these attacks on reproductive rights and personal  freedom apparently know no limits. Remember, first, Republican- controlled State legislatures moved to outlaw abortion entirely,  forcing women suffering from ectopic pregnancies to bleed out in  hospitals and refusing to care for child rape victims. But now  Republicans are moving forward with plans to ban abortion everywhere,  under any circumstances, and they are wresting a woman's right to make  her own personal healthcare decision, sometimes a decision made during  a devastating medical diagnosis out of her hands, putting those  decisions into government's hands.   Make no mistake, the 15 weeks--all of the technical stuff that  Republicans invoke, doesn't take away from the fact that it is a  national ban that will eviscerate Connecticut's law. Congressional  Republicans will decide whether or not women can access this vital  help.   Eliminating access to abortion services as a result of the Dobbs  decision has already caused devastating consequences. The loss of  reproductive services in some States has caused a ripple effect for  healthcare providers across the United States, which proves, for anyone  who doubted, that banning reproductive services doesn't stop women from  seeking those services. It just adds additional barriers and danger. In  fact, it unnecessarily puts their lives at risk.   This bill would place a ban on abortion across the country, and it  would include New York and Massachusetts, not just Connecticut and  Delaware. Go across the country and pick those States where these  rights have been protected.   When I was in the State legislature, and then as attorney general, I  helped write the law that incorporates and codifies Roe v. Wade in  Connecticut statute. And now Connecticut has moved beyond that statute  to provide a safe haven. But all of it would be gone. All of it would  be overwritten by this law.   Americans should have no doubt about where Republicans stand now on  this issue. They want to punish women. They want to punish doctors.  They will do it at the State level. They will do it at the national  level. No State, not even Connecticut, is safe from this threat. They  are coming after our laws in Connecticut. They are coming after women  in Connecticut and men who believe in the rights of women as a matter  of constitutional and personal freedom to make these decisions.   Our laws should protect the rights of women seeking to make their own  personal decisions about their reproductive health in consultation with  medical providers, and I will fight tooth and nail this effort and any  other effort that seeks to control, criminalize, and dehumanize women  making this choice and the healthcare providers compassionately giving  them care.    The American people are in our corner. American people--whatever they  may think about abortion in their own lives, for their own family, for  their daughters or wives or others--they support the rights of those  women to control their own healthcare decision. It is an intensely  personal decision, when it has to be made, and sometimes a threat of  life, something going horribly wrong in a pregnancy, is the reason for  it.   I will continue to fight for all in Connecticut who believe in this  fundamental right. It is a matter of our constitutional DNA in  Connecticut, beginning with Griswold v. Connecticut, which laid the  groundwork for the right of privacy which is the underpinning for that  constitutional freedom. And all of us, I hope, will reject this effort  to ban abortion in the United States.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Mr.  Curtis D. Robinson, a long-time resident of Connecticut and outstanding  entrepreneur and philanthropist who turns 80 on September 21, 2022.   As a teenager, Mr. Robinson left Birmingham, AL, and the segregation  of the Jim Crow South, arriving in Hartford, CT, in 1958 with little  more than the clothes on his back. Mr. Robinson began working two full- time jobs and one part-time job and, after several years, was able to  purchase a grocery store at the age of 18. By the time he was 22, Mr.  Robinson also owned a restaurant, a cleaning service, an apartment  building, and a construction supply company. He used this experience to  start the Small Business Development Program in 1969, creating over 100  small businesses in the Hartford and Springfield areas. This remarkable  success is a testament to Mr. Robinson's extraordinary industrious  spirit and tremendous work ethic.   Today, Mr. Robinson is the owner, operator, and president of C&R  Development Company, the largest minority construction management  company on the east coast. He also owns several shops within Bradley  International Airport and runs other businesses, including R&G  Services, which operates the shuttle bus service at the airport, and  R&G Parking, which operates one of the largest parking lots in downtown  Hartford.   In addition to his entrepreneurial endeavors, Mr. Robinson is also an  advocate for health equity. As the cofounder and chairman of the Curtis  D. Robinson Center for Health Equity--CDRCHE--he expands the provision  of critical health services in underserved communities, serving over  10,000 people since 2010. Expanding on this firsthand experience in  addressing health inequities, Mr. Robinson sits on the boards of  Trinity Health of New England, Saint Francis Hospital and Medical  Center, and the Connecticut Hospital Association.   Mr. Robinson is also an extraordinary philanthropist and has  contributed greatly to the civic life of Connecticut. Along with his  wife, Mr. Robinson founded the Curtis and Sheila Robinson Foundation,  which provides financial support across a variety of areas--offering  assistance with food, rent, clothing, transportation, and scholarship  funds for individuals in need. Over the years, they have championed  many worthy causes, including efforts to combat food insecurity,  domestic violence, and poverty. The Robinsons have also assisted  individuals with medical and hospital care, donated buses to churches  and schools, and adopted a homeless shelter for displaced children.  Their charitable contributions are truly too numerous to list, and I  applaud their remarkable efforts to give back to their community.  [[Page S4612]]    Mr. Robinson's incredible achievements--building a life for himself  through hard work and determination--truly embody the American dream.  His willingness to use his hard-earned success to give back to others  serves as a model for all of us. I applaud his many accomplishments and  hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Mr. Curtis Robinson  on this milestone of his 80th birthday.                            ____________________
