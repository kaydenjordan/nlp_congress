 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S1191]]     Madam President, last week America lost Frank Robinson, a  baseball legend and a pioneer for civil rights. Frank Robinson spent  much of his career in Ohio. He starred first for the Cincinnati Reds  All-Star World Series championship team. They built a team around him  in Cincinnati with Vada Pinson and others. Near the end of his career,  he went to Cleveland, and he managed for the Cleveland Indians. He was  a pioneer for change in baseball.   Larry Doby, whom we honored last year with a Congressional Medal, was  the first African-American player in the American League. He played for  Cleveland. He came up only several weeks after Jackie Robinson broke  the color line.   Then in 1974, Frank Robinson became the Major League's first African- American manager. I was at the game when he--that first game he  managed. He hit a home run his first time at bat. He was the DH for the  Indians. He was what is called a player-manager.   In the days since his passing, we have heard people say that Frank  Robinson was one of the most underappreciated legends of the game, but  the same could also be said of his importance to our country. There are  few players in baseball who have accomplished anything close--on the  field or off the field--to what Frank Robinson did. He is the only  person to have won a league MVP in both the American and National  Leagues--with the National League for the Reds and with the American  League for the Orioles. He was Rookie of the Year with the Reds. He won  two World Series championships. He was the World Series' most valuable  player. He won the Triple Crown with the Orioles. He was a Gold Glove  winner. He was a 14-time all-star. He hit 600 career home runs.   The championships, the awards, and the records alone don't define who  Frank Robinson was or what his success meant to so many people. The  Reds signed him right out of high school. He still strove for more. He  took courses at Cincinnati's Xavier University at the beginning of his  rookie season. He knew that the courses wouldn't count toward any  degree; yet he persevered. He was traded to the Orioles in 1966. He  witnessed redlining and segregation that prevented him and his wife  from finding housing. Here was one of the best players in the Major  Leagues, and he couldn't find housing in Baltimore in the 1960s. Here  was the city's star baseball player, but because of our country's  racist housing policies, realtors wouldn't sell him a home.   Parenthetically, I would also point out that today some of those  racist housing policies continue and that we have an administration and  housing regulators who simply seem too busy to want to enforce fair  housing laws. My wife and I live in ZIP Code 44105 in Cleveland, OH.  Our ZIP Code had more foreclosures in the first half of 2007 than any  other ZIP Code in the United States. And don't think that some of these  housing problems and segregated housing in this country aren't because  of some of the actions of this administration and prior to that.   Frank Robinson didn't stay silent. He joined the NAACP and became a  voice for the civil rights movement. As I said, he was traded to the  Cleveland Indians in 1974. The Indians made him manager. As I said, he  was the first African-American manager in the history of Major League  Baseball. It took exactly 27 years after Jackie Robinson broke the  color line for the owners of Major League Baseball to actually hire a  Black manager--27 years.   That accomplishment meant so much to so many. He proved what never  should have been in question--that African Americans belong not just on  the field but that they are leaders, just like any other American. That  accomplishment resonated not only among baseball fans but, in fact, in  schools and offices around the country. He was a symbol to so many  young Americans that these roles of authority and leadership aren't  just roles that only certain kids whose skin was a certain color could  dream of; these dreams are for everyone. It was a powerful message that  paved the way for so many great leaders on and off the baseball field.   The Cleveland Indians unveiled a statue of Frank Robinson 2 years ago  in my hometown of Cleveland at Progressive Field. Mr. Robinson spoke at  the unveiling. He talked about how far we have come, and then he said:         There are people out there in the minor leagues and at the       big-league level as coaches, and they have earned their way       up. But they just don't seem to be able to break that barrier       as often. All I can tell them--don't give up. Do not give up.    We still don't see nearly as many African-American managers as there  should be.   As we celebrate Black History Month, we as a nation need to heed  Frank Robinson's words. We cannot give up on his dream of breaking down  the institutional barriers that are set up for people of color in  baseball and throughout our society. We don't just honor Black  trailblazers; we need to continue our country's unfinished work.   Hard work isn't paying off for far too many people in this country.  Hard work doesn't pay off for far too many workers, and women and  people of color have even greater challenges. It is even harder to get  ahead no matter how hard they work. We know that this country doesn't  respect work, it doesn't respect the dignity of work, and it doesn't  honor work. As I said, we know that as much as this country doesn't  compensate people for the work they do, it is, again, even harder for  women and people of color. Let's honor Frank Robinson's memory. Let's  honor the legacy of Black Americans not just with words but with  actions to change that.                        Parkland High School Shooting    Madam President, this Thursday will mark 1 year since 17 Americans  were tragically and brutally murdered at Parkland High School.  Seventeen families lost daughters, sons, brothers, and sisters, 17 more  were wounded, and hundreds of students and teachers joined the ranks of  survivors of mass shootings.   Those injured and those families will never be the same. One of the  country's greatest strengths is that out of the greatest tragedies,  Americans channel their outreach in grief into action.   The young people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School launched an  incredible movement for change in this country. These were high school  students, many not even old enough to vote, dealing with pain that most  of us can't imagine. They were able to do what so many, shall I say,  grown politicians have been unable or unwilling to do--something that  so many Members in this body are afraid or unwilling to do.   These kids stood up to the gun lobby--if only we saw that kind of  courage among politicians who take money from the gun lobby year after  year after year. These kids stood up to the gun lobby. They organized  and forced their government to listen.   A month after that awful day, more than a million Americans joined  the March for Our Lives and marches for our lives across the country.  They had a pretty simple demand: The people who represent them should  protect them from gun violence.   This body, again, did virtually nothing. They demand that we stop  ignoring the millions of Americans who want reasonable gun safety  measures. They demand that we stop doing the bidding of special  interest gun lobbyists.   We can't say we are doing what it takes to keep our country safe  until we are finally willing to pass commonsense laws to protect all  Americans from gun violence. Many of us have tried.   I supported the original Federal assault weapons ban in 1994. I  joined many of my colleagues to try to renew it after the Sandy Hook  grade school massacre. Weapons of war don't belong on our streets. They  certainly don't belong in our classrooms.   We tried to pass legislation to close loopholes in our background  check system. After the tragedy at the Pulse nightclub in Florida, we  tried to pass legislation to prevent people on the terrorist watch list  from buying guns.   Imagine this, if you are on the terrorist watch list and you go up to  the John Glenn Airport in Columbus, OH, you can't get on a plane, but  you can buy an assault weapon. You can't get on a plane if you are on a  terrorist watch list. That is Federal law. But because of the power of  the gun lobby in  [[Page S1192]]  this body and in this room, you can buy an assault weapon.   That is why the gun lobby, again, stood in the way. It is why the  movement that these students launched matters. They showed the country  that the gun lobby may have the money, but we have energy on our side,  and we have voters on our side.   Look what happened last fall. So many new voters--many of them young,  many of them women--were elected to this Congress promising, finally-- finally--to stand up to the gun lobby and finally to say no to the  National Rifle Association.   Creating change is never easy. It often requires going up against  powerful special interests, but from the Women's March to the airport  rallies, to the activism to protect people's rights under the  Affordable Care Act, Americans prove over and over the power of  activism.   The students at Parkland clearly aren't quitting. The millions of  Americans inspired by them give me hope for the future. I hope my  colleagues in this body finally stand up to the gun lobby and demand  change.                           Remembering Bill Brewer    Madam President, on Friday, Ohio laid to rest a dedicated public  servant, Detective Bill Brewer.   Detective Brewer devoted two decades of his life to the police force  and made the ultimate sacrifice to keep his fellow Ohioans safe. He  laid down his life while doing his job responding to a desperate 911  call with fellow Clermont County officers in southwest Cincinnati,  working to protect the people he served in Pierce Township.   In the days since Detective Brewer's passing, we have heard stories  of his unselfish service to his community and his family.   Last Sunday, officers from all over southwest Ohio joined the  procession escorting Detective Brewer home to Clermont County. In his  home of Amelia, OH, his community lined the route, paying tribute to  their fallen hero. Hundreds attended a memorial service on Friday,  while hundreds more watched on video. It is a fitting recognition of  the sacrifice this man made to keep the people of his community safe.   Detective Brewer was a proud son of Williamsburg, OH, and a star high  school athlete and a family man. Our hearts break for his wife of 13  years, Jamie, and his 5-year-old son, Braxton. As they mourn this  incredible loss, we hope they take comfort in the outpouring of support  and honor for the husband and father.   To his fellow officers, he was a devoted friend. He was a mentor. One  of them told the press that Detective Brewer was always fair and  kindhearted, that he would give the shirt off his back for anyone in  need. Detective Brewer's legacy will live on through the many lives he  touched.   In times of tragedy, Ohioans rise to the occasion, as do citizens in  Clermont County. We witnessed an outpouring of community support in the  days since he was taken from us. No gesture, of course, ever repays him  or his loved ones. Today we honor this hero's memory. We lift up the  entire Clermont County community.                                  Tax Reform    Madam President, what we have seen in the last few days is that more  and more Americans are filing their tax returns and getting their tax  refunds, and they realize that the President's tax law was a bit of a  sham. They haven't seen the raises that the President promised.   I heard the President in the Cabinet Room say to a group of us:  People will get a $4,000 raise, on average. Some will get as much as a  $9,000 raise with the tax bill.   Call it an empty promise or call it a lie. Either way, the  President's words were empty and meaningless.   Then they expected a huge tax cut because the President told them it  was hundreds and thousands of dollars. They are not seeing that either.  Then, to top it all off, there is a provision in this new tax law that  says if a company shuts down in Orange Town, OH, as GM did, and then  moves to Mexico, as GM is building again in Mexico, they actually get  50 percent off. They get a 50-percent-off coupon on their taxes.   What does that mean? That means that they are paying a 21-percent tax  rate in Ohio--Federal tax rate--but then they go to Mexico, and they  pay 10.5 percent. Believe it or not, under the President's tax law,  they get a 50-percent-off coupon if they move overseas--exactly the  opposite.   The President went to Youngstown, and he said: We are going to bring  more jobs back. We are going to have more jobs. Don't sell your homes  if it looks like there are layoffs coming because we are going to bring  more jobs back. We are going to build new factories.   None of that happened. The opposite happened. Again, they shut down  production in Lordstown, OH. GM did. They are laying off 5,000 people.  They are moving to Mexico, and they get a 50-percent-off coupon, thanks  to President Trump, thanks to the Members of this body and all  Republicans who voted for this disastrous tax bill.   Now, here is what we need to do. We need to throw out the Trump tax  law--just throw out the Trump tax law--and we should rewrite the Tax  Code, amazingly, to put people first.   Here is what we should do. We should first pass the Patriot  Corporation Act. The Patriot Corporation Act is really simple. It  simply says that if you pay decent wages, if you provide decent  benefits--health benefits, healthcare, and pensions or 401(k)--and if  you do your production in the United States of America, you get a lower  tax rate.   In other words, if you are a patriotic corporation, if you are good  citizen, then, you have earned a lower tax rate.   But the other side of that is that if you are a big company where the  executives are making millions--sometimes tens of millions of dollars-- and you pay your employees--if you have hundreds of employees or  thousands--$10 or $12 an hour, then you are in a different category.  Here is how that works. If you are making $10 or $12 an hour and you  are working for one of these big companies, you are eligible for food  stamps often, you are eligible for Medicaid often, you are eligible for  section 8 housing tax credits often, and you are eligible for the  earned income tax credit. In other words, these employees that are  making $10 or $12 an hour get all of these Federal benefits, even  though they are working full time. So what our bill does is what is  called the ``corporate freeloader fee.'' As for these companies that  pay their executives millions and pay their workers $8 and $10 and $12  an hour and those workers end up getting subsidies from taxpayers, they  pay a corporate freeloader fee. They pay the government. They reimburse  taxpayers for the subsidies that they give their employees.   I mean, why should all the people in the Gallery here, why should the  staff working here, who are paying Federal taxes, why should their  taxes go to an employer where the company is making millions and they  are paying their workers such low wages that they are eligible for food  stamps or section 8 housing vouchers or Medicaid or the earned income  tax credit?   The last two bills that we should pass, as we throw out the  President's tax law, is the earned income tax credit. If we double the  credit, we make millions more people eligible. It would mean thousands  of dollars in the pockets of tens of millions of Americans. It would  make a difference in their lives.   Instead of giving tax breaks to rich people, which is what Senate  Republicans and President Trump always want to do--the White House  looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives--and instead of giving  millions in tax breaks--actually, billions to the wealthiest people in  this country--why don't we make the tax system fair and put money in  the pockets of people making $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, or $50,000 a  year.   That is what our earned income tax credit expansion would do, and at  the same time, we should expand the child tax credit. Experts have said  that plan would cut child poverty in half. That gives kids who grow up  in my ZIP code, 44105, who are struggling, who live in homes with high  levels of toxic lead in the walls--kids who don't have the breaks in  their lives that my kids have--a fighting chance. It would lift half of  these kids out of child poverty.   Taken together, the Patriot Corporation Act, the corporate freeloader  fee, the earned income tax credit, and the child tax credit would  create a Tax Code that puts money in the pockets of working people,  would create opportunity for people to aspire to and join the middle  class, would raise wages,  [[Page S1193]]  and, equally importantly, would keep jobs in the United States of  America.   Why should this Congress keep passing legislation, as the President  asked, that would encourage the shutdown of plants here and moves  overseas? Why don't we reward companies that do the right thing? Why  don't we give kids opportunities and families opportunities so they can  get ahead? Why don't we put money in the pockets of working people,  raise wages, and keep jobs in the United States of America?   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
