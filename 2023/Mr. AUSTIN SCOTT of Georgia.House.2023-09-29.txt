 Mr. Speaker, I thought I would go ahead  and respond because I know as soon as I sit down, the gentlewoman from  Connecticut is going to talk about the schoolteachers in Georgia, and  my sister is one of them. She gets her check from the county, in case  you didn't know it. It kind of bothers me that you seem to think that  they get a check from the Federal Government. They actually get paid by  the county, as do our sheriff's deputies.    How did we get here? I have heard the left talk about the chaos  caucus that we have, candidly, as Republicans and what gives them the  power. It only takes five of them to create a disruption. How do five  get the power? The five in our party get the power because the 212 of  you on the Democratic side are going to vote with them to shut down the  government.   Now, a continuing resolution is a 30-day piece of legislation that I  will admit is not perfect, but it is better than a shutdown or the  chaos that comes with a shutdown.   The idea that we as Republicans and the American citizens have to eat  a $2 trillion deficit or else you are going to shut down the government  is absolutely ridiculous.   We are not at war. We are not in a recession. We are in no health  emergency. Show a little responsibility.
