 Mr. Speaker, I want to comment very briefly on the Federal  Aviation Reauthorization Act, which provides long-term stability for  our Nation's aviation community and critical investments in U.S.  airports. I have many, many issues in my district that this bill,  hopefully, will address.   Airplane noise is an issue that directly affects my constituents in  the East Bay. I have convened meetings with Federal and local  stakeholders to come up with a regional solution to airport noise in  the bay area.   This bill will help us make progress to address noise pollution and  ensure that my constituents can live under quiet skies. It would  establish a pilot program for the Department of Transportation to give  grants of up to $2.5 million to six airports for noise mitigation  projects. That is so important.   Also, I am pleased to see that the bill includes language that would  require the FAA to partner with higher education institutions to assess  the health effects of white noise.   While these changes may not reduce airplane noise immediately, we are  moving in the right direction. I look forward to working with the FAA  to ensure my constituents affected by airplane noise are addressed in a  timely fashion. This legislation is critical legislation to help  support America's innovation in aviation technology and will ensure  quieter skies for all.                            ____________________
