 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 6. I  am grateful for the opportunity to speak about it.   My amendment strikes language that would expand the classes of  healthcare workers who would be authorized to dispense narcotics for  narcotic treatment.   Let me be clear at the outset. H.R. 6 is, in large part, a great  bill; however, as currently written, it allows nurse specialists, nurse  midwives, and nurse anesthetists to prescribe buprenorphine. I believe  this is a significant and impulsive expansion of prescribing authority.   Allowing more providers with less clinical experience to provide  buprenorphine, a highly addictive opioid, opens up dangerous new  potential for increased opioid abuse. The point of H.R. 6 is to  decrease opioid abuse, but this provision increases the potential for  abuse and vastly increases the supply of a dangerous opioid that is one  of the major causes of opioid overdose and death in Europe.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity to bring these concerns to  light in this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter in support of my  amendment from The OTP Consortium.                                             The OTP Consortium,                                                      June 19, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Walden and Brady and Ranking Members Pallone       and Neal: On behalf of the Opioid Treatment Program (OTP)       Consortium we would like to offer our support for H.R. 6, the       Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid       Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities       Act. In particular, we strongly support Section 207 which       would provide Medicare beneficiaries with lifesaving       Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder       (OUD) in the highly-effective OTP setting. This policy was       introduced by Ranking Member Neal and Congressman George       Holding as part of H.R. 5776, the Medicare and Opioid Safe       Treatment (MOST) Act of 2018. The OTP Consortium is comprised       of nearly 350 OTPs across the country that provide care to       more than 140,000 patients daily in 37 states, including at       our 22 facilities in Massachusetts, 16 facilities in Texas,       nine facilities in Oregon, and two facilities in New Jersey.        OTPs are highly-regulated, highly-structured, comprehensive       treatment programs that provide MAT--which the National       Institutes of Health states is the most effective solution to       treat OUD. OTPs are the only provider where patients are       guaranteed to receive MAT--including individual and group       counseling, random toxicology screens, medication, and other       supportive services such as case management, primary care,       mental health services, HIV and Hepatitis C testing and more.        Medicare beneficiaries have the highest and fastest growing       rate of OUD, yet they do not currently have coverage for the       most effective form of treatment--H.R. 6 provides such       coverage. More than 300,000 Medicare beneficiaries have been       diagnosed with OUD--your legislation could end up saving       their lives and many more. Medicare hospitalizations due to       complications caused by opioid abuse or misuse increased 10%       every year from 1993 to 2012--your bill would help reverse       this alarming trend.        We do, however, have concerns about the policies contained       in Section 303. While we are pleased that the 275-patient       threshold was not codified, we do not support expanding or       making permanent buprenorphine prescribing authority to non-      physician providers before policymakers can fully analyze the       data resulting from the critical questions asked in       subsection (e). Americans need effective treatment and       decades of evidence and outcomes show that medication simply       assists the other treatment interventions. Medication should       never be the sole aspect of treating SUD--thus the term       Medication-Assisted Treatment. Office-based practices that       focus on medication alone run the risk of becoming the next-      generation pill mill. We hope that Congress will revisit       office-based buprenorphine prescribing thresholds once this       quality assessment has been completed and it can be       determined whether or not patients are indeed truly receiving       MAT in these settings. Improving access to buprenorphine is       important, but it must be paired with the evidence-based MAT       services that are proven to lead to recovery.        We support H.R. 6 and stand ready to work with you see that       this critical Medicare OTP benefit is signed into law,       without delay.            Sincerely,      Peter Morris,        Division President, Acadia Healthcare.      Alex Dodd,        CEO, Aegis Treatment Centers, LLC.      David White, Ph.D.,        CEO, BayMark Health Service.      Jay Higham,        CEO, Behavioral Health Group.      John Steinbrun,        CEO, New Season.     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Roe), the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas  (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Chair, buprenorphine was introduced in Finland in 1997,  and now it has become the most widely-abused opioid in that country.  Buprenorphine can kill people. It does kill people. And office-based  practices involving merely prescribing buprenorphine run a large risk  of harming patients, not helping them to recover.   In closing, I want to thank you for working with me on this  amendment, and I thank Chairman Walden for his gracious commitment to  continue to examine.   I yield back the balance of my time   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.
