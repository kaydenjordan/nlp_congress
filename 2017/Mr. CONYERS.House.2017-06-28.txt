 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1215 will do little to protect Americans' access  to safe and affordable healthcare. Instead, it will deny victims of  medical malpractice and defective medical products the opportunity to  be fully compensated for their injuries and to hold wrongdoers  accountable.   This legislation imposes various restrictions on lawsuits against  healthcare providers concerning the provision of healthcare goods or  services that would apply regardless of the merits of the case, the  misconduct at issue, or the severity of the victim's injury.   There are so many problems with this bill, but to begin with, this  bill would cause real harm by severely limiting the ability of victims  to be made whole. For instance, the bill's $250,000 aggregate limit for  noneconomic damages, an amount established more than  [[Page H5264]]  40 years ago pursuant to a California statute, would have a  particularly adverse impact on women, children, the poor, and other  vulnerable members of our society.   These groups are more likely to receive noneconomic damages in  healthcare cases because they are less able to establish lost wages and  other economic losses. Women, for example, are often paid at a lower  rate than men, even for the same job. Also, they are more likely to  suffer noneconomic loss, such as disfigurement or loss of fertility.  Imposing a severe limit on noneconomic damages, therefore, hurts them  disproportionately.                                time  1415    Finally, this bill is particularly harmful for veterans, members of  the military, and their families. Because the bill prevents State tort  law in any healthcare-related lawsuit that includes any coverage  provided by a Federal health program, all cases arising from  substandard care received in a Veterans Administration facility or a  military hospital would be subject to the bill's restrictions.   As a diverse coalition of veterans organizations noted in their  letter of opposition, H.R. 1215 would limit the ability of veterans and  military families to hold healthcare providers, drug manufacturers, and  medical products providers accountable for pain and suffering and death  that result from substandard care, preventable medical errors, and  defective drugs and devices.   For these and other reasons, I implore and urge my colleagues to  oppose H.R. 1215.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the most active Member in the 115th Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), a distinguished member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just have to add here that H.R. 1215 deeply intrudes on States'  sovereignty. In particular, H.R. 1215 preempts State law governing  joint and several liability, the availability of damages, the ability  to introduce evidence of collateral source benefits, attorneys' fees,  and periodic payments of future damages.   Members should not be fooled by assertions that the bill preserves  State law. In fact, the rule of construction contained in the bill  expressly states that it preempts State law, except in very limited  circumstances where State law is more favorable to defendants.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Chairman, I refer my colleague, the floor leader on  the other side to section 9 of the bill. We have just looked at it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Numerous consumer, labor, veterans, and legal groups all oppose H.R.  1215, including the AFL-CIO, the American College of Physicians, the  Consumers Union, Public Citizen, Vietnam Veterans of America, 12 other  national veterans organizations, and the Liberty Caucus.   H.R. 1215 is an extremely flawed bill that will deny access to  justice for victims of medical malpractice and especially those who are  the most vulnerable among us. It would deny full compensation for  injuries suffered by veterans and military families, children, the  elderly, and the poor.   I hope my colleagues will join us in opposing this very unnecessary,  mean-spirited bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
