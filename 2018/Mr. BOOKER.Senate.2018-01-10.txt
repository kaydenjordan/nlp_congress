 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the  votes on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 371 and the motion  to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 389.   On vote No. 5, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 371.   On vote No. 6, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 389.                            ____________________
