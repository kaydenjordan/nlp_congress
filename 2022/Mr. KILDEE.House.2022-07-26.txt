 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Neguse), my friend, for yielding to me to speak in favor of this rule,  which includes consideration of legislation that I and others drafted,  the Susan Muffley Act, to ensure that people who worked hard, played by  the rules--20,000 of these Delphi salaried retirees, including 5,000 in  my home State of Michigan--have their pensions protected.   The Susan Muffley Act is a bipartisan bill. I will address that again  in a moment. Republicans and Democrats came together to pull this  legislation together. The AARP supports it; the AFL-CIO supports it.  These are workers who lost their pension through no fault of their own.   When General Motors filed for bankruptcy during the recession, PBGC  assumed responsibility for these retirees and unfairly cut their  benefits as a result of the discharge of that bankruptcy. These  retirees were treated differently than other retirees affected by that  bankruptcy. As a result, it upended so many lives.   In September of 2009, the Delphi Salaried Retirees Association filed  suit. After unsuccessfully petitioning the Supreme Court, it became  obvious and clear that a legislative solution was the only way to get  this done.   My legislation would make those retirees whole again. The  beneficiaries will receive a payment, the difference between what they  would have received had their pension been protected.   But let me just get to the point why this action is necessary. I will  specifically address some of the concerns raised by my friend, Dr.  Burgess. This is not a precedent unless you consider the precedent for  any other time that the Federal Government, whether you agreed with it  or not--and I know many didn't--inserted itself into this situation  where GM and Delphi were facing bankruptcy, took control of the  company, provided capital to the company, got their money back.   It was the Federal Government who stepped in to do this. It was the  Federal Government that contributed to the decision to treat these  particular workers differently when it came to their earned pensions.  So now it is the Federal Government's responsibility to fix the mess  that it created in the name of Susan Muffley, a woman whose husband  worked at Delphi for 31 years and failed to seek medical treatment  because they didn't have access to healthcare during that period that  they were being overlooked.                                time  1845    Look, after working for 30 years to earn a pension, you ought to be  able to be respected. The issue here, this is not a precedent in the  sense that it is not just a private pension system that failed. It was  a system that was taken over by the Federal Government, run through  bankruptcy by the Federal Government, and decisions by the Federal  Government that contributed to this.   It is not a partisan piece of legislation. The gentleman says it is a  partisan bill. It is not. I wrote it with Mr. Turner of Ohio. I see Mr.  Katko on the floor, a cosponsor of this legislation. For goodness'  sake, there are very few bills where I find my name on the same piece  of legislation with Representative Mo Brooks. He is on this bill. If  you think that is not bipartisan, I don't know what is.   This is something the Trump administration attempted to resolve, and  now the Obama administration is working with us to get it done. I am  sorry--the Biden administration. Actually, the Obama administration  failed to get it done. Some of my friends on the other side have said  that I might be reluctant to say so. No.   Here is my view: If you broke it, you bought it. This was a failure  that occurred during the Obama administration. I am not afraid to admit  that. But that doesn't mean because I happen to be a member of that  same party that I don't think we ought to step up and do the right  thing when we can to deal with this. The Federal Government is  responsible for what happened to these workers. No two ways about it.  The Federal Government owes it to them to fix it.
