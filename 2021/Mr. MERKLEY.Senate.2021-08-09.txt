 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am here on the floor today to talk  about climate chaos. It is a monumental crisis that requires immediate  and bold action.   The reason I am speaking about climate chaos at this moment is  because several things are happening today that create this connection.  The one is that the IPCC, the International Panel on Climate Change,  has released its 2021 climate report, and the second is, we are in the  middle of talking about infrastructure for our Nation, and the  investments in climate infrastructure are going to be critical to take  on the crisis that we are facing.   We are in pretty big trouble. This report that came out today--``5  Big Findings from the IPCC's 2021 Climate Report''--it lays out how  dramatically  [[Page S6101]]  things have shifted in just a few years. It notes that the  concentration of carbon dioxide is now higher than it has been for 2  million years, and we have made that happen over just the last 100 or  so years but particularly the last 30; that the glacial retreat is  unmatched for the last 2,000 years; that the last decade was warmer  than any period for 125,000 years; that the summer Arctic ice coverage  is smaller than at any time in the last 1,000 years; that the ocean is  warming faster than at any time since the last ice age; and that ocean  acidification is at the highest level in the last 26,000 years.   These things would not have been true a few years ago, and it is  because of the massive buildup in carbon dioxide from our burning of  fossil fuels to power our energy economy, and it is from the massive  release of methane gas because of our use of natural gas, which is a  very nice name for what is mostly methane gas. We collect methane gas,  and we have accelerated that through fracking. A tremendous amount  leaks out through that drilling and fracking system. A tremendous  amount more leaks out through the millions of miles of pipes that carry  it to its destinations, and then when we burn it, it creates carbon  dioxide, also a global warming gas.   So we don't need to really get this report to know we are in trouble  because we just have to look at the facts on the ground from our home  States right now. I mean, Oregon is aflame. We have so many fires  burning simultaneously, and the largest fire is over 400,000 acres-- 400,000 acres. Think how long it would take, if you were on a hike, to  pass through 400,000 acres.   You know, a few years ago, we had a group of homes that were burned  out in John Day, OR, some 24 or so homes, and we thought that was a big  deal. Then last summer, we had six towns burn to the ground, completely  incinerated. Now we have these massive, massive fires, as do Idaho and  Montana and Washington State and California State and Colorado and Utah  and New Mexico, Arizona. The West is aflame because the temperatures  are so much higher.   What else is happening in Oregon? Well, our snowpack is disappearing;  average snowpack is decreasing. It is affecting the amount of  irrigation water we have. It is affecting the fact that our streams are  now smaller and warmer than they were before, affecting our trout and  our salmon, and the ocean is acidifying. Now we have some 30 percent  more acid in the ocean. It affected first the reproduction of our  oysters, so now we artificially buffer the water for our oyster scene  to survive, baby oysters to survive. Now it is starting to affect the  Dungeness crab, one of the most significant financial enterprises in  terms of sea life production in a commercial sense off the coast of  Oregon. So we are seeing impacts in every possible way.   I know that as I travel rural Oregon, people emphasize that this is a  huge impact on rural Oregon and rural America because it is affecting  our farming. It is affecting our fishing, and it is affecting our  forests.   So we are engaged here in a two-part plan. The first plan is an  infrastructure bill that address water, transportation, and broadband.  Well, all well and good, but if part one sails away from the dock and  leaves part two stranded, what is left behind? Housing, massive  investment; education, a massive investment in 2 years of preschool and  2 years of community college. Foundations for thriving families are  left behind, the support for daycare for working families; and the  child tax credit, which is lifting half of the children in poverty out  of poverty in America--the most massive tax cut ever envisioned for  middle-class America.    What other thing is left on the dock? The investment in climate; the  transition from burning fossil fuel, the fossil fuel economy, to the  renewable energy economy.   We cannot let part one sail away of the infrastructure bill without  doing part two, and the report from the IPCC today emphasizes how  absolutely important it is that we act and we act boldly. That report  said it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere,  the ocean, and the land. The report, crafted by 200 global scientists,  concludes, as one of the report's coauthors summarizes:         There is no uncertainty language in this sentence because       there is no uncertainty that global warming is caused by       human activity and the burning of fossil fuels.    The report goes on to say that we are now on an irreversible course  towards a hotter planet; that if we do the severest cuts in carbon  emissions right now, the severest cuts, we are still going to see  temperatures rise 1\1/2\ degrees Celsius or about 2.7 degrees  Fahrenheit. That was the goal of the Paris Agreement. We would have to  massively cut our carbon emissions and our methane emissions right now  to meet the Paris target.   The report goes on to say that extreme weather events, which were  rare or completely unprecedented, will now be common and more common as  we approach the new normal or it becomes a new normal because of  climate change.   I think the U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, summed it up  when he said this report is ``a code red for humanity''--``a code red  for humanity.'' So that is why all 100 of us here in the Senate should  be on the floor discussing how to respond to a code red for humanity.   Wow, we have a lot of work to do, but that first part of the package  has nothing in it or almost nothing in it--a little bit of money for  charging stations, a little bit of money for electric buses, a little  bit of money for improving the electric grid, but nothing like the  massive investment that is required to respond to a code red, a code  red for the planet.   Now, clearly, as the planet gets hotter and it is affecting our  forests and our farming and our fishing--forest fires that are  destroying towns, more powerful hurricanes affecting the seashore, more  intrusion of saltwater into freshwater supplies--cities are having to  basically start to build dikes around themselves in order to keep the  seawater out.   I heard one Member of the Senate say: You know, here is the thing. We  shouldn't do anything about this because the investments required to  take on climate change will be disruptive.   Well, I will tell you what is disruptive. Forest fires are  disruptive. The loss of the snowpack for our winter sports and our  irrigation water and our healthy streams, that is disruptive. Sea life  being damaged by ocean acidification, that is disruptive to our  economy. Forests with pine beetles thriving and trees dying, that is  disruptive to our forestry. Lack of rain, such that the groundwater is  not recharged, is disruptive to our irrigation for our ranchers and our  farmers.   What is disruptive is doing nothing, and the damage will far exceed  the cost of taking an honest effort to transition quickly to renewable  energy.   Failing to act means failing our future generations. We cannot allow  that to happen. So that is why I am so pleased that on the same day  that the IPCC released their report, we also saw the budget resolution  released.   Now, the budget resolution is the second half of the package, the  part that addresses families, that addresses forests, that addresses  housing, that addresses children, and, yes, addresses climate. So there  is hope.   And what does it do? Well, it funds the Civilian Conservation Corps  to put Americans to work in good-paying jobs to help conserve our  Nation's public lands and waters and bolster community resilience and  to advance environmental justice.   It establishes the Energy Efficiency and Clean Electricity Standard  that my colleague from Minnesota, who is presiding over the Senate  right now, has been so instrumental in laying out for the Senate to act  on. That clean electricity standard will have an enormous impact  because to escape the fossil fuel energy economy, we have to electrify  everything on the production end. We take the power off the grid, but  we have to put renewable energy onto the grid. So it is the key. It is  the centerpiece--the centerpiece--of how we act.   And there are a lot of subsidies, yes, for things like electric buses  and also for electric vehicles. And I think it is so exciting that we  now are going to have an F-150 electric. And the F-150 electric goes  from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds. Try that with your  fossil fuel car, my friend, because you will fail. But you get the new  Ford F-150, and it will press you back in the seat like you have never  experienced as you take off, and you can still do your  [[Page S6102]]  industrial work with your pickup. And there is a Ford Mustang coming  on, electric, and that is going to be a hot item, an exciting item as  well. And so it is kind of neat that what is good for the environment  is also going to be good for all of us to have a good time driving.   So all of these pieces that are in the second half--the second half  of the infrastructure package--that has to get done, and it should be  absolutely bipartisan because these investments in families are desired  by Democratic families and Republican families and Independent  families. These investments in housing--affordable housing in our  country--are needed by Republican and Democratic and Independent  families.   And you know what? It is going to be completely paid for--completely  paid for by having the megarich pay their fair share. And as you all  know from all the reports, they have been jumping and diving and  ducking their taxes, many of them paying zero. Billionaires who are  putting themselves into space on a joy ride pay zero in taxes.  Billionaires are using tons of the products of what we paid for of our  road infrastructure and our water infrastructure and our education  infrastructure. They are employing all kinds of folks who are funded by  Pell grants to get through college, paying zero--zero--in taxes.   Why are the billionaires paying less than you and me? Why are they  paying less than the clerk at the grocery store or the person bagging  your groceries? Why are they paying less than the secretaries? Why are  they paying less in taxes, the billionaires? Good question.   It shouldn't be the case. So the responsible thing is to pay for the  package with tax fairness for all Americans, everyone doing their fair  share, including our companies, some of which have posted tremendous,  astronomical profits while paying absolutely zero in taxes.   If we turn the clock back to Henry David Thoreau, who said many  interesting things in his book, ``On Walden Pond,'' and one of the  things he said is, ``What is the use of a house if you haven't got a  tolerable planet to put it on?''   Well, his question was kind of looking toward the future that we are  now in, where the ravages of a heated planet are destroying our  forests, our fishing, and our farming, undermining the foundations of  our rural economy, creating storms that assault our shores, creating  fires that burn down houses and towns as well as trees.   It is time for us to act, and to act boldly, because we are under a  red alert for the planet and we need to act.
