 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Gasperi  family, who will be moving to Kenya in August on a mission to bring  clean, fresh water to the schools in the surrounding area.   The Gasperi family seeks to provide clean water to schools in the  city of Nakuru. Clean water will help the Kenyans avoid waterborne  parasites and illnesses that interfere with childhood education.   Ashley Gasperi grew up in Kenya, and, with her husband, Chris,  started a nonprofit called Ekenywa, which means a new beginning. Their  mission is to improve the quality of life for school-aged children in  Kenya and to eradicate poverty.   Both Chris and Ashley hold their master's degrees in nursing. Chris  serves as a nurse manager at St. Mary Medical Center's orthopedic  center, and Ashley serves as a clinical instructor at Temple  University.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the entire Eighth Congressional District of  Pennsylvania, we are so proud of the Gasperi family. We wish them the  best as they work to provide a brighter future and cleaner water for  all the children of Kenya.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, the most important duty of this body is  to ensure the safety of every American family from foreign enemies who  intend us harm. We must advocate for a foreign policy that projects  strength and purpose.   The threat profile our Nation faces has never been more severe,  including from rogue regimes and those who directly and indirectly  support the spread of terror. Acting in isolation, each of these  threats requires U.S. attention. However, we must also investigate and  understand the scope of  [[Page H5740]]  evil's reach, especially the nexus between Iran and North Korea.   Mr. Chair, my amendment would compel the Pentagon to report the  extent of cooperation on nuclear programs, ballistic missile  development, chemical and biological weapons development, and  conventional weapons programs between Pyongyang and Tehran. Only when  we understand the complex dealings between these enemies of peace can  we outline a plan to combat them.   My amendment will provide better, more comprehensive tools for  American defense, and I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to  support it for the sake of our Nation's security.
