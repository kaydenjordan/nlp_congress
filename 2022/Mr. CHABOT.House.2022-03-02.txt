 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also  want to thank Chairman Meeks and Representative Spartz for their  leadership on this very important measure.   Last week, the world watched in horror as Vladimir Putin shattered  the peace in Europe and began an unprovoked assault on Ukraine and its  innocent people. Put simply, this is the largest land war in Europe  since World War II, a war that we hoped would never come again. We  cannot condemn this senseless, brutal, and illegal invasion in strong  enough terms.   In the face of this onslaught, the Ukrainian people are demonstrating  incredible bravery as Russia brings to bear its overwhelming military  firepower, at least in terms of soldiers and weaponry and equipment.  But in terms of the combatants on the ground, one side is fighting for  conquest. The other side is fighting for their homes and their  families, and most importantly, their freedom.   Thus far, at least, freedom is prevailing. The Ukrainians, and  President Zelensky especially, are rallying the free world and  demonstrating once again that free men and women would rather die than  submit to the forces of tyranny.   As we stand here today to support the people of Ukraine, let us  remember that their fight for freedom is far from over. We must ensure  that they get the support that they need, that Putin is held  accountable for his war crimes--and they are war crimes--and that he  does not snuff out forever the light of democracy in Ukraine because  that is what he wants to do. Freedom must prevail.
