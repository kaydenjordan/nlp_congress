 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of Americans have debt, and we punish people  for it. But the shame should actually be on policies that incentivize  debt and predatory behavior in debt collection. The lack of protections  in place for borrowers is a reflection of those harmful policies.   Debt collectors today can use virtually any means available to harass  borrowers, even in the middle of a global pandemic that has taken  nearly 600,000 American lives, increased unemployment, and left  millions unsure of how they will put food on the table.   Debt collectors can call you, email you, text you, and even contact  you on social media. My amendment will help rein in this endless  harassment by prohibiting collectors from contacting borrowers on  social media without explicit permission.   Mr. Speaker, while there is still more work to be done on this front,  this an important place to start, and I encourage my colleagues to  support the amendment.
