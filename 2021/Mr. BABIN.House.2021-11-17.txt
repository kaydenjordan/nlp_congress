 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague and  neighbor from Louisiana across the Sabine River for hosting this  Special Order tonight.   Madam Speaker, it has been 10 months since Joe Biden took office, and  look at the state of our country. Our southern border is eroding before  our very eyes. Gas prices are skyrocketing. Inflation has gone up every  month. Our currency is diminishing at an alarming rate. And now  Americans are about to sit down to the most expensive Thanksgiving in  history.   How can anyone justify the fact that a bag of carrots has a price tag  48 percent higher than just a year ago?   My colleagues across the aisle know full well that every American is  hurting because of their bad policies. They conveniently avoid the  topic, telling people that inflation is actually a good thing.   Give me a break. Try telling that to those hardworking Americans at  the grocery store or at the gas pump now.   What will it take for the left to finally come to their senses and  say no more?                                time  1700    Is commonsense and wisdom something of the past? Outdated and  disregarded? Democrats criticize us for telling the American people  that they are destroying the country. They try to divert the American  people's attention by censuring a Republican congressman over a  cartoon; but I would ask them to simply look around. We are in a state  of crisis and decay; and hardworking, law-abiding, freedom-loving  Americans fear the inevitable outcome should we continue down this  path. That outcome, what is it? Socialism, folks.   Today, I ask my Democrat colleagues to look at the burden that they  have put on the American people and face the fact that history has so  clearly written--a socialist utopia simply does not exist.   Today, I ask them, on behalf of every single American in this Nation,  to find the courage and rise and say enough.
