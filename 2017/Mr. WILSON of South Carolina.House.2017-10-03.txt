 Mr. Speaker, our prayers go to all  victims of the Las Vegas massacre.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that I have been an advocate for pro-life  values and protecting the rights of unborn babies. Today, the House  will vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This will  save the lives of babies who are too young to speak for themselves but  who are old enough to feel physical pain.   I appreciate the success of South Carolina Citizens for Life, who  work to give a voice to those who do not have one. With the great  leadership of Executive Director Holly Gatling of the Midlands, Leon  Wizorek of Barnwell, and Sally Zaleski of Orangeburg, this organization  has been working to save lives.   As a cosponsor of the legislation with colleagues Trent Franks, Vicky  Hartzler, Mia Love, and Karen Handel, I am grateful to stand for life,  upholding the conservative values and protecting the lives of our  unborn babies. Every life is precious and has great value.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Thank you, Dr. Tom Price and Betty Price, for your successful service  to American families.                            ____________________
