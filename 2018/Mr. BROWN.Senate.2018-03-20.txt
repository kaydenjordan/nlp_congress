 Mr. President, I thank Senator Portman and Senator  Blumenthal for their work on this. Senator Portman and I have spent  untold hours, and he has been a leader on this. I thank him for his  leadership, in Toledo and Cincinnati, but especially in Toledo, where  the sheriff, the community, Celia Williamson, and so many others have  been so important in combating this terrible affliction in our society.  I thank them.                       Wall Street and American Workers    Mr. President, last week, the House passed another giveaway to Wall  Street, siding with special interests and rolling back accountability  on some of the biggest banks at the expense of taxpayers. It comes on  the heels of last year's tax giveaway that will benefit those same  megabanks. This Congress bends over backward to help Wall Street while  working families continue to struggle.   It is not just that we are helping Wall Street with tax breaks, we  are helping Wall Street with rolling back regulations. Let me outline  what exactly all that means.   In a series over several months, I am laying out the case for how  Wall Street undermines America's workers and some of the changes we  need to make in this country to grow our middle class and make work pay  off.   Remember, one of the points I made was that American Airlines  announced that they were going to increase workers' wages, as did  Chipotle, and Wall Street hit them with a lower stock price as a  result.   In each installment of this series, we have talked about these  issues. I want to talk specifically this time about what Wall Street's  war on workers does to employment. You can follow each installment on  my medium page at www.medium.com/@SenatorBrown.   Last time, I talked about workers' paychecks. Today, I want to talk  about layoffs.   Wall Street's singular focus on padding their own pockets is bad  enough, but worse, it comes at the direct expense of American workers.  Corporations focus almost exclusively on their quarterly performance on  the stock market. That is how a CEO's performance is evaluated. They  are compensated in large part with company shares. They do better when  their stock price goes up. They do things to make their stock price go  up, and then they do even better because they are compensated in large  part with company shares.   Wall Street analysts like it when corporations minimize their cost to  boost their short-term profits; hence the stock price goes up even when  the company is already profitable, and that leads directly to layoffs.  Corporations lay off workers to show they are serious about cutting  expenses, and their stock prices often rise as a result. Wall  [[Page S1831]]  Street's war on workers means not only smaller paychecks but also pink  slips for those workers.   How did we get to a point where stock prices are more important than  workers? It didn't happen overnight.   I was talking with Senator Whitehouse about this, and whether it is  Cranston, RI, or Mansfield, OH, companies used to consider their  employees, their customers, and even the people in the town they did  business in, as stakeholders. They cared about their community, they  cared about their workers, and they cared about their customers. They  felt a duty to fulfill obligations to a broader community, not just  their own corporate board members and their own corporate executives.   I grew up in Mansfield, OH, a city of about 50,000 in North Central  Ohio halfway between our State's two largest cities, Cleveland and  Columbus. I remember that there were so many companies in our town. I  didn't know those company presidents--they were the big people in town,  and I was a kid--but I do remember what those companies did. They  sponsored Little League teams. They were involved in local Kiwanis  clubs. They cared about workers, and they cared about the community.  They cared about their customers. They weren't always interested in  shareholders; they were interested in stakeholders, in all of us as a  community. All the workers, all the customers, and all of the community  were stakeholders. But now the focus has narrowed to just shareholders.   As Wall Street's influence has grown, corporate priorities have  shifted from shareholders kind of writ large, and the way success is  measured has changed fundamentally to stockholders. Businesses have  become beholden to those quarterly earnings reports. They have left  employees, communities, and customers behind in many ways. They do  everything possible, including laying off workers, to make sure their  balance sheets and profit margins look as good as they can--the impact  on the workers and the long-term health of the company be damned.    In the 1980s, investors began to pursue hostile takeovers of  companies that failed to maximize profits. Executives at other  companies began to fear takeovers if they didn't keep profits and stock  prices high. The pay packages of top management became greater and  greater and became more and more closely tied to short-term stock  performance.   Wall Street's and Main Street's interests began to diverge. Folks in  the corporate boardroom were no longer forced to consider what was in  the long-term interests of their workers and of their small-time  investors. For top corporate executives, workers became nothing more  than a line item in the budget, a cost to be minimized.   By the 1990s, even profitable companies started laying off workers to  boost profits even further. Look at what happened to Xerox, an iconic  American company that had never had a major layoff in its history. In  1993, the company announced plans to cut 10,000 workers despite being  profitable. The company was doing fine. It wasn't a case of an industry  moving south, facing an agonizing decision with bad options, but the  CEO justified the job cuts as necessary ``to compete effectively'' and  to have a ``lean and flexible organization.'' He also said he expected  to see higher profits because of the layoffs the following year.   Xerox wasn't alone. In the first 10 months of 1998, when the economy  was booming, corporations laid off over half a million U.S. workers-- 200,000 more than were laid off the year before. This is the definition  of profits before people, and things have gotten worse and worse since  the late 1990s.   In 2015, Sysco announced a 3-year plan that included reducing its  workforce--corporate-speak for laying off workers. It might have made  sense if the company had experienced a year of sluggish sales, but  guess what--the opposite was true. Their sales had increased. They  generated $1 billion in cash flow, and they were able to pay $700  million in dividends to the company shareholders. If the large dividend  payout the year before wasn't generous enough, the CEO said that one of  the goals of the 3-year plan and its layoffs was to ``maximize  shareholder returns''--not stakeholders, not employees, not the  communities, not the customers, but shareholder returns.   The next year, 2016, Tyson Foods announced layoffs despite having a  good quarter in beef sales. The following year, the company's president  touted ``exceptional financial results.'' What was the reason for those  results? Cost-cutting. It is always cost-cutting--more corporate-speak  for laying off workers. Do you know what else he cited as the company's  good health? Not great sales, not new products or investments in more  workers, but the ability of the company to buy back billions of dollars  of its own stock. So an accounting trick that funnels money to  executives is what the company cited as a measure of its success.  Buying back means executive compensation goes up. That is the key to  what it was doing with cost-cutting. The company buys up shares of its  own stock to drive up the price and increase the value for shareholders  and the compensation for executives whose pay is tied to stock  performance. Sounds familiar.   It is no coincidence that since the biggest corporations reaped their  tax windfalls in September, they have announced billions of dollars in  buybacks. It is always about the executives--about the executives' tax  cuts, about the executives' compensation, about the executives'  buybacks. Again and again, we see Wall Street consider workers as  simply a cost to be cut but executive pay as essential to a company.   Last year, Humana announced that it was eliminating 2,700 jobs  despite $13 billion in revenue. In the same call that the CEO announced  the layoffs, he also announced an increase in executive pay. Workers  lose their jobs to pay for more money for corporate executives. Sound  familiar again and again and again? And the cherry on top? A month  later, Humana announced $3 billion in stock buybacks. Again, what is  that about? Higher executive compensation.   Of course, cost-cutting measures typically include workers losing  their jobs. Cost-cutting measures almost never include pay cuts for  corporate executives. In each of these examples, the company cited cost  cuts that were so necessary, they had to fire workers, upend thousands  of employees. I wonder how many of those executives and how many of  those corporate leaders actually brought some of those workers into  their offices and looked them in the eye and told them they were laying  them off. My guess is that they had a much lower paid employee make  that announcement and face the media and, more importantly, face the  employees who lost their jobs.   How many of these executives actually listened to the story of an  employee who loses her job, loses her house, whose total life is  upended? How many of them ever listened to the stories of what happened  to their workers who got fired? The company cited cost cuts that were  so necessary, they had to fire those workers.   The shortsighted approach to running a company may work for top  executives who can squeeze as much value out of the company in the  short term without considering the business's long-term value. It is  not just bad for the employees and communities, it is usually bad for  the long-term health of the company. Making short-term decisions pays  off if you are already well paid, but it doesn't work for those  employees. Mainstream investors and workers only make a profit when a  company's stock value continues to rise over time, but the corporate  executives are no longer forced to consider what is in the long-term  interest of workers and small-time investors. As long as Wall Street's  analysis of one-size-fits-all measure of corporate success continues to  be cost-cutting, workers are at constant risk of losing their jobs. As  long as CEOs get paid based on stock prices instead of the company's  long-term success, workers will keep getting fired from hostile  companies.   We need to break this cycle of greed between Wall Street and CEOs. In  the end, companies can't be profitable without good workers. We need  policies that restructure our economy so workers share in the profits  they create and Wall Street doesn't determine when workers keep their  jobs or how much is in their paycheck.   I yield the floor.
