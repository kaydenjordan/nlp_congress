 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an important issue  that is deeply concerning to Kansans: Rising drug prices.   So far this year, the price of hundreds of lifesaving pharmaceutical  medications have already increased. Hardworking Kansas families are  facing skyrocketing inflation and many simply do not have the funds to  keep up with the never-ending rise in healthcare costs.   For the past three decades, the bipartisan 340B program has helped  low-income families afford essential medications by requiring  pharmaceutical companies to give safety-net and rural healthcare  providers discounts on prescription drugs. In my home State of Kansas,  we have over 80 hospitals that use 340B savings. Not only do 340B  hospitals provide heavily discounted prescription medications, they  also make additional healthcare services, such as trauma care and  substance abuse treatment available to most of our vulnerable patients.   As the 340B program celebrates its 30th anniversary, it is vital that  we reaffirm our commitment to protecting this program and ensuring all  Kansans have access to quality and affordable healthcare.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question so  that we can immediately consider H.R. 6619 which will prohibit local  education agencies from receiving Department of Education funding  unless schools are open for in-person learning, and allow parents to  opt out of mask mandates on behalf of their children.   Over the past 2 years, our children have suffered academically and  socially throughout the pandemic. As a father of four young children, I  know how important it is that kids are back in the classroom and free  of unnecessary and distracting mask mandates. Parents, not politicians,  should have the power to make the best decisions for their children.  Let me repeat that because so many across this country and some in this  body don't understand that fundamental truth. Parents, not politicians,  should have the power to make the best decision for their children. And  that includes whether or not they wear a mask in school.   It has been over a year since the CDC implemented universal mask  mandates in schools with little science to back up their claim. Studies  have shown that students can safely return to prepandemic educational  settings; meaning in a classroom and without a mask.   The House has also appropriated $120 billion to reopen schools,  nearly three times what the CDC had requested. Yet, we still have  school districts across our country refusing to return to in-person  learning or forcing kids to wear a mask against their will.   These school districts should not be given any more hard-earned  taxpayer dollars from the Department of Education or any other Federal  agency.                                time  1300    To make matters worse, the same elected officials who are  implementing these draconian mandates are often seen disregarding them  completely. The lengths some elected officials will go to gain a  political advantage at the expense of the well-being of our children is  truly astounding.   The reality is, my colleagues across the aisle are not following the  science, and it is damaging an entire generation's educational and  social development.   It is time we give parents the power to let their kids experience  normal once again. I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question  and support H.R. 6619.
