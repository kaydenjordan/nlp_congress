 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the CROWN Act because all hair is professional hair.   While serving in the Georgia State Senate, a colleague greeted me  with what she thought was a compliment. After spending most of the  legislative session in braids, I had my natural hair pressed straight.  She told me, Nikema, you should keep your hair that way. It looks  better, more professional, more like a State Senator.   Remarks like this are all too familiar for Black women and girls;  unacceptable on their own, but the outright discrimination that flows  from them is worse. If I didn't work for the people in Congress, I know  that I could be fired simply for wearing my hair in braids.   Nothing about this is okay, so I make it a point to create an  environment where my team feels comfortable wearing their crowns in  every texture.   Everybody deserves this level of safety, no matter where they work.  Our hair is an expression of our authentic selves. Braids, locs, coils,  or a silk press, all hair is professional hair.   Discrimination has no place in America; that includes discriminating  against Black hair. The CROWN Act would make race-based hair  discrimination a thing of the past, once and for all, and that is why  we should pass it today.                                time  1015
