 Madam President, I come to the floor today to oppose  Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending spree.   If Democrats pass the bill, every American will end up paying more,  and clearly pay more in taxes, also pay more for the costs that people  are seeing today at home--goods, gas, groceries. These prices all  continue to go up.   First, let's talk about taxes. This bill would be the largest tax  increase in the history of the United States--actually, in the last  half century.   The bill raises taxes on small businesses, and that means higher  prices on everyone and also fewer jobs.   The bill raises taxes on farmers and ranchers, who will have a harder  time in terms of passing down the family farm or ranch to their kids or  grandkids.   The bill raises taxes on savings and investments. So seniors will  either have to work longer or retire with less.   It includes trillions of dollars in tax increases, yet Democrats seem  to be pandering to their elite donors. They made sure to include  special exemptions for rich people in blue States and for the owners of  electric vehicles.   Now a study from the University of California Berkeley--clearly not a  conservative university--they say that 9 out of 10 electric vehicle  subsidies go to the rich--go to the rich. Nine out of ten, according to  Berkeley, go to the rich.   Democrats also would give tax breaks for people making up to $400,000  a year for all sorts of things, including sending their kids to summer  camp.   Is that what the Democrats want to vote for: Tax breaks for people  making up to $400,000 a year to send their kids to summer camp?   Well, the contrast with Republicans could not be clearer. Where  Democrats  [[Page S5136]]  are making more handouts for their friends, Republicans actually  simplified the Tax Code. Where Democrats' increases are going to  eliminate jobs, our tax cuts increased job growth, increased  employment, lowered unemployment, raised wages.   The 2017 tax cut was an across-the-board tax cut. It helped  businesses and working families, and the result was the best economy in  my lifetime.   In the months after the tax cuts, nearly 200 companies--200  companies--announced raises for their employees.   Six million American workers received either a bonus or a raise or an  increased retirement contribution--6 million Americans after we passed  that law.   Now, before the pandemic, unemployment was at a 50-year low. Wages  were growing at the fastest pace in a decade, and the biggest wage  gains were for people at the bottom of the economic ladder.   On average, American household income rose by more than $4,000 a  year. Well, this is more than the increase over the entire 8 years of  the Obama-Biden administration.   We had the lowest poverty rate in a half a century. Child poverty was  down; income inequality went down. The top 1 percent's share of taxes  went up, so the richer folks were actually paying more in taxes.   After Republicans cut taxes, we saw the lowest unemployment rates  ever recorded for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans, and for  Asian Americans.   When we began to reopen the economy last year, it was the fastest  recovery in American history. That was because we had such a strong  economy before the pandemic.   What a contrast to what we have with the Democrats over the last 6  months. Since Democrats took control of Washington, we have seen the  fastest rise in core inflation in 40 years--the fastest rise in core  inflation in 40 years.   And we have also seen the most unfilled jobs in Americans history.  The American people are already paying more at the grocery store,  paying more at the gas station; now the American people are bracing for  the fact that they are going to pay a lot more on tax day as well   Yet just as bad as the Democrats' tax increases, on top of that, we  see reckless spending. Democrats tell us the bill costs $3.5 trillion.  This is nearly the cost of what America spent in World War II. Yet the  bill is actually much more expensive than $3.5 trillion, because  Democrats continue to use accounting gimmicks to hide the real cost of  the legislation.   Last week, a nonpartisan group released a study showing the real cost  is likely $5.5 trillion. This is on top of the $6 trillion we have  already spent on coronavirus relief. Five and a half trillion dollars  is larger than the entire economy of Japan, which is the third largest  economy in the world.   This is clearly a recipe for inflation. So now Democrats are waving  around a report from a single discredited economist who says: Oh, don't  worry about inflation.   Well, the people in my home State of Wyoming are worried about  inflation because they are living it.   Now, this same economist has been wrong over and over and over again  in his career. He predicted a recession under President Trump. Instead,  we saw the best economy of our lifetime. He wasn't even close. His work  was an influence on President Obama's stimulus plan, which gave us the  slowest recovery in 70 years.   So hard to know why the Democrats would want to even turn to this  person other than he is saying what they want him to say.   Who are you going to believe? Him or your own two eyes?   And the people of Wyoming believe their own two eyes when they go and  fill up with gas or they go to the grocery store or other stores and  see their paycheck being eaten away.   Now, Democrats now tell us they can spend their way out of inflation.  Spend their way out of inflation?   This isn't just wishful thinking. This is radical. It is extreme. It  is dangerous. It is scary. Our economy doesn't need a dime of stimulus.  We don't even need stimulus. We didn't need it 4 months ago, when  Democrats borrowed and spent an additional $2 trillion.   Prices are going up because Democrats spent too much already. The  money supply hasn't gone up this fast since World War II.   One Democrat Senator, this weekend, said inflation is happening  because of money we have already spent.   Well, if this is true, then why would we want to add fuel to the fire  and spend more? Why would we want to do that?   Democrats are printing more money without creating more goods and  services. So if you print more money without creating more goods and  services, this is almost a textbook definition of inflation.   The two bills coming to the floor now would bring Democrats' total  for the year to $8 trillion in additional government spending.   According to an estimate from the Manhattan Institute, this is enough  to give every American household $60,000; or it is enough to cut income  taxes by one-third.   Instead, Democrats are preparing more payoffs for their friends and  donors. This bill is a full giveaway to union bosses, trial lawyers,  leftwing professors. It includes taxpayer funding for full-time  professional climate activists. It includes corporate welfare for  connected companies.   This tax-and-spending spree is utterly reckless. Not one Republican  will vote for this bill. This means all it takes is one Democrat in the  Senate or a handful in the House to stop this freight train to  socialism. All it takes is one Democrat concerned about our future,  willing to say: We shouldn't weigh down our children with debt or our  economy with massive tax increases.   President Biden and the Democrat party are in charge of this runaway  train. Each and every Democrat is going to be held responsible for the  consequences. This includes more inflation, more worker shortages, more  debt, and more dependency.   Look, Democrats did enough damage with their last spending spree.  This new spending spree is much worse.   Unlike their last spending spree, this bill includes massive tax  increases. It is one more reason why the American people are already  speaking out against this reckless tax-and-spending spree.   People across the country and certainly home in Wyoming are fed up,  and the poll numbers are showing it. Seventy-four percent of  Americans--we are talking Republicans, Democrats, Independents--74  percent of Americans are concerned this spending spree will accelerate  inflation; 78 percent are rightly concerned about their own wages going  up at a time when--with their own taxes going up at a time when their  wages have been getting eaten into by inflation.   The people are going to remember how you vote on this bill. They are  going to remember it. They remember it every time they go to the gas  station, every time they go to the grocery store, and they are clearly  going to remember it when they go to vote.   So election day will come, people will make their votes as citizens,  and they will realize what the Democrats have done with this reckless  tax-and-spending spree and how it has impacted them as they are paying  more in taxes, having a greater national debt, and inflation eating  away at their paycheck.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Rocky and  Lisa Eades, the 2021 honorees of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central  Wyoming.   Since 1978, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming has made a  positive difference in the lives of children. Their mission is to  inspire all youth, especially those who need them the most. They strive  to help young people reach their full potential as productive,  responsible, and caring citizens. The programs, leagues, and activities  serve the children in our community by cultivating academic success,  healthy lifestyles, and good character and citizenship.   On September 8, 2021, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming  will host their 23rd annual awards and recognition breakfast. At this  breakfast,  [[Page S5138]]  the organization honors members of the community who have made a  significant difference in the lives of others. It is an inspiring  celebration.   This year's honorees are Rocky and Lisa Eades. They are an ideal  choice because of their tremendous role in helping families. Their  story of generosity and compassion is inspiring.   Rocky and Lisa cofounded the Jason's Friends Foundation, a nonprofit  organization based in Casper, WY. Jason's Friends provides financial  and moral support to families with children fighting cancer. The couple  took on this charge after experiencing firsthand the hardships  associated with childhood cancer. Their 8-year-old son Jason was  diagnosed with a brain stem tumor in January 1995.   Rocky and Lisa dedicated their all to Jason's recovery. They upended  their lives, traveling to Denver and New York for care and treatment.  Jason's brave fight ended in November 1995. To honor Jason's life and  help Wyoming families in similar situations, they founded Jason's  Friends Foundation in 1996.   Jason's Friends has crafted an inspiring legacy, providing over $5.8  million in financial assistance to families dealing with the added  stress and financial burden of a child with cancer. Currently, 145  families are enrolled in the program. The foundation helps cover  nonmedical expenses such as travel and household bills. Their work  allows families to fully commit to their fight against cancer.   The Bowl for Jason's Friends fundraiser, in its 23rd year, is a  highly anticipated event, drawing in the entire community. The  foundation also hosts Camp Courage, a no-cost summer camp for childhood  cancer patients and their families.   Family is the highest priority for the Eades. In addition to Jason  and the countless families they have helped throughout Wyoming, they  have two grown daughters, Brooke and Skylar. Lisa serves as the  volunteer president/CEO of Jason's Friends, cochairs the Wyoming Cancer  Coalition, serves on the Wyoming Department of Health's Institutional  Review Board, and was appointed by then Governor Mead to the Wyoming  Palliative Care Advisory Council. Rocky is the president of Eades  Construction in Casper and has built hundreds of custom homes in  Natrona County.   Rocky and Lisa live a life of heart and perseverance. They are the  first to offer a helping hand to those experiencing tremendous  challenges. The Code of the West charges us to live each day with  courage. Not only do Rocky and Lisa embody this principle, they give  everyone around them the courage needed to do the same. Casper and  Wyoming are fortunate to have them.   It is with great honor that I recognize these outstanding members of  our Wyoming community. My wife Bobbi joins me in extending our  congratulations to Rocky and Lisa Eades upon their selection for this  special award.                            ____________________
