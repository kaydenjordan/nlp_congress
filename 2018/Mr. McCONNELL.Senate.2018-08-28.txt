 Madam President, it was quite something to listen  yesterday to Members' heartfelt tributes to the memory of our friend  Senator McCain. He meant so much to so many of us, both inside this  Chamber and out.   As I noted yesterday, the Senate is eager to work on concrete ways to  continue this momentum and provide a lasting tribute to this American  hero long after this week's observances are complete. Following Senator  Kennedy's death in 2009, for example, we named the Kennedy Caucus Room  to honor his and his brothers' public service. Some have suggested we  take a similar step so that the Armed Services Committee, on which our  friend played such a critical role, would meet in a committee room  named for Senator McCain.   Back in 2000, the Senate approved recommendations to add two  additional portraits to the Capitol Senate Reception Room right off the  Senate floor. Only seven Senators in the entire history of this  institution are honored with portraits there.   I actually had the opportunity to serve in the bipartisan group that  successfully recommended that Senators Arthur Vandenberg and Robert  Wagner should appear there alongside Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John  Calhoun, Robert La Follette, Sr., and Robert Taft, who were selected by  a special committee back in 1957. That committee, interestingly enough,  was appointed by Lyndon Johnson and chaired by John F. Kennedy. I have  also heard in recent days that perhaps Senator McCain's portrait should  join that distinguished group. So it is a further tribute to our  colleague that there is no shortage of good ideas.   In order to make sure we realize these intentions, I would like to  put together an official group who can collaborate and bring together  ideas from current Members, former colleagues, and friends. It will be  bipartisan, as only befits John's legacy. Come to think of it, we  should probably call it not a committee but a gang. So I am glad we are  able to form this gang to ensure that a suitable, lasting tribute  becomes a reality. I will have more details regarding this group to  share in the coming days after our friend is laid to rest.                            ____________________     Madam President, August is usually a time for Senators  to spend more time in our home States, meeting with our constituents  and reporting on the progress we have made here in Washington, but this  August had to be different. There was too much business left  unfinished. So I made the decision to keep the Senate in session this  month to continue working on behalf of the American people. I am proud  to report that is just what we have done.   The Senate has now passed regular appropriations measures that  account for 87 percent of next fiscal year's discretionary spending, we  finalized our work on the National Defense Authorization Act named for  Senator McCain, and in August alone, we have confirmed eight more of  the President's well-qualified nominees for the Federal courts. But, as  I have stated, the continuing, historic obstruction from Democrats on  the President's nominees continues to make our progress on that front  insufficient, so we will stay at it.   Currently before us are nominees to be Assistant Secretary to the  Department of Health and Human Services, a Vice Chairman for the  Federal Reserve, important posts at the Departments of Justice and  Treasury, and a slate of impressive nominees for the Federal judiciary.  I hope we can continue to make progress. It remains my intention to  confirm all 17 of the nominees currently before us before the Senate  concludes our business this week.  [[Page S5962]]                                ____________________     Madam President, now on one final matter, lately there  has been no shortage of outstanding economic headlines:   ``Small business confidence hits another record high.''   ``U.S. workers get biggest pay increase in nearly a decade.''   ``Open jobs outnumber U.S. unemployed for third straight month.''   But it is also important to look beyond the headlines and ask whether  all Americans are benefiting from this new prosperity.   For years, under the last administration, much of the so-called  recovery only touched some communities and some industries. Many  vulnerable Americans fell further and further behind. Today, things are  different. A growing and vibrant economy has room for everyone. The  unemployment rate for young Americans age 16 to 24 is now the lowest it  has been since July 1966. Labor force participation among this same  group is at its highest level in nearly a decade. The unemployment rate  for workers with less than a high school diploma is now at its lowest  level in recorded history.   As work opportunities have opened back up, the number of Americans  seeking Social Security disability benefits has plummeted. As one  scholar told the New York Times, ``When the economy gets better,  employers are more willing to look to other labor pools and be more  accommodating. . . . People with disabilities also have a sense there  may be something out there that fits their needs.''   Remember, for much of the Obama economy, opportunity creation was so  insufficient that many vulnerable Americans were effectively put right  on the sidelines. The job market was too crowded. Openings were too  few. But this thriving economy, helped along by Republican policies, is  a different story. There are more and more opportunities for everyone.   This reminds us that it is capitalism and free enterprise, not new  government programs, that best equip Americans to provide for their  families and pursue happiness. Free enterprise is what has led an  aviation tech maker in Colorado to lean on a high school-age  technician, whose skills are ``highly integral'' to the company. Free  enterprise is what has led a semitrailer manufacturer in Wisconsin to  hire inmates, as they reenter the community after paying their debt,  and help them rebuild upright lives. There is an old line often  attributed to Ronald Reagan: ``The best social program is a job.''   While our Democratic friends keep railing against tax reform and  regulatory reform, keep insisting we should compile more money and  power here in Washington, Republicans know better. We know that a real  recovery is when Americans of all ages, all abilities, and in all parts  of the country have more opportunities to earn their own success, and  we are proud that our policies are helping make that happen.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the pending cloture  motions on Executive Calendar Nos. 911, 783, and 720 be withdrawn, and  that at 3:45 p.m. today, the Senate vote on the following nominations  in the order listed with no intervening action or debate: Executive  Calendar Nos. 910, 911, 783, and 720; that if confirmed, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
