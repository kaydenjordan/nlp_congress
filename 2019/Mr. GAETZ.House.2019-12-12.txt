 Mr. Speaker, I am joined here with members of the Florida,  Georgia, and Alabama delegations because on December 6, in the early  hours of the day, our Nation learned of a terrorist attack unfolding at  Naval Air Station Pensacola. The attack took the lives of Ensign Joshua  Kaleb Watson of Coffee County, Alabama; Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham  of St. Petersburg, Florida; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters  of Richmond Hill, Georgia.   We congregate here today to honor the memory of those who lost their  lives and those who were wounded during the course of this egregious  attack.   Those who wear the uniform inspire the best within us because they  are truly the best among us. They are our sons and daughters, our  fathers and mothers. Last Friday, three of them were taken from us, and  we shall not forget their names, or those who have been impacted by  that terrible attack.   I request all present, both on the floor and in the gallery, to rise  for a moment of silence; and I am proud and honored to be joined by my  colleagues.                            ____________________
