 Mr. President, I rise today in support of Judge Stephanie  Dawkins Davis for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Michigan.   I had the honor of introducing Judge Dawkins Davis at the Senate  Judiciary Committee hearing more than 6 months ago. As I told the  members of the committee, Judge Dawkins Davis is a highly respected  member of the Michigan legal community, and she will serve our State  well as a district court judge.   Judge Dawkins Davis has been an exemplary public servant who has  worked hard and honorably to serve the people of Michigan. She has  earned the respect of colleagues across the State and has garnered  numerous awards throughout her career.   She began her career as a civil defense attorney at Dickinson Wright  and later joined the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern  District of Michigan, prosecuting cases at both the trial and appellate  levels. She also spent time as a deputy unit chief of the Controlled  Substances Unit and as a high intensity drug trafficking area liaison.   Her successful work led to her appointment as executive assistant  U.S. attorney, and after that, she became a magistrate judge for the  Eastern District and was selected to serve at the Flint Federal  courthouse.   Judge Dawkins Davis is a qualified jurist. The American Bar  Association unanimously rated her as ``well qualified.'' She was also  the first African-American woman nominated by President Trump for a  Federal judgeship.   I am proud to recognize Judge Dawkins Davis for her many  accomplishments and for the diverse voice and perspective she will  bring to the bench.   This seat has been vacant since October 26, 2016; that is more than 3  years. It is past time that the Senate consider Judge Dawkins Davis's  nomination, and I am glad it is finally happening today.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
