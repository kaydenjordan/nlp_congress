 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Kikkoman Foods,  Inc., on its 50th anniversary. I am proud to honor this organization  and the ongoing international exchange of food culture from Japan to  Walworth, WI.   What began in 1973 as the first U.S.-based plant for the  manufacturing of soy sauce has now become a strong part of the Walworth  community. The Mogi family soy sauce recipe dates back over 300 years  and was first introduced in the United States at a Navy Pier global  business showcase. Crowds present in Chicago tried Kikkoman soy sauce  for the first time. It was such a big hit that Kikkoman created a  committee to investigate production in the United States. The committee  settled on Walworth, WI, because they saw great potential in the proud  tradition of Wisconsin agriculture and a midwestern work ethic. In  addition, the Midwest region provided an optimal climate for the  production of soy beans and wheat, essential components of soy sauce.   Soon, Kikkoman's plant in Walworth aided the fusion of American and  Japanese cuisine. In Walworth, soy sauce became a kitchen staple.  Kikkoman continues to advance their mission of expanding the use of soy  sauce as a ``versatile flavor enhancer.'' I appreciate the continued  fusion of these two cultures and the partnerships of Kikkoman in the  Wisconsin community. Together, Japanese technology and American  agriculture blend to create a successful overseas expansion for  Kikkoman.   Today, the plant in Walworth is Kikkoman's North American production  headquarters and produces an estimated 34 million gallons of soy sauce  annually, more brewed soy sauce than any other facility around the  world. Since its introduction to Wisconsin, Kikkoman has been an  essential contributor to the Wisconsin economy and shares the same  commitment to the development of Wisconsin businesses, suppliers,  service providers, and contractors. Ultimately, the Walworth Kikkoman  production facility serves as an important example of the coprosperity  and success of American and Japanese partnerships.   We in Wisconsin are grateful to Kikkoman for sharing the vibrant  tradition and well-respected values of soy sauce brewing and the  Japanese culinary tradition. I am honored to recognize the 50th  anniversary of Kikkoman Foods, Inc., and look forward to their  continued success in Wisconsin for years to come.                            ____________________
