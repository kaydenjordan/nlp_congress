 Mr. President, for all of its flaws, the supplemental  request the Biden administration submitted to Congress did correctly  identify four especially urgent national security priorities: defeating  Russian invasion in Europe, countering Iran-backed terror in the Middle  East, deterring Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific, and securing  America's southern border.   Late last week, President Biden said he was willing to make  ``significant compromises'' on Republican policy changes designed to  restore real border security.   And across the country, elected Democrats are emphasizing just how  urgent this progress is. The Governor of Arizona reported over the  weekend that her State is ``at a breaking point'' and that it needs  Washington to ``step up, do its job, and bring security and order to  our border.'' She is a Democrat.   At the frontlines of the crisis that has unfolded on President  Biden's watch, the mayor of Nogales, AZ, put it this way:         I think it's time to say enough is enough. . . . I'm a       Democrat, a registered Democrat, but I run this city as a       human being.    I know many of my colleagues here in the Senate share that  frustration. Many of them recognize the urgency of the situation. Just  over the weekend, in the time since Senator Lankford presented Senate  Democrats with this latest opportunity to help fix America's broken  asylum and parole system, the crisis at the southern border has  actually gotten worse.   With average daily border crossings near 10,000--10,000--CBP is now  saying it is releasing 6,600 illegal aliens into the interior every  single day. The backlog of asylum cases sits at 3 million--3 million-- and counting. And officials have reported arrivals from more than 150  countries just since October 1.   This is what a crisis looks like. This is what the Democratic leader  spent last week insisting was ``extraneous'' to America's national  security.   Well, when it comes to keeping America safe, border security is not a  side show; it is ground zero.   Senate Republicans have no more spare time to explain this basic  reality.
