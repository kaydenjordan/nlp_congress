 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for her  leadership.   Today I stand in opposition to H.R. 5129 because it removes  longstanding religious protections for community service providers that  receive funds through the community service block grant program.   Religious providers all around the country provide food for the  hungry, healthcare and hospice programs for the terminally ill, and  educational opportunities for the less fortunate. This partisan bill  will likely prevent certain religious groups from engaging in charity,  simply because of what motivates their charity.   In 2019, the community action agencies partnered with more than  19,000 faith-based organizations around the country. In Indiana, the  funds reached 335,000 Hoosiers by providing health services, housing  aid, education help, income improvement, and more. If charitable choice  language is removed from this bill, religious organizations may be  forced to choose between serving their community and honoring their  sincerely held faith beliefs. That means more Hoosiers in need. It is  shameful to cut religious protections from such an impactful program.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill as it will  mean less charity tomorrow for all Americans. We must defend our  religious freedom, and this bill is a direct attack on it.
