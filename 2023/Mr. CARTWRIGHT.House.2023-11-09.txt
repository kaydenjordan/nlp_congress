 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the FS-GG  Subcommittee.   Mr. Chair, here in Congress we have a big opportunity to fight drug  trafficking in this country.   Congress originally authorized the High Intensity Drug Trafficking  Area program, HIDTA, in 1988 and renewed it in 1993 and in 1998.   The program provides significant financial assistance to State and  local law enforcement and facilitates strong cooperation among those  agencies and with Federal law enforcement.   That cooperation has led to many successes in our efforts to disrupt  the market for illegal drugs by interdicting and seizing drugs off of  our shores and within our borders.   This High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program removes the supply  of illicit substances, making it harder for drug trafficking  organizations to sell their products. For example, in 2021, the HIDTA  program seized over 193 metric tons of cocaine products, 195 metric  tons of methamphetamine, 2,900 metric tons of marijuana, 4 metric tons  of heroin, and 9 metric tons of fentanyl.   We all know the toll that the drug trafficking continues to take on  communities across our country. Along our southern border, the Mexican  cartels are using any means necessary to import precursor chemicals  from China to produce synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. That is to  meet a growing demand, a demand that has resulted in over 100,000  deaths of Americans in just 1 year.   The accessibility and the affordability of these drugs leave Federal,  State, local, and Tribal partners in a continuous defensive posture to  keep dangerous narcotics out of our communities and successfully to  combat the drug trafficking networks that are responsible.   Nevertheless, still today we continue to see draconian cuts by the  majority to law enforcement efforts not only in this bill, the FS-GG  bill, but also in the bill produced by the Commerce, Justice, Science,  and Related Agencies Subcommittee where I am the ranking member.   These cuts serve only to amplify the supply of illicit drugs. These  cuts cause a proliferation in the violence associated with the drug  trade. These cuts damage the important work of successful programs like  HIDTA.   Here in Congress we have the opportunity to build on the investments  we have made in the war against drugs. We can provide the HIDTA program  with the resources it needs to address its existing and emerging  challenges in this war. We can send a clear signal to our adversaries  on the global stage that we will not allow this attack on our  communities without consequence. We can bring those responsible for  this drug trafficking scum to justice.   For these reasons, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to the committee. If the House rules permit, I  would have offered the motion with an important amendment to the bill.  My amendment would increase the Office of National Drug Control  Policies High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program by $15 million.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of this amendment.         Mr. Cartwright moves to recommit the bill H.R. 4664 to the       Committee on Approriations with the following ammendment:        Page 41, 1ine 23, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $15,000,000)''.     Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues join me in voting for  this motion to recommit.
