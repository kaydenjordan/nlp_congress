 Mr. Speaker, sometimes it is just hard to keep track  of the daily outrages: the President is not just insulting, but  attacking allies like Canada on national security grounds; a tariff  war; reckless and inaccurate attacks on NATO and our allies, the  bedrock of stability in Europe; the President of the United States  cozies up to one of the worst people on the face of the planet. Kim  Jong-un, the dictator of North Korea, has imprisoned over 100,000 of  his people in concentration camps, starved millions more, murdered  members of his own family and is held up as some sort of exemplar by  Trump. Trump says he likes the way his people pay attention to him.  Well, maybe because if they don't, they get killed or sentenced to a  concentration camp. This notion that we are forcibly separating  children from families at the border, where the family simply is  looking for asylum, inflicting probably permanent damage on these  children; and, of course, the countless environmental attacks and the  activities of corrupt cronies who have been put in positions of  authority.   Last week we witnessed one of the most despicable acts of this  disturbing administration: The United States launched a global attack  on breastfeeding--yes, breastfeeding.   Think about it for a moment. Mother's milk is the most nutritious way  to feed a baby. It contains antibodies that provide it with health  protections as a baby and throughout its life.   There was an innocuous resolution that was being advanced before one  of the United Nations affiliates, the World Health Assembly, to promote  breastfeeding.   This is a serious problem in developing countries. Global giants that  sell baby formula have been touting this as a healthier, more  convenient alternative. Recent studies show that less than 40 percent  of poor women in developing countries are breastfeeding. The use of  infant formula in these poor countries not only is inferior, not only  does it lack the long-term health benefits, and is it not a cheaper  alternative for low-income people. Actually, in many of these  countries, mixing formula with dirty water poses a direct threat  immediately to the health of the child.   Ecuador, a member of this assembly, was prepared to introduce a  routine resolution promoting breastfeeding. Then this administration  sprang into action, pressuring Ecuador--allegedly, with retaliation in  the trade sector--to not offer the resolution. Ultimately, the bullying  was successful; the resolution was not advanced by Ecuador. Although,  irony of ironies, it was Russia that stepped up and moved forward with  the resolution, which was ultimately adopted with minor changes.   What does it say about America and this administration that it would  be doing the bidding of giant international corporations, promoting a  practice that actually undermines health in many poor people? Just  having a resolution promoting the benefits of breastfeeding was  threatening to their business and to this administration.   We have seen a lot of disturbing and shameful acts since Trump became  President, but it is hard to imagine something worse than what was on  display last week.   It is time for my Republican colleagues to join us, expressing  outrage about behaviors like this. We are better people, and we ought  to demonstrate it.                            ____________________
