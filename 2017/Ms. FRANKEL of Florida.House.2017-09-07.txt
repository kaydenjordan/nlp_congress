 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 889, line 6, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $8,500,000)''.        Page 898, line 9, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $8,500,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Frankel) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Chair, this bill inexplicably defunds UN  Women.   What is UN Women?   UN Women was created by the United Nations in 2010 to direct  activities on gender equality issues. The organization helps meet the  most urgent needs of women and girls by supporting women's full  participation in their country's political, economic, and social life.   So as I said, this bill inexplicably takes away funding, $8.5  million, that we are trying to get back from this very important  program. I think this defunding of this is wrong, it is unwise, it is  immoral.   Let me tell you what happens when we abandon the UN Women, because  this is what we are walking away from: providing services for survivors  of human trafficking. We are walking away from registering women to  vote and participate in their political system, including women in the  peacemaking process. We are walking away from combating child bride  kidnapping and fighting child marriage. That is what we are walking  away from today.   I know we have a lot of issues here in this country. We have been  battling the hurricanes, and I know our hearts go out to all those  impacted.   There is something else that has been going on in this world for  years now, which is the greatest humanitarian crisis that we have seen  since World War II, and that is what is happening in Syria. You have  millions of people fleeing into neighboring countries, running away  from rape, from murder, from chemical attacks.   What is the United States doing?   Oh, well. We are abandoning the Muslims, we are trying to build the  walls, while we have great allies like Jordan, for example, who have  now taken in over a million Syrian refugees, including this very young  girl who was at a program that I had an opportunity to visit when I was  in Jordan at a facility run by the UN Women where they are working with  women to give them skills, to teach them.   This young girl fled her home in Syria under rocket fire, leaving her  family, her brother killed, and fleeing to Jordan, where she is now  learning to be a journalist. We are defunding programs like that in  this bill.   So we are putting so many women's lives at risk, like Zaad, the girl  I just talked about, leaving women and girls vulnerable to sex  trafficking, poverty, homelessness, and hunger; and we say we want to  try to bring stabilization to these regions across the world.   Let me tell you what research shows. Research shows that when women  are empowered, economies grow and societies are more stable with less  violence. And our own U.N. Ambassador, Nikki Haley, said:         We want to make sure that our governments support girls and       support women, and we should encourage every country to       support these basic rights.    So what are we doing today?   We are defunding UN Women. As I said, it is inexplicable and it is  wrong. I think it is actually idiotic.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), who  I think can elucidate even more on this subject.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I respectfully withdraw this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.
