 Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back on the  floor. We have had a productive week so far. Things are moving along.  We are doing exactly what we promised the American people, and that is  removing regulatory burden, that is beginning to move toward an economy  that looks after the needs of our communities--our moms, dads, aunts,  uncles, and grandkids. They come together to know we are working toward  a common goal, and that is looking ahead and making sure that what we  do is in the best interests of our neighbors and our communities.   Today, I want to continue in what we started, Mr. Speaker, just a  week or so ago. We are introducing the folks that the country has sent  from our side to be Members here, to join myself and others, to take  this fight from the majority not only from their streets in the  campaigns, but now onto the floor of the House.   So this afternoon, we are going to start off with one of our new  Members from New York's 19th Congressional District, John Faso. I found  out as I was looking through his background that John comes from the  same hometown as President Martin Van Buren and also our former  colleague Chris Gibson, who was here for a while.   I think if there is anything that sums up what I have heard from  John's heart, it is the economic condition that we are in and the fact  that our debts cannot continue to be sustained, and we have to put in  good practices that not only take into account his district--which is a  wonderful part of New York State--and the growing application there,  but how we can take that all over the country.   So with great pride, it is my privilege to introduce the newest  Congressman from New York's 19th Congressional District, John Faso, to  tell us a little bit about why he is here and his vision for what we  have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso).    Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons we do this-- and I think Congressman Faso actually mentioned this--is what we forget  so many times is we come in here, and we are grouped together as 435,  but, the reality is, we all come from our individual districts.   Listening to the gentleman's story, listening to why he came, that is  what keeps us grounded. This is the wonderful hallowed halls for us to  remember all the history that has been here, but, when we come here,  you bring that personal story. And that is what the voters elected you  to do.   Again, it is a pretty amazing district. I am learning about a lot of  districts. When you have the area of Woodstock and Cooperstown in the  same district, that is pretty cool.   I appreciate the gentleman being here, and I am looking forward to  his service.    We are very glad to have the gentleman here.   Mr. Speaker, as we go along, you have seen one great new Member from  New York's 19th District, but then there is also a new Member who comes  from the Big First out in Kansas. He is a doctor. He has been married  for 32 years and has four children.   I think the coolest thing about this is we talk about a culture of  life. For me, it is not just a life issue of getting up every day. I  believe that you take every day as a gift that has been given to you,  and you grasp and you take that joy. But life has to start. For a  doctor who delivers 5,000 babies, it is pretty cool to see that life,  as a husband who has been there.   He has talked about his greatest role as a husband and father. That  is mine and, I think, Mr. Speaker, as most, as we look at this. Seeing  my kids come in was a special time. To know what that means in the life  of a family, Dr. Marshall brings that personal touch to the House. He  brings that personal touch from the Midwest.   Mr. Speaker, you do know I am in the Air Force Reserve. Mr. Speaker  understands that very well. Also, I will say that he served as well in  our once-parent operation, the Army Reserve. It is good to have him  here. That military background also gives us a new perspective because  our world is not a safe place, and we need to understand what we are  going through.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Big First, the First  District of Kansas, Dr. Roger Marshall.    It is good to have Dr. Marshall here and be a  part of bringing that vitality of someone in the health field, knowing  and understanding that relationship between the patient and the doctor  and finding the best way so that all can have that access. I think that  is what we see.   He ended with something, and I will sort of end with that: the prayer  breakfast. From my background as not only an Air Force chaplain but  also a pastor for over 11 years, we can have disagreements. And we are  going to have disagreements. But what I have found is, when you pray  for each other, you can have disagreements, but you can't be mad.   I think that is what we have got to do as a country is we have our  disagreements and we move forward and we look for what is best for the  individuals and not best for what is this government.    I think that is what you brought to the table today and talked about,  that passion to get it back to the individual who looks to Washington,  knows it is there, and doing what the Constitution said, but not  overreaching into the areas of their life that take them away from the  things they want to do.   So I appreciate the gentleman's service. I appreciate him being here.  It is going to be great as we go forward.   Mr. Speaker, we have gotten a fast start. There are some things going  on where we are doing what we promised. I had an interview just the  other day, and the reporter asked me the question: Well, what do you  think about X? They named off like two or three things. I said: What is  surprising right now to many folks who have reported on this place for  so long is the fact that things are getting done and being promised to  get done, and they are happening.   Mr. Speaker, that is what we are sent here for. And as we see that  through the regulatory issues we have been dealing with this week, we  are going to deal with again next week, and as we look ahead to the  battles of repealing and putting together access to affordable health  care for all Americans and not doing the scare tactics and not doing  the straw man and not trying to push anybody off a cliff but saying:  let's talk about this together; let's listen and work together, as  opposed to the way it was done.   Then, we look into tax reform. We look into energy development. It is  a time in America to be smiling. It is a time when we can look around  and the rest of the world is saying: that is the country that we know.  That is the shining light that we know. That is the place that the  world looks to. Because we are the freest country in the world, and we  gave our spirit to others.                                time  1645    So it is exciting for me, as part of my work for the Republican  Conference, to bring the freshman Members up here to let them tell  about their areas. And as we do so, it just shows you, I believe, that  America, in many of these districts, saw promise. And we are looking  forward to continuing with our new Members and continuing to introduce  them over the next weeks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
