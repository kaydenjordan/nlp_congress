 You have got a minority report you are putting in which  cites lists of abuses; is that correct?    I just wondered, do you have in there all the things Chris  Christie did that came up in a hearing that we held in 2009 in our  committee showing the abuses of the system by Chris Christie?   The CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members to address their remarks to  the Chair, please.  [[Page H8113]]         Mr. Chairman, Mr. Pascrell will discuss it in more detail.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Pascrell will go into this in some  detail.   But we held hearings on this, and we didn't have any support from the  other side of the aisle when we pointed out all of the abuses that were  going on in New Jersey, Mr. Chairman, with monitors being appointed  that were making $52 million--Mr. Ashcroft, in particular--other  monitors who had involvement in cases that Mr. Christie was involved  in, which his brother was involved in, and where money was given to Mr.  Christie's law school and other pet projects. Nobody on the other side  criticized it. It was only when they cared about Obama.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, line 11, insert after ``settlement agreement'' the       following: ``(except as provided in subsection (g))''.        Add at the end of the bill the following:        (g) Exception.--The provisions of this Act do not apply in       the case of a settlement agreement in relation to       discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, or       any other protected category.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 577, the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Chairman, the reason I have this amendment is because  I don't think the bill is a good bill, and it shouldn't affect  settlement agreements on the basis of race, religion, national origin,  or any other protected category.   I was kind of shocked that it was put in order; I will be even more  shocked if it passes. But the reality is it doesn't make any difference  because this bill isn't going anywhere in the Senate.                                time  1615    Most of what we do in the Judiciary Committee is highly partisan  matters that won't go anywhere in the Senate. We are one of the four  committees of jurisdiction that can deal with matters dealing with the  White House, with Russian interference in our election, and with issues  concerning obstruction of justice and the firing of James Comey with  Emoluments Clause violations, abuse of power, and attacks on the  judiciary.   The Senate and House Intelligence Committees have investigations. So  does the Senate Judiciary Committee. Only our committee has done  absolutely nothing. Absolutely nothing.   Today, Senator Jeff Flake, a gentleman who I served with in the House  and a man of moral rectitude, said he cannot continue to serve in the  Senate because to be quiet on issues concerning the White House in  relation to decency, truth, and other matters would involve complicity.  He couldn't remain complicit.   By our committee not taking any actions concerning activities in the  White House, we are complicit. We should be the most responsible  committee in the Congress because we are the people's House, and we  have the judiciary, the FBI, and elections all within our purview, yet  we have remained silent.   Part of the reason that has been said is because other groups are  investigating. Well, we are the group that should be doing the  investigating because we are the people's House. We don't not take up  bills like this because the Senate is not going to pass them. We take  them up all the time, throw them over there, and they don't come back.   So I am distraught by the fact that my friend Jeff Flake, who is one  of the finest people I have served with, a man of rectitude, is not  going to run for reelection. He wasn't a knee-jerk Republican, just  like Bob Corker is not a knee-jerk Republican. And both  [[Page H8120]]  have said many truths today about what is going on in the executive  branch.   We are an equal branch of government that has responsibility to be a  check and balance, and the House Judiciary Committee has that  responsibility. I once again call on the chairman of the committee to  hold hearings on elections, on Russian interference in our elections,  on threats to our democracy, on violations of the Emoluments Clause,  obstruction of justice, and the firing of the FBI Director.   The FBI is under our charge. We should have hearings. We should have  hearings on emoluments. We should have hearings on all of these issues  and not be complicit. Being complicit is the same as being guilty.   Mr. Chairman, I ask that we pass the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
