 Mr. Speaker, in June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  or ICE, released a list of criminal illegal aliens who were allowed  back into their sanctuary communities by local officials. One such  criminal is Rosalio Ramos-Romas, a Honduran citizen who was deported  four times before authorities arrested him in Washington State in  October of 2017.   Once notified of his arrest, ICE issued a written detainer request  asking local authorities to imprison him for an additional 48 hours.  Instead, local authorities ignored the detainer request and allowed  Rosalio back into the community, where he eventually murdered his  cousin and hid the body in a dumpster.   These are not isolated incidents of violence, but they occur all too  frequently in sanctuary cities across America. The truth is that  sanctuary city policies threaten the safety of our neighbors.   I am fed up that these tragedies have gone unchecked for far too long  in our country. That is why I introduced H.R. 3964, the Justice for  Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act, with Congressman Bradley Byrne, which  would allow anyone harmed by an illegal immigrant in a sanctuary city  to sue the sanctuary city or State.  [[Page H7566]]    Mr. Speaker, it is time for the House to give victims of sanctuary  city policies a legal pathway to justice. This cannot happen again.                            ____________________
