 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Affordable  Care Act, a law that has made a real difference in the lives of  Minnesotans and Americans.   After 7 years of attacking the ACA, Republicans still have not come  up with a plan to replace this law. Instead, they plan to work with  President-elect Donald Trump to repeal the law and destroy the progress  we have made.   Repealing the ACA would leave tens of millions of Americans  uninsured. Repealing the ACA would let insurance companies deny  coverage to more than 2 million Minnesotans with preexisting  conditions. Repealing the ACA would eliminate free, high-quality  preventive health care for hundreds of thousands of families in my  district. Make no mistake, Republicans' ACA repeal plans would turn  back the clock, leaving millions of Americans just one illness away  from bankruptcy.   For the sake of Minnesotans and all Americans who have benefited from  this law, join me in fighting to save the Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________
