 Madam Speaker, I extend my congratulations to the  committee leaders for successfully reaching an agreement with the  Senate on a final Water Resources Development Act for 2020. This is a  wonderful bill.   We have $10 billion in new water infrastructure authorizations in  this bill. It authorizes all of the pending Chief's reports. That  includes two very important flood risk management projects in my  district, which has been severely harmed by persistent flooding in  recent years, as evidenced by the damage from Hurricanes Irma and  Maria.   I would like to take this opportunity to remind the Army Corps that  it may fund the construction of these projects out of remaining funds  provided in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and that construction of  such projects in the Virgin Islands, as well as in Puerto Rico, with  funds provided under that act shall be conducted at full Federal  expense.   This bill also contains a long-sought reauthorization of projects for  navigation in the harbors of St. Thomas and Christiansted, St. Croix.  The reauthorization of these projects for navigation will provide the  harbors access to Federal resources for maintenance dredging and  improvements to navigational systems, which will allow them to  accommodate more and larger cruise ships over the long term, thereby  better competing in a competitive Caribbean market. This is a very  strong bill for the ports and harbors of the United States.   Lastly, this bill is probably the most progressive bill in a  generation in terms of directing the Army Corps toward greater  resiliency of future water resources development projects. It includes  several provisions to modernize how the Corps develops future projects  to make sure that it is better able to deal with issues of climate  change and extreme wet weather events.   All in all, this is a significant investment in water resources  infrastructure, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
