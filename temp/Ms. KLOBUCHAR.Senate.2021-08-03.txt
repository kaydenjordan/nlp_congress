 Mr. President, I thank Senator Schumer for his  leadership.   With that said, we in the Senate were able to come unanimously behind  this important, important resolution, which I will describe in a  minute.   I also thank Senator McConnell, and I certainly thank my friend  Senator Blunt for his leadership.   We must pass this legislation honoring the Capitol Police and other  heroes who protected the Capitol on January 6 by awarding them this  Congressional Gold Medal.   Senator Blunt joined me from the beginning in sponsoring the Senate  version of this legislation and worked with me on the Rules Committee.  And I thank the Presiding Officer, Senator Padilla, for his great  service on that committee to continue the work of getting to the bottom  of the security, planning, and response failures that we saw on January  6.   While that work goes on, it is important that we recognize the  bravery and patriotism of those who defended our democracy and our  lives with Congress's highest honor.   The insurrection at the Capitol was more than an assault on  democracy. Oh, it was that in a big, big way, but it was also an actual  life-or-death situation for the many brave law enforcement officers who  show up here to do their work every day.   We will never forget the haunting shrieks of the police officer  pinned in between the doors at the hands of rioters, pleading for help.  We will never forget Officer Harry Dunn, who told his story again last  week at the House select committee, recounting how he fought against  the violent mob for hours and after it was all over, broke down in  tears, telling fellow officers in the Rotunda that he had been called  the N-word multiple times that day. And he looked at his friend, his  fellow officer, and said: ``Is this America?''   These medals today, these Congressional Gold Medals that will be  displayed for millions to see--one at the Smithsonian, one in this  Capitol, one at the Metropolitan Police, and one with the Capitol  Police--they answer that question.   No, Officer Dunn, that was not America, but these medals that  recognize your bravery, this is America.   Then our own Officer Eugene Goodman, who after saving Senator Romney  from walking directly into the mob of insurrectionists, ran by himself  to take on a group of rioters and then diverted that mob away. We have  all seen it on the video. We know what he was doing: allowing the rest  of us to safely depart.   Tragically, the attack on the Capitol also cost the lives of four  brave officers, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who  died the day following the attack. And I had the honor to meet his  family.   Four other officers died following the events of January 6: DC  Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, his colleagues Gunther  Hashida and Kyle DeFreytag, whos passings were reported just yesterday,  and, of course, Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood.    We are also so inspired by the work of their loved ones who have come  to Capitol Hill to fight for a 9/11-style Commission to look at the  insurrection and why it happened, to get to the bottom of it and to  advocate for the Capitol Police to support their officers.   It has been reported that at least 140 more officers sustained  injuries from defending the Capitol. The courage of these officers will  be remembered forever.   We responded. Senator Blunt and I joined with Senator Portman and  Peters on the Homeland Security Committee to interview officials from  multiple agencies and review thousands of documents. We convened major  public hearings and then interviewed many, many other witnesses.   Our resulting bipartisan joint report focused on the security,  planning, and response failures related to the violent and  unprecedented insurrection at the Capitol, and it includes key findings  and recommendations that must be put in place without delay. I am  pleased that we have introduced our bipartisan bill, which will make  sure that the new Police Chief will be able to call in help from the  National Guard without calling a bunch of other people in the middle of  a crisis.   We have just passed, on a bipartisan basis, thanks to Senators Leahy  and Shelby, major security funding that will help to give the police  the resources they need and fund the improvements needed to this  Capitol.   We also have put in place two new Sergeants at Arms, one in the  Senate and one in the House, as well as a new Police Chief, Chief  Manger, whom I just met with for a lengthy period of time yesterday to  go over all of our recommendations. By the end of the year, I will  appear in this Chamber with a checklist to make sure that they are  either done being implemented or in the process of being implemented to  be done soon.   Another key priority that we called for in our report was advanced  last week when the President signed into law, as I said, all of the  funding that we need. And what that includes that I didn't mention,  $4.4 million for mental health support for Capitol Police officers and  the many officers who are still dealing, as we can see, with trauma to  this day.   Passing this bill, which, of course, already passed the House--and,  yes, I agree with Senator Schumer about how it is impossible to  understand why some people voted against it, but it still passed with  bipartisan support--is another step forward to honor the heroism and  sacrifice of our law enforcement.   Those medals, when little kids walk by and see them at the  Smithsonian, their parents are going to be able to tell them this  happened. This attack happened, and there were brave police officers  and staff and others in this  [[Page S5687]]  building that stood up that day and protected our democracy, and we  will be forever thankful to them.   We are hearing a lot about gold medals, and some of them by our own  USA team that we are so proud of the last week at the Olympics.   This is our Olympics. This is our gold medal. And it goes to them, to  the Capitol Police officers and the Metropolitan Police officers and  others that protected us that day.   Thanks, Senator Blunt, who is here with us as well.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from  further consideration and the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.R. 3325.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, every  single one of them, including Senator Blunt and Senator Collins, who is  here with us today, for supporting this legislation and honoring the  heroism and patriotism of the courageous law enforcement officers who  risk and in some cases sacrifice their lives to defend our democracy. I  also want to thank Senator Blunt for his work on the Senate version of  this legislation, as well as Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell, and  I thank Senator Blunt for joining me today.   Now it is headed to the President's desk. No more motions, and this  is done. I look forward to seeing this bill signed into law.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
