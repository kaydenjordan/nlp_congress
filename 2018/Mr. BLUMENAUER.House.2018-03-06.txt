 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in  permitting me to speak on this.   This bill, I think, is an example of the politics and legislation  that Ray Baum would be particularly proud of, characterizing his work  as a policymaker and a policy adviser.   I had a chance to work with Ray in his other hats: chairing the  Public Utilities Commission, as a distinguished legislator and majority  leader, and, of course, his role here in Congress.   I appreciate the product we have before us today. I have enjoyed  listening to people reaffirm areas that they are proud of, making a  difference for people.   I appreciate, in particular, the authorization of new spending to  help broadcasters' expenses relating to spectrum reallocation. This is  very important, especially for public broadcasting stations.   But I want to raise one item of concern, and I hope the chairman and  ranking member would work with us to look at the bill's study of  spectrum for commercial uses dealing with the mid-band, or C-band, to  consider public broadcasting.   I fear that if we are thrust into competitive bidding with public  broadcasting, they are likely to not be able to compete effectively.  But it will affect millions of people across the country.   I applaud the committee's bipartisanship and work with the Senate,  but I hope that future consideration of the impact of C-band  reallocation on public broadcasting would be something that the  committee could look at to make sure that we are protecting those vital  interests.
