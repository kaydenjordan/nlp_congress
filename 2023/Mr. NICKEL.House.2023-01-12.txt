 Madam Speaker, it is the honor of a lifetime to represent  the people of North Carolina's 13th District.   While we have seen chaos and confusion play out in this very Chamber  over the past week, I want to make it clear that I am here to solve  problems and not get caught up in politics as usual.   It is important for the American people to know that there are adults  in the room, and reasonable minds will prevail. I am committed to  working across the aisle to do what is right for North Carolina.   North Carolina's 13th District is one of the fastest growing  districts in the country, and Congress needs to address the challenges  that come with that growth.   My constituents need their tax dollars to be used responsibly to  improve roads and bridges. They need solutions that bring down the cost  of housing and childcare. We need immigration reform that allows our  economy to prosper.   Madam Speaker, I support immigration reform that includes a pathway  to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants known as the Dreamers,  along with robust border security.   From Apex to Goldsboro, my district has a diverse set of needs and  priorities, and the time for action is now.                            ____________________
