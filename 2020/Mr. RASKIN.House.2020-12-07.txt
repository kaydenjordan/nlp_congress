 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 1100) reaffirming the strategic partnership between  the United States and Mongolia and observing the 30th anniversary of  democracy in Mongolia, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1100         Whereas the United States and Mongolia established       diplomatic relations in January 1987, and since that time the       relationship has grown stronger based on shared strategic       interests, security cooperation, democratic values, good       governance, and respect for human rights;        Whereas, since its peaceful democratic revolution in 1989,       Mongolia has charted, through a series of initiatives, a       successful path to multiparty democracy and a free market       economy;        Whereas, in 1990, the Government of Mongolia declared an       end to a one-party, authoritarian, political system and       adopted democratic and free market reforms;        Whereas, in 1992, Mongolia adopted a constitution       establishing a parliamentary democracy, becoming the first       country in Asia to transition from communism to democracy;        Whereas, in 1999, the Government of Mongolia invited the       Peace Corps to establish its program in the country and has       since hosted 1,437 volunteers in English and health       education;        Whereas Mongolia has shown its commitment to a ``third       neighbor'' relationship with the United States by sending       troops to support United States operations in Iraq from 2003       through 2008 and Afghanistan since 2009, and Mongolia has a       strong record of troop contributions to international       peacekeeping missions;        Whereas successive Mongolian governments have taken notable       steps to strengthen civil society, battle corruption, and       spur economic development;  [[Page H6863]]         Whereas the Parliament of Mongolia, the State Great Khural,       has engaged with Congress, including through the House       Democracy Partnership, thereby promoting responsive and       effective governance through peer-to-peer cooperation;        Whereas Mongolia began as a partner to the Organization for       Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in 2004, graduated       to become a participating state in 2012, and participates       actively in the work of the OSCE for stability, peace, and       democracy;        Whereas Mongolia has regularly invited the OSCE and other       organizations to send monitoring teams to its Presidential       and parliamentary elections;        Whereas Mongolia has also been an active member of the       Community of Democracies (CoD), a global coalition of       countries that support adherence to common democratic values       and standards, and Mongolia has not only remained active       since the founding of the CoD in 2000 but also successfully       chaired the CoD from 2011 through 2013;        Whereas, in addition to supporting the OSCE and CoD,       Mongolia supports democratic initiatives while participating       in a wide range of other global institutions;        Whereas most recently, on June 24, 2020, Mongolia       successfully organized parliamentary elections, strengthening       its commitment to democracy and the rule of law;        Whereas the success of Mongolia as a democracy and its       strategic location, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and       ability to pursue an independent foreign policy are highly       relevant to the national security of the United States;        Whereas climate change in Mongolia has contributed to       severe droughts, higher temperatures, and extreme winter       weather conditions, resulting in mass deaths of livestock and       economic hardship for people living in rural communities,       especially the nomadic population;        Whereas the United States has provided support to Mongolia       through the Millennium Challenge Corporation through an       initial compact signed in 2007 designed to increase economic       growth and reduce poverty and a second compact signed in 2018       involving investments in water infrastructure, including       supply and wastewater recycling, as well as water sector       sustainability;        Whereas, on September 20, 2018, the United States and       Mongolia signed a joint statement and the Roadmap for       Expanded Economic Partnership, outlining the intent to deepen       the bilateral commercial relationship through full       implementation of the obligations under the Agreement on       Transparency in Matters Related to International Trade and       Investment between the United States of America and Mongolia,       signed at New York, September 24, 2013 (in this preamble       referred to as the ``United States-Mongolia Transparency       Agreement''), and to collaborate in supporting Mongolian       small- and medium-sized enterprises through various programs       and projects;        Whereas according to the Bureau of the Census, trade       between the United States and Mongolia is modest but growing,       with a total value of trade in 2019 between the two countries       of approximately $217,500,000, including $192,700,000 in       United States exports to Mongolia and $24,800,000 in United       States imports from Mongolia;        Whereas Mongolia is a beneficiary country under the       Generalized System of Preferences program, but its use of the       program remains low, as in 2018 only $3,300,000 of exports       from Mongolia to the United States entered were under the       program; and        Whereas, on July 31, 2019, the United States and Mongolia       declared the bilateral relationship a ``Strategic       Partnership'' and noted the shared desire--        (1) to intensify cooperation as strong democracies based on       the rule of law through safeguarding and promoting democratic       values and human rights, including the freedoms of religion       or belief, expression, including internet and media freedom,       assembly, and association, anticorruption and fiscal       transparency, and youth and emerging leader development;        (2) to cooperate in promoting national security and       stability across the Indo-Pacific region so that all       countries, secure in their sovereignty, are able to pursue       economic growth consistent with international law and       principles of fair competition;        (3) to deepen national security and law-enforcement ties       through collaboration on bilateral and multilateral security,       judicial, and law enforcement efforts in the region;        (4) to strengthen cooperation in multilateral engagements       such as peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and disaster       preparedness and relief operations;        (5) to expand trade and investment relations on a fair and       reciprocal basis, support private sector-led growth, fully       implement the United States-Mongolia Transparency Agreement,       promote women's entrepreneurship, and continue to explore       support for infrastructure under the new United States       International Development Finance Corporation with the new       tools provided under the BUILD Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 9601 et       seq.);        (6) to strengthen border security, prevent illegal       transshipment and trafficking, expand cooperation on civil       aviation safety and oversight, and efficiently facilitate       legitimate travel between Mongolia and the United States;        (7) to increase cooperation in addressing transnational       threats such as terrorism, human trafficking, drug       trafficking, the proliferation of weapons of mass       destruction, cyberattacks, transnational organized crime,       pandemics, and other emerging nontraditional security       threats;        (8) to continue to develop an environment in which civil       society, social media, and a free and independent media can       flourish; and        (9) to maintain high-level official dialogues, encourage       bilateral exchanges at all levels of government, and further       develop people-to-people exchanges to deepen engagement on       issues of mutual interest and concern: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) underscores the importance of the relationship between       the United States and Mongolia and remains committed to       advancing this Strategic Partnership in the future;        (2) encourages the United States Government to help       Mongolia use its benefits under the Generalized System of       Preferences program and other relevant programs to increase       trade between the United States and Mongolia;        (3) urges the United States International Development       Finance Corporation to expand activities in Mongolia to       support economic development, diversification of the economy       of Mongolia, and women-owned small- and medium-sized       enterprises;        (4) urges Mongolia to address climate change and continue       to work with the UN Environment Programme, the Global Climate       Fund, and other global institutions to strengthen climate       change resilience;        (5) urges private and public support to help diversify the       economy of Mongolia through increased cooperation and       investments, as well as infrastructure and other vital       projects;        (6) supports the resumption of the Peace Corps program in       Mongolia once the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided;        (7) urges the Department of State, the United States Agency       for International Development, and other relevant agencies to       continue to support Mongolia's democratic and economic       development and efforts on anticorruption;        (8) calls for the continued engagement of Mongolia in the       Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the       Community of Democracies, congressional-parliamentary       partnerships, including continued high-level parliamentary       exchange, and other institutions that promote democratic       values, which reinforces the commitment of the people and the       Government of Mongolia to those values and standards;        (9) reaffirms the importance of civil society to the       continued democratic development of Mongolia;        (10) encourages the Government of Mongolia to build a       regulatory system that supports and encourages the growth and       operation of independent nongovernmental organizations and       continues to pursue policies of transparency that uphold       democratic values;        (11) urges Mongolia to continue their commitment to free,       fair and credible elections; and        (12) encourages the Government of Mongolia to continue       legal reform, build institutional capacity, and improve the       independence of other democratic institutions.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on H. Res. 1100, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this year marks 30 years since Mongolia's democratic  transition. Mongolia is a true success story, a landlocked country  squeezed between two huge neighbors, China and Russia, that has  nonetheless become a shining democratic breakthrough story in Asia.   As Mongolia's so-called third neighbor, the U.S. should continue to  build upon our shared interests and commitment to democratic values and  further advance our strategic partnership.   From national security to economic stability, Mongolia has  demonstrated its commitment to our partnership by hosting annual  peacekeeping exercises and participating in U.S.-led programs like the  House Democracy Partnership and the Open World Leadership Center.   Our countries must also continue to partner closely on global  warming. Climate change is a pressing concern for all the world and has  already gravely affected the livelihood and well-being of the Mongolian  people, who now face widespread livestock and crop losses, as well as  escalating extreme-weather events.  [[Page H6864]]                                     time  1215    This resolution urges the expansion of U.S.-Mongolia economic ties  and encourages the Mongolian Government to continue to increase  transparency, freedom, and good governance.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Titus for her work on this  bipartisan resolution. I urge all Members to support it, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, December 7, 2020.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of H. Res. 1100, Reaffirming the       strategic partnership between the United States and Mongolia       and observing the 30th anniversary of democracy in Mongolia,       the Committee on Ways and Means agrees to waive formal       consideration of the resolution as to provisions that fall       within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and       Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the resolution or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H. Res.       1100.            Sincerely,                                           Hon. Richard E. Neal,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Ways and Means.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, December 1, 2020.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: I am writing to you concerning H. Res.       1100, Reaffirming the strategic partnership between the       United States and Mongolia and observing the 30th anniversary       of democracy in Mongolia. I appreciate your willingness to       work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H. Res.       1100 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on Ways and Means conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to strongly support H. Res. 1100, which  recognizes Mongolia's commitment to democracy, security, cooperation,  and respect for human rights and reaffirms the important growing  partnership between our two nations.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to, once again, thank Ms. Titus and Mr.  Yoho for their leadership on this resolution. I urge all Members to  join us in supporting it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 512) calling for the global repeal of blasphemy,  heresy, and apostasy laws, as amended.  [[Page H6865]]    The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 512         Whereas Article 18 of the International Declaration of       Human Rights states that ``[e]veryone has the right to       freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right       includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and       freedom, either alone or in community with others and in       public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in       teaching, practice, worship and observance'';        Whereas many countries continue to have criminal blasphemy       laws and punish people who engage in expression deemed by the       government to be blasphemous, heretical, apostate, defamatory       of religion, or insulting to religion or to religious       symbols, figures, or feelings, and such punishment can       include fines, imprisonment, and capital punishment including       by beheading;        Whereas blasphemy laws have affected Christians, Muslims,       Jews, Hindus, Baha'i, secularists, and many other groups, are       inconsistent with international human rights standards       because they establish and promote official religious       orthodoxy and dogma over individual liberty, and often result       in violations of the freedoms of religion, thought, and       expression that are protected under international       instruments, including Articles 18 and 19 of the       International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR);        Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Committee stated in       General Comment 34 that ``[p]rohibitions of displays of lack       of respect for a religion or other belief system, including       blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the [ICCPR].'';        Whereas the United States Commission on International       Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has found that blasphemy charges       are often based on false accusations, are used for sectarian       or political purposes, and foster religious intolerance,       discrimination, and violence;        Whereas USCIRF has found that at least 70 countries had       blasphemy laws as of 2018;        Whereas these laws were present in 18 Middle East and North       African countries, 8 countries in the Americas, 18 Asia-      Pacific countries, 14 European countries, and 12 Sub-Saharan       African countries;        Whereas the Pew Research Center found that countries with       laws against blasphemy, apostasy, or defamation of religion       were more likely to have severe governmental restrictions on       religion, and to experience social hostilities based on       religion, than countries that did not have such laws;        Whereas restrictive laws beyond those penalizing blasphemy,       heresy, and apostasy further limit religious freedom, such as       extremism laws--        (1) in Russia that have been used to ban Jehovah's       Witnesses as an extremist organization and fueled persecution       of this religious group;        (2) in China, to arbitrarily detain an estimated 800,000 to       2,000,000 Uighur Muslims in internment camps because they       followed Islamic rituals and practices; and        (3) in North Korea, to detain an estimated 50,000 to 70,000       Christians in labor camps because they followed the tenets of       Christianity;         Whereas an international group of experts convened by the       Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human       Rights recommended in 2012 that ``[s]tates that have       blasphemy laws should repeal the[m] as such laws have a       stifling impact on the enjoyment of freedom of religion or       belief and healthy dialogue and debate about religion.'';        Whereas blasphemy laws are inconsistent with United Nations       resolutions adopted by consensus since 2011 recognizing that       religious intolerance is best fought through positive       measures, such as education, outreach, and counter-speech,       and that criminalization of speech is warranted only for the       prevention of imminent violence;        Whereas according to the annual religious freedom report       published by the Department of State in 2015, attackers in       Bangladesh killed five allegedly anti-Islamic or secularist       writers and publishers, and injured three others;        Whereas in response to these killings, the Home Minister of       Bangladesh, rather than condemning the murders, called on       bloggers and others to refrain from writings that could hurt       the religious feelings of others and added that violators of       the warning would be subject to prosecution under the       restrictive religious freedom laws of Bangladesh;        Whereas a 2016 report by USCIRF on Bangladesh found that       religious and civil society groups fear that increasing       religious extremism will result in more criminal attacks and       threats;        Whereas restrictive religious freedom laws validate and       promote social violence targeted at religious minorities and       dissenters, whether Christian, Muslim, secularist, or other;        Whereas USCIRF has found that in Pakistan, blasphemy laws       have been used to prosecute and persecute Muslims,       Christians, secularists, and others;        Whereas according to a Pew Center report on religion and       public life, Pakistan stands out for having one of the       highest levels of restrictions on religion when both       government restrictions and social hostilities are taken into       account;        Whereas USCIRF has found egregious examples of the       enforcement of blasphemy laws and vigilante violence       connected to blasphemy allegations in Pakistan, where       blasphemy charges are common and numerous individuals are in       prison, with a high percentage sentenced to death or to life       in prison;        Whereas, as of May 2018, USCIRF was aware of approximately       40 individuals on death row for blasphemy in Pakistan or       serving life sentences;        Whereas Asia Bibi was sentenced to death for blasphemy in       2010 and was held for 8 years, until the Supreme Court of       Pakistan overturned her conviction in 2018, upheld her       acquittal, and granted her permission to leave the country to       flee the threats against her in 2019;        Whereas Pakistan selectively enforces the blasphemy and       anti-terrorism laws against minority religious groups,       including by specifically targeting Ahmadiyya Muslims such as       Abdul Shakoor, an 80-year old optician and bookseller who was       recently released after serving over three years in prison on       such charges;        Whereas blasphemy laws in Pakistan have fostered a climate       of impunity, as those who falsify evidence go unpunished and       allegations often result in violent mob attacks or       assassinations, with little to no police response;        Whereas in 2017, the Christian Governor of Jakarta,       Indonesia, was convicted for blasphemy of Islam and sentenced       to two years in jail;        Whereas several countries that maintained blasphemy laws       have recently taken steps towards removing these provisions,       including Greece, Ireland, and Canada;        Whereas blasphemy laws in the United States were       invalidated by the adoption of the First Amendment to the       Constitution, which protects the freedoms of thought,       conscience, expression, and religious exercise; and        Whereas the United States has become a beacon of religious       freedom and tolerance around the world: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws       inappropriately position governments as arbiters of religious       truth and empower officials to impose religious dogma on       individuals or minorities through the power of the government       or through violence sanctioned by the government;        (2) calls on the President and the Secretary of State to       make the repeal of blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws a       priority in the bilateral relationships of the United States       with all countries that have such laws, through direct       interventions in bilateral and multilateral fora;        (3) encourages the President and the Secretary of State to       oppose--        (A) any efforts, by the United Nations or by other       international or multilateral fora, to create an       international anti-blasphemy norm, such as the ``defamation       of religions'' resolutions introduced in the United Nations       between 1999 and 2010; and        (B) any attempts to expand the international norm on       incitement to include blasphemy or defamation of religions;        (4) supports efforts by the United Nations to combat       intolerance, discrimination, or violence against persons       based on religion or belief without restricting expression,       including United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/      18 (2011) and the Istanbul Process meetings pursuant to such       resolution, that are consistent with the First Amendment to       the Constitution;        (5) calls on the President and the Secretary of State to       designate countries that enforce blasphemy, heresy, or       apostasy laws as ``countries of particular concern for       religious freedom'' under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the       International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C.       6442(b)(1)(A)(ii)) for engaging in or tolerating severe       violations of religious freedom, as a result of the abuses       flowing from the enforcement of such laws and from unpunished       vigilante violence often generated by blasphemy allegations;        (6) urges the governments of countries that enforce       blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy laws to amend or repeal such       laws, as they provide pretext and impunity for vigilante       violence against religious minorities; and        (7) urges the governments of countries that have       prosecuted, imprisoned, and persecuted people on charges of       blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy to release such people       unconditionally and, once released, to ensure their safety       and that of their families.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 512.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H6866]]    Mr. Speaker, in this age of partisan division, one of the  foundational American values still has the power to bring us together  across the aisle: the defense of every human being's freedom of  religious conscience and freedom of thought against government  persecution. With H. Res. 512, we act today to stand up for religious  and intellectual freedom in a world gone mad with religious  discrimination, religious oppression, and religious violence.   H. Res. 512 calls for global repeal of laws punishing blasphemy,  heresy, and apostasy, three religiously defined thought crimes that  have no actual victims and, thus, no place in the criminal law of free  nations. Yet governments in 84 countries, from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and  Somalia to China, Russia, and Bangladesh, still use laws like these to  intimidate, arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate members of minority  religions, disfavored faiths, and freethinkers.   Putting people in jail or even condemning them to death for  religiously subversive speech was not unknown in American colonies. In  Massachusetts, Puritan Governors hanged Quakers for their heretical  lectures in town squares.   But our enlightenment Constitution, especially our First Amendment  free exercise and antireligious establishment clauses, put us squarely  on the path of rejecting blasphemy laws and these other relics of  inquisition, holy crusades, and New England witchcraft trials. Our law  has gotten rid of obsolete offenses like blasphemy and apostasy because  they have a purely religious character and do not refer to empirical  social harms.   Blasphemy is making impious or sacrilegious statements about  established churches or doctrines.   Heresy is taking religious or intellectual positions at odds with an  established religious orthodoxy.   Apostasy is breaking away from a religious orthodoxy or a church.   As offensive as we might consider other people's religious views and  utterances, in America today, people's thoughts and words about  religion are absolutely protected by the First Amendment. But in many  parts of the world where religion is still actively weaponized by  theocratic and authoritarian governments, these imaginary offenses can  still get you thrown into jail, harassed, and executed, or simply  stopped and torn limb from limb by state-sanctioned lynch mobs.   Religious people of the wrong faith are the most common victims of  blasphemy and heresy laws.   You might be a practicing Christian or Hindu, Mr. Speaker, in an  officially Muslim state like Libya or Afghanistan or a devout Muslim in  a Hindu society like India. You might be a nonreligious person targeted  by your enemies or state authorities.   You might be a 22-year-old Nigerian gospel musician like Yahaya  Sharif-Aminu, who was convicted of blasphemy in a state sharia court in  Kano State on August 10 and has been sentenced to death by hanging for  something he said on a WhatsApp group on the internet.   Mr. Speaker, you might be a Sudanese Christian like Mariam Ibrahim,  who was jailed for apostasy because, although she had been a devout  Christian for her entire life, government officials demanded that she  follow her absent father's Muslim faith. She was held in jail with her  20-month-old son and forced to give birth to her daughter in prison  while her legs were shackled to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, you might be a 13-year-old Muslim boy in Nigeria like  Omar Farouq, who was sentenced to 10 years at hard labor for blasphemy  when he said something about Allah in an argument with friends, a  brutal miscarriage of justice condemned by UNICEF and child advocates  all over the world.   You might even belong to the wrong sect of the official state  religion. In the Islamic State of Pakistan, for example, people  belonging to the Ahmadiyya Muslim faith are being persecuted as  heretics and apostates as if this were the Middle Ages.   At least five Ahmadiyya Muslims have been killed in Pakistan this  year alone because of their faith, including Tahir Ahmad Naseem, an  American citizen who was murdered in broad daylight in a courtroom  while standing trial for blasphemy charges just for practicing his own  religion. While his teenage killer was arrested, he is being celebrated  now as a martyr by the media and members of the police service who  watched him kill Naseem.   Mr. Speaker, the global assault on religious and intellectual freedom  today is taking place in many of the world's largest countries:   China confines millions of Uighur Muslims in miserable reeducation  camps and forces them into slave labor in Xinjiang province;   Russia has decreed that Jehovah's Witnesses are an extremist group  and confiscated their property, jailed their members, and even  allegedly tortured some of them;   India recently passed draconian laws burdening the rights of  disfavored Muslim minorities.   With this resolution, Mr. Speaker, against the new wave of global  religious oppression and persecution, America can once again take the  lead in defending the basic human rights of religious and intellectual  freedom all over the world.   James Madison, the author of our First Amendment, denounced that  ``diabolical, hell-conceived principle of persecution,'' and he stated  in his remonstrance against religious assessments that ``the religion .  . . of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every  man.''    Let us share this principle with the nations of the world with this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very thoughtful and  eloquent statement in defense of religious freedom, the value that  unites us behind this powerful resolution, which will put the  government squarely back in the fight to defend religious liberty all  over the world and to oppose the spread of these blasphemy laws that  are being used to persecute innocent people all over the globe.   Mr. Speaker, in our country, the religious Free Exercise Clause and  the clause against establishment of religion stand best when they stand  together because they both stand for the  [[Page H6867]]  principle that no particular religious sect can seize control of state  power and then persecute members of other religious groups, but that is  what is happening in so many places all over the world.   Mr. Speaker, our experience in the separation of church and state and  standing up for the free exercise of religion is something that we can  continue to proudly promote to the rest of the world, and we do have  something that we think we can teach other nations that want to follow  the path of democracy and freedom.   As the U.S. works to advance human rights, it is critical that we put  this question of freedom of thought, freedom of conscience right at the  heart of our efforts. Everyone must be able to practice their faith--or  no faith at all--without the threat of government violence and  persecution.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this excellent measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 823) condemning the Government of Iran's state- sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued  violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 823         Whereas, in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996,       2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017,       and 2018, Congress declared that it deplored the religious       persecution by the Government of Iran of the Baha'i community       and would hold the Government of Iran responsible for       upholding the rights of all Iranian nationals, including       members of the Baha'i faith;        Whereas, since 1979, Iranian authorities have killed or       executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders, and more than 10,000       have been dismissed from government and university jobs;        Whereas the Report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur       on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of       Iran (A/74/188) dated July 18, 2019, provides, in part--        (1) the Iranian authorities and the Iranian criminal       justice system regard the Baha'is as ``unprotected       infidels''; the Baha'i faith is also ``regarded as a       misguided sect''; and ``Baha'i worship and religious       practices are deemed heresy.'';        (2) ``Baha'is have been murdered with impunity and       violations of their human rights have not been       investigated.'';        (3) members of the Baha'i faith ``frequently face charges,       such as, ``breaching national security', ``propaganda against       the holy regime of the Islamic Republic of Iran', or       `propaganda activities against the regime in the interests of       the Baha'i sect' '';        (4) ``Since August 2005, more than 1,168 Baha'is have been       arrested and charged with vaguely worded offences.'';        (5) ``There were a total of 95 Baha'is reportedly arrested       in 2018, compared with at least 84 in 2017 and 81 in 2016.'';        (6) ``On 1 January 2019, the court of appeal of Isfahan       reportedly condemned, in separate judgments, nine Baha'i       citizens to a total of 48 years of prison. They had been       charged with `membership of the illegal Baha'i community and       propaganda against the regime by spreading the Baha'i faith       in the society.' '';        (7) directed by a 2007 letter from the Security Unit of the       Public Place Supervision Office of the Islamic Republic of       Iran to police commanders throughout the country, Iranian       authorities continue to apply economic pressure against the       Baha'i community, by banning them from specific professions       and ``halting their entry to `high earning businesses' '';       and        (8) ``Since 2013, there have been more than 803 incidents       of violations of economic rights of the Baha'is, including       arbitrary shop closures, unfair dismissals from employment       and the actual or threatened revocation of business       licenses.'';        Whereas the Department of State's International Religious       Freedom Report for 2019, Iran section, provides, in part--        (1) ``Non-Shia Muslims and those affiliated with a religion       other than Islam, especially members of the Baha'i community,       continued to face societal discrimination and harassment, and       employers experienced social pressures not to hire Baha'is or       to dismiss them from their private sector jobs.''; and        (2) ``The law bars Baha'is from founding their own       educational institutions. A Ministry of Science, Research,       and Technology order requires universities to exclude Baha'is       from access to higher education or expel them if their       religious affiliation becomes known.'';        Whereas, on March 11, 2020, the Department of State       released the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for       2019 and, in connection with Iran, the report provides, in       part--        (1) Iranian authorities ``barred Baha'i students from       higher education'', and in 2019, denied enrollment to at       least 22 Baha'i college applicants solely because of their       religious affiliation despite passing the national admissions       test;        (2) ``The country materially contributed to human rights       abuses . . . in Yemen, through its support for Houthi rebels       and directing authorities in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen       to harass and detain Baha'is because of their religious       affiliation.''; and        (3) ``In July 2019, Iran Wire, a human rights reporting       agency, reported the case of Hamed Rezvani, a Baha'i musician       and teacher, who left his home in Isfahan in December 2018       and has not been heard from since. Repeated requests by the       Rezvani family for information from police and local       intelligence have not produced any information about his       disappearance.'';  [[Page H6868]]         Whereas according to the 2020 Annual Report of the United       States Commission on International Religious Freedom       (USCIRF)--        (1) ``There are more than 300,000 Baha'is in Iran, who       together constitute the largest non-Muslim religious minority       in the country.'';        (2) ``Security forces also prevented the burial of two       deceased Baha'i individuals in a Baha'i cemetery in Kerman       after it was sealed in March 2018. In October, the body of a       deceased Baha'i woman was exhumed four days after her burial       and abandoned in a desert area outside the town of Jaban.'';        (3) There is a ``particular uptick in the persecution of       Baha'is'', including of local government officials who       advocated on behalf of Baha'is, and the Iranian government       blamed Baha'is, without evidence, for wide-spread popular       protests in 2019; and        (4) ``In July 2019, Twitter banned several official Iranian       media accounts for incitement against Baha'is in Iran.'';        Whereas the Baha'i International Community documented a       more than 50 percent increase in hate propaganda directed       against the Baha'is in the twelve-month period ending August       2020 compared to prior years with more than 9,500 such       articles, videos, or web pages appearing in Iranian       government-controlled or government-sponsored media;        Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a       signatory to both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights       and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,       among other international human rights treaties, without       reservation;        Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions,       Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514)       authorizes the President to impose sanctions on individuals       ``responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for       ordering, controlling, or otherwise directing, the commission       of serious human rights abuses against citizens of Iran or       their family members on or after June 12, 2009''; and        Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights       Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-158) amends and expands the       authorities established under the Comprehensive Iran       Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 to       sanction Iranian human rights abusers: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the Government of Iran's state-sponsored       persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued       violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and       the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;        (2) calls on the Government of Iran--        (A) to immediately release all imprisoned or detained       Baha'is, together with all other prisoners held solely on       account of their religion;        (B) to end its state-sponsored campaign of hate propaganda       against the Baha'is; and        (C) to reverse state-imposed policies denying Baha'is and       members of other religious minorities equal opportunities to       higher education, earning a livelihood, due process under the       law, and the free exercise of religious practices;        (3) calls on the President and the Secretary of State, in       cooperation with responsible nations, to continue to condemn       the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights       and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on       account of their religion; and        (4) urges the President and the Secretary of State to       utilize available authorities to impose sanctions on       officials of the Government of Iran and other individuals       directly responsible for serious human rights abuses,       including abuses against the Baha'i community of Iran.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 823.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution condemning  the government of Iran's persecution of its besieged Baha'i minority. I  thank all of my colleagues who have worked on this, including on the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Deutch and Mr. Wilson, for their  leadership on this measure.   Mr. Speaker, the Government of Iran has carried out an inhumane  campaign of religious persecution against the Baha'i minority, its  largest nonMuslim religious minority in the country. The regime has  closed Baha'i-owned shops and stores, forbidden Baha'i citizens from  holding government jobs, and denied Baha'i children access to school.  Members of the Baha'i community have been unjustly arrested and  prosecuted and executed, targeted solely for their religious beliefs.   Mr. Speaker, the U.S. stands for the freedom of religious exercise,  and we must speak up in the face of this theocratic injustice. We  cannot forget those who struggled for their basic religious freedom and  civil liberty in Iran.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution sends a strong message to the Iranian  Government that the Government of the United States will not remain  silent in the face of such terrible oppression. It calls for the  immediate release of all imprisoned or detained Baha'is, and urges  sanctions on Iranian officials and others who are responsible for these  human rights abuses, including abuses against the Baha'i community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank Mr. Deutch and Mr. Wilson for their hard  work on this important resolution.   Mr. Speaker, American foreign policy must work to advance and protect  basic human rights around the world, including religious freedom and  the rights of religious minorities. When we see human rights  violations, like the ones the Iranian Government has inflicted on the  Baha'i community, we must speak out. We must pursue justice for the  victims and we must hold the perpetrators accountable. We must defend  people nonviolently exercising their faith against governments  violently imposing their will on the public.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a step in the direction of aggressive  defense of human rights, and I am pleased to support it. I urge all of  our colleagues to support this bipartisan measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
