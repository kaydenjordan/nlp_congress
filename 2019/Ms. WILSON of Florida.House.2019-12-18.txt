 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  impeachment of Donald J. Trump. This is not a joyous moment.  Impeachment ought to be an act that is exceedingly rare. Madam Speaker,  this is one of those rare occasions because this President's abuse of  power strikes at the very heart of our republic.   I was initially one of the holdouts on impeachment, preferring first  to see a strong, defensible case that Donald Trump had abused the power  of his office before endorsing such a serious step. When it became  clear that President Trump abused the power of his office by attempting  to extort the Ukraine government by withholding military aid in  exchange for a political investigation, our only choice was to move  forward on impeachment. Mr. Trump attempted to use the power of the  Presidency to subvert democracy itself.   My Republican friends argue, in part, that no crime was committed  because Mr. Zelensky claims he never felt pressure when asked to  criminally investigate the political rival of the most powerful man in  the world. I agree in part. These crimes were not committed against Mr.  Zelensky. Donald Trump believes that the power of the Presidency is his  personal tool to coerce the weak to do his bidding. If it had not been  Mr. Zelensky, it would have been some other poor fellow compromised by  need or greed. These crimes were committed against the Republic and the  American people who belong to it. And the power of impeachment was  given to this body to save us from small men entrusted with great  power. In 1787, Benjamin Franklin was asked this simple question:  ``What have we got, a republic or a monarchy?'' I hope that my  colleagues will answer as Mr. Franklin did: ``A republic, if we can  keep it.'' I will vote yes to impeach the President of the United  States. I urge my colleagues to do the same.
