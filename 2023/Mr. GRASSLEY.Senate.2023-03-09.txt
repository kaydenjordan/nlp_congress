 Madam President, today, I would like to extend best  wishes to the former Senator from New York, James L. Buckley. One  hundred years ago today, on the 9th of March, Jim was born the fourth  of 10 children, just as the Roaring '20s were getting underway. As he  celebrates his 100th birthday, an impressive milestone by all  accounts--I am also told he is the oldest living former U.S. Senator  among us--Barbara and I wish Jim and his family a happy celebration.   Jim Buckley was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1970 as a candidate of  the Conservative Party, making him the first third party candidate to  win election to the U.S. Senate in four decades. Representing the State  of New York in the 92nd through 94th sessions of Congress, he served  during a rocky period in U.S. history that included the Vietnam and  Watergate era. Before ever putting his name on the ballot for public  office, Jim enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1942, serving our country in  uniform during World War II. He received his law degree from Yale  University in 1949 and, from there, pursued a career in the law as an  attorney and in lawmaking as a U.S. Senator.   Our congressional service overlapped during the 94th Congress, when I  was a freshman Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. We didn't  have the opportunity to serve together here in the upper Chamber.  Senator Buckley ran for reelection as a Republican in 1976, losing to  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, with whom I served until his  retirement in 2001.   As conservatives, Senator Buckley and I share a commitment to shared  principles, limited government, sanctity of life, States' rights, and  safeguarding constitutional rights, including political free speech. In  fact, his name will be attached for posterity to a landmark decision of  the U.S. Supreme Court, Buckley v. Valeo. Then-Senator Buckley led a  coalition of free speech advocates to challenge amendments made to the  Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 because they interfered with  First Amendment rights.   Students of history, political junkies, and legal scholars recognize  that this case has shaped the landscape of free speech and campaign  finance for the last five decades. In 1976, the High Court arrived at  two important conclusions regarding campaign finance laws. On the one  hand, the Supreme Court found that contribution ceilings on individual  contributions did not violate the First Amendment. However, in a vote  of 7-1, it struck down restrictions on campaign expenses and found they  did violate the First Amendment as an infringement on free expression.   Following his time in the legislative branch, Senator Buckley went on  to serve in the Reagan administration in the U.S. State Department.  From 1982-1985, Senator Buckley served as president of Radio Free  Europe/Radio Liberty in Germany, essentially a clarion of the airwaves  fighting communism. From there, he continued his lifelong devotion to  public service when he was nominated by President Reagan to the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.   Judge Buckley was confirmed by the Senate on December 17, 1985. He  served for the next 11 years and assumed senior status on August 31,  1996. I have served on the Senate Judiciary committee every year I have  been honored to represent Iowa in the Senate, including 6 years as  chairman. My colleagues here in the Senate understand that I take  seriously my constitutional role to vet nominees to the Federal bench.  In our system of checks and balances, I strive to uphold this  fundamental cornerstone of our democratic republic. Lawmakers write the  laws and set policy. Judges interpret the laws; they don't exercise  their value judgments or impose their own policy preferences.   As Judge Buckley himself said at his portrait ceremony in December of  2003: ``I hope, though, that my service on this court has been able to  establish, if nothing else, that it is possible for a person to have  the strongest views on questions of public policy and still understand  and observe the sharp distinction between the constitutional role of a  legislator and that of a judge.''   I couldn't say it better myself. I salute this great American for his  public service to our great Nation, from the U.S. military and spanning  all three branches of the Federal Government. Senior statesman,  Senator, and judge may not be his most exalted titles. For someone  whose humility and commitment to family are well known, those honors  are husband, dad and grandfather. I extend my best wishes to Jim for a  happy 100th birthday. Thank you for your patriotism, principled  leadership, and service to America.                            ____________________
