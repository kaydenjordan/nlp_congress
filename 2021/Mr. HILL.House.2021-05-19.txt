 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the rising  rate of religious persecution around the world, where billions are  persecuted for practicing their chosen faith.   One of the tools we have to combat global religious injustice is the  Office of International Religious Freedom at the State Department.  However, this office remains without leadership. Thus far, President  Biden has neglected to appoint an ambassador-at-large for International  Religious Freedom.   That is why I led a bipartisan and bicameral letter to President  Biden to take action and appoint an ambassador-at-large for  International Religious Freedom.   Religious freedom is one of the most basic human rights, Mr. Speaker,  yet religious persecution continues around the world in countries like  Iran, Russia, and China.   President Biden must act now and nominate this ambassador and give  the U.S. Government a leading voice to combat this persecution and  ensure a future where all mankind can freely practice their religion of  choice without fear.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I commend my friend from Louisiana for  bringing our Members to the floor tonight to talk about something that  is so essential to American life, our careers, our work, our  independence, our ability to pursue happiness.   This pandemic has thrown many off track for that, and it is House  Republicans that want to make sure we pursue policies that get people  back to work, back to opportunity, back to independence.   Our small businesses in my home State of Arkansas and local economies  across our country are recovering from the devastation of the pandemic.  They now face a threat that has resulted from President Biden and House  Democrats' inflated and fiscally irresponsible approach to unemployment  benefits.   The Wall Street Journal reports there are over 8 million job  openings, Mr. Speaker, in the United States right now. That is almost  more jobs open than every person currently out of work.   Instead of encouraging these positions to be filled, my friends on  the other side of the aisle have disincentivized going back to work and  have made these benefits so appealing that it has disrupted labor  markets across the country, particularly in Arkansas, particularly  lower-income labor markets.   Medical workers, small businesses, and restaurants all tell me that  this is creating problems for them. It has hurt States so much that a  handful of individual States are now rejecting participating in Federal  unemployment benefits.   This is not the direction we need to go, and it does not take an  economist to understand this is not a permanent solution. We cannot  keep tying policies back to a once-in-a-century pandemic that will  systematically change our country forever.   The solution is simple, and it is what House Republicans are  advocating and have been advocating for months. We need policies that  encourage Americans to get back to work, not policies that encourage  reliance on the Federal Government.
