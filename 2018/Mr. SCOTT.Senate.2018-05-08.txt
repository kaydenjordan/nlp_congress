 Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to honor  Callie's Biscuits, a small business in Charleston, SC, that serves up  homemade, nationally recognized biscuits.   Callie's was founded in 2005 by Carrie Morey to bring her mother  Callie's biscuit recipe to folks across the country. I had a chance to  meet Carrie in person, and there is no question that she exudes the  exact traits required of someone determined to run a prosperous  business. Today the company has since expanded to three locations,  including Charleston's Upper King District and the Charleston City  Market. Her goal was to build a business around her passion for  southern food while creating a healthy environment for her to still  spend time with her family. When Carrie first started the company, she  only used part-time help. She now employs 65 people who help her carry  out her business's day-to-day operations, while keeping the tradition  of southern biscuit-making alive.   The story of Callie's Biscuits is exemplary of the American  entrepreneurial spirit that we are honoring during National Small  Business Week. Callie's and other small businesses play a critical and  unique role in our national economy and our communities. Carrie's  success has brought great joy to South Carolinians and has garnered  national recognition for her biscuits.   Carrie also gives back to her community; she is a guest lecturer at  the College of Charleston Business School's entrepreneurship classes  and serves as an adviser to innovators at a baking incubator she  operates. In this role, she advises these entrepreneurs on both baking  and operating a small business. I would like to congratulate Carrie and  all the employees of Callie's Biscuits for the positive impact they are  making in the lowcountry and beyond, and I wish them continued success  in their business.                            ____________________
