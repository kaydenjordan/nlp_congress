 Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory of  Frank Bradley, a lifelong Tallahassee, FL, resident who owned a famed  local country store and was well regarded as a consummate southern  gentleman.   Frank Bradley was born on July 11, 1925, in Tallahassee and served  his country honorably in the U.S. Navy during World War II. When he  came home from the war, he began working in his father's family store,  Bradley's Country Store. In 1970, Frank added a packinghouse to the  store, with products still made from his grandmother Mary's 1910  recipe.   He also began to host the store's annual Old Fashioned Fun Day, which  brings in thousands of visitors each year. Frank retired from the store  in 2008, leaving it in the hands of his daughter Janet. His lesson for  her was to treat their customers with respect as if they are always  right.   Frank was dedicated to improving his community and worked to address  issues affecting residents, including leading the charge to pave a  portion of Old Centerville Road. While he sought for the entire road to  be paved to the Georgia line, he accepted a compromise of 2 miles.   I express my sincere condolences to his wife Lillian, two daughters  Janet Bradley Parker and Julie Bradley Obrecht, six grandchildren, and  one great-grandson. May God bless his family during this time of  loss.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize the Sunrise Sting  2000 Girls Soccer Club, who won the 2018 United States Youth Soccer  National Championship.   Sunrise Sting 2000 is comprised of talented young women from Sunrise,  FL. Several of the players have been together since they were 8 years  old, under the direction of coach Juan Laureano. Sunrise Sting has  existed since 1975; yet this is their first time winning the Southern  Regional and National Championship tournaments.   After winning the Southern Regional Championship 4-0 against  Mandeville, LA, the team entered the final stage of the National  Championship series. In group play, the Sunrise club defeated CDA  Slammers FC from California 1-0 in their opening match. They rebounded  from losing a close contest to Campton United of Illinois with a 3-1  victory over the Scottsdale Blackhawks of Arizona. In the semifinals,  they won 3-0 over CDA Premier 00 of Ohio.   In the National Championship game, they avenged their previous loss  to Campton United by defeating them with a 3-2 victory, despite  trailing at halftime. The team considers itself a family and refused to  quit in the face of adversity because of their strong teamwork.   I extend my best wishes to head coach Aguinaldo Ferreira, coach Juan  Laureano, Victoria Burbrick, Stephanie Cuan, Taylor Dobles, Marlee  Fray, Liliana Fernandez, Kayla Fernandez, Madison Grushoff, Jordan  Horacek, Cassandra Lawson, Chloe Laureano, Elizabeth Matei, Maiya  Matos, Megan Morgan, Sylvie Prepetit, Evanthia Spyredes, Amber Tam,  Samantha Wald, Sydney Waiters, and the entire Sunrise Sting  organization on this impressive accomplishment.                            ____________________
