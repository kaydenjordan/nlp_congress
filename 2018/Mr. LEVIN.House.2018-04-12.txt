 Mr. Speaker, here they go again. Republicans are coming to  the House floor to decry growing deficits, as if they had nothing to do  with them.   Just this week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  reported that the federal deficit is going to double over the next five  years--driven by policies passed by a Republican-controlled House and a  Republican-controlled Senate and signed into law by a Republican  President.   Their hands are stained with red ink.   The fact that these same Republicans are now saying we need a  Balanced Budget Amendment to tame our debt is more than a little hard  to swallow. In fact, I don't know how they are not choking on their  hypocrisy.   Republicans increased the deficit by $1.9 trillion to provide huge  tax breaks mostly to wealthy individuals and large corporations. Just  look at the analysis from the Tax Policy Center, which shows the top  one percent--those with income over $730,000 a year--getting an average  tax cut of over $50,000 in 2018, compared to only $60 for those at the  bottom.   And CBO tells us the deficit will grow even higher if the GOP further  extends these tax cuts for the top.   The purpose of today's activity is not to bring balance to the  budget--it is to provide political cover for Republicans. But even they  are having trouble pretending to take this bill seriously.   Here's what Representative Mark Meadows, Chairman of the Freedom  Caucus, has said about this measure:         There is no one on Capitol Hill, and certainly no one on       Main Street, that will take this vote seriously.    Representative Jim Jordan characterized today's proceedings by  saying:         . . . we're going to pound our chest like Tarzan and say       we're for a balanced budget, it's not going to fool anybody.    And a staffer for the conservative Club for Growth summarized the  whole effort as, ``Leadership is just trying to check a box here.''   If today's legislation was only about hiding the real Republican  record on rising debt, it would be bad enough. But this measure also  paves the way for devastating cuts in critical programs, including  Social Security and Medicare.   The Republican balanced budget amendment would prevent Social  Security from drawing down savings the program is now accruing in its  trust fund to pay promised benefits in the future. This would force  cuts in Social Security benefits because all federal expenditures would  have to be covered by tax revenues collected during that same year. A  similar problem would exist for paying future Medicare benefits out of  that program's trust fund.   Additionally, by requiring a balanced budget every year, regardless  of the state of our economy, this legislation would force benefit cuts  and tax increases at the worst possible time--potentially turning mild  recessions into great depressions. Not only would that be devastating  for hard-working families, it also would drive future deficits even  higher.   Mr. Speaker, today our Republican colleagues are hoping their  concerned words will hide their harmful actions on increasing our  nation's debt. But in doing so, they are only creating more potential  harm. We should reject this deceptive and dangerous charade.
