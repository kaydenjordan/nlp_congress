 Madam President, the country lost one of its elder  statesmen this week with the death of former Senator Richard Lugar.   As Members of Congress, one of the most important parts of our job is  keeping our Nation secure. We only hope that when we leave Congress, we  will have left our Nation a little safer than when we found it.   Richard Lugar never had to wonder if he had done that. As the Soviet  Union was collapsing, Dick stepped forward and shepherded the passage  of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which supported  the dismantling and decommissioning of nuclear weapons in former Soviet  countries before the weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists or  rogue nations.   As a direct result of his efforts, over the years, thousands of  weapons have been destroyed--from warheads to missiles to chemical  weapons. Thanks to his work, our Nation and our world are more secure.   Dick's achievements on global security are the kind of legacy most of  us can only hope to have, but, of course, that is not all that Dick  Lugar did in his Senate career.   As Indiana's longest serving Senator, he also served as a leader on  agricultural issues and on food security. Even after he had left the  Senate, he continued to advocate for the issues that he cared about as  president of the Lugar Center, which, among other things, focuses on  global food security and preventing the proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction.   Dick will be sorely missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his  family, particularly his wife, Char, and their four sons, Mark, Bob,  John, and David.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Florida (Mr. Rubio).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio)  would have voted ``nay.''
