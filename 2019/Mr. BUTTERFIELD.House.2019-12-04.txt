 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend of more  than 40 years, Mayor C. Bruce Rose.   Tomorrow, the city of Wilson, North Carolina, will pause to observe  Bruce Rose Day and will rename the Headquarters Fire Station to the C.  Bruce Rose Headquarters Station, recognizing 60 long years of  continuous service to our city.   Mr. Speaker, Mayor Rose graduated from Charles L. Coon High School  and received an associate degree in applied science in fire science  technology from Wilson Technical Community College. He also proudly  served our country in the United States Army for 2 years.   Mayor Rose served for 30 years with the Wilson Fire Department, 7 of  which he served as fire chief. He attended fire schools throughout  North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and Maryland, including the  National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland. He is a graduate of the  Executive Development Course of Chief Fire Officers in Emmitsburg.   Mayor Rose is a life member of the North Carolina Association of Fire  Chiefs and served on its board of directors for 4 years. He is also a  life member of the North Carolina Association of Retired Fire Chiefs  and served, by appointment of Governor James B. Hunt, on the North  Carolina Fire Commission. Mayor Rose received the 1999 Governor's Award  for Outstanding Volunteer Service.   Mayor Rose continued to serve as a goodwill ambassador for the city  of Wilson as he was elected mayor, beginning in 1992. He has been proud  to celebrate the progress of the city through events such as ribbon  cuttings and groundbreakings and presentations of proclamations. He  speaks at community events, works to bring industries into the city,  and has worked diligently to see the city community thrive.   He is especially proud of the Whirlygig project, which is bringing  economic development to our city.   Under his leadership, an $18 million surface transportation project  is now in progress in the eastern section of our city, which is the  African American community. The city invested $2 million into this  project; the North Carolina Department of Transportation invested $6  million; and, with my assistance, the city received a TIGER grant,  under Secretary Anthony Fox, of $10 million for the project.    During his tenure, Mayor Rose has been involved in several projects  and  [[Page H9226]]  initiatives, such as creation of the Buckhorn Reservoir and Greenlight  Community Broadband, which is a municipal broadband, and it is  successful.   He has been Wilson's longest serving mayor, after serving 27, nearly  28, consecutive years and eight consecutive terms.   Mayor Rose is a lifetime member of Wilson First Pentecostal Holiness  Church, where he served as deacon and Sunday school superintendent.   He is married to Rebecca Davis Rose. They continue to be active in  our community and involved in church functions throughout the city.  Mayor Rose, Mr. Speaker, is father to four children and one delightful  grandchild.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating  and honoring my friend, Mayor C. Bruce Rose, as he is recognized for  60--I will repeat that again, 60--consecutive years of unselfish  service to the city of Wilson, North Carolina. The contributions of  Mayor Rose to the city cannot be overstated.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for his  leadership in preventing the continued spread of illegal robocalls.   Mr. Speaker, these unlawful operations are deceiving and defrauding  unsuspecting citizens, with little recourse. Congress must do its part  to bring these perpetrators to justice, and the bill before us today  does just that.   I am pleased that my bill, H.R. 3434, is included in the bill we have  today. I thank Chairman Pallone for fighting to keep the language in my  bill in the underlying legislation during negotiations.   My bill recognizes industry efforts to address illegal calls by  directing the FCC to publish an annual report on best practices in  tracing back illegal calls to their origins. It promotes provider  accountability by allowing carriers to block calls from providers who  do not fully participate in private-led efforts to trace suspected  illegal callers.   Every day, Mr. Speaker, consumers fall victim to scams initiated by  fraudulent calls. I believe that the TRACED Act is a practical and  comprehensive solution that will aid us in ending these illegal calls  for good.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.    Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy  of a dear family friend, Deacon James Andrew Wynn, Sr. Born on August  6, 1922, James Wynn lived a long, loving, and productive life. This  past Saturday, he transitioned from labor to reward.   Deacon Wynn, a lifelong resident of Gold Point, North Carolina, loved  his family, loved his community, and loved his God. In 1943, he met the  love of his life, Naomi Lynch, commencing a marriage that lasted for 59  long years.   James was a skilled farmer and carpenter and was well-known  throughout the community.   James and Naomi were parents to eight wonderful children. They took  great pride in their children's education and accomplishments, and they  have accomplished much.   The children are: Angela; Joan; Judge James Wynn, who is a long- serving judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals; Reginald Wynn;  Dr. Anita Wynn; and Dr. Arnie Wynn. From that lineage are 17  grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.   May Deacon James Andrew Wynn, Sr. rest in peace.                            ____________________
