 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Washington  for yielding me the time.   We hear a lot of talk coming from the other side about this Texas  law, but I want to talk about the legislation that we have in front of  us today and what effects that will have.   Madam Speaker, it should be called the abortion on demand bill  because it does nothing to protect women's health; rather, it  supersedes States' rights and makes any protection for women and unborn  children illegal.   This bill will override countless protective State laws like parental  notice, clinic regulations, and informed consent before an abortion.   The abortion on demand act would not only strip States of their  rights to protect women and babies, but it would also strip away a  parent's right to be involved and informed on their child's health and  well-being.   What about protecting minors? Would States be allowed to ensure  parental involvement or even notification? The answer is, of course, no  under this legislation. In fact, it is just the contrary. The bill  strips all of these protections provided by State laws.    One of my highest priorities as a Member of Congress is protecting  the right to life for all innocent life from conception until natural  death. This bill is a shameful attempt to override States' rights and  codify widespread abortion on demand in this country.
