 Mr. Speaker, the American people can count.  Forty-four Senate Democrats voted to shut down the government. Ten  times as many Democrats as Republicans supported denying funds to our  military, to children's healthcare, and to everyday Americans.   The Senate Democrats must be held accountable. Their actions halted  government services. They can't blame anyone else.   The numbers don't lie, and the American people can count. Forty-four  Senate Democrats voted to shut down the government. Let's hope they  change their minds and vote to get back to work. We have much to do to  make America great.                            ____________________
