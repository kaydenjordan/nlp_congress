 Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and for  standing with me and with all of us.     Tom Reed is my co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus. He is a  Republican, and I am a Democrat. When it comes to policy views, we  often disagree. But at the end of the day, we are united as Americans.  My good friend, like me, always puts country first.   Today, a group of lawless thugs sought to upend the Constitution and  the peaceful transition of power because they didn't like the outcome  of the Presidential election. So, they tried to nullify it using  improvised explosives, shattering windows, breaking down doors,  injuring law enforcement, and even tearing down the American flag that  rises above this beacon of democracy.   But their attempt to obstruct democracy failed. Their insurrection  was foiled. The American people and the greatest democracy the world  has ever known won.   Abraham Lincoln, who served in this very body, famously said: ``A  house divided against itself cannot stand.'' That is why, for the sake  of this country, we must stand together, united, and celebrate a  peaceful transition of power.   In 14 days, President-elect Biden will be sworn in. And despite all  of our differences, I have faith that, for the American people, we will  come together, Democrats and Republicans, committed to unity, civility,  and truth. We will recognize our higher purpose to help America through  these dark days.   That is the only way we will beat COVID, rebuild our economy, and  stand up to threats at home and abroad.   Working together as Democrats and Republicans, I know our best days  will always be ahead of us.
