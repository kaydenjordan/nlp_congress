 Mr. Speaker, when the Biden administration learned Iran  was just weeks away from enriching enough uranium for a weapon, this  administration's response was to rush to a deal to  [[Page H4018]]  slow but not stop Iran's nuclear ambitions. This is so.   Mr. Speaker, the fact is, no deal will include concrete guarantees  that Iran will not develop nuclear weapons. Yet, in pursuit of a deal,  the Biden administration is offering concessions that will enrich our  adversaries, endanger our allies, and cost America dearly.   The whole new deal now hinges on delisting the Islamic Revolutionary  Guard--yes, that terrorist organization--even as the IRGC supported  attacks against U.S. troops recently in the UAE.   Mr. Speaker, sanctions relief will give Iran access to over $100  billion in frozen assets. That is over $100 billion in frozen assets to  the center of terrorism in the world. Nuclear trade, in addition, with  Russia and China will only strengthen this unholy alliance.   What can our allies expect from an Iran enriched from energy sales  and free from sanctions? Even worse, President Biden is seeking to buy  oil from Iran instead of ramping up U.S. production. This disastrous  decision, irrational decision, will fill their coffers even more.   We have wrecked our U.S. national and economic security, Mr. Speaker,  by forfeiting our energy over the last 15 months and our independence.  We are now subject to the fluctuations from the randomness of the  geopolitical events rather than relying upon American workers and  American energy.   We have cost our Nation thousands of jobs and empowered our enemies.  We are seeing this firsthand with the leverage we have ceded to Russia  because this administration seeks to decimate U.S. energy production.   The Department of Energy is taking trips and seeking oil purchases  from Venezuela. Mr. Speaker, I have not seen Department of Energy  representatives in Pennsylvania to see how the great reserves in the  Marcellus Shale can support our country's energy needs.   Is the Biden administration choosing Venezuela over Pennsylvania? Are  they choosing Tehran over Texas? And as my good friend, Representative  August Pfluger, branded not too long ago: Are they choosing Moscow over  Midland?   This is the product of disastrous domestic policies weakening our  hand in diplomacy and the Biden administration rushing to negotiate  from a position of weakness. It is why our allies are urging us to walk  away and keep sanctions in place on Iran.   This deal was misguided 7 years ago. It is downright dangerous today.  We need Democrats and Republicans in this House to stand up for America  and against this erroneous, misguided, senseless Iran nuke deal.                            ____________________
