 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I also thank Mr. Griffith for introducing the Promoting Closed-Loop  Pumped Storage Hydropower Act. He did valuable work to make this the  bipartisan version we see today.   More electricity from hydropower is key to meeting our clean energy  goals, to reducing harmful emissions that pollute our air and water and  contribute to climate change.   Hydropower is one of the few carbon-free energy sources that provides  a steady baseload of electricity. This bill will give closed-loop  hydropower projects an expedited process for approval from FERC. It  will consider interagency input through a new task force and provide  appropriate protection for wildlife and endangered species while  helping us grow emissions-free energy.   These closed-loop projects often integrate other forms of renewable  energy, like solar, to develop a power generation cycle that is clean,  secure, and reliable.   In San Diego, where large rivers and typical hydropower generation  are less common, closed-loop pumped storage hydropower offers an  innovative solution and can have other benefits to the region's energy  and reservoir systems.   In my district, the Lake Hodges Pumped Storage Project has provided  clean energy since 2012, and a new project at the San Vicente Reservoir  is being considered now.   We must consider to have productive bipartisan conversations like  these that produce the ultimate goal of streamlining the regulatory  process so that hydropower projects can be approved more quickly while  still meeting high environmental standards.
