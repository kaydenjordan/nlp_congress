Desert Locust Control Act                                 H.R. 1079         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Desert Locust Control Act''.       SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to prioritize efforts       to control the ongoing desert locust outbreak in East Africa       and other affected regions, mitigate the impacts on food       security, economic productivity, and political stability,       improve interagency coordination to prevent future outbreaks,       and promote resilience in affected countries.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States Agency for International Development       reports that countries in East Africa are currently suffering       the worst desert locust outbreak in decades, which will       devour crops and pasture and destroy local livelihoods across       the region.        (2) As of December 2020, the Food and Agriculture       Organization reported that there were 42 million people       experiencing acute food insecurity in East Africa, which       numbers are projected to increase if the desert locust       outbreak is not controlled.        (3) The desert locust outbreak in East Africa, particularly       in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia, is negatively impacting food       security, local livelihoods and economic productivity, and       may threaten political stability in the region.        (4) Proactive investments now to control the desert locust       outbreak could reduce the need for a much larger United       States humanitarian response effort later, as well as support       economic and political stability and build resilience in       affected countries.        (5) In order to optimize the United States response to the       desert locust outbreak, an interagency working group should       be established to develop and implement a comprehensive,       strategic plan to control the desert locust outbreak in East       Africa and other affected regions, mitigate impacts on food       security, economic productivity, and political stability and       prevent future outbreaks.       SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP.         (a) Establishment.--The President shall establish an       interagency working group to coordinate the United States       response to the  [[Page H3717]]       ongoing desert locust outbreak in East Africa and other       affected regions, including the development of a       comprehensive, strategic plan to control the outbreak,       mitigate the impacts on food security, economic productivity,       and political stability, and prevent future outbreaks.        (b) Membership.--        (1) In general.--The interagency working group shall be       composed of the following:        (A) Two representatives from the United States Agency for       International Development.

(d) Interagency Working Group Support.--The interagency       working group shall continue to meet not less than semi-      annually to facilitate implementation of the comprehensive,       strategic plan required by subsection (c)(5).

Securing America From Epidemics Act                                 H.R. 2118         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing America From       Epidemics Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Due to increasing population and population density,       human mobility, and ecological change, emerging infectious       diseases pose a real and growing threat to global health       security.        (2) While vaccines can be the most effective tools to       protect against infectious disease, the absence of vaccines       for a new or emerging infectious disease with epidemic       potential is a major health security threat globally, posing       catastrophic potential human and economic costs.        (3) The COVID-19 pandemic has infected more than       119,960,700 individuals and has killed at least 2,656,822       people worldwide, and it is likely that unreported cases and       deaths are significant.        (4) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous human costs       and substantially disrupt the global economy and cripple       regional economies. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa       killed more than 11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses in       the affected countries alone.        (5) While the need for vaccines to address emerging       epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive the necessary       development of vaccines to address them--a complex and       expensive undertaking--are very often critically absent. Also       absent are mechanisms to ensure access to those vaccines by       those who need them when they need them.        (6) To address this global vulnerability and the deficit of       political commitment, institutional capacity, and funding, in       2017, several countries and private partners launched the       Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).       CEPI's mission is to stimulate, finance, and coordinate       development of vaccines for high-priority, epidemic-potential       threats in cases where traditional markets do not exist or       cannot create sufficient demand.        (7) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI seeks to bring       priority vaccines candidates through the end of phase II       clinical trials, as well as support vaccine platforms that       can be rapidly deployed against emerging pathogens.        (8) CEPI supported the manufacturing of the United States-      developed Moderna COVID-19 vaccine during its Phase 1       clinical trial, and CEPI has initiated at least 12       partnerships to develop vaccines against COVID-19.        (9) CEPI is co-leading COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the       ACT-Accelerator, which is a global collaboration to quickly       produce and equitably distribute safe and effective vaccines       and therapeutics for COVID-19.        (10) Support for and participation in CEPI is an important       part of the United States own health security and biodefense       and is in the national interest, complementing the work of       many Federal agencies and providing significant value through       global partnership and burden-sharing.

Res. 277         Whereas the principle that an informed and engaged       electorate is critical to a vibrant democracy is deeply       rooted in our laws of free speech and underpins the virtues       on which we established our Constitution, ``in Order to form       a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic       Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the       general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to       ourselves and our Posterity . . .'';        Whereas having independent, diverse, and local media that       provide exposure to a broad range of viewpoints and the       ability to contribute to the political debate is central to       sustaining that informed engagement;        Whereas it is in the public interest to encourage source,       content, and audience diversity on our Nation's shared       telecommunications and media platforms;        Whereas the survival of small, independent, and diverse       media outlets that serve diverse audiences and local media       markets is essential to preserving local culture and building       understanding on important community issues that impact the       daily lives of residents;        Whereas research by the American Society of News Editors,       the Radio Television Digital News Association, the Pew       Research Center, and others has documented the continued       challenges of increasing diversity among all types of media       entities;        Whereas with increasing media experience and       sophistication, it is even more important to have minority       participation in local media to ensure a diverse range of       information sources are available and different ideas and       viewpoints are expressed to strengthen social cohesion among       different communities; and        Whereas the constriction in small, independent, and diverse       media outlets and limited participation of diverse       populations in media ownership and decision making are       combining to negatively impact our goal of increasing local       civic engagement and civic knowledge through increased voter       participation, membership in civic groups, and knowledge of       local political and civil information: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms its commitment to diversity as a core tenet       of the public interest standard in media policy; and        (2) pledges to work with media entities and diverse       stakeholders to develop common ground solutions to eliminate       barriers to media diversity.           Encouraging Reunions of Divided Korean-American Families                                H. Res. 294         Whereas the Korean Peninsula, with the Republic of Korea       (in this resolution referred to as ``South Korea'') in the       South and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (in this       resolution referred to as ``North Korea'') in the North,       remains divided following the signing of the Korean War       Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953;        Whereas the division of the Korean Peninsula separated more       than 10,000,000 Korean family members, including some who are       now citizens of the United States;        Whereas there have been 21 rounds of family reunions       between South Koreans and North Koreans along the border       since 2000;        Whereas Congress signaled its support for family reunions       between United States citizens and their relatives in North       Korea in section 1265 of the National Defense Authorization       Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181), signed into       law by President George W. Bush on January 28, 2008;        Whereas most of the population of divided family members in       the United States, initially estimated at 100,000 in 2001,       has significantly dwindled as many of the individuals have       passed away;        Whereas the summit between North Korea and South Korea on       April 27, 2018, has prioritized family reunions;        Whereas the United States and North Korea have engaged in       talks during 2 historic summits in June 2018 in Singapore and       February 2019 in Hanoi; and        Whereas many Korean Americans are waiting for a chance to       meet their relatives in North Korea for the first time in       more than 60 years: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the United States and North Korea to begin the       process of reuniting Korean-American divided family members       with their immediate relatives through ways such as--        (A) identifying divided families in the United States and       North Korea who are willing and able to participate in a       pilot program for family reunions;        (B) finding matches for members of such families through       organizations such as the Red Cross; and        (C) working with the Government of South Korea to include       American citizens in inter-Korean video reunions;        (2) reaffirms the institution of family as inalienable and,       accordingly, urges the restoration of contact between divided       families physically, literarily, or virtually; and        (3) calls on the United States and North Korea to pursue       reunions as a humanitarian priority of immediate concern.
