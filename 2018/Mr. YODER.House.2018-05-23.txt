 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to the  National Defense Authorization Act, which would add the full text of my  bill, H.R. 387, the Email Privacy Act.   I want to remind my colleagues that this bill has been passed twice  by the House, once on April 27, 2016, by a roll call of 419-0, and  again by voice vote, unanimously, in the House on February 6, 2017.   My legislation has a simple concept behind it: if the government  wants access to content stored in our private email accounts, they  should get a warrant.   Currently, agencies can receive the stored email content of a user's  cloud email account by sending an administrative subpoena directly to  the service provider. This creates a double standard, where paper  communication has greater Fourth Amendment protections than electronic  copies.   This standard is outdated, as the law governing this issue has not  been updated since 1986. Now our whole lives are in the cloud and  stored online.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for  accepting my amendment and Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary  Committee, and I urge all those in this process, House and Senate, to  maintain the House-passed language in the final version of the NDAA  that we send to the President's desk.                            ____________________
