 Madam Speaker, I rise today at a moment when,  tragically, women's rights in the United States have been greatly  diminished since last year's Women's History Month was commemorated.   While we will continue our month-long celebration in observance of  women's history, it is just as important for us to focus on the future  that women will face as it is for us to reflect on the achievements of  the past.   Access to abortion is no longer a constitutional right. Full stop.   Access to lifesaving abortion medication, even in States where  abortion is legally protected is under threat.   Teenage girls and young women are facing unprecedented rates of  trauma, violence, suicide, and maternal mortality.   We still have not achieved equal work for equal pay. Yet, we continue  our celebration this month all the same. That is in part what makes  this month so special.   From Harriet Tubman liberating the enslaved to Vice President Harris  inspiring women and girls across the Nation that they too can dream  with ambition, lead with conviction, and see themselves in a way that  others may not, we are making progress and our work is not yet  finished.    In closing, Happy Women's History Month.                            ____________________
