 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  the nation of Israel for holding its national elections yesterday.   As the sole democracy in the Middle East, it not only sets an example  to its neighbors, but it is a key ally in spreading peace, democracy,  and prosperity throughout the world.   I also want to recognize the thousands of people who traveled to  Washington recently for this year's AIPAC conference.   It has been an honor to work with so many of my colleagues on  legislation that will not only help secure Israel militarily but also  allow it to thrive economically. Countries in the region should take  note of what is possible when they work in good faith and, most  importantly, seek peace.   As NATO's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in this Chamber  last week, it is good to have friends. I am honored to count Israel as  one of our closest and greatest friends.   I look forward to working with a united Congress to support the  Jewish state and to spread democracy wherever tyranny exists.                            ____________________
