 Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the floor today and  bring attention to an extraordinary young man from Mansfield, Texas,  named Orion Jean.   In 2020, Orion was selected as the National Kindness Speech Contest  Winner. With the cash prize that Orion received from the speech  contest, he created his own initiative focused on community and  kindness, called Race to Kindness.   His first project was Race to 500 Toys. Orion collected and  personally donated over 600 books to the Children's Medical Center of  Dallas, but Orion did not stop there. He continued on with his next  Race to Kindness project, Race to 100,000 Meals. With the support of  local communities and nonprofit organizations, Orion fed over 100,000  people during Thanksgiving 2020.   Orion's efforts not only reached the people of District 6, but with  his most recent endeavor, Race to 500,000 Books, he has collected  500,000 books and is distributing them to Mansfield Independent School  District, Fort Worth Independent School District, and Dallas  Independent School District, along with several literacy organizations.   Just when you think this young man could not get any more impressive,  he is also a published author with his debut book, ``A Kids Book About  Leadership,'' which encourages children to discover the power of  leadership that resides within themselves.   He has appeared on Good Morning America and The Ellen Show, where he  received a $10,000 donation for Race to Kindness. And right now, Orion  is a Top 5 finalist for Time's Kid of the Year 2021.   Orion's goal is to pull kindness to the forefront and show the true  power of community and how those two qualities can change people's  lives. We should all strive to be more like Orion Jean.                            ____________________
