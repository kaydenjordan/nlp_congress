 Mr. Speaker, it was reported last week  that the BMW plant in South Carolina remained the top vehicle exporter  in America, with more than $8.4 billion worth of cars shipped to  foreign countries.   Nearly a quarter of a million cars were exported, with the vast  majority sent from the Port of Charleston, led by State Ports Authority  President Jim Newsome.   Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, the late Governor Carroll Campbell  recruited BMW to South Carolina with export production of 1,400 cars a  day. Production in 2018 was 356,749 vehicles.   Governor Henry McMaster and Commerce Secretary Bobby Hitt continue to  promote an additional $600 million investment in Plant Spartanburg,  which already at $10 billion is the largest BMW plant in the world,  providing 11,000 jobs.   Thousands of additional jobs in the region have been created by  suppliers to the assembly facility.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never  forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
