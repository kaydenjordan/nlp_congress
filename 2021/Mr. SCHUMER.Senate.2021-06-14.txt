 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, tonight, congressional leaders will  mark what is hopefully the final somber milestone of the COVID  pandemic: 600,000 American lives lost to the disease. It is  particularly jarring at this moment--a moment of recovery, optimism,  and hope--to remember the enormity of lives lost over the past 15  months. Not only that, we face the grim reality that the recent  fatalities happened while Americans were on the verge of getting  vaccinated. Some had their appointment just days away.   So as our fellow Americans are taking their masks off, going back to  work, seeing families and friends, and returning, as they should, to  life, let us remember those who cannot. Let us hold them in our hearts  a little while longer.  [[Page S4504]]    I am reminded of the famous meditation by the English soldier and  poet John Donne, who told us that ``no man is an island, entire of  itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. So  if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less.''   ``Any man's death diminishes me,'' he said, ``because I am involved  in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;  it tolls for thee.''   The bells have tolled for 600,000 Americans this past year, a  staggering and incomprehensible sum. Remember them. Hold them in your  hearts a little while longer.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on a different subject, after  passing the bipartisan U.S. Innovation and Competition Act last week  and confirming the first judges of the Biden era, we will continue with  major elements of our legislative agenda.   Senate committees will continue working on a bipartisan  infrastructure proposal to meet the demands of the 21st century. As I  have said from the start, discussions about infrastructure investments  are progressing on two tracks. One track is bipartisan. The second  track pulls in other elements of President Biden's American Jobs Plan,  which will be considered even if it does not have bipartisan support.  Our Senate committees are working on both tracks at the same time.   As a reminder to the Senate--a reminder to the Senate--as I have said  from the start, in order to move forward on infrastructure, we must  include bold action on climate. At the moment, both tracks are moving  forward and progressing very well.   In addition, before the end of the month, the Senate will vote on  crucial voting rights legislation. Republican State legislatures across  the country are passing the most draconian voting restrictions since  the beginning of Jim Crow. Congress must take action to defend our  democracy.   Meanwhile, we will move more swiftly to confirm even more of the  President's appointments, including several to the Federal bench.   Last week was one for the record books. The Senate confirmed the  first slate of President Biden's judicial nominees. Not only were they  individuals of immense talent and high character, they reflected the  great cultural, geographic, and experiential diversity of our country.  Among them was the first Muslim American to ever be confirmed as an  article III judge.   Let me read a headline from this morning's Washington Post: ``Biden  has nominated as many minority women to be judges in four months as  Trump had confirmed in four years.'' That is an amazing--an amazing-- statistic.   Women, especially women of color, have long been underrepresented on  the Federal bench. Along with President Biden, the Senate Democratic  majority is working quickly to close the gap.   In fact, in just a few hours, we will confirm another outstanding,  trailblazing nominee for the Federal bench, Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson, to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Jackson will be the  first of President Biden's circuit court nominees confirmed by the  Senate, and we are starting right at the top.   After the Supreme Court, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals is the most  important Federal court in the country, with jurisdiction over cases  involving Congress and the executive branch Agencies, and Judge  Jackson, nominated to the seat once occupied by the current Attorney  General, is the perfect person for the job. She is a former Federal  defender. She clerked for Justice Breyer, and, since 2013, has been a  district court judge in DC. She has all the qualities of a model  jurist. She is brilliant, thoughtful, collaborative, and dedicated to  applying the law impartially. For these qualities, she has earned the  respect of both sides.   Nominees to powerful circuit courts, especially the DC Circuit, are  frequently controversial, but, last week, a bipartisan group of  Senators in the Judiciary Committee voted in her favor. I greatly look  forward to confirming this exceptional nominee in just a few hours and  continuing to restore balance to a judiciary that has been thrown out  of whack by former President Trump.   After Judge Brown Jackson's confirmation, we will turn to other  nominees. We will hold a cloture vote this evening on Lina Khan's  nomination to the Federal Trade Commission and confirm her tomorrow.  Tomorrow, as well, we will vote on Kiran Ahuja to lead the Office of  Personnel Management, and the Senate will have the opportunity to  advance several of the nominees as the week goes on                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, despite the fact  that we are now almost 6 months into a new administration, the sins of  the previous administration are coming to life. Late last week, the New  York Times reported that the Trump administration's Justice Department  delivered secret subpoenas for the personal phone data of at least a  dozen people tied to the House Intelligence Committee, including  Members of Congress, aides, and even family members. One was a minor.   This is a gross abuse of power. It is an assault on the separation of  powers. The notion that any President, via their political appointees,  could manipulate our democratic system to tap into personal data has  the fingerprints of a dictatorship--a dictatorship--all over it.   This appalling politicization of the Department of Justice by Donald  Trump and his sycophants must be investigated by both the DOJ inspector  general and by Congress. Former Attorneys General Barr and Sessions and  other officials who were involved must testify before the Senate  Judiciary Committee, under oath. If they refuse, they are subject to  being subpoenaed and compelled to testify under oath.   The Justice Department must also provide information to the Judiciary  Committee, which will vigorously investigate this abuse of power. The  issue should not be partisan. Under the Constitution, Congress is a  coequal branch of government and must be protected from an overreaching  executive. We expect our Republican colleagues to join us in getting to  the bottom of this very, very serious matter.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 148.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.  [[Page S4505]]     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 173.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  the mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, June  14, be waived.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Yes, there is, Madam President.    Thank you, Madam President. First, let me thank Senator  Rosen. She has been a valiant, strong and unrelenting fighter against  anti-Semitism--not just today with this wonderful resolution, but every  day, and we thank her for her leadership, her tremendous and needed  leadership on this issue.  [[Page S4514]]    I want to thank Senator Lankford as well in joining Senator Rosen in  crafting this bipartisan resolution because, as we all know, anti- Semitism is not a partisan issue. So I very much appreciate the way  that they have worked together across the aisle to bring this  resolution forward   It is essential that we come together at this moment. Over the past  few years, America has once again seen the pernicious, poisonous, and  dangerous rise of hate crimes. In recent weeks in particular, anti- Semitism--the oldest hatred--has dramatically spiked. It, too, just  like every other hate crime, is pernicious, poisonous, and dangerous.  We are all horrified by the anti-Semitic attacks in New York, around  the country, and around the globe.   So I join my colleagues tonight to say unequivocally that this hatred  must be called out, confronted, and stopped. And the Senator from  Nevada has an excellent series of proposals to help make that happen.   Anti-Semitism must be combated wherever and whenever it rears its  ugly head. It is vile, it is reprehensible, and it is counter to  everything America stands for: freedom of religion, equality, and  respect for the dignity of every person.   For too long--too long--we have seen it. And yet in the past, America  has always been a refuge for the oppressed; a land of promise,  opportunity, and tolerance for people from all corners of the world who  came here in search of a better life. It was true for my family and for  many others, and hopefully, it will continue to be.   But that noble purpose has too often been marred by periods of  isolationism, xenophobia, and racial intolerance. We live in a time  where we must actively work to rekindle the light of tolerance that has  kept anti-Semitism at bay here in the United States and around the  globe.   As majority leader, the first Jewish-American to hold that honor, I  will work with any and all of my colleagues to face down anti-Semitism  and every other form of racial or religious discrimination.   I strongly urge the Senate to stand united against anti-Semitism, and  I am very grateful to pass this resolution unanimously.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 147.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination without intervening action or debate, and if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all  without intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in  order to the nomination, that any statements related to the nomination  be printed in the Record, and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  June 15; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; further, that upon conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Khan nomination; that all postcloture time expire  at 11:30 a.m.; and further, that the Senate recess following the  cloture vote on the Ahuja nomination until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the  weekly caucus meetings; that if cloture is invoked on the Ahuja  nomination, that all postcloture time expire at 2:30 p.m.; finally,  that if any of the nominations are confirmed, that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:28 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, June 15, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
