 Madam Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration  that I rise to celebrate Women's History Month and recognize Sandra  Noe, Executive Director of Meals on Wheels in northwest Indiana.   Sandra has worked with Meals on Wheels for 36 years to combat senior  isolation and hunger.   As the demand for services increased over the past year during the  COVID-19 pandemic, Meals on Wheels rose to the challenge and delivered  over 1,700 meals daily, provided over 750,000 wellness checks, and  celebrated its nine-millionth delivery.   Madam Speaker, as we recognize Women's History Month, please join me  in thanking Sandra and everyone at Meals on Wheels for the  extraordinary services they provide to northwest Indiana.   Let us recommit to continuing to support their invaluable work and  recognize this month and every day the invaluable ways that women  continue to provide healing and promote hope, not just in caregiving,  but in all aspects of our society.                            ____________________
