 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 4779 and that  [[Page S5852]]  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time.   The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.    Mr. President, this bill, H.R. 4779, ``To extend the  Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers beyond  Borders Act of 2006,'' would reauthorize the U.S. SAFE WEB Act, which  is an important tool for the Federal Trade Commission to investigate  and take action against the scams, robocalls, and fraud that may span  international borders. It would save consumers the hardship and  heartbreak, financial pain, and emotional travail of fraud, scams, and  robocalls that may have international implications and impacts.   The SAFE WEB Act has been reauthorized on a bipartisan basis over  many years. I am pleased to cooperate and collaborate with Senator  Moran of Kansas, who is a great partner in consumer protection and this  effort and is the chairman of the subcommittee on which I am the  ranking member.   We all know that fraud spawned by foreign criminal organizations, as  well as domestic ones, has caused significant harm to consumers here.  Therefore, this measure will provide the tools that are essential to  the FTC in protecting consumers and in enforcing the law.   I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
