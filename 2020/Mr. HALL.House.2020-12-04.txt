 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the MORE Act, and I urge  our colleagues in the Senate to do the same.   There is a serious need for justice reform in our country, a focus on  restorative financial justice. Investment in research, along with  descheduling, is something that we must lead on.   COVID innovation zones in our country might be a strategy for  bringing bipartisan solutions that create jobs but also dealing with  this terrible pandemic.                            ____________________
