 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Michigan  International Speedway as they celebrate their 50th anniversary in  2018.   Located in my district in the heart of the beautiful Irish Hills,  Michigan  [[Page H4725]]  International Speedway is one of the Nation's premier racing  facilities. Throughout the season, MIS will be commemorating this  milestone by showcasing many of the memorable moments and drivers in  the track's history.   I look forward to joining everyone to kick off their first NASCAR  race of the year, which is just weeks away. In addition to NASCAR, MIS  offers year-round entertainment and festivals, making it a leading  tourist attraction for people near and far.   Through their extensive charity work and programs like the Spirit of  America Blood Drive, MIS is actively involved in improving the  community and impacting lives.   Mr. Speaker, Michigan International Speedway is a staple of our  community and the world of racing. We are fortunate to have them in the  Seventh District.   Here is to 50 more years of lasting memories for fans and drivers  alike.                            ____________________
