 Madam Speaker, our debt, our deficit,  and our spending are indefensible. Three years ago, our national debt  was $23 trillion, a staggering sum by any measure. Since then, it has  grown by 50 percent to $33 trillion.   We have heard allegations tonight from one side of the Chamber that  everybody deserves blame for that crisis, so let me be very clear.  During that time, I voted against $13 trillion in spending.  Nevertheless, we find ourselves at a tipping point.   In the last 10 years, we have spent $3 trillion just on interest on  the debt. In the next 10 years, we won't spend $3 trillion on interest,  we will spend $10 trillion. For that money, our country gets nothing.  No sailor, no soldier, no safety net. We get nothing.   Making matters worse, in 7 years, Medicare is insolvent and in 10  years, Social Security is insolvent.   We must get our fiscal house in order.   Now, the appropriations bills before us move us in that direction.  They do so through real, robust, and significant cuts, billions of  dollars in cuts.   Are the bills perfect? No.   Do I support every single cut in every single bill? No.  [[Page H4492]]    Can we balance the budget through nondefense discretionary cuts  alone? No.   To be honest, these bills will not solve all that ails us, but they  are a critically important step toward stopping this runaway train.  Business as usual, Madam Speaker, is unacceptable. A ``yes'' vote  acknowledges that and moves us in the right direction.
