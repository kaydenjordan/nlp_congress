 Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Mr.  Bill Cotter for his service and contributions to the State of  Mississippi in his 23 years of service with the Hancock County Port and  Harbor Commission.   Bill is retiring as CEO, but his record of leadership with the  commission extends well beyond his latest role. In addition to CEO,  Bill has served as the director of Stennis International Airport, as  well as the chief operations officer for the facility as a whole, which  includes the airport, its surrounding commercial property, and the Port  Bienville Industrial Park, located on the Pearl River in southwest  Mississippi.   While advancing into greater positions of responsibility, Bill's  guidance helped the Hancock Port and Harbor Commission meet challenges  head-on and achieve enormous success. As airport director, Bill led  Stennis Airport's recovery from Hurricane Katrina, and he coordinated  the tasks necessary for transitioning the airfield into a disaster  response staging area during the BP Deepwater Horizon crisis.   Bill's contributions to the agency are also felt through his project  management undertakings. Since 2005, Bill has overseen nearly $40  million in capital improvements at Stennis International Airport, which  have proved invaluable in enabling the facility to serve as a resource  in meeting the aviation needs of both the military, businesses, and  industry.   The Port and Harbor Commission's maritime business has also thrived  under Bill's leadership. During his tenure as chief operating officer,  existing docks at Port Bienville were refurbished and improved, and  construction is underway on a new 600-foot dock.  [[Page S7027]]    The Hancock Port and Harbor Commission has consistently fulfilled its  economic development mission, and Bill is a big reason why. Through his  efforts, numerous companies have located on commission properties,  including the U.S. Department of Defense contractor Tyonek Service  Group, which performs a wide range of aircraft service operations and  has been a vital catalyst in the success of the Stennis International  Airport in attracting and serving military customers.   In conclusion, the value provided by Hancock Port and Harbor  Commission has been made more appealing through Bill's leadership and  hard work. The resulting economic growth and development is felt on  multiple layers throughout Hancock County and has brought about a  quality of life revered by residents and visitors alike.   With his retirement from the Hancock County Port and Harbor  Commission, I thank Bill Cotter for his long and dedicated service to  Hancock County, my State, and our Nation. I wish him a retirement  filled with opportunities for him and his wife to spend time with their  children and grandchildren.                            ____________________
