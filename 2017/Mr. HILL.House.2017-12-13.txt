 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Williams, for  introducing H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to  Finance Act. This act is needed.   Tonight, we are not here to rehash the failings of the JCPOA, but we  are really here to honor Secretary Kerry's commitment of oversight of  Iran outside that agreement. He made it quite clear to Congress in his  briefings that we would monitor the world's largest exporter of terror  around the world; that we would do everything outside the agreement to  enforce sanctions; that we would not stop reviewing their behavior.   This piece of legislation comes at an important time, as the Trump  administration is taking significant steps to protect our homeland by  reviewing actions around rogue regimes and sponsors of terror around  the world, including Iran.   Now, my friend from Washington brought up the subject of the American  worker, and, of course, we all are blessed by the brilliance and  success of Boeing. We couldn't come to our jobs without them.   But there are 5,000 airlines in the world, Mr. Speaker. There are  10,000 Boeing aircraft in service, and there are 5,700 airplanes on  order from the Boeing corporation to help make up that $41 billion of  annual revenue.   The question here is not about selling airplanes, the question here  is about protecting the homeland and interests of our country around  the world.   Unfortunately, civil aviation is commingled with military Quds Force  action; not just in what has been said tonight about transporting  military action to Syria, supporting a war that has killed some 500,000  people, but what about Boeing transport from Damascus to Caracas?                                time  1815    What about the Boeing aircraft operated by the Iranian regime back  and forth between Russia and Iran, back and forth between Tehran and  Damascus, between Damascus and Venezuela?   It is not just the civilian aircraft, Mr. Speaker, and that is why we  want to be alert, and our American citizens need to know if their bank  deposits are being used to extend credit to a regime that seeks  pleasure in murdering innocent people, murdering our men and women in  uniform and even innocent civilians in their own country.   We may differ on our views on the JCPOA, but we can all agree that  nothing in the nuclear deal prevents the sharing of information between  an administration and this Congress about financing aircraft for the  world's largest state supporter of terrorism. That is what this piece  of legislation is trying to achieve. That is what Mr. Williams' point  is in bringing it to the floor, and I appreciate his thoughtful work to  implement this much-needed policy and to help keep the citizens in my  district safe from Iran's global terror advance.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to read a letter addressed to the Members of  Congress from a highly respected organization that is pro-Israel and  pro-peace advocacy. I am a member, and I look to the recommendations,  the advice, and  [[Page H9887]]  the assistance of this organization on all issues related to the Middle  East and related to Iran and related to Israel. It is known as J  Street, and I am a proud member and a proud participant.   J Street urges Members:         Oppose the so-called Strengthening Oversight of Iran's       Access to Finance Act, that is H.R. 4324, which is clearly       intended to lead to a U.S. violation of the JCPOA.        This bill would impose additional certification       requirements on the administration in order to carry out       current U.S. obligations related to commercial aircraft sales       under the JCPOA.        These new obligations require the administration to certify       that Iran is not engaged in certain nonnuclear activity or       issue a national security waiver saying they will allow the       planes to be sold anyway. In other words, it imposes new       unilateral terms for a continuation of the JCPOA that are       unrelated to Iran's nuclear conduct.        It has been widely reported in connection with the       President's recent refusal to make the necessary       certification to Congress under the Iran Nuclear Agreement       Review Act that the President resents having to undertake       official actions to keep the United States in compliance with       the JCPOA.        Proponents of this legislation clearly hope to make use of       the President's apparent resistance to taking such steps by       adding a new certification requirement that they hope he will       also fail to meet, thereby blocking the sale of commercial       aircraft and forcing a U.S. violation of the agreement.        Anyone doubting that this is the point of the bill need       look no further than the first finding, which makes clear       that this bill is a gratuitously anti-Obama, anti-JCPOA       vehicle and not a serious attempt to legislate on a       bipartisan basis on threats emanating from Iran.        No one who wants to see the JCPOA continue to be       implemented should support this bill.    Finally, Mr. Speaker, Dylan Williams, the vice president of  government affairs who signed this bill, said:         Congress just gave the administration powerful tools to       conquer other countries, support of the Assad regime when it       passed new sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea a few       months ago that the President signed into law. Implementation       and assessment of the impact of that law should occur before       consideration of any new sanctions legislation.    Again, in addition to the supporters of this body who have worked  very hard to try and convince the Members of this body to be on the  side of peace, to try and get the Members to understand the seriousness  of undermining the JCPOA, the Members of this body who work very hard  for peace and who join with groups like J Street and advocate for peace  are trying to make sure that the United States stands up to its  agreements, understanding how this undermines our leadership in the  world.   If we sit down and we negotiate with other countries, as we have done  on the JCPOA, and they expect us to live up to the agreements and then  they hear that we have various Members of Congress with ideas of their  own putting together legislation that is supported by the opposite side  of the aisle, coming in not with one piece of legislation, not with two  pieces of legislation, but we don't know how many will continue if they  are successful in passing the legislation that they are putting before  us, if this continues, then I am certain that our allies will not trust  us. They will not want to negotiate with us on other deals that are  important to peace in this world. I would simply ask the Members on the  opposite side of the aisle to pay attention to highly respected,  credible organizations like J Street and take their advice about how to  give support to the JCPOA.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
