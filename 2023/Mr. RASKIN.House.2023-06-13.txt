 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman kindly for his courtesy  in granting me this time.   Today is June 13. We have had 164 days in the year 2023, and we have  had 291 mass shootings. We are having, on average, 1\1/2\ mass  shootings every single day in America.   Of course, our colleagues would prefer not to talk about it because  they say it is impolite to talk about a mass shooting on the day it  happens. With that theory, we would never talk about it, and we would  continue ad infinitum into the carnage and the bloodshed that this  unlimited, open-arms policy is giving America today.   A number of my colleagues have invoked the Second Amendment. They  only quote half of it. They say: `` . . . the right of the people to  keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''   What about the first half of it? ``A well regulated militia, being  necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to  keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''   They say we want to repeal the Second Amendment. Mr. Speaker, we  don't want them to repeal the Second Amendment. We want them to read  the Second Amendment because the Second Amendment would ask us why we  [[Page H2841]]  are allowing people to go into elementary schools, Walmarts,  supermarkets, churches, and synagogues all over America with AR-15s  enabled sometimes with a stabilizing brace--as in Dayton, Ohio;  Boulder, Colorado; Colorado Springs; Nashville, Tennessee--and  assassinate our people.   If a foreign government were doing it, we would declare war on them,  but since we are just allowing the gun industry to spread these weapons  of mass destruction around the country, they want to allow it.   They say that the Second Amendment must be respected in this strange  and distorted way because they believe the Second Amendment gives  people the right to overthrow the government. This insurrectionist  theory of the Second Amendment means that the people must have an  arsenal equal to that of the government.   Well, it is very hard to explain the rest of the Constitution, then.  The Second Amendment doesn't mention anything about rebellion or  insurrection.    Article I, Section 8, Clause 15 says Congress has the  power to call forth the militias from the States in order to ``suppress  insurrections.''   Does that sound like a pro-insurrection document to you?   How about the Republican Guarantee Clause?   Congress shall guarantee to the people of the States a republican  form of government and assist them in putting down domestic violence.   How about the treason clause, which says that treason shall consist  of levying arms against the Union?   I could give you six more examples like that, but why don't we pause  on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which says that anybody who has  sworn an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United  States and violates that oath by engaging in insurrection or rebellion  shall never be allowed to hold Federal or State office again.   That is not the meaning of our Constitution.   The regulation the administration has adopted is perfectly  constitutional, so if you want more bloodshed, just stand for that. It  has got nothing to do with the Second Amendment. It is perfectly  constitutional for us to engage in reasonable gun safety regulation.  Check out Heller v. The District of Columbia. Justice Scalia wrote that  opinion.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  distinguished gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in opposition to this effort to overturn  President Biden's veto of H.J. Res. 42, legislation that was introduced  by Georgia Representative Clyde to strike down the people of  Washington, D.C.'s local police reform law.   If it rings a bell, it is no wonder. The House and Senate have  already voted on H.J. Res. 42. The overwhelming majority of Democrats  voted to oppose it when Republicans brought it to the floor in April.  When it reached President Biden's desk in May, he vetoed Mr. Clyde's  resolution, as he promised that he would.   Although the resolution narrowly passed the House and Senate, in  neither Chamber did it assemble anywhere close to the two-thirds  majority required in both Chambers in order to override a veto.   Mr. Speaker, today's vote is an exercise in time-wasting and  vainglorious futility. The Republican majority doesn't have the votes  to override the veto, and it doesn't deserve to.   H.J. Res. 42 would nullify a law passed unanimously by the Council of  the District of Columbia representing more than 700,000 residents to  promote accountability for police officers who use excessive force or  abuse their power, a goal that the vast majority of Americans share.   The D.C. law bans the use of chokeholds and other dangerous neck  restraints and sets reasonable standards for the use of deadly force.   It requires public release of body-worn camera footage and creates a  police officer misconduct database, but only for officers who have been  either convicted of a crime or for whom allegations of abuse have been  civilly or administratively sustained.   The law prohibits D.C. from hiring police officers who have engaged  in prior criminal or official misconduct.   Most importantly, the new law empowers the chief of police to fire or  discipline officers who break the law by removing police disciplinary  matters from the collective bargaining table.  [[Page H2844]]    Now, Mr. Speaker, you may recall that this is the position that  galvanized the opposition to D.C.'s law. This provision is why  Republicans want the Congress of the United States to behave like a  535-Member nationally elected super-city council with the power to  overturn the work of the 13-member Council of the District of Columbia  elected locally by the actual residents of Washington, D.C.   So what is so important about this provision? Well, the local police  union doesn't like it, and they have been the chief lobbyists against  it. They sued when this reform legislation was first passed in D.C.,  asserting that the provision removing police discipline from the  collective bargaining table violated the U.S. Constitution, but they  lost their case in the U.S. District Court for D.C. and the U.S. Court  of Appeals for D.C., and the Supreme Court failed to grant cert.    Now, in their haste to kick around the people of Washington and not  to support D.C. police officers who, after all, came to our defense on  January 6, many of whom were wounded by the insurrectionists and ended  up with broken fingers and arms and legs, and so on, our GOP colleagues  are suddenly embracing the extreme position on police disciplinary  matters which has already been rejected by the courts in which  jurisdictions across America are debating and doing away with.   Now, why is the ending of discipline of police officers a subject for  collective bargaining such a big deal? Well, Washington itself is a  good example.   The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department has been forced by labor  arbitrators to rehire a significant number of officers who had been  fired for engaging in serious criminal misconduct, including criminal  assault, including sexual assault.   Every D.C. police chief for at least the last 25 years have expressed  outrage about having to hire bad cops after they have been fired for  engaging in serious misconduct. Forcing police chiefs to reinstate bad  cops fired for breaking the law is bad for public safety, bad for  community trust, and bad for morale among the vast majority of good  police officers who are doing their jobs, like the ones who came to  defend us on January 6, 2021, against the violent mob insurrection  incited by the former President.   This should not be a partisan point. This is a matter for local  decisionmaking in Washington, D.C., as it is in every other  jurisdiction in the country.   Mr. Speaker, 700,000 tax-paying American citizens have decided  through their locally elected representatives that the chief of police  who is appointed by the Mayor should be able to discipline bad actors  within the police department. Reversing the D.C. government on this  local matter is outrageous interference by Congress to impose a bad  public policy on the Capital City.   The D.C. police accountability law makes reasonable, commonsense  reforms that will make the D.C. police more accountable to the  community of people they serve, increase public trust, and strengthen  public safety.   In fact, multiple provisions constituting the D.C. police reform law  are mainstream reforms that enjoy strong public support and are  congruent with the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed  the House in the 117th Congress, and with police accountability laws  enacted by dozens of States and localities in recent years in the wake  of notorious episodes of brutality, like the unconscionable murder of  George Floyd.   For example, since May of 2020, at least 24 States have enacted  legislation to limit the use of dangerous neck restraints against  citizens; 39 States have passed reforms related to officer education  and training.                                time  1545    Twenty-six States have enacted laws to improve data collection and  increase transparency. At least seven States, including Arizona,  Colorado, and Wisconsin, have passed legislation requiring the  publication of police databases or use-of-force information. Twenty  States since 2020 have enacted laws that address State-level use-of- force standards.   This is a matter for States and localities to decide themselves.  Reversing D.C. on this local matter is an outrageous effort to impose  bad public policy on the people of D.C.   Voting to override the veto of this GOP resolution is yet another  attack on local decisionmaking, federalism, and the policies of  meaningful oversight and accountability that the majority of Americans  want. A vote to override the veto today is a vote against political  democracy and local self-government in America. A ``yes'' vote today is  a vote against commonsense oversight and accountability over policing  in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand  up for democracy, stand up for political self-determination, and vote  ``no'' on this attempt to override the President's veto.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
