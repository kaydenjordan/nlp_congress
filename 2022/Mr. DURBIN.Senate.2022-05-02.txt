 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the past 2 years, our understanding  of healthcare and good health practices has changed. The pandemic  revealed we cannot limit the delivery of care to the hospital or the  doctor's office. We need to reach out, particularly to the most  vulnerable members of our communities, directly, personally. That is  exactly what is underway in Chicago right now.   Four years ago, I brought together the CEOs of the top 10 hospitals  in Chicago. They were located in areas around the city, I noticed, that  were comparable to the areas of greatest gun violence, each one of  those hospitals. So I asked the 10 CEOs to come over for breakfast--I  bought the bagels and coffee--and they sat down around the table and  they looked at one another and they told me: This is the first time we  have ever sat in the same room together.   They are competitors. They are trying to get the same people to come  to their hospitals. But this morning was a conversation about what they  had in common.   These hospitals are on the frontlines of treating victims with bullet  wounds. When I met with those CEOs in 2018, we talked about how you not  only treat this kind of violence but how you prevent it.   We launched something called the Chicago HEAL Initiative. ``HEAL''  stands for Hospital Engagement, Action, and Leadership. Despite being  competitors, these 10 hospital CEOs sat down, and on their own--without  my input, without my urging or any Federal mandates--wrote 16 things  they thought they could achieve over a span of 3 years. I looked at the  list and said that this sounds good to me.   We knew we couldn't solve every aspect of the complex problems facing  us with gun violence, but it was a good start. They said to me: This is  the first time we have ever gotten together, and we were able to come  up with an agreement.   Well, last week, the 3 years were up, and we announced what happened  at these hospitals over the last 3 years. The gunshot patient in the  emergency room, hospitals are no longer just stitching up their wounds;  they are also addressing the emotional scars to prevent retaliation.  Last year, 3,000 gunshot victims were paired with counselors and  caseworkers.   Without these interventions, we know that nearly half--half--of the  gunshot victims would be back in the hospital within 5 years. That is a  fact.   But the hospitals are also looking further upstream to try to put an  end to violence in the city of Chicago.   People say the best way to stop a bullet is with a job. Well, these  10 hospitals took that to heart. Over the last 3 years, these 10  hospitals increased new hires from neighborhoods of the highest gun  violence, which face more poverty than other neighborhoods, obviously,  by a whopping 21 percent.   Here is what they do. They go into the high schools and middle  schools around the hospitals where they do business and sit down and  talk to the kids and say: How would you like to shadow one of our  nurses or one of our doctors, see what it is like in the hospital here  and maybe even have a summer internship? All of a sudden, young people  have taken an interest in that hospital that they walk by every day and  never ever related to.   The hospitals also decided they have economic clout. Think of the  money that is spent on goods and supplies at every hospital in America.  Well, they decided to reach out to their suppliers and say to them: We  are going to give you special consideration if you will locate part of  your business in the neighborhood around our hospital so that people in  the neighborhoods can be working to provide the goods and materials  that we need.   They increased goods and services from local suppliers by nearly 30  percent--$120 million last year--just the beginning, seed money to get  these businesses in the neighborhood supplying the hospital.   Importantly, these 10 hospitals are going into the Chicago middle and  high schools offering apprenticeship programs, and it is working. Last  year, 5,000 students went through these apprenticeship and intern  programs.   This is especially important 2 years into the pandemic. Our hospitals  have been hit with shortages of nurses, doctors, and critical support  staff--not just in the city of Chicago, I might add, but the entire  State. I spoke to the Southern Illinois Health Clinic CEO, and he has  talked to me about the same thing they are running into in Chicago.  They just don't have enough medical professionals.   I met last week with members of the Illinois Hospital Association.  They told me that the shortages and burnouts in our health workforce is  their top concern. They are working with local schools to recruit  students.   A few years ago, I kept hearing this nursing shortage, nursing  shortage, and I decided I had to learn what was behind this. And it is  a very simple fact of economics. Here is what it comes down to. If you  are a registered nurse in my State of Illinois, it is not uncommon for  you to have an opportunity to make a six-figure salary, not uncommon at  all. And particularly if you are  [[Page S2233]]  in the big city, you are going to make that much money. That is a good  salary, and I believe these nurses deserve it.   But then you say, well, we need more nurses. We need to have more  nurse training. Well, what do you need for nurse training? A teacher. A  professor.   How do you take a registered nurse and turn that registered nurse  into a professor? Two years for a master's degree in nursing.   The obvious question: What is that nurse going to do for 2 years  while she is going to school or he is going to school to become a  professor? They are not going to get the six-figure salary that they  were earning as RNs. So there is an obvious economic disincentive for  them to go into teaching even if they want to do it.   Now, let's assume they get through the 2 years and the master's  degree, and now they are professors. The amount that they are being  paid at the community college or at the nursing school is not  comparable to the salary of an RN. So the economics of the situation  come in as a great obstacle.   So what happens--you know this, I am sure, very well, Madam  President. What happens to the hospital that doesn't have enough  nurses? They have to go out for what they call contract nurses. I am  not holding anything against these people. They make a living and are  pretty smart at it. They make themselves available. Some of them move  all over the country to be in different hospitals, and they get paid  dramatically more than the RNs who are on the regular staff.   One hospital told me they pay three times the rate for a contract  nurse as a regular nurse. Another said five times the rate. If you can  think what that means, the budgets of these hospitals and clinics are  going through the roof with these additional costs for a nursing  shortage.   So we have got to find a way to create the economics of more nursing  professors from the RN pool that is overtaxed, working hard, getting  paid six figures, and move them into teaching ranks.   The obvious beneficiaries are all of us in America, but directly it  is hospitals and clinics. So they have to join with us in a joint  effort to try to solve this problem.   We also know that trauma is the root of much of the pain and conflict  in our neighborhoods. You have heard the phrase: ``Hurt people hurt  people.''   Almost 30 years ago, the CDC did a study on adverse childhood  experiences, called ACEs. They found that witnessing violence or  growing up without a stable home can really have an impact on the human  mind, the mind of a child. Without the right help, that trauma can  rewire a child's brain and change the way they see the world. It is not  hard to see how this fuels the cycle of violence.   Under the HEAL Initiative, these 10 Chicago hospitals are bringing  their medical expertise into the community to help children cope with  traumatic experiences. I have seen it in a classroom, in one of the  classrooms called Calm Classrooms Project, which teaches meditation in  school.   I was at a classroom of third graders, and the teacher said to the  kids at their desks: Now we are going to be quiet for 5 minutes. So  everybody just think about what we are going to do today.   There was one kid who just couldn't do it. He was fidgeting. He  wanted to talk. She was telling him: No, no. Be quiet for a little  while.   I said to the teacher afterwards: What is going on?   She said: That little boy is going through some real problems at  home.   I said: What are you going to do about it?   She said: Senator, I am a teacher. I am not a psychologist. I am not  a counselor. We need somebody to sit down and talk to him. He needs  help right now.   Well, imagine all these kids coming back from their Zoom educations,  trying to get back into the classroom and into the swing of things. For  a lot of kids, there is an adjustment. They need a helping hand.   So what we are trying to teach is that what is going on with mental  health issues, wellness issues, trauma issues all relates to the  outcomes we are looking for: kids who are successful in school and kids  who avoid the gangs and violence on the street.   Two weeks ago, I visited Drake Elementary School--the Drake Dragons-- where I toured one of the school clinics and the mobile health van.  Listen to this, Madam President. You are going to like this. They have  a clinic in the school itself. They treat the kids with counseling and  physical and health--whatever needs they have. They, of course, are  there for the staff, but they also make it open to the families of the  kids, no questions asked: Come on down to our clinic. When you drop  your kid off at school, come on into the clinic if you need a helping  hand. And they have expanded that to the neighborhood as well. It is a  great idea, and it is based in the school--what I like about it.   It has been years and years since I was there, in grade school. We  had an occasional school nurse, but that was about it. What would you  think about a real clinic in the school? And over half of the people  who come in need mental health counseling. It is an important part of  life, and they are responding to it.   We were joined in our meeting just a week or so ago by Dr. Walensky  from the CDC. She applauded these hospitals that are part of the  Chicago HEAL Initiative, and she said this innovative partnership is  exactly what CDC sees in the future.   I hope President Biden agrees. I am sure he will. In his fiscal year  2023 budget, the President called for a $250 million investment in  community violence interventions to support programs like the HEAL  Initiative. Believe me, I am going to knock on his door. In March, in  his State of the Union Address, the President urged lawmakers to come  on a bipartisan basis to address mental health.   Debbie Stabenow, our colleague from Michigan, has been one of the  strongest proponents of mental health. She was talking about this--and  should. The President hears the message, and he is delivering.   I partnered also with Senator Capito, a Republican from West  Virginia, on the RISE from Trauma Act, which will help more kids heal  from trauma. Our bill would increase the resources for a trauma- informed workforce. Projects like HEAL and this legislation with  Senator Capito can really change lives for the better.                            ____________________     Madam President, let me say a word about gun violence  because in the city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent, it  breaks my heart what is happening in that city.   Not last weekend but the weekend before, there were 37 shootings in  the course of a weekend. Seven people died. This weekend, 9 people were  killed and 26 others wounded by gunfire. This is the beginning of the  summer months. I am afraid that it tells us we still have a massive  challenge ahead of us. We have to do more at every single level.   Let's start with what the HEAL Initiative is doing and bring some  hope to the lives of folks, give them an opportunity for a decent- paying job, let them have an affordable place to live that is safe from  gunshots and other threats to a family.   We have to work on this together to deal with the criminal justice  system. We learned the hard way that simply putting tougher sentences  down for something like crack cocaine is not necessarily the answer. In  fact, it can backfire, as it did, we learned, over the last 20 years.  We have to have sensible criminal sentencing guidelines that punish  wrongdoing, of course; keep dangerous people off the street, of course;  but give people a chance  to rebuild their lives. Many of them will be  able to do it. Let me also say that we have to have effective  prosecution.    We lost one of our best Chicago policewomen just last year. Her name  was Ella French. Ella French was a lovely, young, respected police  officer who was sitting in a car with her partner. A fellow came up  with a gun, shot her in the back of the head--unfortunately, killed  her--and then shot her partner in the head, too, and blinded him in one  eye. His name is Officer Yanez. I met him at the South Side Irish  Parade.   Well, the tribute to Ella French, who lost her life in the line of  duty, was like something I have never seen before in Chicago. They went  to a high school  [[Page S2234]]  in the southern part of the city and took the chapel and set it aside  for visitors to come pay their respects. The Presiding Officer wouldn't  believe the lines that went on for blocks, men and women in uniform and  everybody else--myself, my wife, folks in the city--paying their  respects to Ella French. She was an extraordinary person.   The gun that killed her was a straw purchase gun. What does that  mean? Somebody went into a Federal gun dealer and said: I want to buy a  gun. They looked and checked, and that person had no criminal record.  The person bought the gun, turned around, went outside, and handed it  to a convicted felon, who then turned around and killed this  policewoman. That is a straw purchase.   Unfortunately, for too long, we have treated that as a bookkeeping  crime, a misdemeanor, nothing serious. It is serious. Straw purchases  are a way to avoid the prohibition under the law of a person with a  criminal record buying a gun. We ought to treat it as a serious matter.   I have appealed to all the U.S. attorneys in my State, and I hope all  Senators will talk to the U.S. attorneys across the Nation. Take straw  purchasing seriously. This is not a bookkeeping error; this is a deadly  crime that can kill innocent, good people like Ella French and maimed  the officer who was with her. So we ought to take that seriously.   This weekend that I just referred to, the previous one, with 37  shootings, 1 of them was on Sunday night. Madam President, they went to  the scene afterwards and found 68 cartridges--68. The people in the  neighborhood said it sounded like a war zone. Two of the cartridges  were from an AK-47, a military assault type rifle, which has no place  anywhere except in the military or maybe some police application, but  in this case, it was being used in a shootout between two people in  cars.   I don't understand what happened next. They ended up finding one of  the people who were involved in the shooting. He had a gun. He had a  gun illegally. He doesn't have a firearm identification card, required  under Illinois law. After taking a look at the facts of the situation,  they plan on charging him with a misdemeanor. What is going on here? A  misdemeanor for a shootout on the streets of Chicago with 68 cartridges  on the ground afterwards?   Whether it is a straw purchase treated as a bookkeeping error or a  shootout with an AK-47 treated as a misdemeanor, we have to send the  word out that this is unacceptable--not just in Chicago but  unacceptable across this country.   If you want to legally own a gun, store it properly, use it properly  and legally, I am all for it, and I think that is what the Second  Amendment is all about. But what is going on on streets of Chicago, the  streets of East St. Louis, Rockford, and so many other cities is a  shootout with a massive amount of guns that are finding their way onto  the streets. So we have to take that seriously.                            ____________________     Madam President, let me just close by saying that last  week, the Senate did a great job filling another critical law  enforcement vacancy in Chicago. We confirmed Oak Park Police Chief  LaDon Reynolds to be our Northern District's next U.S. marshal. That  seat has been vacant for almost 4 years. It is a critical position for  reducing crime, apprehending fugitives, and protecting our judges.   Marshal Reynolds is the man for the job. Breaking the cycle of  violence in Chicago and across America requires the best. All of us  need to pull together: families, schools, community organizations, law  enforcement, the public health community, faith leaders, the business  community, and more. I am glad that the HEAL Initiative is a start in  that direction. We have more work to do, and we cannot allow any petty  Washington politics to get in the way.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet) is  necessarily absent.
