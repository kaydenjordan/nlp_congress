 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering H. Con. Res. 43, to authorize  the use of the Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box  Derby.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Hoyer for introducing this  resolution. The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby is an annual  competitive event that encourages children, ages 9 through 16, to  construct and race their own soapbox vehicles on the Capitol Grounds.   This event has become a great tradition in the District of Columbia  metropolitan area over the last few decades. It provides a terrific  opportunity for children to appreciate the work necessary to build the  vehicles and enjoy the thrill of competition.   The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the  Architect of the Capitol and the Capitol Police to ensure the  appropriate rules and regulations are in place and that the event  remains free to the public.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res.  43, and I yield back the balance of my time.   time  1715 I11
