 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Cesar E. Chavez  and the Farmworker Movement National Historical Park Act.   This legislation would establish the Cesar E. Chavez and the  Farmworker Movement National Historical Park in California and Arizona  to preserve the nationally significant sites associated with Cesar  Chavez and the farm worker movement.   In 2008, with strong bipartisan support, Congress enacted legislation  directing the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study  of sites that are significant to the life of Cesar Chavez and the farm  labor movement in the Western United States. The National Park Service  evaluated over 100 sites that were significant to Cesar Chavez and the  farm labor movement in thy stern United States and found that five  sites were ``nationally significant.'' Importantly, the Park Service  wrote that these nationally significant sites depict a distinct and  important aspect of American history associated with civil rights and  labor movements that are not adequately represented or protected  elsewhere. While the Park Service provided five management alternatives  to protect these special places, they ultimately recommended that  Congress establish a national historic park that would include several  nationally significant sites.   In 2012, President Obama established the Cesar E. Chavez National  Monument. The property is in Keene, CA and is known as Nuestra Senora  Reina de la Paz. In his Presidential Proclamation, President Obama  said: ``This site marks the extraordinary achievements and  contributions to the history of the United States made by Cesar Chavez  and the farm worker movement that he led with great vision and  fortitude. La Paz reflects his conviction that ordinary people can do  extraordinary things.''   While this was a critical step forward, the National Monument leaves  out many nationally significant sites and leaves many important stories  untold. The creation of a national historical park, as originally  recommended by the Park Service, would allow the National Park Service  to tell the full story of Cesar Chavez and the farm labor movement for  the benefit of all Americans.   This legislation would establish the Forty Acres in Delano, CA; the  Cesar E. Chavez National Monument, which includes La Nuestra Senora  Reina de la Paz, in Keene, CA; and the Santa Rita Center in Phoenix,  AZ, as part of a new Cesar E. Chavez and Farmworker Movement National  Historical Park. These sites contain nationally significant resources  associated with Cesar Chavez and the farmworker movement and would be  preserved and protected as part of the National Park System.   This legislation would also establish a new National Historic Trail  that would commemorate the 1966 Delano to Sacramento March, a major  milestone event in the farm labor movement. According to the Special  Resource Study, ``More than one hundred men and women set out from  Delano on March 17, 1966, and thousands of farm workers and their  families joined in for short stretches along the way. By the time the  marchers entered Sacramento on Easter Sunday, April 10, 1966, the farm  worker movement had secured a contract and attracted new waves of  support from across the country.''   We must honor and celebrate the life and legacy of Cesar Chavez, the  inspirational civil rights advocate and leader of the farm labor  movement whose impact reverberated in California and across the world.  His list of accomplishments is long, from creating the Nation's first  permanent agricultural labor union to helping secure passage of the  first American law that recognized farm workers' rights to organize.   While widely respected as the most important Latino leader in the  United States in the 20th century, Cesar Chavez was not just a leader  for the Latino community. Following the principles of Mahatma Gandhi  and Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesar Chavez led a nonviolent movement of  protests and boycotts to secure a union, better pay, and better working  conditions for farmworkers. He also played a leading role in the  broader labor movement, the Chicano movement, and the environmental  movement. For Chavez, it did not matter where you came from or what  your job was: he believed in the fundamental right to dignity and  respect.   But this park will not just focus on Chavez's legacy; it will also  preserve the thousands of stories of people who played a role in the  broader farm labor movement. According to the Special Resource Study,  ``During the 1960s, the farm labor movement attracted support from a  wide array of individuals, including members of other unions, religious  leaders, civil rights activists, high school students and college  students (including young Chicanos and Filipinos), environmentalists,  and justice-minded consumers across the country and abroad.''   As the son of immigrants from Mexico and the first Latino to  represent California in the U.S. Senate, I believe the movement Cesar  Chavez created is just as important today as it ever has been. The  National Park System--which preserves our natural, historical, and  cultural heritage while offering  [[Page S2896]]  vital spaces for teaching, learning, and outdoor recreation--must paint  the full mosaic of America. Through the sites preserved by this bill,  we can ensure that the National Park System preserves the diverse  history of our Nation that is too often overlooked. As a farm worker  himself, Cesar Chavez maintained a strong connection to the natural  environment. This bill uplifts his story and those of others whose  contributions helped build the farmworker and civil rights movements  that are pillars of American history.   I thank the bill's cosponsors in the Senate and House of  Representatives, and I especially want to thank Congressman Ruiz for  spearheading this effort with me to ensure that our national monuments  and historical parks better reflect the diversity of America's  heritage.   Today and every day, let's recommit to the work Cesar Chavez began.  As he would say: La Lucha Sigue. We must not waver as we keep up the  fight for justice and equality for all.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Cesar E.  Chavez National Historical Park Act as quickly as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Ms. Sinema):   S. 4372.
