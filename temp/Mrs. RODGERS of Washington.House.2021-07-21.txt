 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  Hyde amendment and urge us to be warriors for human dignity and human  value.   We must cherish every person's unalienable human right to life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   With technology today, we can look into the womb and watch the  development of a baby day by day. Doctors are able to administer  lifesaving care to babies before they are born. It is a miracle to  witness, and it is proof that life begins at conception.   Our laws should reflect this science and the truth. For decades, my  colleagues across the aisle, including President Joe Biden, agreed. I  urge them to join us to protect life.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act,  and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no.''   The decision to oppose H.R. 2467 was not easy, but this version is  not the right approach.   PFAS contamination is a serious problem in many congressional  districts. That is true for me, too. My district has PFOA and PFOS  contamination at Fairchild Air Force Base in Airway Heights,  Washington, and I very much want it cleaned up.   I have problems, though, with H.R. 2467's overwhelming, heavy-handed,  and unscientific approach. I am struggling with why this aggressive  expansion of Federal power and spending is the best answer that the  people's House can provide.   What does this massive proposal mean, and are we ready to go this  far?   I cannot stress this enough: what we are addressing today is not  about one, two, or just a handful of legacy chemicals. PFAS are,  instead, an enormous and diverse class of manmade chemicals. EPA's  ``Master List of PFAS Substances'' contains more than 9,000 distinct  chemicals, and the definition in this bill would apply to every one of  those 9,252 chemicals and their uses.   Since the late fall of 2020, Congress has enacted 31 separate  provisions to address PFAS. Congress has compelled cleanup of PFAS at  military installations, banned certain uses of PFAS chemicals in  products, pushed cooperative agreements for cleanups with States, and  authorized $500 million for removing emerging contaminants, especially  PFAS, from drinking water.   Similarly, EPA has advanced nine major regulatory efforts for PFOA,  PFOS, and some of the other PFAS chemicals.   EPA Administrator Regan also has commissioned a multiyear review  process at EPA to consider any necessary modifications and to identify  new strategies and priorities related to PFAS.   I want strong scientific backing for anything that we do to address  PFAS chemicals. I am concerned that the mandates in the PFAS Action Act  will frustrate EPA's existing science-based plans. This bill instead  will cement policy choices with long-range implications. It will  overwhelm EPA's existing resources to tackle environmental and public  health challenges beyond PFAS.   The PFAS Action Act is not a measured approach. It prejudges  outcomes, showing little regard for objective science, risk assessment,  transparency, and public input.   For example, the bill requires EPA to make regulatory determinations  within 5 years on 9,250 PFAS chemicals--and without public  participation.   This impossible deadline is a lawsuit waiting to happen. It requires  every manufacturer and processor to conduct comprehensive testing on  all 9,252 PFAS. This will overwhelm existing domestic laboratory  capacity to focus on any other scientific or public health matter.   Like it or not, some PFAS chemicals have specific properties that  aren't easily addressed with other chemical types, like stability and  water, oil, stain, and heat resistance. This makes them crucial in  making semiconductors, lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles,  solar panels, wind turbine parts, medical devices and drugs, and  protective gear for our military and law enforcement.   This bill would create a hostile environment in the United States of  America for their manufacture and use. It will create a de facto ban in  the marketplace and a boon for trial lawyers. It prevents new PFAS from  coming on to the market for 5 years. This will result in the drying up  of investment in safe PFAS chemicals and PFAS product purchases. It  also will signal to trial courts that all PFAS are hazardous.   It singles out PFAS manufacturers and uses a complex and expensive  regulatory approach. It uses an unattainable standard to ban  incineration of PFAS-contaminated material. This will federalize local  trash collection and clog our Nation's remaining landfill capacity.   It attaches permanent, open-ended cleanup liability to any person who  has ever been associated with PFAS, regardless of whether you were a  good actor.   Mr. Speaker, cleanup liability is:   ``Strict,'' so your intent is irrelevant;   ``Joint and several,'' so you are not just responsible for your fair  share, you are responsible for everyone's shares;   And, ``retroactive,'' so it doesn't matter if the liability occurred  5 years, 10 years, 20 years, or 50 years ago or even further back.   Given the compliance costs, the sidelining of investment, the endless  liability under CERCLA, tort lawsuits, and the inability to make or  finance safer replacement chemicals and products, it is not hard to see  how H.R. 2467 creates a de facto ban on 9,252 chemicals. It threatens  the viability of every industry that needs these chemicals and products  that benefit our society.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, this bill essentially bans the  materials that are necessary for America to win the future. That  includes protective gear for law enforcement at a time when violent  crime is surging in our country.   In drafting this legislation over two Congresses, the majority never  called  [[Page H3775]]  EPA to testify on the bill. Now we are left with the opinions of the  politicians and the White House, not the career scientists and the  experts who will have to implement it. So much for trust the science.   In addition, the Congressional Budget Office has had trouble scoring  this bill and a nearly identical bill from last Congress. That is  because there are so many PFAS chemicals, and the mandates in this bill  have no limits on either the Federal Treasury or the private sector.  The bill also poses a significant burden on EPA's time and the lack of  additional resources EPA will have to tackle other issues critical to  their mission.   We all want to have a good solution to address PFAS contamination,  but this bill falls short, unfortunately.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in opposing this approach. We  can do better.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3  minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), an exceptional  leader on the Energy and Commerce Committee and a cardiothoracic  surgeon.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to clarify that  the previous administration, as well as the current administration, has  been taking several actions in connection with PFAS; this large group  of chemicals. We are talking about 9,252 chemicals; not just one.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Walberg), a member of the committee and a problem solver.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong), another dynamic member of  the Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), our policy chairman and a member  of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Crenshaw), another member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and a decorated Navy SEAL.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), a physician and member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), a leader on the Natural  Resources Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), the lead Republican on the  Oversight and Reform Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much  time I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Unfortunately, this bill is not just limited to legacy contamination.  It creates a hostile environment for the manufacture and use of PFAS,  present and future.   The ban in this bill is a de facto ban on 9,252 PFAS, as well as  numerous lifesaving and critical products containing PFAS.   A de facto ban is a system where many suppliers of a product are  allowed, but the environment is so completely hostile to its existence,  that the product might as well not be made.   The aggressive, unscientific regulatory approach in this bill,  coupled with its extremely limited exemptions, will create stigma and  uncertainty, and that will result in increased litigation in trial  courts for products containing PFAS.   If you start stacking up the negative market pressures created  through:   One, increased compliance costs;   Two, limited disposal options;   Three, sidelined investments;   Four, unquantifiable and permanent liability under CERCLA;   Five, tort lawsuits aided by legislative stigma;   Six, marketplace challenges;   Seven, the inability to make or finance a safer replacement chemical  or product, it is not hard to see how H.R. 2467 creates a de facto ban  on 9,252 chemicals and threatens the viability of these industries and  the industries that need them and the products containing them that  benefit our society.   Unfortunately, this is not a new tactic. It has been done before with  the war on coal under the Obama administration, and now we are seeing  it with the rest of fossil fuels and any product that some decide they  don't like.   The word ``ban'' may not appear, but by creating massive costs  through regulatory barriers and mandates, uncertainty, and taxes, a de  facto ban is created by the cost of doing business. The cost of doing  business becomes too high and we, as Americans, become dependent upon  other countries, dangerously dependent upon other countries. It  jeopardizes manufacturing in our country, and then we wonder why people  are not manufacturing in the United States.   It has been done on coal, it has been done on fossil fuels, and today  it is being done on American manufacturers.   We can do better. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.  Let's go back, let's do better. We all want to protect clean drinking  water. That is a shared goal. Let's stay focused on that goal. Vote  ``no'' on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in  opposition, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we all believe that we must have clean water.  Unfortunately, this is not a thoughtful or scientific approach.   H.R. 2467 is opposed by a broad diverse, collection of interests that  are concerned about its aggressive, over-the-top, unforgiving, and  simultaneous mandates, obligations, and expenses.   These include: The United States Conference of Mayors; National  League of Cities; National Association of Counties; American Water  Works Association; Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies; National  Association of Water Companies; National Association of Clean Water  Agencies; National Rural Water Association; Association of California  Water Agencies; The Water Environment Federation; American Chemistry  Council; American Coatings Association; American Forest and Paper  Association; American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers; American  Petroleum Institute; Flexible Packaging Association; National  Association of Chemical Distributors; National Association for Surface  Finishing; National Council of Textile Organizations; National  Electrical Manufacturers Association; National Association of Surface  Finishing; National Association of Printing Ink Manufacturers; Plastics  Industry Association; United States Chamber of Commerce.   Madam Speaker, I include these letters in the Record.                                                      July 21, 2021.      Re Opposition to H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act of 2021.         Dear Representative: On behalf of organizations       representing the nation's municipal governments and drinking       water and wastewater systems, we write in opposition to H.R.       2467, the PFAS Action Act of 2021. While we support taking       action to reduce the prevalence of PFAS in the environment,       the legislation would run counter to the important ``polluter       pays'' principle that guides Superfund site cleanups under       the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and       Liability Act (CERCLA), and would step back from the       transparent, science-based process of regulating drinking       water contaminants under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)       and clean water operations under the Clean Water Act (CWA).       We urge you to vote against this legislation in its current       form.        H.R. 2467 would require EPA to designate PFOA and PFOS as       hazardous substances under CERCLA within one year, and to       make a determination on designating all remaining PFAS within       five years. These hazardous substance designations are       intended to make sure polluters are held responsible for       paying for the cleanup of contaminated Superfund sites, which       we support. But the bill as currently structured would also       mean that municipal drinking water and wastewater utility       ratepayers could face staggering financial liability to clean       up PFAS that was legally disposed of following the water       treatment process. We believe water and wastewater utilities,       when acting in accordance with all applicable laws, should be       provided an exemption to protect the utilities and water       customers from bearing the costs of cleanup.        In the case of drinking water systems, if PFAS is removed       from source water in order to comply with a drinking water       regulatory standard, the utility then becomes the possessor       of filtration media that contain those PFAS. The utility must       then dispose of these PFAS-laden filters, typically by       sending them to a hazardous waste landfill in accordance with       applicable law. However, should that landfill ever become a       Superfund site, then the water utility could be treated as a       PFAS polluter--and be responsible for a portion of the       cleanup costs--forcing local ratepayers to cover the cleanup       bill after they already paid to remove the contaminants from       their source water.        Wastewater utilities would face similar liability through       no fault of their own because they receive PFAS chemicals       through the raw influent that arrives at the treatment plant.       This heterogenous influent can come from domestic,       industrial, and commercial sources and may contain PFAS       constituents ranging from trace to higher concentrations,       depending on the nature of the dischargers to the sewer       system. In any case, the influent is not generated by the       utility, but the utility is responsible for treating it under       scientific and regulatory authorities provided for under the       CWA. Because wastewater utilities cannot halt treating       continual industrial or domestic wastewater inputs which       likely contain PFAS in some concentration, they should be       protected through a targeted CERCLA liability exemption.        It is particularly disappointing that H.R. 2467 would offer       a CERCLA liability shield to airports that release PFAS into       the environment through their use of firefighting foam. It       defies logic that the legislation fails to extend that same       liability protection to water and wastewater systems that       have no choice but to dispose of PFAS found in water       supplies, and whose ratepayers would be ultimately       responsible for all of the costs associated with a Superfund       site cleanup. As passive receivers of PFAS, water and       wastewater utilities should be afforded the same liability       protections that the legislation would award airports in       order to keep CERCLA liability focused on the corporations       that created the pollution in the first place. Our       organizations have repeatedly asked Congress for CERCLA       liability shields in the legislation similar to those for       airports but have been rebuffed.        Additionally, many of our organizations oppose provisions       in H.R. 2467 that would amend SDWA by requiring EPA to       promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for       PFOA and PFOS within two years, establishing a unique and       expedited drinking water contaminant regulatory process for       other chemicals in the PFAS family, and eliminating EPA's       discretion on whether to issue drinking water health       advisories related to PFAS. In sum, these changes would       undermine the development of transparent, science-based       drinking water standards, and would place undue cost burdens       on our communities and ratepayers while leading to premature       regulatory decisions that lack public review and scientific       validity.        While we share the goal of addressing PFAS contamination       and holding accountable those entities that are responsible       releasing it into the environment, H.R. 2467  [[Page H3787]]       would instead assign environmental cleanup liability to       innocent water systems and their customers. We have no choice       but to oppose the legislation and encourage you to vote       against it in its current form.            Sincerely,          American Council of Engineering Companies, Association of             California Water Agencies, California Association of             Sanitation Agencies, National Association of Counties,             National League of Cities, National Water Resources             Association, Water Environment Federation, American             Water Works Association, Association of Metropolitan             Water Agencies, National Association of Clean Water             Agenices, National Association of Water Companies,             National Rural Water Association, The U.S. Conference             of Mayors.                                   ____                                                    June 22, 2021.       Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers,       On behalf of the nation's mayors, cities and counties, we       write to express our concerns with the Assistance, Quality,       and Affordability Act of 2021 (AQUA Act, H.R. 3291) and the       PFAS Action Act of 2021 (H.R. 2467). Our organizations       strongly support provisions in H.R. 3291 that would       reauthorize the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund and       authorize grants to support lead pipe replacement and PFAS       treatment. However, the legislation also includes provisions       that would require the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency       (EPA) to set National Primary Drinking Water Regulations for       PFAS and other chemicals and regulate PFAS under the       Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and       Liability Act (CERCLA). These provisions could have       unintended consequences for local governments and place an       undue cost burden on communities and our residents.        In general, our organizations support provisions in the       1996 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which       require that drinking water standards be based on sound       science, public health protection and occurrence of       contaminants in drinking water supplies at levels of public       health concern to reduce risk while balancing costs. Congress       should not circumvent this process in any way for select       contaminants.        Moreover, CERCLA ensures that hazardous substances that may       endanger public health or the environment are cleaned up by       holding responsible parties financially liable. Local       governments, including municipal airports and fire       departments, which were required by federal law to use       firefighting foam containing PFAS chemicals, and drinking       water and wastewater utilities and municipal landfills, which       serve as receivers of PFAS chemicals and did not cause or       contribute to contamination, should not be held liable for       PFAS contamination or cleanup costs.        The nation is just emerging from a deadly pandemic that has       left local governments and many of our residents and small       businesses reeling financially. Our communities need       financial assistance to address our drinking water       infrastructure challenges, but we can not absorb costly       unfunded mandates that will become an additional burden to       local budgets and our residents. While we acknowledge the       public health risks associated with PFAS chemicals and urge       Congress and the Administration to examine PFAS contamination       holistically and to take comprehensive action to address the       problem, the federal government should avoid passing costs       onto local governments and ratepayers for PFAS treatment and       cleanup.        We agree with the sentiment outlined in the comment letter       from the American Water Works Association, Association of       Metropolitan Water Agencies, National Association of Water       Companies and the National Rural Water Association to the       House Energy and Commerce Committee on June 15, which raises       similar concerns.        Specifically, we offer the following comments on the AQUA       Act and the PFAS Action Act of 2021:        Local governments, water utilities and their ratepayers       should not be held financially liable under CERCLA for PFAS       contamination. CERCLA was established to make polluters and       manufacturers of these pollutants pay for the contamination       they caused. At a minimum, the legislation should extend a       similar CERCLA liability exemption to local governments that       is offered to airports.        We are opposed to Congress modifying EPA's impartial       contaminant regulatory process on an ad-hoc basis to       establish a unique and expedited regulatory process for       specific chemicals. The legislation would require EPA to rush       to finalize drinking water regulations for PFOA, PFOS, and       other chemicals in the PFAS family within two years of the       bill's enactment. We believe that an expedited time frame       would come at the expense of public transparency and       scientific rigor and would lead to inequitable regulations       that force the lowest-income water ratepayers to shoulder a       greater proportion of the new compliance costs that are       passed on by their water systems.        Repealing section 1412(b)(6) of the Safe Drinking Water       Act, a key provision that allows EPA the opportunity to       ensure that the public health benefits of a drinking water       regulation are reasonably balanced with the compliance costs       that water system ratepayers will incur, will directly shift       the burden to pay for these upgrades to local governments.       Under current law, if EPA determines that the benefits of a       proposed maximum contaminant level (MCL) do not justify the       costs of compliance, section 1412(b)(6) gives EPA the option,       following notice and opportunity for public comment, to       promulgate an MCL ``that maximizes health risk reduction       benefits at a cost that is justified by the benefits.''        The PFAS infrastructure grant program as proposed in H.R.       2467 includes the limitation of eligible treatment       technologies to those that are certified to remove ``all       detectable amounts'' of PFAS from water supplies is       admirable. We are concerned about this requirement, however,       since no technology is available today that can reliably meet       this standard.        As it pertains to the replacement of lead service lines,       there is language included in the grant authorization that       would require ``any recipient of funds . . . shall offer to       replace any privately owned portion of the lead service line       at no cost to the private owner.'' This language is       potentially problematic for several reasons. First, as the       water associations pointed out in their letter, the language       could be interpreted to require any water system that       receives any amount of program funds to permanently pay for       all future private-side lead service line replacement costs,       even after this federal grant assistance has been exhausted.       Second, we are also concerned that authorization does not       mean full appropriations at the levels necessary to replace       all private residences' lead service lines. Including this       language could potentially hamper local government long-term       efforts to develop a program to replace all lead service       lines. Finally, we are concerned that potential new EPA       testing and replacement rules will trigger lead pipe       replacement without the necessary Congressional funds. For       these reasons, we agree with the water associations'       recommendation--that the legislation should specify that       ``none of the funds made available'' through this program may       be spent in a manner inconsistent with conditions specified       by Congress.        Thank you for considering the local government perspective       as you move this legislation forward. We look forward to       working with you to address our nation's drinking water       needs. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to       contact our staff: Judy Sheahan (USCM) Carolyn Berndt (NLC)       or Adam Pugh (NACo).      Sincerely,      Tom Cochran,        CEO & Executive Director, The U.S. Conference of Mayors.      Clarence E. Anthony,        CEO & Executive Director, National League of Cities.      Matthew D. Chase,        CEO & Executive Director, National Association of Counties.                                   ____                                                       July 2, 2021.        Dear Members of the House of Representatives: We, the       undersigned organizations, strongly oppose H.R. 2467, the       ``PFAS Action Act.'' Our organizations are committed to       ensuring the safety of our employees and the communities       where we live and operate. This legislation would delay and       complicate contamination remediation issues.        Product safety provides the foundation of consumer trust,       and our members devote significant resources to achieve this       effort. Every member of the value chain has an important part       to play to ensure the products consumers use are safe and       sustainable. We remain committed to advancing effective,       science-based solutions to PFAS challenges.        This spring, we sent a letter to EPA Administrator Michael       Regan regarding possible designation of PFOA and PFOS as       hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental       Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). As stated       then, CERCLA is not an effective policy tool to fulfill the       goal of accelerating cleanup in communities.        Moreover, EPA has existing authority to meet the intent of       this legislation and should be provided the time, resources,       and flexibility to make its determination regarding how best       to address PFAS concerns. This approach should be made with       guidance from the new PFAS Council review process, consistent       with sound science and accepted principles for protecting       public health and the environment.        Finally, a bill of H.R. 2467's magnitude and complexity,       including the proposed sector-based wastewater effluent       guidelines, deserves the opportunity to be examined at length       in a committee setting. Many major stakeholders, including       EPA, the Department of Defense, other federal agencies and       states have all taken significant actions to address PFAS       since the last time we had a venue to discuss within a       committee.        We oppose the PFAS Action Act and ask that the House of       Representatives do so as  [[Page H3788]]       well. We stand ready to assist you throughout the legislative       process and engage on a better way to move forward on this       issue.            Sincerely.        American Chemistry Council, American Coatings Association,       American Council of Engineering Companies, American Forest &       Paper Association, American Fuel and Petrochemical       Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute, Flexible       Packaging Association, National Association of Chemical       Distributors, National Association of Printing Ink       Manufacturers, National Association for Surface Finishing,       Plastics Industry Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.                                   ____                                                      June 15, 2021.      Hon. Paul Tonko,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. David McKinley,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Environment and Climate           Change, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Tonko and Ranking Member McKinley: We, the       undersigned organizations, strongly oppose H.R. 2467, the       ``PFAS Action Act.'' Our organizations are committed to       ensuring the safety of our employees and the communities       where we live and operate. Product safety provides the       foundation of consumer trust, and our members devote       significant resources to achieve this effort. Every member of       the value chain has an important part to play to ensure the       products consumers use are safe and sustainable.        With these goals in mind, earlier this spring we sent a       letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan expressing our       concerns regarding possible designation of PFOA and PFOS as       hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental       Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). As stated       then, CERCLA is not an effective policy tool to fulfill the       goal of accelerating cleanup in communities and may delay       cleanups already in process.        EPA has existing authority to meet the intent of this       legislation and should be provided the time, resources, and       flexibility to make its determination whether and how to       address PFAS. This approach should be made under the new PFAS       Council, consistent with sound science, and to protect human       health and the environment.        Finally, a bill of H.R. 2467's magnitude and importance       deserves a hearing before going to markup. The subcommittee       has not held a hearing on PFAS for approximately two years.       Since that time, EPA, the Department of Defense, other       federal agencies, and the states have all taken significant       actions to address PFAS challenges. The subcommittee should       hear from those government agencies, the business community,       and other key stakeholders before members decide on the       proper scope and substance of any legislation. Moreover, the       committee has gained many new members who deserve an       opportunity to hear from such stakeholders before making       policy decisions.        We oppose the PFAS Action Act and ask the members of your       subcommitte to do so as well. We stand ready to assist you       throughout the legislative process.            Sincerely,        Agricultural Retailers Association, Airlines for America,       American Chemistry Council, American Coatings Association,       American Forest and Paper Association, American Fuel and       Petrochemical Manufacturers, American Petroleum Institute,       Flexible Packaging Association, National Cattlemen's Beef       Association, National Association of Chemical Distributors,       National Association of Manufacturers, National Association       for Surface Finishing, National Council of Textile       Organizations, National Electrical Manufacturers Association,       National Oilseed Processors Association, National Mining       Association, Plastics Industry Association, U.S. Chamber of       Commerce.                                time  1400    The amendments en bloc is a collection of 10 individual amendments.  In fact, some parts of it are indicative of the underlying bill. It is  provisions you don't need a bill to accomplish because EPA is already  doing them.   Other parts of this amendment highlight, for me, why the overall bill  should be opposed, and many do oppose it. Let me give you some  examples.   The amendments en bloc contains a provision that would create a  website at EPA containing household well water testing. Ironically, EPA  already has that website. For those interested, it is www.epa.gov/ privatewells.   Among its existing resources are items called for in these  amendments: PFAS testing, health effects discussion, and third-party  certification recommendations. Any other issues could be solved by  updating this website.   The amendments en bloc also doubles down on certain consumer product  problems the underlying bill creates and then kicks it up a notch. It  adds luggage, umbrellas, and food packaging materials to section 10's  expansion of a program never designed for articles and would force  significant changes and administrative effort.   It also requires every manufacturer or importer of a PFAS chemical in  the last 10 years to send a sample of it to EPA and to each State.  Notwithstanding that this could make EPA subject to hazardous waste  storage requirements under section 9, EPA is already compelling  comprehensive toxicity testing from the same people for the same  ultimate purpose under section 3 of the bill.   The amendments en bloc authorizes funding for things that appear to  be covered already. It increases the funding authorization in section 7  for grants by 600 percent. That is a hike before we even know how well  the program works or if the money is needed.   It also provides reimbursement to communities that installed  equipment to remove PFAS from drinking water when those upgrades were  made without expectation of Federal money.   The amendments en bloc creates, similar to lead, a Federal grant  program for PFAS testing at schools, drinking water filters, and  disposal efforts. But there is nothing to suggest PFAS enters drinking  water like lead, and the used filters are not protected from Superfund  liability if they are safely disposed.   I wish we would take the time to make the real reforms that would  improve this bill--amendments like the one offered by Mr. Bilirakis to  protect the bill from harming semiconductor production in the United  States of America. PFAS are essential to etching and cleaning  semiconductors, and we don't want this bill to prevent the formation of  a domestic supply chain in the United States of America.   I am also thinking about bipartisan amendments offered by Dr. Bucshon  and Mr. Schrader to protect PFAS used in FDA-approved drugs and  devices. Pediatric and adult heart patients have PFAS to thank for  stents and heart valves that keep them alive today.   Mr. Carter, too, had an amendment to save chlorine production from  extinction in this country. There are only three ways to make it:  mercury, which is being phased out; asbestos, which EPA has considered  banning; and PFAS. Coming out of a pandemic, killing chlorine should be  the last thing we are trying to do.   Mr. Crenshaw also had an amendment to protect the use of PFAS in  protective gear. Crime is surging in our cities. Now more than ever,  our police personnel and military should not be put in danger because  the chemicals necessary to keep them safe are a casualty of this bill.   These amendments were not made in order. The Congressional Budget  Office, CBO, score of H.R. 2467 was indeterminate, stating its  administration would cost the Federal Government $280 million, but it  is impossible to know how it impacts Federal spending.   No matter how well-intended or well-meaning this bill may be, its  impacts are broad, unknown, and depend on things Congress hasn't yet  established and must think through.   The amendments en bloc does not improve this bill, and I oppose it  and urge others to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
