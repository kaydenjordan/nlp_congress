 Mr. President, some studies have shown that upwards of 50  percent of people who have had COVID-19 will experience some form of  post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection PASC, 6 months after  infection, including neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, and  mental health symptoms. To date, there have been over 78 million cases  of COVID-19 in the United State and an untold number who were infected  but did not have access to testing to confirm their diagnosis. PASC,  commonly known as long COVID, is a growing public health crisis in this  country. I myself have experienced these symptoms and know firsthand  the importance of increasing our understanding of the causes and  possible treatments for long COVID. Given the disproportionate impact  of COVID-19 on communities of color, persons with disabilities,  seniors, and first responders, we must ensure that there is equity in  our work to address the needs of individuals with long COVID.   That is why Senators Markey, Duckworth, and I are introducing the  Comprehensive Access to Resources and Education for Long COVID Act, or  the CARE for Long COVID Act, legislation that would expand our  knowledge of the symptoms of long COVID, barriers to care, and  disparities in diagnosis and treatment. This bill would synthesize data  on patients' experience with long COVID, compiling information crucial  for further research and improved policy and treatment. Additionally,  this bill would encourage research and recommendations around the  health system's response to long COVID, with an emphasis on reducing  disparities in communities that have experienced disproportionate harm  during the pandemic. To ensure actionable research, this bill would  require dissemination of findings to healthcare providers, patients,  Federal Agencies, and other key stakeholders in a manner that is  accessible.   This bill would also ensure that adults and children with long COVID  have the resources they need to navigate workplaces and schools,  building on efforts by the Biden administration to recognize long COVID  as a disability. Specifically, this bill would facilitate interagency  coordination to educate the public on the impact of long COVID and the  rights associated with employment, disability status, and education for  individuals with long COVID. To ensure that individuals with long COVID  can access existing resources, this bill would fund grants for medical- legal partnerships and other collaborations between healthcare  providers, community-based organizations, and legal services.  Recipients would be able to use grant funds to support cooperative  efforts, provide technical assistance, or hire staff in order to help  individuals with long COVID access healthcare, social services, or  legal services.   Robust response to the long COVID crisis will continue our efforts to  address the equity and well-being of historically marginalized  communities. We cannot afford to let the needs of individuals with long  COVID go unmet any longer. I urge my colleagues to support the passage  of the CARE for Long COVID Act so that we can take necessary steps  towards meeting the needs of diverse communities with long COVID.                            ____________________     Mr. President, some studies have shown that upwards of 50  percent of people who have had COVID-19 will experience some form of  post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 infection PASC, 6 months after  infection, including neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, and  mental health symptoms.
