 Madam President, I rise today to salute a hometown hero, a  dedicated journalist, and a trusted newsman, Jim Taricani, who sadly  passed away last month after decades of contributions to Rhode Island  and the field of journalism throughout this country.   This is just an example of the tributes that he won by a very, very  enthusiastic population of Rhode Island. This is the front page of the  Providence Journal on the day of his funeral service.   He was a gentleman. He was a man of integrity, a man of fairness--the  qualities that define a great journalist. In fact, the words ``great  journalist'' and ``Jim Taricani'' are synonymous.   He leaves behind an extraordinary legacy. He was an award-winning  investigative journalist who earned multiple Emmys and the coveted  Edward R. Murrow Award, and he was a true champion of the First  Amendment.   Jim grew up in Connecticut and served the U.S. Air Force, where he  was stationed in Europe as a military police officer. But he made his  mark when he moved to Rhode Island and embarked on a career in  broadcast journalism, first in radio, and then over a 30-year career at  WJAR that spanned from the late 1970s through 2014.   Jim began his stint for NBC 10--WJAR--as a general assignment  reporter but gained notoriety for covering big stories and uncovering  the truth. He went on to found the station's investigative team in  1979.   He earned a reputation for taking on tough stories about organized  crime and political corruption. In reporting on these difficult topics,  Jim's own integrity, selflessness, and fairness shone through every day  and every moment.   Indeed, Jim didn't just talk about principles; he lived them. In  February 2001, Jim obtained an FBI surveillance video from a  confidential source. It showed a public employee accepting a bribe in  the famed Operation Plunder Dome case, which transfixed Rhode Island  and Providence, its capital, for many, many months. It marked a  significant moment when people could see and hear what corruption  looked like. Rather than following a court order to reveal the source  of the tape, Jim stood up for the First Amendment, and he was sentenced  to 6 months of home confinement.   Several of Jim's friends and colleagues wrote letters to the judge on  Jim's behalf, including Christiane Amanpour, who interned for Jim in  the early 1980s, when she was a student at URI.   She noted that Jim Taricani taught her ``that journalism when done  right is a noble profession, that America's unique commitment to  freedom of the press is vital to a functioning democracy, [and] that  holding public officials to account is the imperative of a corruption- free society.''   Indeed, that is what Jim set out to do through his reporting.   He became a strong advocate for other journalists, testifying before  Congress about freedom of the press and the challenges journalists face  in trying to keep the public informed about their government. His help,  his actions, and his activity spurred action. The Senate Judiciary  Committee advanced Senator Schumer's bipartisan media shield bill. But  the work to protect journalists, and to ensure that they can  responsibly do their job and inform the public, continues. We must find  a bipartisan way forward that balances freedom of the press and public  safety.   Jim was also a tremendous advocate for the American Heart  Association. A survivor of cardiovascular disease and multiple heart  attacks, Jim documented his own process of undergoing a heart  transplant, from uncertainty to recovery. Here is how the Providence  Journal's television critic described it:         Listed--the title refers to the word from doctors that       every heart transplant candidate longs to hear--is the most       powerful human interest story I have ever seen on local       television. It is courageous first-person journalism, a story       that you may never forget.    Taricani, who kept a diary throughout his hospital stay, wanted to  have his experience videotaped in order to produce a donor awareness  video for the American Heart Association. It was never his intention to  broadcast the account, but when the news director, Dan Salamone,  suggested it would reach a broader audience if televised, Taricani  agreed.   That was Jim. He was not looking to be the story but was willing to  share his story if it could help others. Thoughtful, tenacious, and  tough--that was Jim Taricani. By the way, 32 days after receiving his  new heart, Jim was back at work, which tells you everything you need to  know about how passionate he was about journalism and how much he loved  his job.   Undoubtedly, the love of his life was his wife, Laurie White, who is  a force in her own right and has taken up Jim's cause of freedom of the  press and encouraging the next generation of aspiring young journalists  to go out and make a difference. She has endowed a lecture series on  First Amendment rights at the University of Rhode Island in Jim's  honor, which is a fitting tribute.   She said:         Journalists bring sunlight to the stories that otherwise       may stay hidden in the shadows. It is my hope that this       lecture series will continue his legacy of inspiring the next       generation of ethical and responsible journalists.    I expect the series will help increase public understanding of the  importance of a free press and the First Amendment for decades to come.   As a journalist and as a person, nothing stopped Jim from following  the facts, uncovering the truth, sharing important stories, and  enlightening his audience. We are all, in Rhode Island and across the  country, deeply saddened by the loss of Jim Taricani, but his example  and legacy endure. That legacy will sustain us and inspire us to  continue working together to build a just and decent country, and for  that we are all grateful to Jim.   Madam President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from  Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
