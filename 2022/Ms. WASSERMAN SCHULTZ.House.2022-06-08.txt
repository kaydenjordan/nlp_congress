 Madam Speaker, I rise to confront the Nation's  leading child killer: gun violence.   Passing the Protecting Our Kids Act does that by raising the legal  age to buy certain semiautomatic rifles and closing the ghost gun  loophole. It strengthens safe storage rules at home and clamps down on  bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.   Once more, House Democrats will do something meaningful to address  this carnage while House Republicans do nothing. Yes, a few Senate  Republicans may do the absolute minimum, but when an 11-year-old tells  Congress that she smeared her murdered friend's blood on her own body  to play dead and stay alive in Uvalde, I will take baby steps over no  steps.  [[Page H5382]]    From Uvalde and Buffalo to Parkland, Orlando, and Las Vegas, America  is bleeding. While this legislation will not end gun violence, it is a  tourniquet.   The deaths, suicides, and astronomical health costs are too high, and  we cannot continue to forsake our national freedoms to learn, work, and  worship without fear.   Let's pass this legislation and reclaim America's values and confront  this Nation's leading killer of children: gun violence.
