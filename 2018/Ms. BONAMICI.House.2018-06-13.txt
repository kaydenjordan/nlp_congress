 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5889, which would help reduce  childhood trauma by requiring the Department of Health and Human  Services to provide information and technical assistance to early  childhood professionals about the best ways to help treat children  struggling with trauma related to substance abuse exposure. Children  exposed to adverse childhood experiences, or ACEs, are more likely to  suffer from substance use disorder later in life. We can save money and  lives by better supporting these children.   I recently held a listening tour throughout northwest Oregon to  better understand how opioids are devastating our communities and to  identify and discuss the tools we need to combat this epidemic. I heard  from healthcare professionals, families who lost loved ones,  individuals in recovery, and community leaders, who all called for  greater Federal investment to fight back against opioids. One of the  discussions I convened focuses specifically on the needs of children  and how we can better support them to succeed both in the classroom and  in life.   Busy educators and other early childhood professionals now often find  themselves serving as first responders to a growing crisis. Some  schools in my home State of Oregon are adopting a trauma-informed care  approach to better support affected students.   For instance, Warrenton Grade School, which I recently visited, is a  shining example. They are deliberately building a ``culture of care''  that focuses on meeting the emotional needs of children hand-in-hand  with their academic growth.                                time  1500    Schools and especially school-based health centers are already facing  budget shortages and urgently need additional resources for prevention  programs and for screening.   I encourage my colleagues to support the passage of this legislation,  but this bill will not be effective if we don't invest in comprehensive  supports for young children and their parents.   Traumatic events during childhood often trigger substance abuse later  in  [[Page H5125]]  life. It is vital that we support early learning initiatives to provide  children the comprehensive support they need, including programs like  Head Start and home visiting programs.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Brat and Congressman  O'Halleran for their work on this legislation. I know they care a lot  about this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran), a cosponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to thank Congressman  Brat and Congressman O'Halleran for their work on this important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its passage, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5890. The most recent omnibus  legislation increased funding for the Child Abuse Prevention and  Treatment Act, or CAPTA, by $60 million, and this bill would help  States improve their support for infants, children, and families  suffering from the opioid epidemic by requiring Health and Human  Services to provide guidance to States on how to implement effective  plans of safe care.   Pregnant women and young mothers can face seemingly insurmountable  challenges when struggling with addiction. I think about Tiffany, whom  I met in Oregon. She is from Happy Valley, Oregon, and her struggle  with addiction began after she was prescribed medication following a C- section for her third child's birth.   After having to send her kids to live with her mom, she was finally  able to access treatment and other support services. She is now clean,  in recovery, able to care for her kids again, and, importantly, help  others.   We must do everything we can to support moms like Tiffany and provide  the necessary resources and care to parents and their children so they  can have the opportunity to be reunited.   Although I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, it  is important to note that CAPTA, even with the $60 million increase, is  not fully funded. Only when CAPTA receives the full amount authorized  under law will States be able to meet all requirements and adequately  address the needs of children exposed to substance abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Garrett and  Congresswoman Murphy, for their work on this important legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy), who is a cosponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage my colleagues to support  this important legislation. I want to thank Congressman Garrett and  Congresswoman Murphy for their work on the legislation. I also want to  thank Chairwoman Foxx for reminding us that we are not just talking  about abstract policy. We are talking about real people: men, women,  and especially children who are affected by this crisis.   So, again, thank you to the cosponsors of the legislation. I urge its  passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5891, which would establish an  interagency task force to identify, evaluate, and recommend ways in  which Federal agencies can better coordinate responses to the opioid  epidemic and carry out their authorized duties.   Many factors have contributed to this crisis, and it will take  significant efforts to overcome it. Throughout my listening tour around  northwest Oregon to discuss the opioid crisis, it became abundantly  clear that local, State, and Federal officials must work together to  address this epidemic and stem the loss of lives.   As I previously mentioned, I heard from numerous providers,  individuals in recovery, families who lost loved ones, teachers,  community leaders, all who called for greater Federal investment to  fight back against opioids and more assistance for State and local  entities that are working on the front lines.   Because of the breadth of programs required to assist families, any  government effort to address substance use disorder and the opioid  crisis must be a coordinated and collaborative approach across  agencies. I am hopeful that this interagency task force will result in  a more collaborative plan of action to address the many issues facing  my constituents and the other people across this country.   I am, however, concerned that a plan of action without the necessary  funding to carry out the recommendations will remain just a plan. So I  urge my colleagues to support providing sufficient resources to  implement these solutions.   I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Grothman and Congressman  Lamb, for their work on this legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb), who I know is very concerned  about this issue as well.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, want to thank Congressman  Grothman and Congressman Lamb on this important legislation and  emphasize again, that once we get the report from this task force, we  need to have the funding--the resources, the money--to implement its  recommendations to make sure that it really helps the people we are  serving. So, again, I thank them for their work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5892.   In addition to the severe health consequences of substance use  disorders, the opioid epidemic has taken a serious toll on the  workplace. More than 10 million full-time workers have a substance use  disorder. A 2017 survey from the National Safety Council found that 70  percent of employers have seen some effect of prescription drug usage,  including absenteeism, impaired or decreased job performance, injuries  or near misses, and arrests on or off the job.   When I traveled across northwest Oregon to talk to community members  about the opioid crisis, I heard from many employers and employees  whose work had been affected by addiction. Oregon's low unemployment  rate is resulting in local employers struggling to find qualified  personnel. The opioid crisis has weakened our workforce at a time when  our economy needs more workers. For instance, a timber company on the  coast of Oregon reported that only one applicant passed a drug test  during a recent hiring process.   When I hear from people in recovery, many say that they could not  continue working while they were struggling with addiction. We must  acknowledge that our work and our personal lives are intertwined, that  an employer's interest in the health of its employees should not end at  the door, and that investing in employees through proactive prevention  or flexible support policies can be good for employees and for the  bottom line.   An estimated 20 percent of the decline in men's labor force  participation over the last 20 years can be attributed to the increase  in opioid prescriptions. For women, that number is 25 percent. Sadly,  the disease of addiction is affecting people far beyond their homes. If  we are going to make any progress in addressing the opioid epidemic,  our workplaces must have policies that support affected workers.   This legislation would establish a council to advise the Secretary of  Labor on actions the Department of Labor can take to provide  informational resources and guidance to address the effects of  substance use disorders on the workplace. The advisory council will be  comprised of a diverse coalition of stakeholders, including substance  use disorder experts, unions, and employers. This includes supporting  workers with substance use disorders, as well as those in recovery.   The advisory council would be charged with assessing a range of  workplace policies best practices. These identified best practices will  benefit employers and employees alike by keeping workers safe, healthy,  productive, and on the job.   I also urge my colleagues to support legislation for other workplace  policies and protections that are vital for people struggling with  substance use disorder, such as paid leave. There is certainly more  that we, as policymakers, can do to make sure that workers can access  and seek treatment when they need it, and be able to return to their  jobs as soon as possible.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Lewis and Congressman Cartwright  for their work on this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), the cosponsor of this  important legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.   Madam Speaker, once again, I thank Congressman Lewis and Congressman  Cartwright for their work on H.R. 5892. As we continue with this work,  we must recognize that it is much harder for people to be successful in  their recovery if they do not have a job. Let's work with our employers  and look at the results of this bill that the advisory council will  advise us. Let's follow their recommendations.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1091, as amended, the  Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act.   This bill will provide support to the millions of grandparents and  other older caregivers across the country who are raising children. As  my colleague, Mr. Lewis, mentioned, more than 2.5 million grandparents  are raising their grandchildren across the Nation today.   Child welfare experts agree that substance use disorders, especially  addiction to opioids, are behind much of the growing number of  grandparents raising their grandchildren.   Raising grandchildren can dramatically alter the lives of these  grandparents, who can sometimes be overwhelmed by the unique challenges  they face as they adapt to their new roles and responsibilities.   The Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act would create an  advisory council charged with identifying best practices, resources,  and other tools to help grandparents and other older caregivers address  common challenges when raising children. This might include how to  navigate a school system or access healthcare.   This information is vital and will prove to be lifesaving to  grandparents striving to care both for themselves and for their  families.   Madam Speaker, I thank Senator Susan Collins and Senator Bob Casey  for their work on this bill, and I thank Congressman McGovern,  Congressman King, and Congressman Lewis for their leadership in the  House.   This bipartisan, bicameral effort is a testament to the importance of  this growing and important issue. I urge my colleagues to support S.  1091.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the cosponsor of this  House legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, again, I support this legislation, the Supporting  Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act, and other efforts of my  colleagues to address the opioid crisis, but these policies will only  be a drop in the bucket if the administration continues undermining  access to affordable, comprehensive healthcare that includes robust  Affordable Care Act protections for preexisting conditions like  substance use disorder.   If we are to stem the tide of this epidemic, Medicare, Medicaid, and  private insurers must fully cover addiction treatment and safer  alternatives to opioids for pain.   One thing is clear: Changing policy alone won't stop this crisis. We  also need more resources for prevention, treatment, and innovative  solutions.   The urgent need for more funding is wide and varied. Prevention  programs need to be able to reach more people. Researchers need  additional funding to gather data that will drive effective solutions.  Overstretched public health departments need to be able to coordinate a  comprehensive response. Treatment facilities need more beds and more  staff. Healthcare providers need further education and training.   We must increase the resources to match the scale of this problem,  this crisis, and focus on making smart investments to adequately  address the opioid crisis.   Madam Speaker, once again, I thank Senators Collins and Casey, as  well as Congressmen McGovern and King, for their work on this  legislation, and I urge its passage.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
