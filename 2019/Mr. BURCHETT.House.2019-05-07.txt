 Mr. Speaker, I salute you for your salute to the  Tennessee Big Orange with your tie selection.   I also rise today to recognize Weigel's Farm Stores, an east  Tennessee-based convenience store chain, for its dedication to selling  Tennessee products. Recently, Weigel's announced that it would sell  milk only produced, processed, and bottled within the State.   In 1931, the Weigel family began operating a dairy. Over decades, the  family business expanded from farming to owning and operating 67 stores  in the region. I remember the square jugs of Weigel's milk that became  iconic in the Knoxville area.   Although they no longer produce their own milk, their commitment to  Tennessee dairy products has remained constant. Independently owned  dairies have long been an important part of east Tennessee's economy,  but recently, these operations have struggled to compete with the  larger farms.   I am glad that Bill Weigel, a good friend of my family's and the  current owner of the business, and his family are investing in our  local products and family farms, and I hope their decision will inspire  other milk processors in the area to do the same.                            ____________________
