 Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot today about  discrimination against the LGBTQ community and them being kicked out of  housing or whatever. No one wants that.   But my question, Madam Speaker, to my friends on the other side was:  Would they also agree that no one who disagrees with their views should  be kicked out of their homes or lose their job?   Should adoption agencies not be allowed to continue operating if they  don't believe in that?   Should houses of worship close because they continue teaching the  traditional biblical values and principles of male and female?   And I would suspect the answer would be no; that they should be  fired, they should close, because the bill itself clearly states that  religious rights and freedoms are not protected in this bill. And that  is what is so dangerous.   This is a bill of tyranny, where government is telling people what  they must believe and punishing them if they do not believe and do not  conform. This is a dangerous bill. It codifies in itself  discrimination.    I appreciate the gentleman's leadership on this  and he's a very dear friend from Texas. And I am grateful.   Listen, I don't know that there are many issues that are much more  significant, if any more significant, than what we are watching unfold  in our society these days, with the cancel culture movement. And the  gentleman brought up so many great examples. Everyone certainly, I  believe, probably everyone on this side of the aisle has experienced  this cancel culture in one degree or another, and it is, frankly, not a  new thing. It started quite some time back.   But certainly, it has built to the point of enormous momentum now to  the point of literally destroying lives, destroying businesses,  destroying careers, and that is what is disturbing to me.   And I would just go on to say that this cancel culture--two main  points that I just want to bring up, and I would love to have a bit of  dialogue with the gentleman on this.   But number one is: What is underneath it? What is causing it? What is  the purpose? What is the motive behind cancel culture?   I don't think we need to just deal with the results of it, but what  is behind it. And I would suggest that it is a lust for power. And, as  a result, there is an attempt to intimidate, an attempt to cancel, an  attempt to threaten, and it is also that I am king of the hill and you  are not.   There is this desire for power behind the cancel culture movement,  and I believe that is a significant issue, and I would like to hear the  gentleman's thoughts on that, and then I will come  [[Page H707]]  back to another thought that I have and bounce that off you as well    Absolutely. That is extremely well said and very  potent in the way you presented that. And it has come to the point,  even in just the last couple of days, I had a woman face to face I was  speaking with about this, and she was hesitant to get involved in a  relatively small way in trying to make a stand in her local community.   And her words to me, I am afraid that if I do this, the FBI is going  to come knocking at my door. And she had received those kinds of  threats, those kind of whatever. She didn't go into details with me,  the specifics of what had brought her to that point.   But the realization to me is this cancel culture is like a cancer  that is now infiltrating our society and its tentacles are reaching,  they are far-reaching. And what contributes to part of this, I am  afraid, we are participating in right here in this Chamber.   And a quick example, we just passed the Equality Act. And I could not  help but think, while this is being passed, and even some questions I  had with it, sure, we don't want discrimination for anyone. This is the  land of the free. Everyone has rights.                                time  1915    But the bill itself specifically says there are no religious  exemptions to this, that RFRA does not apply, which means people who  have deeply held religious beliefs are going to be canceled from  participating in their routine life if they disagree with the premise  of this bill, and if they personally have convictions otherwise, that  is being forced upon them.   It is very concerning to me that we in this Chamber are actually  participating in throwing gas on the fire of this whole cancel culture,  even with legislation that is coming out of this body. I would like to  hear your thoughts on that.
