 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor a great friend of  mine, a true patriot in New Mexico, Representative Dianne Hamilton, who  passed away very recently at the age of 87 after serving for 18 years  in the New Mexico House.   Dianne was more than a representative. She was truly my mentor, a  colleague, a friend, and a person whom everyone looked up to and  aspired to be. When I say ``looked up to,'' she was over 6 feet tall.  She had an incredible personality; she was very quick-witted; and her  gift was public service.   She was a military wife, so working for our veterans was something  that she held very deeply in her heart. She also had an interest in the  people of the communities that she served. She opened up the first  domestic violence shelter, so this will be something that lives on in  her memory.   Mr. Speaker, to tell you the number of stories about her would take  up more than the time allotted today to share with you what an  inspiration she was.   What was very unique about Dianne was she was a radio host before she  got into the New Mexico House of Representatives. She had a knack for  making everybody feel important, whether they were a student who had  shown an animal at the local fair or if she was meeting with the  Governor or somebody beyond.   She was worthy of every award she was ever given, which were things  like the Governor's Award for Outstanding New Mexican Women. She was  given the Citizen of the Year from her respective counties.   The world needs more Dianne Hamiltons because, truly, her gift was  her heart. Her gift was helping people like me pioneer the way to  public service where we could learn from a true champion. We learned  how to work across the aisle, and we learned how to carry bills and  negotiate to get what we wanted.   She was an inspiration and will continue to be even after her life  because her family is beautiful. She was an inspiring mom, and she is a  woman of such great character.   I can't sit here and say enough about her because there just isn't  enough time to really give you, Mr. Speaker, all the aspects and all  the benefits of having somebody like Dianne Hamilton not only as a  friend but also someone who served and served with purpose.   Again, she pioneered the way for people like me to come up behind  her. She taught me how to do things, to make relationships happen, and  to be successful as now a U.S. Representative and before as a State  representative.   The world needs more Dianne Hamiltons. She was a patriot. She was a  mom who gave everything to her loving family. She was someone who gave  of herself to her community, to her peers, to her friends. Dianne  Hamilton is truly a woman's woman, a person who I will dearly miss. I  know her family and her community will miss her as well.   And I just will always take with me the two biggest pieces of advice  she ever gave me. First, she said, never let anybody see you cry. Fight  for what you believe in and do it with all of the character and class  that you can.   And number two, never leave your house or your office without your  lipstick. Those are the important things I will always remember.  [[Page H6919]]    I am forever indebted to her, her family, and we will miss her.                            ____________________
