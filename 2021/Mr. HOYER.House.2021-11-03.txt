 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and I thank  him for his support. I want to thank the chairman of the committee as  well for his agreeing to have this come to the floor, and I look  forward to his support.   I want to say, Mr. Speaker, I have talked to a lot of Members about  this. The policies that we have regarding Cuba are subject to debate  and subject to differences. While I think, Mr. Speaker, there are no  differences--there are--in this Congress, that we are all for  supporting those who seek democracy and who seek the benefits of  freedom and who seek the welfare of their families associated with that  freedom. I don't think there is a single Member who wasn't appalled by  the way peaceful protesters in Cuba were brutally suppressed in July.                                time  1430    I doubt there is anyone here who is not concerned that such actions  will be repeated this month when the next protests are scheduled to  occur. So this is a very timely resolution because it anticipates that  there will be another group of people who will have the courage to  stand up and to speak up on behalf of freedom in their country.   There was a resolution passed by the United States Senate on August  3, 2021, although it doesn't exactly mirror our resolution. Frankly,  our resolution is somewhat less specific in terms of criticism and in  terms of policy.   Why? Because we wanted this to be about human rights. We wanted it to  be about people who stand up for freedom. We wanted it to be another  statement of the thousands that we have made in countries throughout  this globe that suppress the rights of people and that imprison people  because they try to express their views. But this resolution that was  passed in the Senate was sponsored by my counterpart, the majority  whip, Mr. Durbin; by Mr. Kaine from Virginia; Mr. Schatz from Hawaii;  Mr. Coons from Delaware; Mr. Booker from New Jersey; Ms. Cortez Masto  from Nevada; Mr. Brown from Ohio; Mr. Padilla from California; Mr.  Warner from Virginia; Mr. Cardin from my own State of Maryland; Ms.  Rosen from Nevada; Mr. Warnock from Georgia; Mr. Lujan from New Mexico,  our former chair of the campaign committee; and Ms. Hassan from New  Hampshire; along with many Republicans. My point is that this was a  unanimous consent, so everybody was for it.   The vote we take on this resolution is a simple one. The text of the  resolution is clear. It states that this House--all of us--stands in  solidarity with Cubans seeking to express themselves and seek a redress  of grievances from their leaders. It affirms that the Cuban people  ought to be able to enjoy the same access to information and the  internet as Americans and other free people do around the world. And it  urges the Biden administration to find ways to promote freedom, human  rights, and access to basic needs in Cuba.   I believe that these are goals we can support overwhelmingly. I  understand that some Members believe that the text of this resolution  does not include items on policy that they would like to have. I  certainly think that is a legitimate concern, and there is no reason  why we cannot have resolutions that speak to that. But this is  singularly focused on the rights of people.   John Kennedy said that we will bear any burden to defend any peoples  who essentially seek freedom. That is what this resolution does. It is  simple and straightforward.   I have supported many of these policies as chairman of the Commission  on Human Rights and the Helsinki Commission, where resolution after  resolution said to Soviet satellites that the Helsinki signature of the  Russians on that document demanded that they observe the human rights  of those folks. This is a similar resolution.   I hope all Members would share my view that a strong, bipartisan, and  united vote by this House will send a message to the people of Cuba  that they are not alone, that the American people stand with those who  speak out in peaceful protest, and that Democrats and Republicans stand  together and in support of the freedoms they seek.   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting this resolution. I hope that the valid concerns and  differences Members have on both sides of the aisle when it comes to  Cuba will not preclude us from agreeing that we ought to stand in  solidarity with those who are seeking the same rights that we enjoy in  this extraordinary country in which we live. That is why I will be  voting an enthusiastic and strong ``yes'' on this resolution.
