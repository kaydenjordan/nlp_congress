 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague from Texas  seeking to make this better, but I am going to have to oppose this  amendment. It is confusing, unnecessary, and  [[Page H1476]]  overly restrictive on agencies. This amendment would create a single  definition of three different words: propaganda, publicity, and  advocacy. Those are different words. Under this amendment, publicity,  advocacy, and propaganda would mean making a statement not widely  accepted by the scientific community. Are we going to create a test of  two out of three dentists agree? It is going to be difficult to do. I  mean, it could be anything. Is it propaganda for me to say I love my  wife? I only know a couple of scientists, there is not going to be a  broad, general consensus in the scientific community about that, but it  is certainly not propaganda. It is a statement of my feeling.   Publicity and propaganda and advocacy are different words. They don't  mean the same thing, and they certainly don't have the definition my  friend from Texas is suggesting. Check out the dictionary. You can do  it on your smartphone. These definitions that are proposed in this  amendment are unworkable. I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have no doubt that my good friend  from Texas loves his wife. I would also suggest to him that there might  be a number of individuals who are experts that would be able to  confirm that, certainly those who are around him, and they might be  able to say that that is not propaganda or publicity, and, therefore,  his statement stands.   But when you are talking about thousands upon thousands of executive  agency staff, servants of the United States Government wanting to do  what is right, and you come down with this massive, oppressive document  that says here is what you have to do, but don't do propaganda and  don't do publicity, there should be a determination or a standard that  says if it is based in fact, you have no problem, that is information  that you can disseminate in order to edify those who may be wanting to  comment by edifying the particular regulatory scheme or structure that  you are putting forward for comment.   Why should my friends on the other side be afraid of good, strong  information to make the input valuable so that if I am dealing with a  clean air regulation that I am able to hear from those who are for and  against, but I can provide documentation, scientific documentation  about the quality of air pollution, why this regulatory scheme is  appropriate. I ask my colleagues, again, to support the Jackson Lee  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I come back to the purpose of this  bill: we want our regulatory agencies to be neutral. They propose a  rule, they have done the research, and they have done the science. They  wouldn't be proposing it if they didn't believe that it needed to be  done. Where they crossed the line is using taxpayer money to go out and  promote and advocate for it. The idea behind public comments, the whole  thought behind public input is to get a diversity of ideas, but, if the  solicitations seeking that comment are biased, or if the agency is  advocating it, it potentially suppresses the other side. We want to get  both sides of the matter.   Let's look at the actual definition of propaganda. I googled it while  Ms. Jackson Lee was just speaking. Propaganda is information,  especially of a biased or misleading nature used to promote a  particular cause or point of view. Advocacy is another one that has a  definition. It is public statements for or a recommendation of a  particular cause or policy. So those definitions basically say you are  pushing a point of view. We don't want to limit those.   The definition and the purpose behind this legislation is to make our  agencies fair about seeking comment and fair about listening to those  comments. We don't want the agencies going into this with preconceived  notions and advocating it. We want the public comment to work the way  the public comment is supposed to work. The scientific community,  whether they are for it or against it, can weigh in in those public  comments, and the public and the agency will know what their consensus  is based on the fair comments fairly solicited. So again, I urge  opposition to this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. How much time is remaining on both sides?   The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 30 seconds remaining. The  gentleman from Texas has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me say to the gentleman that what  we are suggesting is that propaganda can be confusing. I want truth and  honesty, and I want our agencies to be able to reach out and to help  the American people. Therefore, my amendment says that if by chance  they say something but it has facts or empirical evidence, it is not  propaganda, it is not publicity, they can go forward and protect our  water, they can protect our health, they can protect our air. Why are  we hiding on this floor?   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. It only  makes this bill more refined as to how we can help the American people  pass a regulatory scheme that enhances local communities and cities.  That is why we need the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, the purpose of the  underlying legislation here is to make sure we have a fair process and  the Federal Government isn't pushing a point of view, it is listening  to all sides. This amendment takes that away. For that reason, I urge  opposition.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on  the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed.                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Farenthold    The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hultgren). It is now in order to consider  amendment No. 2 printed in part A of House Report 115-21.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer), I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 4, line 24, strike ``; and'' and insert a semicolon.        Page 5, line 2, strike the period at the end and insert ``;       and''.        Page 5, after line 2, insert the following new clause:        ``(v) if applicable, a list of agency regulatory actions       issued by the Executive agency, or any other Executive       agency, that duplicate or overlap with the agency regulatory       action.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 156, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, this is a simple transparency measure  that adds a disclosure requirement under the underlying bill.  Understanding which regulations are duplicative or overlapping allows  the public to be better informed as they participate in the rulemaking  process. We want to know what is going on as members of the public. Too  many times agencies develop regulations without consideration or  coordination with other Federal agencies, State and local governments,  or, in some cases, even the public. They issue proposed rules that are  unnecessary, duplicative, or overcomplicated.   This simple amendment helps draw the public's attention to potential  areas of concern while the rule is still in the proposed phase of  rulemaking. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think my colleague across the aisle  actually makes the case for me. The executive branch already requires  that this work be done by the agencies.   Leaving behind the constitutional authority of this body to direct  that happen in the nature of executive orders that can be changed by  the next executive, this actually codifies a good part of the executive  order that is already in place, so the agencies wouldn't have to do any  work.   What this does add, however, to that executive order and why it is so  important is it adds a transparency requirement. An agency is required  to look to see what regulations are out there that may be duplicative  under the executive order. This requires them to tell us about it. Why  would they want to hide from the American people that they are creating  a duplicative regulation?   This is a simple transparency amendment that improves the quality of  the underlying bill, improves the amount of information accessible to  the public, and holds executive branch agencies accountable to make  sure they are not putting unnecessary and duplicative burdens on the  American people.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we are simply codifying an executive  order here, as the gentleman pointed out, but we are adding one more  thing. We are adding transparency to it so the American people know  what these alphabet soups of government agencies are up to and give us,  as watchdogs in Congress, or private organizations or a member of the  public with internet access the ability to see how the CFR is expanding  and expanding with more and more duplicative Federal rules.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is unnecessary and  confusing. As I am sure my colleague from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee)  knows, the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.   The First Amendment applies to everybody in this country. We couldn't  write a law that infringes upon the First Amendment and have it  withstand scrutiny by the Supreme Court or under the Constitution, and  I certainly wouldn't support a law that did this.   The underlying legislation is designed to stop public agencies from  using your taxpayer dollars and my taxpayer dollars for promoting one  side of an issue. It is not designed to chill any Federal employees of  First Amendment rights.   In fact, the Supreme Court, in 1994, in Waters v. Churchill, held  that public employees do have a right to free speech. We are not going  to be leaning over people's necks seeing what they are putting on their  personal Twitter accounts, but we are going to say that, if you are a  government agency spending taxpayer dollars to promote a point of view  on something before your agency, that is a no-no. That is what this  underlying legislation does.   Ms. Jackson Lee's amendment is simply unnecessary because we can't  suppress the First Amendment rights even if we want to. And we do not-- I say do not--ever want to violate the Constitution and interfere with  people's First Amendment rights. And, listen, I agree with the  underlying intent of my colleague's amendment. Simply, we can't do it.   Unfortunately, this amendment is not only unnecessary, it could be  harmful. If we say First Amendment protections apply in this law, are  we going to have to go out and in every law we pass, put in something  that says the First Amendment applies? Come on. We already know the  First Amendment applies because the Constitution is the supreme law of  the land.   So it creates unnecessary confusion that could ultimately harm  people's  [[Page H1479]]  First Amendment rights. Can you see the lawsuits? Well, Congress didn't  say in there it protected my First Amendment right. So we would have to  go and rewrite every law on the books.   The Constitution is there and it works. It is an unnecessary  amendment. So I hope my clarification that the First Amendment applies  assuages the concerns of the gentlewoman from Texas and she withdraws  the amendment. If she doesn't, however, I am going to have to oppose it  as unnecessary and potentially confusing to the entire body of law of  this country.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?   The ACTING CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Well, let me say this.   Mr. Chair, first of all, before I yield to the gentleman from the  great State of Maryland, the reason why we need my amendment is because  this deals with speech. This regulatory bill deals with speech, what  you can say and what you cannot say.   So this is not a reflection that we need this in every legislative  initiative. I would love for it to be there. But this is a bill that  deals with what our agencies can say. And if the Chairman of the FCC  put out all of these proposals specifically so that the public could  see, just think if this bill unclarified what the protection of the  First Amendment reiterated, his speech would be chilled.   I am delighted to yield 30 seconds to the distinguished gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    I would just like to point out that Commissioner  Pai's release of that information would not be prohibited under this  bill. It is not advocacy. It is releasing facts. So it would not be  prohibited.   Again, the First Amendment already applies to every law that we make  in this body and every law we have made. The Constitution trumps what  we do here.   So, with that, I continue to argue that this amendment is unnecessary  and potentially confusing, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Again, Mr. Chair, can the Chair tell us the time  remaining.   The ACTING CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1\1/4\ minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, let me indicate that the gentleman just  argued my point. Clarity is what we need. My amendment provides  clarity.   Again, what does this bill do? This bill tells Federal employees  about their speech: what level of speech, containing speech, how much  speech, what they can say, what is propaganda, what is publicity.  Therefore, I think it is important to avoid the chilling effect on  public servants who are doing the task on behalf of the American  people.   Being the American people's defendant, I believe that we should, in  fact, have this language. In Branzburg v. Hayes, Justice Douglas  reminded us that an effective self-government cannot succeed unless the  people are immersed in a steady, robust, unimpeded, and uncensored flow  of opinion and reporting which are continuously subjected to critique,  rebuttal, and reexamination. That is the protection of the First  Amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think the utmost clarity is in the First  Amendment. I am going to read it here.   ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of  speech, or of the press, or the right of the people to peaceably  assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.''                                time  1015    That applies to everything we do, every law we make. This amendment  is unnecessary, and I urge opposition.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Let me reemphasize: Clarity in the First Amendment cannot be a bad  thing. This bill kills speech. Let's clarify that that speech is  protected by the First Amendment to not chill the hard work of our  hardworking Federal employees trying to provide for the safety and  security of the American people.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, at the risk of sounding repetitious, the  First Amendment applies to all we do in this body. This amendment is  unnecessary.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will  be postponed.                       Announcement by the Acting Chair    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings  will now resume on those amendments printed in part A of House Report  115-21 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following  order:   Amendment No. 1 by Ms. Jackson Lee of Texas.   Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Farenthold of Texas.   Amendment No. 3 by Ms. Jackson Lee of Texas.   The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any  electronic vote after the first vote in this series.                  Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a  recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee) on which further proceedings were postponed and on  which the noes prevailed by voice vote.   The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.   The Clerk redesignated the amendment.                                Recorded Vote    The Acting CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded.

The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, as a great supporter of transparency,  this bill is designed to promote transparency in executive branch  agencies.   Unfortunately, I think the motion to recommit would actually be  violative of the Constitution. The President and the executive branch  agencies we are seeking to regulate under this law are creations of  Congress administered by the executive branch.   The Presidency is created by the Constitution, and it is my belief  that it would be unconstitutional to pass this motion to recommit. For  that reason alone, I urge my colleagues to oppose it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
