 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, one of the great nights in Washington, D.C., throughout  the whole Congressional year, is the night we do the Congressional  baseball game, where Democrats play Republicans at the Washington  Nationals Park. There are 5,000-10,000 people there--maybe more,  depending on the year--and it actually brings everybody together in  Washington, D.C., which, as many people know, is a unique night. Many  of the players at that game wear their local Minor League Baseball  uniform to represent their local community in Washington, D.C., at the  baseball game.   I have worn the Mahoning Valley Scrappers uniform there. The Mahoning  Valley Scrappers have been just outside of Youngstown, Ohio, in Niles,  Ohio, right by our mall, the Eastwood Mall at Eastwood Field, for 20  years. It is where young people and families can go watch professional  baseball. They can afford it. They can hang out. It is a 5- or 10- minute drive. It is an important component of our community.   So, of all the ups and downs of our economy in northeast Ohio over  the last 20 years, we have had baseball. And now Major League Baseball  is saying: We want to cut over 40 teams. And what we are saying here in  the United States Congress is: Congressman Bill Johnson, Republican-- who also represents part of the area--myself, and others, are coming  together to try to stop this from happening.   Young people in our area have been able to go to this field and watch  CC Sabathia, Francisco Lindor, Victor Martinez, Jose Ramirez--names  everybody knows in Major League Baseball, and when they were starting,  they played in Niles, Ohio.   So, we want to make sure that we prevent this from happening. We want  to save Minor League Baseball in communities all over the United  States.                                time  1230
