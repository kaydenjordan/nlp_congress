 Mr. President, my dear friend, Robert Clark  Penney, passed away on March 14, 2023. As we prepare to say our final  goodbyes at a memorial ceremony this coming weekend, I am among many  Alaskans who are reflecting on the legacy Bob created across our state  and especially along his beloved Kenai River.   Named Alaska's Ambassador for Sport Fishing by our State legislature  in 2017, Bob was known for his success in business and his tireless  advocacy of the iconic Kenai River watershed. But, like many Alaskans,  he started with humble roots in the lower 48. Bob was born in Portland  in 1932, where he showed his business acumen early. At the age of 10,  he and his sister Patsy were gifted a pony. While his sister was  gathering her friends for a free ride, Bob was on the next block with  the pony, selling rides for a dime apiece.   As he grew up, Bob played on the high school tennis team and worked  part-time after school hours. He also loved the outdoors, hunting birds  and fishing for salmon in the local rivers near Gresham, OR.   Bob answered the call to head north to Alaska in 1951, when the  lumber company he worked for expanded into what was then still a U.S.  Territory. When Bob was just 19, the company offered him the job of  managing their new Alaska prospect. Bob excelled there, but it was a  job he took at Wade Trailer sales in 1956 that inspired him to enter  real estate, where he would really make his mark.   After learning the ropes at Wade's, Bob opened Penney Trailer Sales  in 1959, selling mobile homes. Bob soon grew the business to include  RVs and housing for construction camps. In just a few short years, he  was the largest mobile home dealer in our new State. During that time,  Bob also began to invest in real estate and building development. He  built everything from single-family homes to massive commercial real  estate ventures spanning the west coast and Mexico. Through it all, Bob  always gave back, seemingly more by the year. His philosophy in both  life and business was to ``wear the other guy's shoes'' and ``always  leave a little bit for the next person.'' Bob served on the boards of  the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce, the Anchorage Economic Development  Corporation, and the Alaska Regional Hospital Board of Trustees. He was  a philanthropist, starting the Anchorage Mayor's Charity Ball, which  has now raised more than $4 million for charitable organizations in our  State's largest city.   When the oil industry started to boom in Alaska, Bob felt the State  needed greater community involvement to bring attention to this  opportunity and others like it. He formed the Organization for the  Management of Alaska's Resources--OMAR--later renamed the Resource  Development Council--RDC--and included many State leaders in the  effort. RDC is now Alaska's largest resource trade association-- encompassing the fishing, forestry, mining, oil and gas, and tourism  industries--and its advocacy remains critical to growing our economy  and reaching our potential as a state.   Bob also had a distinguished tenure as a member of the North Pacific  Fisheries Management Council. The federally chartered council is  critical to the sustainable management of Alaska's commercial  fisheries, one of the largest employers and economic drivers in our  State. Bob's service on the board contributed to the health and well- being of the largest fishery in America, but his true passion was the  conservation of the fishery of the Kenai River in southcentral Alaska.   Bob was always delighted by Kenai Chinooks, or ``Kings,'' the largest  salmon in the world. He loved to take friends and visitors out on the  river and the pictures of happy anglers and their catch of the day  adorned the walls of his riverfront home. Bob realized these fish are  an amazing resource for the State and for Alaskans, as more than half  our population can access the river by road in a matter of hours. Bob  knew that Alaskans could feed their families and fill their freezers  from this river in perpetuity if it was managed correctly.   So, in 1986, Bob founded the Kenai River Sportfishing Association.  Under his direction, the association grew into Alaska's premier  sportfish and fish  [[Page S3617]]  habitat conservation organization, helping to ensure the long-term  sustainability of the river.   Bob and two of his friends, Senator Ted Stevens and Bix Bonney,  utilized KRSA to start the Kenai River Classic, an invitational fishing  tournament held each August. The tournament has brought in elected  officials and industry leaders from across America, educating them  about the Kenai River and its needs. It has raised over $25 million for  conservation of the local watershed, enabling the rehabilitation of  critical fish spawning habitat, opportunities for youth, and better  access to the river for both subsistence and sportfishing.   ``Alaska's Sport Fish Ambassador'' was true to his name and title,  but family and friends were the driving force in his life. Bob met his  wife Jeannie in 1973 at a dinner party in Girdwood; they dated and got  married on New Year's Eve in 1974 on a sailing schooner in Kawela Bay  off Oahu. Since the vessel was ``just outside the limits,'' their  marriage license lists the latitude and longitude, instead.   Bob always had big ideas for Alaska. He couldn't walk through a room  without taking up one cause or other. He followed through, helping to  build our young State. But Bob was always happiest holding court at his  home, ``River Presence,'' on the Kenai, surrounded by his family and  friends.   Bob is survived by 4 grown children, 10 grandchildren, 7 great- grandchildren, and leaves a remarkable legacy, from economic  development to philanthropy, to world-class fishing on the Kenai River.  My family and I knew Bob for decades, were proud to call him our  friend, and are grateful for all he did to enrich our great  State.                            ____________________
