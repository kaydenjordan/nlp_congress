 Mr. Speaker, last month, the EPA  announced the new navigable waters rules that would replace the  disastrous waters of the U.S. proposal.   I strongly support this rule, which will finally restore the limits  of the Clean Water Act, providing farmers, ranchers, and landowners  true clarity on the law's reach.   To help bring more certainty to farm producers, I recently introduced  with my friend, Representative Collin Peterson, H.R. 5799, the Bridging  Responsible Agricultural Conservation Efforts Act of 2020, which  addresses wetland determinations under the Clean Water Act.   Under current law, EPA, Army Corps of Engineers, and USDA are tasked  with such determinations on farmlands. However, farmers have  experienced confusion and undue burdens for decades due to the  discoordination between the agencies when making such determinations.  This bill will foster cohesion between the agencies and clarify what  defines normal farming practices.   Modernizing modern farming practices and clearly defining converted  croplands will bring long-overdue certainty to this process.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, which is a win  for our Nation's farmers and ranchers.                            ____________________
