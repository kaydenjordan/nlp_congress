 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the millions of  Americans who are outraged as they witness mass shooting after mass  shooting, with no action from their government; the millions of  Americans who are struggling to make ends meet every day, while their  government hasn't raised the minimum wage in a decade, so they are  struggling more than ever; and, similarly, Americans who are fighting  for equality and civil rights while they see nothing being done in  Congress.   Every single week, this House passes legislation that is  overwhelmingly popular among Americans, yet not one of these bills has  seen the light of day because of the filibuster. It is truly a death  grip on our democracy.   The filibuster is being used by a handful of people to stifle  progress that Americans overwhelmingly want, progress that would ban  pay discrimination, progress that would protect our unions, progress  that would protect voters' rights, progress that would literally save  lives by passing commonsense gun reform.   It is past time we get rid of the filibuster as it is today. The  filibuster  [[Page H2035]]  should not take precedence over American lives.   I thank the gentleman who just spoke about our great bill that is  coming up because it is wonderful that all those ideas are in there, so  I am so glad we are on the same page.                            ____________________
