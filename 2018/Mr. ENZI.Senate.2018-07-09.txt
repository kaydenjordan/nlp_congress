 Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the  nomination of Mark Bennett to be a circuit judge for the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals.   Mr. Bennett has had a long legal career and has served as the  attorney general of Hawaii. My concerns lie not in his resume, but in  his public history of opposing constitutionally protected freedoms  essential to our way of life.   I have been and always will be a defender of the right of people to  keep and bear arms. Wyoming is a State full of law-abiding gun owners  who grow up learning to respect firearms and how to use them  responsibly. Folks use them for a variety of purposes, everything from  self-defense to hunting to work.   As Hawaii's attorney general, Mr. Bennet joined four other State  attorneys general in an amicus curie brief on behalf of the District of  Columbia in the Supreme Court case District of Columbia v. Heller. The  brief argued that the Second Amendment protects no individual right to  bear arms. This position worries me that he would not uphold Supreme  Court precedent on the Second Amendment.   At a time when so many critical issues are being litigated in our  courts, I cannot vote to confirm a nominee with a background of  opposing fundamental constitutional rights. Therefore, I must oppose  the nomination of Mr. Bennett.   Thank you.
