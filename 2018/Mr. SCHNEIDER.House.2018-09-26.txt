 Mr. Speaker, I have spoken before about how businesses  in my district, large and small, are suffering under the President's  tariffs that are raising costs and increasing uncertainty.   But the damage of the Trump administration's trade policy goes beyond  the business community. Here is one example. This week, I learned a  public middle school in my district has to dip into its contingency  funds to cover the $2 million in unbudgeted cost increases for its new  addition and remodeling project, caused by President Trump's tariffs.   Let me repeat that. This school or, more precisely, local taxpayers  now face $2 million in additional costs, not for new classrooms, but  rather to cover the extra costs of the President's trade war.   I have also heard from seniors in my district worried about tariffs  accelerating the cost of prescription drugs, including insulin,  antidepressants, MRI machines, artificial joints, and pacemakers, to  name just a few.   Put simply, President Trump's tariffs are not working for the  American people. It is time to instead end the misguided trade war and  enact sensible, enforceable trade policies that support American  workers, American businesses, American intellectual property, and our  environment.                            ____________________
