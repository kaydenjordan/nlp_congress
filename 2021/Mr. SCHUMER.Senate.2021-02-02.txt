 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Capitol attack on January 6 unleashed  many, many horrors, but it also revealed many heroes. One such hero was  Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, a New Jersey native, an Air  Force National Guard veteran, and a 12-year member of the Capitol  Police Force who tragically lost his life during the attack.   This evening, the body of Officer Sicknick will arrive at the  Capitol, and he will lie in honor beneath the Capitol Rotunda. We will  formally pay our respects to Officer Sicknick with a service on  Wednesday.   I join with my colleagues and members of the Capitol Police Force in  grieving the loss of one of their fellow officers. May his memory live  forever as a model of service to our Nation, selflessness in the line  of duty, and courage in the face of danger.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter entirely, the Senate,  this week, will continue confirming President Biden's Cabinet nominees,  closing the book today on the nomination of Alexander Mayorkas to be  the Secretary of Homeland Security.   Mr. Mayorkas's qualifications are unassailable. He is a 7-year  veteran of the DHS and has already been confirmed by this Chamber  three--three--times. Like most of President Biden's Cabinet nominees,  his nomination is also history-making: He will be the first Latino and  first immigrant to hold the top job at DHS. I look forward to  confirming Mr. Mayorkas today.   We have a second outstanding nominee to confirm today as well--Pete  Buttigieg for Secretary of Transportation. Mr. Buttigieg--known to many  simply as Mayor Pete--has demonstrated an impressive familiarity with  the entire Nation's transportation challenges--challenges that are  pronounced in States like my own, where projects like the Gateway  Tunnel are a top national priority.   I know that Mr. Buttigieg is committed to working with Members from  both sides to improve rail and transit, highways, and more in rural  communities, urban centers, and everywhere in between. I am excited to  call him Secretary Pete by the end of the day and get to work with him  immediately on helping the MTA--the Nation's largest transit network in  the country--and moving Gateway forward after years of cynical  obstruction by the Trump administration.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on COVID-19, even as we continue to  confirm President Biden's nominees, the Senate will turn this week to  the historic task of preparing a rescue package to lift our country out  of the depths of the awful COVID-19 pandemic and set our country back  on the path to normalcy. Despite the best efforts of Congress over the  past year, the needs in our country are still great and still urgent.   The disease has been with us for nearly a year, and yet this January  was officially the worst month to date. Nearly 100,000 Americans died  just in the last month. Unemployment insurance claims remain at nearly  1 million a week. Schools remain closed, businesses unvisited, and all  the familiar fixtures of daily life still remain on hold.   All of us in this Chamber are tired of seeing our constituents, our  friends, our family, our country suffer. It is time to meet the  challenges of the moment with boldness, with courage, and with urgency.   When Congress came together to pass an interim emergency relief bill  in December, we all knew the job was not complete. Economic experts and  the  [[Page S216]]  President-elect at the time called it an important downpayment because  that is what it was--a downpayment, not the final act. No one should be  surprised that the first legislative act of the new Democratic majority  is to build on that foundation and help the country defeat COVID-19  once and for all. So the Senate is going to move forward this week with  the process for producing the next bold rescue package.   Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi and I filed a joint budget resolution for  the 2021 fiscal year, totaling $1.9 trillion, which will give us  another legislative tool to pass a COVID relief bill quickly and  decisively. The Senate will vote to proceed on the budget resolution  this afternoon. Time is a luxury our country does not have.   Let me be very clear. We are not going to dilute, to dither, to  delay. We are not going to dilute, dither, or delay. The needs of the  American people are so demanding, we need to think big, and we need to  act quickly. The Senate must move forward today with the vote to begin  debate on the budget resolution, and I am optimistic that the motion to  proceed will pass.   I would say to my Republican colleagues that we want this important  work to be bipartisan. We welcome your ideas, your input, and your  revisions. We welcome cooperation. There is nothing about the process-- or a budget resolution or reconciliation, for that matter--that  forecloses the possibility of bipartisanship.   I would remind this Chamber that since 1980, the budget process has  been used 17 times--17 times--to pass serious bipartisan legislation.  This process is open to bipartisanship.   So let me be clear to my colleagues this morning. There will be a  bipartisan, open amendment process on the budget resolution this week.  Democrats eagerly encourage participation from both sides of the aisle  on this proposal. Again, there is nothing about the process itself that  prevents bipartisanship. What has made recent reconciliation efforts by  Senate Republicans so partisan was not the process but the legislation  they sought to pass.   The former Senate majority--I heard the Senator from Texas crying  crocodile tears about using reconciliation, but just a few years ago,  he was an active participant in using it twice to pursue expressly  partisan and deeply unpopular legislation--first, to repeal our  Nation's healthcare law and kick millions of Americans off of their  healthcare coverage, and second, to slash taxes for big corporations  and the wealthy to the tune of a $1.7 trillion bill and hole in our  deficit. Of course, Democrats opposed those efforts on the merits.   At the moment, however, we are talking about using the budget process  to help small business--something we all support. We are talking about  using the budget process to speed the production and distribution of a  vaccine that everyone champions and everyone knows is the key to ending  the crisis. We are talking about getting our country back on its feet  and our economy back on track.   We want this entire effort to be bipartisan. We do. But helping the  American people with the big, bold relief they need--that is job No. 1.  That is job No. 1, which is so, so important. So, again, we are not  going to dilute, dither, or delay because the demands of the American  people are so real and so large. We need to think big and think  quickly.   Helping millions of Americans who are still without work by extending  the enhanced unemployment benefits that are now slated to expire in  March. Helping parents waiting for the day their kids can finally go  back to school safely. Helping teachers, firefighters, busdrivers, and  other essential public employees at the State and local levels,  preventing them from the risk of layoffs. Helping restaurants and bars  and theaters, which were the first to close and may be the last to  open. Helping every American struggling to make ends meet, to pay the  rent, pay the mortgage, pay for groceries, keep up with that utility  bill, by sending them direct assistance in the form of a check. That is  job No. 1--helping the American people survive the toughest months of  this crisis while hastening the end of the crisis itself.   In the months to come, millions of Americans will be vaccinated, and  slowly but surely, life will return to normal once again. The rescue  plan proposed by President Biden--the rescue plan that we begin to work  on this week--will lay the foundation for our country's long-awaited  comeback, while giving Americans a helping hand to stay safe and stay  financially secure in the meantime.   I look forward to proceeding with this budget resolution and on the  work of making this historic and vital rescue package a reality so it  works for the American people   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, we all know of the crisis in America-- the greatest economic crisis in 75 years since the New Deal, the  greatest healthcare crisis in 100 years since the Spanish pandemic flu.  Americans are suffering and hurting, losing jobs, businesses closing,  can't feed their families, being evicted from their homes.   We are in a very, very difficult situation. We cannot afford to  dither, delay, or dilute. We need a big, bold package along the lines  of what President Biden has proposed, the American relief plan.   We hope our Republican colleagues will join us in offering  amendments. Of course, as you know, as the reconciliation process moves  forward, it is open to amendments and suggestions. We want it to be a  bipartisan proposal, but we also know that we must move forward with  the crisis in America. That is why today's vote is a very good vote,  because it sets us on the process of moving forward and solving this-- one of the greatest crises America has ever had.   I move to proceed to Calendar No. 4, S. Con. Res. 5, the concurrent  resolution on the budget.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 23.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 25, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9 a.m.,  Wednesday, February 3; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  upon the conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume  consideration of S. Con. Res. 5, with 31 hours remaining.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned,  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:21 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, February 3, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
