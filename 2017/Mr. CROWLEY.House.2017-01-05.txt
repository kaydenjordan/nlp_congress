 ``Every order, resolution, or vote to which the  concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary  (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the  President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect,  shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be  repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives,  according to  [[Page H103]]  the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.''    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.

The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 5, 2017, on page H174, the following appeared: (1)  COMMITTEE ON ETHICS.--Ms. Sanchez. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is  there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?  There was no objection. The resolution was agreed to.      The online version has been corrected to read: (1) COMMITTEE ON  ETHICS.--Ms. Sanchez. The resolution was agreed to.    ========================= END NOTE =========================                              ____________________
