 Mr. Speaker, I think all Americans and certainly Members  of Congress agree that we need to simplify our Tax Code, make it easier  for middle class families to get ahead and to stay ahead.  Unfortunately, what we know about the Republican tax plan, as the  details begin to leak out, go in a different direction.   This is a tax break, a big tax cut for billionaires at the expense of  working families. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a  family making $50,000 could see their tax bill increase by as much as  380 percent--less money to set aside for retirement, less money to set  aside for a child's education, less money to pay the bills that  families who struggle work hard every month to pay, in order to fund a  tax break for the wealthiest Americans.   5,400 families would get a $270 billion tax cut funded by increased  taxes on people who work hard every day just to make ends meet. Just  saying that this is tax relief for all Americans over and over again  does not make it true. The details actually matter.   This is a big tax break for the wealthiest Americans. People like the  Trumps and the DeVoses don't need more relief. We need to reject it.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, my friend, for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, this is a subject that I think we have a great deal of  experience on in this country. It is only a decade since the housing  crisis wreaked havoc, not just on individual families, but on whole  communities.                                time  1645    The notion that one of the available tools that we can deploy to deal  with the consequence of this sort of predatory activity by going right  at the source of that predation and require them to supply the  resources to offset the impact of that activity is something that we  really ought to think carefully about.   Mr. Chair, mortgage foreclosures wreck families, but also wreck  communities. We ought to use every tool we can to prevent them by  ensuring that individuals know and have access to the resources they  need in order to prevent this from happening again. The impact is  devastating, and we ought to do everything we can to prevent it from  happening again.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and  particularly for this thoughtful amendment. I am from Flint; born and  raised in Flint. I represent Flint. I was here on the floor and I was  the one pushing for the legislation that the gentleman on the other  side mentioned that provided $120 million to help offset the cost of  this terrible tragedy.   When I introduced the first legislation, we calculated what the total  direct and indirect cost was: $1.5 billion.   Now, here is the point: again, we ought not put a community like  Flint in the position of having to depend on this Congress to fully  fund the total cost of that recovery, or another community that might  be facing a similar situation.   If the gentleman is sincere that Congress can act to help offset the  incredible indirect costs that my home community is facing, then I  would suggest the gentleman join me in my effort to do just that. So  far, Congress has not done that.   The notion that we would exempt the people of Flint from access to  the resources that could be determined by a court as being part of the  justice that they deserve is not an act that we ought to engage in.   Flint, as sad as this case is, is not an anomaly. Flint is a warning,  and when we need to make sure we heed that warning.
