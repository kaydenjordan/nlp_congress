 Mr. President, today I wish to join the  Philadelphia community in renaming the 6000 block of Springfield Avenue  to Marcus J. Yates Way.   Thirty years ago, on July 18, 1988, a gun fight on this block took  the life of 5-year-old Marcus Yates. Marcus's death was a tragedy that  prompted Philadelphia residents to seek change in their community, and  while today's street dedication leaves us with a daily reminder of  Marcus's life, it also serves as a testament to the dedication of the  Yates family and those who stood alongside them, to ensure that his  death would not be in vain.   Marcus's killing served as the inspiration for efforts to better  protect the children of west Philadelphia. Neighbors looked to create  new, safer spaces for children, with residents setting up sports teams  and drama clubs. Following the incident, citizens also organized a  number of antidrug groups and held antidrug marches throughout the  city, citing the increase in drug trafficking as a cause for the  increase in gun violence in the community.   In 1990, the Yates family opened the Marcus J. Yates Home for  Children, housing over 30 foster children from the area. Since their  son's death, the Yates family has become advocates against gun  violence, seeking to prevent similar devastation from occurring  throughout the Nation. They have taken this effort from the municipal  level all the way to the Federal Government.   When people described Marcus, they often commented on his vibrant,  welcoming spirit. It is a tragedy that the community lost a bright soul  at such a young age. Through the efforts of Marcus's family and his  community, his legacy is one of advocacy and action. They have worked  tirelessly to ensure that his short life was not lost in vain.   The efforts of the West Philadelphia community, as well as the  resilience of the Yates family are examples for us all. Their actions  show us that with compassion and collaboration, tragedy can be a  driving force for positive change. We honor their efforts and their  persistence today on the anniversary of a life taken too soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise not even, I guess, 24 hours since  the news broke across the airwaves about what the President was saying  and what he was not saying in Helsinki with Vladimir Putin being just a  few feet away from him. That was a terrible moment for our country.   Yet, in the aftermath of that, folks came together from across the  country and from across all kinds of usual lines of division. Democrats  and Republicans came together to express both outrage at the insult but  also, I think, to express a sense of solidarity about the path  forward--that this moment of crisis in our national security has to be  met with bipartisan consensus. Thank goodness that has prevailed so  far. We have a long way to go, but that was a good moment for the  country after a very bad moment.   I am not here tonight to talk about that, but I want to point to it  as an example of the sides coming together on a big issue. I think  there have been other moments this year. At one point, when we passed  appropriations legislation, there was a strong investment in national  security and national defense but also investments in priorities like  education and healthcare and the opioid crisis and childcare and the  National Institutes of Health--on and on. Great investments for our  country will help us grow and make us stronger. The farm bill recently  passed the Senate. That was overwhelmingly bipartisan. So there have  been good moments.   I am afraid, on the Judiciary, we have had, unfortunately, the  opposite. Since I have been in the Senate--and as Senator Wyden  referred to earlier--I have had the privilege of working with  colleagues on nominations for the U.S. district court in Pennsylvania-- for the Eastern District, the Middle District, and the Western  District. It has been a collaborative process. Since 2011, in working  with Senator Toomey, even though we are on opposite sides of the aisle,  we have confirmed--I think it is--14 judges because we have  collaborated. There has been give-and-take, and there has been review  and scrutiny and then, ultimately, consensus in allowing a candidate to  go forward.   No Federal judge in those years would have gone forward without the  signing of the blue slip that has been referred to tonight by both  Senators. It happened in the past when there were two Republican  Senators, but now, with a split delegation, that tradition continues in  our State. It is a good tradition. It is the right way to do it.   That tradition prevailed until recently, when it came to appellate  court judges--in my case, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third  Circuit, which includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, and the  Virgin Islands. Even at the very end of the Obama administration, my  colleague from Pennsylvania objected and would not return a blue slip.  That nomination for the Third Circuit, at that time, did not go  forward. I respected the blue slip that my colleague decided not to  sign. The Obama administration respected it, and that nomination didn't  go forward. I didn't like it, but that is what the agreement was.    Now we are into this new world where, just recently, as our two  colleagues from Oregon are talking about  [[Page S5021]]  what has happened in the Ninth Circuit, which is in the northwestern  corner of our country, and in the Third Circuit, which is where I live  and where I work, we had a nomination go forward without a blue slip  that had been signed by me. My point of view was disregarded by both  the White House and the Senate Judiciary Committee in contravention of  years of tradition--and not tradition for the sake of tradition but of  practice because it allows you to arrive at a consensus pick that both  parties have to agree on.   That is not good for the Senate. It is not good for the judiciary. It  is, ultimately, not good for the American people because, if one party  has total control, as the Republican Party has now with both Houses of  Congress and the administration, you are going to get judges with only  one point of view. That leads me to my last point for the night, which  will take a few minutes, but I want to make sure this gets on the  record.   Another piece of bad news, in terms of the judiciary, unlike the  other good news about consensus in other areas of our work, is what has  happened under this administration with regard to the selection process  for the Supreme Court. This has never happened before when, during a  campaign, organizations--in this case, only two--come together and  present a list of names. That list of names is, in essence, a bargain  between a candidate and those groups. Then that is carried forward to  the administration. Now we have a list of just 25 names--25. The last  time we checked, there were about 700 Federal judges in the United  States of America. The President could pick any one of those Federal  judges. Many of them--I don't know how many--had been chosen by  Republican Presidents. Many of them are very conservative or  conservative, and some are moderates.   Apparently, the only way you get on that list is to be hard right.  You have to pass whatever tests are applied by the Heritage Foundation  and the Federalist Society. This list has been designed to do the  bidding of corporate special interests that are determined to handle  healthcare in a fashion that none of us would want it handled--by  giving the power back to insurance companies to make decisions on  healthcare. It is a corporate agenda that crushes unions or seeks to  crush unions. It represents working men and women and promotes policies  that, in my judgment, will leave the middle class further behind. So  any judge on this list, which I would argue is a corrupt bargain  between the advocate and those groups and now the President and those  groups, is fruit of a corrupt process.   Just by way of example, the Heritage Foundation is an extreme  rightwing organization. That organization just released a new proposal  to end protections for people with preexisting conditions, to gut  Medicaid for seniors, people with disabilities, and children. They  recently hosted a press conference for Republican attorneys general who  are trying to eliminate those protections through the courts. Just in  one State, Pennsylvania, more than 5.3 million people have preexisting  conditions. That is almost half the population of Pennsylvania. Those  5.3 million people include over 643,000 children who have preexisting  conditions.   The Heritage Foundation wants to take us back to those dark days in  which you could be denied treatment or coverage because of your having  a preexisting condition. I don't know many Pennsylvanians who want to  go back to those days, to turn back the clock in that fashion.   The Heritage Foundation also called labor unions cartels. Labor  unions, of course, helped to build the greatest middle class ever known  to man. In my State, from the formation of the first permanent  Pennsylvania local labor union in Philadelphia in 1792 to the Lattimer  massacre in Northeastern Pennsylvania, which is one county away from  me, to the Homestead strike in Western Pennsylvania--in all of those  struggles, Pennsylvania's workers have led the way to ensuring that  working people have basic rights, good wages, and of course benefits  like healthcare. Yet you have organizations in the United States of  America that want to rip away protections that people recently gained  when it comes to healthcare.    The last thing--the very last thing--working men and women in  Pennsylvania need is another corporate judge on an increasingly  corporate court.   Here is some evidence for that assertion. A review by the  Constitutional Accountability Center shows the consequences of the  Court's corporate tilt, finding that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has  had a success rate of 70 percent in cases before the Roberts Court  since 2006, a significant increase over previous Courts that were  thought to be conservative, I guess.   In the most recent term, the Court sided with corporate interests in  9 out of 10 cases in which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce advocated for a  position.   I was elected by the people of Pennsylvania to represent all  Pennsylvanians and to advance policies, especially when it comes to  making decisions about judges and Justices in a fashion that would give  meaning and integrity to what is inscribed on the Supreme Court:  ``Equal Justice Under Law.''   I was not sent here to genuflect to the hard right or to any  organization. In this case, I certainly was not sent here to genuflect  to the hard right with regard to groups funded by corporate America.   President Lincoln said it best about what he hoped our Nation would  be. He called on our Nation to work to ensure ``that government of the  people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the  earth.''   It seems that some in Washington today--and I have to say, the  administration with them, with this nomination to the Supreme Court,  most recently announced--are determined to pack the Court with a  government of, by, and for extreme right, corporate special interests.  So I oppose the President's nomination because it is a corrupt bargain,  as I said before, with the far right, big corporations, and what can  only be called Washington special interests.   On a night like tonight, when we are talking about major matters of  justice--how our courts will function, whether they will be balanced,  whether there will be mainstream judges and Justices--I hope we will go  back to that model that still prevails in some States--I would say in  most States--when it comes to district court judges: collaboration  between and among Democrats and Republicans. It is now being jettisoned  at the appellate court level, certainly in the Third Circuit and now  apparently in the Ninth Circuit and several others. Of course, on the  Supreme Court, there is no consultation. There is consultation with two  groups; that is it--and maybe some others who get to be in the room.  But if you are a conservative judge in America today, appointed by a  Republican, you need not apply to become a Supreme Court Justice. You  have to be hard right enough to be on that list of 25. You could be one  of those hundreds of conservative judges, but you are not going to get  on the list of 25 because you haven't demonstrated that you are hard  right enough.   I think it pains all of us that we are at this point. There were  days, not too long ago, when Presidents consulted with both parties  before--before--a Supreme Court nomination. We know that. That is on  the record, as clear as day. But now we have this list, and only the  list for the Supreme Court. Now we have blue slips that are being  thrown out the window or not honored when it comes to the appellate  courts. I hope that this kind of cancer doesn't go all the way to the  Federal district courts.   I think all of us wish we were in a different place, and I hope we  can return to those traditions that lead to consensus and, I think,  lead to bipartisan collaboration and, ultimately, better fulfillment of  that goal and that value of equal justice under law.   I yield the floor.
