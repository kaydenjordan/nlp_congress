Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8408, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8408, the bipartisan Aircraft  Certification Reform Accountability Act, today because a U.S.  commercial airplane manufacturer and, candidly, the Federal Aviation  Administration broke the public trust. 346 innocent people died on two  Boeing 737 MAX airplanes in October 2018 and March 2019.   Despite the crashes, both Boeing and the FAA found that the  certification of the 737 MAX was compliant with FAA regulations. It was  compliant with regulations, yet 346 people died. I believe that that  shows that there are problems with the regulatory system that need to  be addressed.   Ranking Member Graves, Aviation Subcommittee Chair Larsen, Aviation  Subcommittee Ranking Member Graves, and I actively worked on this bill  over a number of months. I think I can speak for all of us when I say  our intent is to ensure a U.S.-manufactured airplane never again  crashes due to design issues or regulatory failures.   The Boeing 737 MAX has been grounded since the second crash, that of  Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 on March 10, 2019. This has been the  longest grounding of a transport plane in the history of commercial  aviation and will likely end this week when the FAA judges that  Boeing's modifications to the deadly system that caused the crashes are  sufficient.   The FAA and Boeing have spent the last 20 months doing what they  should have done before the 737 MAX ever entered service, so  consideration of this bill is timely.   There is a long litany of negligence, recklessness, corporate greed-- particularly at the executive level--and errors in the design and  certification of the 737 MAX that culminated in the crashes of Lion Air  flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 and, ultimately, this  legislation.   I am not going to go over all of the stunning acts and omissions  within Boeing and the regulatory capture that prevented the FAA from  detecting and correcting those acts and omissions because they have  been laid bare in numerous reports since the accidents, including those  of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which recently  concluded the longest and most comprehensive investigation in the  committee's history with a nearly 250-page report on the technical and  regulatory failures in this story; the Joint Authorities Technical  Review, a team of U.S. and international safety regulators who assessed  the design and certification of the 737 MAX; the National  Transportation Safety Board; a special committee convened by the  Department of Transportation to evaluate the FAA's certification  process with respect to the 737 MAX; the Indonesian National  Transportation Safety Committee, which investigated the crash of Lion  Air flight 610; and the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority, which  investigated the crash of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302.   Lion Air 610 and Ethiopian flight 302 crashed, ultimately, because of  a system called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or  MCAS, which forced the airplane into dives with forces so great the  pilots were physically unable to counteract them. Through numerous  investigations, we know Boeing intentionally concealed the existence of  MCAS in cases from the airlines and pilots, partly to save money on  pilot training and partly to avoid increased regulatory scrutiny by the  FAA.   Level B non-simulator pilot training was a design objective for the  737 MAX from the outset, according to Boeing's former chief project  engineer; and as early as 2014, 2 years before the FAA made a pilot  training determination, a Boeing press release and marketing materials  declared this level of training for prospective 737 MAX customer  airlines. In one case, they promised to pay a penalty of $1 million per  plane to a purchaser if a higher level of training was necessary.   We also know that Boeing's safety assessment with respect to MCAS was  horribly incomplete. MCAS activated on both flights because of a tiny,  fragile vane, called an alpha vane, protruding from the left side of  the nose. The alpha vane measures the angle of attack between the  airplane and oncoming air.   When it failed, as these tiny, fragile vanes are wont to do, it  triggered a complex computerized response, which included a jarring  stick shaker, which vibrates the column so violently that if you are  holding onto it, your teeth are going to rattle to warn of a stall;  unrelated other cautions and warnings, and this plane has a primitive  alert system unlike all Boeings made in the last 25 years, as the  dozens of prioritized things; and warnings that airspeed, altitude is  unreliable.   More importantly, the MCAS system, an invisible system, left out of  the first manual, or deleted from the first manuals distributed with  the plane, forced the nose down repeatedly and inexorably toward the  Earth.   Now, Boeing assumed pilots would respond to all that and apply the  proper corrective procedure within 4 seconds. I would challenge most  experienced pilots to sort through that blizzard of alerts in 4  seconds, not knowing of the existence of the system, to determine what  is going on and apply proper procedure.   A Boeing test pilot in a simulator in 2012 couldn't do that, as the  committee staff investigation revealed. It took that pilot more than 10  seconds to respond correctly and found the condition to be  ``catastrophic,'' meaning the situation would have been unsalvageable.  The plane would have crashed. The simulator crashed. And it did not  share that information with the FAA or its MAX customers.    But Boeing and the FAA never assessed the airplane-level effects of  an alpha vane failure, how it would trigger erroneous MCAS activation,  and how pilots would respond; not that there wasn't plenty of  opportunity within Boeing to stop and think about MCAS and the  hazardous situations it would create.   At one juncture, a Boeing employee was authorized by the FAA as part  of the ODA, Organization Designation Authorization, to determine the  plane's compliance with the FAA requirements, asked in an email if the  airplane was vulnerable to a single alpha vane failure. The employee  was given a summary assurance that MCAS was not vulnerable, but that  assurance was incorrect. The eyes and ears of the FAA on the ground at  Boeing left the FAA largely in the dark regarding issues that affected  the airplane certification.  [[Page H5845]]    We uncovered numerable instances of similar missed opportunities in  our investigation. The culture of profits at any cost with the company  may well have been a factor in the failure to root out safety problems.   According to a 2016 internal survey of similar Boeing employees, who,  at the time, were called authorized representatives of the FAA, 39  percent said they felt undue pressure from Boeing management to make  decisions in the company's interest.   And then there was the FAA, whose complacency rendered the agency  virtually a nonpresence in this story until then-Acting Administrator  Elwell grounded the airplane after the second one crashed and after  virtually every other agency in the world had grounded these airplanes.   The FAA was either unable or unwilling to conduct rigorous oversight  of Boeing during the certification process. A Boeing employee wrote an  internal email in 2015 that, during a presentation of the 737 MAX, FAA  officials were like ``dogs watching TV.'' And they hid the mention of  MAX in two lines in a very lengthy presentation of MCAS.   Throughout our investigation, we learned the FAA and Boeing  separately performed an analysis after the first crash, that of Lion  Air, which concluded that, if left uncorrected, the design flaw in the  737 MAX could result in as many as 15 future crashes. And despite the  calculations and the agency's own Transport Airplane Risk Assessment  Methodology, or TARAM, the FAA let it continue to fly.   In fact, the head of safety for the FAA came to my office in February  after the first crash and said that was a one-off, there is no problem  with this plane. But that report had been produced before he came to  see me. Now, when we finally got him to a 7-hour recorded testimony, he  said he never heard of anything that said 15 of the planes would crash.   Well, what does the head of safety do at the FAA? Seriously.   Now, here is the most outrageous indication of a broken safety  culture within the very agency that is supposed to be the leading  champion of strong safety cultures. In a recent survey of FAA aviation  safety employees, 56 percent of those involved in certification  activities believed there was too much external influence on the agency  and that this influence was affecting FAA safety decisions.   This is 25 years after the horrible crash of Value Jet in Florida,  when I finally got the law changed to say that the FAA is not to  promote and regulate in the public interest and safety; it is only to  regulate in the public interest and safety, not to promote the  industry.   All of these factors alone, and more, all part of a broken system  that broke the public's trust culminated in 2018 and 2019 MAX  accidents. And the bill we are considering today will fix that broken  system.   It requires the FAA to approve authorized representatives at all  aviation manufacturers by examining their qualifications and character  so that, when they are considering a proposed design, they will  remember that public safety rests on their shoulders.   Any person who interferes with an authorized representative's  performance of his or her critical duties on behalf of the FAA will be  subject to civil penalties going forward.   It also imposes civil penalties for a manufacturer's failure to  disclose the details of a system like MCAS that manipulate flight  controls without direct pilot input and for a manufacturer's delivery  of an airplane that does not conform to an FAA-approved design.   The bill requires two FAA rulemakings that, together, will require  manufacturers to provide the agency with thorough assessments measuring  the risk created by changes to existing aircraft designs so FAA can  ascertain whether a manufacturer has sufficiently minimized any given  risk.   The bill requires the FAA to hire more staff to rigorously review new  designs and authorizes enough funding for 100 of them.   It also requires the FAA to implement a nonpunitive voluntary safety  reporting system for FAA employees to report safety concerns, prohibits  agency officials from talking with manufacturers about formal  objections to FAA career employees' decisions unless publicly  disclosing information about those communications, and it extends to  manufacturers' employees the same whistleblower protections that apply  to airline employees today, and much more.   I want to make it clear that this bill is not meant in any way to  interfere with the victims or their families' access to the judicial  system and all available remedies when tragedies occur. Compliance with  the provisions of H.R. 8408 will not adversely affect any existing  remedies available to families of the Boeing victims and any other  future victims under State, Federal, statutory, or common law. Families  who have already suffered tragic loss must be able to seek compensation  when their loved ones are injured or killed in aircraft crashes due to  negligence or other wrongdoing.   The 346 sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers who died  on Lion Air flight 610 and Ethiopian flight 302 placed their trust in a  broken system. Today, we take the next big step toward fixing that  system.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Graves, Aviation Subcommittee  Chair Larsen, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Graves for their  partnership in advancing this legislation, and I look forward to  continuing to work with them and our Senate colleagues, and hopefully  we can get it enacted into law this year.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen), the subcommittee chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to recognize the staff on both  sides and the Members. Early on, this did appear like it could be a  contentious piece of legislation, but in the end we all came together  in the public safety interest for needed reforms to this Federal agency  and the process by which we certify aircraft.   I thank the investigative staff of the committee, who put together an  extraordinary report. I also thank the aviation staff on both sides of  the aisle for their work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the tragic deaths of 346 people on two  Boeing 737 MAX jet crashes in October 2018 and March of 2019 were  entirely preventable. As was said in the final report prepared by the  Majority Staff of the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure on ``The Design, Development & Certification of the  Boeing 737 Max'' released on September 16, 2020, ``The MAX crashes were  not the result of a singular failure, technical mistake, or mismanaged  event. They were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty  technical assumptions by Boeing's engineers, a lack of transparency on  the part of Boeing's management, and grossly insufficient oversight by  the FAA--the pernicious result of regulatory capture on the part of the  FAA with respect to its responsibilities to perform robust oversight of  Boeing and to ensure the safety of the flying public.''   The 737 MAX tragedies require us to make sure that certification  alone can never become a legal shield for aircraft design or  manufacturing defects. Even with the enactment of this legislative  reform, it will be impossible to eliminate all risk. Indeed, as the  Committee's report shows, ``FAA management has undercut the authority  and judgment of its own technical experts and sided with Boeing on  design issues that failed to adequately address safety  [[Page H5847]]  issues and appear to have violated FAA regulations or guidance, in some  instances.''   We need to incentivize the industry to do everything possible to  ensure the safety of their planes and components. H.R. 8408 seeks to  accomplish this goal by making both manufacturers and regulators  responsible for updating and upgrading safety and technology standards  as new systems and information are developed and become available.   I also want to make it clear that this bill is not meant, in anyway,  to interfere with victims' or their families' access to the judicial  system and all available remedies when tragedies occur. Compliance with  the provisions of H.R. 8408 will not adversely affect any existing  remedies available to families of the Boeing victims and any other  future victims under state or Federal statutory or common law.  Families, who have already suffered tragic loss, must be able to seek  compensation when their loved ones are injured or killed in aircraft  crashes due to negligence or other wrongdoing.   Many of the families of the Boeing 737 MAX crashes attended hearing  after hearing as the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure conducted a comprehensive review of everything that went  wrong with the 737 MAX. They were there to remind us of the human  element--that we are here to work for the people. The bill does nothing  to interfere with or affect the ability of the families of victims of  air tragedies to hold industry accountable, now or in the future.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8266) to modify the Federal cost share of certain emergency  assistance provided under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act, to modify the activities eligible for  assistance under the emergency declaration issued by the President on  March 13, 2020, relating to COVID-19, and for other purposes, as  amended.

[[Page H5848]]            SEC. 5. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS AND HOUSEHOLDS.         Section 408(f)(3)(J)(iii) of the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.       5174(f)(3)(J)(iii)) is amended by striking ``2 years'' and       inserting ``3 years''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8266, the FEMA Assistance  Relief Act, as amended.   H.R. 8266 is a bipartisan bill I introduced with Subcommittee Chair  Titus, Representatives Thompson, Lowey, Roybal-Allard, Walden, and  several other Members representing districts ravaged by natural  disasters this year.   Simply put, this legislation would increase the Federal cost share of  certain assistance provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,  FEMA, under the Stafford Act.   Specifically, the bill would address the Federal cost share for all  declared disasters in the year 2020, the year of the pandemic, the year  of record wildfires, the year of record floods, the year of more  hurricanes than any other time in history, from 75 percent to not less  than 90 percent and further adjust the Federal cost share for COVID- related declarations to 100 percent.   Communities across this country, including my district in Oregon,  continue to struggle to recover from the twin crises: Combating the  COVID-19 pandemic while also facing extreme weather events, fires, and  other issues that science has linked to climate change.   State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments are seeing their  public health emergency management resources stretched thin or outright  depleted and overdrawn. It is Congress' responsibility to ensure they  have the financial support necessary to address these crises.   I first implored President Trump to direct FEMA to authorize a  Federal cost share adjustment back in March when he invoked a rarely  used clause in the Stafford Act to declare the pandemic a national  emergency and issue a Presidential emergency declaration for each State  and many protectorates and Federally recognized Tribes.   Thus far, both the President and the agency have not taken action to  shift the cost share more equitably on to the shoulders of the Federal  Government, who invoked this clause in an unprecedented way.   While Federal regulations allow for Presidential or administrative  cost share adjustment, the requests from the National Governors  Association, National Conference of State Legislatures, the National  Association of Counties, National Emergency Management Association,  International Association of Emergency Managers, and others for this  much-needed assistance have gone unanswered in a time when States and  locals have seen their revenues all but disappear due to the impact of  public health measures taken to combat the pandemic.                                time  1530    On several occasions during the last 15 years, Congress has seen fit  to statutorily increase the Federal cost share of FEMA assistance,  notably after a couple of hurricanes.   This year has already seen the busiest tornado, hurricane, and  wildfire seasons on record. The burdens of response and recovery to an  unprecedented number of natural disasters are compounding atop a global  pandemic.   If ever there was a moment for another statutory adjustment, 2020 is  the year in which that should happen.   Further, by establishing a national emergency and pulling FEMA into  the response in mid-March, the President invoked section 501(b) of the  Stafford Act, which declares the ``United States exercises exclusive or  preeminent responsibility and authority.'' One would think that  exclusive and/or preeminent responsibility and authority would justify  the 100-percent cost share for COVID-related expenses.   H.R. 8266 would provide much-needed assistance to ease the financial  burden on State, local, Tribal, and territorial communities that have  been granted Stafford declarations this year.   Additionally, this bill clarifies and encourages FEMA to reimburse  for personal protective equipment and disinfection costs for public  schools, public transit, courthouses, and other traditionally eligible  nonmedical entities, which were excluded from eligibility in FEMA's  September 1 interim policy--for some unknown reason--on eligible public  assistance expenses tied to fighting the spread of the global pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, in particular, Congressmen Payne and  Malinowski, members of the committee, for their efforts to address this  with a stand-alone bill. I am glad we are able to address the matter  here.   Just to reflect for a moment on the wildfires in the West, these were  wildfires of a magnitude and intensity never seen in recorded history  and, according to some scientists who have been studying our forests  through history, prehistory.   In my district, we had three major conflagrations, one just upriver  from my house, which took out the entire town of Blue River, and toward  the McKenzie River Corridor. The winds were gusting to hurricane force.  Humidity dropped to 6 percent. That is the Sahara Desert; that is not  Oregon. They blew down the McKenzie River Corridor. Forest scientists  say there has never been what is called a stand-replacement fire event  in that corridor in history or prehistory. It is wet, it is damp, but  not this year. These conditions were unbelievable.   In the north part of my district and in Kurt Schrader's district, we  lost three towns and had massive damage.   Then down in southern Oregon, not in a forested area, in  Representative Walden's district, the towns of Phoenix and Talent were  dramatically impacted. Many, many residences and businesses were lost.  One of the fires was set by a transient in a field, but again, the  winds were blowing at a level never, ever seen before out of the  northeast.   The city manager of Talent said to me: You know, I grew up in  southern California. This looks to me like the worst that southern  California ever had in the past. This doesn't look like Oregon.   These things are due to the changing climate. There are going to be  more of them, and we have to be ready. This bill at least will help  with this year's response.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 8266, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional requests for time, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time. I thought we just had that one additional speaker, or I wouldn't  have yielded back all my time.   I would like to point out that after Katrina, the gentleman's home  State got 100 percent.   In this case, when we are talking about COVID, there were  unprecedented invocations of the Stafford Act for every State and every  territory of the United States of America, and I believe that warrants  the 100 percent for COVID, which has already occurred and is past  tense.   In addition, COVID has devastated local revenue sources for States  that have sales taxes. Mine doesn't. You know, their revenues are down  phenomenally, and for other reasons.   I don't really want to belabor this. We are going to win  overwhelmingly.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding his time.
