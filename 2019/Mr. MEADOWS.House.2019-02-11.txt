 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1063. I appreciate the  gentlewoman's remarks as it relates to this particular bill. The  bipartisan Presidential Library Donation Reform Act, which was  introduced by the gentleman from Maryland, my good friend, Mr.  Cummings, is certainly one worthy of our support, Mr. Speaker.   Under current law, Presidents can fundraise for their Presidential  libraries through private, unlimited donations while they are still in  office. There are no current requirements for any Presidential library  fundraising organization to disclose the source or size of the donation  it receives. Donations can be from individuals, companies,  associations, and foreign governments, with no transparency.   Presidential libraries have become more expensive throughout the  years. President Clinton's library cost $165 million. President Bush's  cost $250 million. President Obama's is projected to cost more than  $500 million.   This bill requires Presidential library fundraising organizations to  disclose to the National Archives information about contributors who  have donated $200 or more in any quarter. The National Archives would  then be tasked with making the data available on its website in a  downloadable format.   H.R. 1063 also sunsets the disclosure requirement to when the  management of the actual library is transferred to the National  Archives.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It is a pro- transparency bill that has already passed the House, as my colleague  mentioned, not once but three different times, with overwhelming  support under both Democratic and Republican majorities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1065, the Social Media Use in  Clearance Investigations Act of 2019, introduced by the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).   Mr. Speaker, I was at one of these hearings where we were talking  about this very issue and how it was just mind-boggling that we would  not use current protocols, in terms of looking at national security  clearances and the approval thereof.   It was Mr. Lynch's initiative here to actually address that in a  legislative manner, and I support his good work there.   Millions of Americans use social media to interact with family  members, friends, and followers. Public posts on social media websites  occasionally provide a unique insight into a person's character and  interests.   In several high-profile cases, Federal contractors with valid  security clearances who leaked classified information had posted highly  suspicious entries on their social media accounts.   For example, Edward Snowden used various online aliases to post  suspicious content on the comment boards of a tech magazine before he  received his security clearance. A simple check--mind you, a simple  check--would have let us know of these suspicious activities and  certainly could have worked to mitigate some of the damages that we all  know too well.   Private companies and private citizens can and often do search  publicly available social media accounts to learn more about job  applicants. However, our government does not regularly check the social  media of individuals who have applied for security clearances.   On May 12, 2016, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  issued a new policy permitting the use of public social media  information in security clearance investigations. Despite that legal  clearance, most security clearance investigations still do not involve  a social media check.   Various Federal entities have studied the potential use of social  media information in background investigations for at least a decade.  The National Security Agency, the Army, OPM, and others have conducted  pilot programs on the effectiveness of social media checks, and it is  not clear what use has been made of this data for these programs or  whether the programs can be expanded to cover more applicants.   Concerning online behavior should be one of many factors used to  evaluate a person's fitness to access classified information.   H.R. 1065, the Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act, is a  step toward creating a more holistic security clearance review process.  The bill requires OMB to evaluate pilot programs conducted to date and  estimate the costs of wider implementation of publicly available social  media checks.   This report is due within 6 months and will help guide subsequent  legislation to require checks of publicly available data. We cannot  wait any longer to modernize our security clearance process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this thoughtful piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank the gentleman,  again, for his thoughtfulness on this particular piece of legislation.  I know that he has worked with my previous colleague, now the Governor  of Florida, Mr. DeSantis, and we have great bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge the adoption and passing of H.R. 1065, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1064, and I want to thank the gentlewoman  from California for her leadership on this effort. Any time that you  support whistleblowers, it is a good day in Congress; and to do that a  bipartisan way, with  [[Page H1500]]  the gentlewoman's leadership, is certainly a day that should be  applauded. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.   Whistleblowers in the Federal Government should be able to tell their  supervisor when something is going wrong. That is the truth, no matter  what, especially in cases involving classified information which  implies, Mr. Speaker, that it is a matter of national security.   Under the current law, whistleblowers dealing with classified  information in the intelligence community can make protected  disclosures to their supervisors. However, whistleblowers dealing with  classified information outside of the intelligence community do not  have the same protection.   With fewer legally-protected options, employees outside of the  intelligence community may be more likely to make an illegal disclosure  to people or entities without the proper security clearance.   Federal employees dealing with classified information outside of the  IC community must be reassured that they can report wrongdoing to the  appropriate people, including their supervisors.   With that protection, whistleblowers will be less likely to disclose  protected sensitive information on waste, fraud, and abuse to the media  or other entities or individuals without the proper security clearance.   This bill would allow whistleblowers to make protected disclosures of  classified information to individuals within their chain of command, as  the gentlewoman has already suggested.   There are very few conceivable circumstances in which a whistleblower  complaint to a supervisor would jeopardize national security, but such  disclosures are not currently protected.   There is no reasonable basis for concern about whistleblowers  throughout the Federal Government having the right to contact  individuals within their chain of command about waste, fraud, or abuse  of a classified nature. These additional whistleblower protections will  make it easier for Federal employees to do the responsible thing when  it comes to classified disclosures.   I urge my colleagues to support this. I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 995. But before I do, I want to  congratulate the gentlewoman on the passage, I believe, of her first  bill here on the House floor; and go even further to say that, in  keeping with this bipartisan support of H.R. 995, the Settlement  Agreement Information Database Act of 2019 that was introduced, and is  introduced, by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).   Mr. Speaker, transparency and public participation are critical to  maintaining the public trust in its government. However, Federal  agencies have increasingly resolved litigation by entering into  settlement agreements rather than going through a lengthy public trial.   Now settlement agreements are often negotiated behind closed doors.  Those secret negotiations effectively prevent the public from  participating in important policy sessions.   Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate this. When these settlements are done,  when they are actually consummated, they set up future public policy,  and to do that behind closed doors is certainly not something that a  transparent government should be about.   State and local governments, industry stakeholders, and taxpayers are  often directly affected by these settlements, but unable to provide  input.   For example, through the settlement agreement, the Environmental  Protection Agency required the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas, to  overhaul its sewer system in 12 years. Sewer utility bills increased by  167 percent in 3 years to fund the obligation of this agreement. At the  same time, Fort Smith residents' income actually decreased by 11  percent.   The burden of a Federal settlement can be difficult to see and  understand. Poor recordkeeping makes it impossible for Congress and the  public to determine the full impact of the Federal settlement  agreements.   Agencies release information about settlements at their discretion.  Some agencies rely even on press releases to release the amount of  information. So, as a result, the public only sees the facts through  what the agency puts out and only in the most favorable light.   So, in many cases these closed-door negotiations, the terms of the  settlement are deemed confidential. Without an explanation to the  public, the process becomes even more opaque and seemingly arbitrary.                                time  1630    H.R. 995 will shine a light on Federal settlement agreements. This  bill will require the establishment of electronic and publicly  available databases for agencies' settlement agreements.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this particular  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), the sponsor of this particular  piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for his  leadership on this particular bill. I urge the adoption of it, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1079, the CASES for Constituents Act,  introduced by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) and, as was  mentioned, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).   I have some prepared remarks, Mr. Speaker, but let me just deviate  from that for just a second.   Finally, two people have come together to get rid of the archaic way  that we have to get disclosures, that only go to hurt our constituents  whom we aim to serve. I mean, only in the government do we have this  kind of way where we actually have to make sure that we run it over by  a carrier pigeon to get something done.   All of us have been together where we are trying to serve our  constituents. Sometimes it is very time sensitive, Mr. Speaker, and  what do they want?   Well, you need to go get the privacy release form.   And if you go get the privacy release form: Well, no. That is not  okay. You have got to get their actual signature.   And so we are sending people all over.   So it is with heartfelt gratitude, Mr. Speaker, that I want to thank  these two gentlemen for doing something that is not only common sense  but much needed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) in support of this particular  piece of legislation that he and the gentleman who just spoke have led  so eloquently and diligently on.    Mr. Speaker, I want to go ahead and close, if we can, at  this particular point, but before I do so, I want to thank all of our  staff.   It is so easy at times for us to get up here, and yet the legislation  that gets introduced oftentimes is not just due to our personal staff  in our offices, but the committee staff, and so I want to make sure  that I emphasize that today.   Mr. Speaker, I will close with this final comment.  [[Page H1504]]    I had a constituent not long ago who said: You know, I will just  email you a release, and we won't have to go through all of this  getting it in writing.   I said: No, no, no, no, no. That will take an act of Congress.   Well, let me just tell you, today the Congress has acted.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
