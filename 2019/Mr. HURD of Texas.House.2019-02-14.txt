 Mr. Speaker, those who have answered the call to  serve our country can be found all across the 23rd Congressional  District of Texas. From Monahans to Alpine, Fort Davis to Eagle Pass,  my team crisscrossed the 29 counties I represent and heard from 23 of  our Nation's heroes whose stories will be preserved for generations to  come through the Library of Congress' Veterans History Project.   From those who just finished serving in the military to veterans of  the Vietnam war and Second World War, these men stood in the trenches  overseas, flew aircraft over Nazi Germany, and put themselves in harm's  way to protect our Nation from threats across the globe--from the Axis  Powers to ISIS. They paved the way for today's servicemembers who keep  us safe every single day.   I thank the Library of Congress for preserving these stories so that  we can learn about our past and teach future generations the value of  selfless service.   I thank all who have served, and God bless these United States of  America.            San Antonio Christian School Swimming Team State Title     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  outstanding achievement of the San Antonio Christian School swim teams  for winning both the girls and boys Texas Association of Private and  Parochial Schools Division 2 State Championships last week.   This achievement is truly a testament to their dedicated work ethic  and incredible talents. What a fantastic way to end an undefeated  season. Hard work and practice paid off. Their parents, peers, and  community are proud of them.   Included in this group is a former intern of mine, a gifted athlete  and rising star--Michael O'Brien of San Antonio, Texas. Well done,  Michael.   Enjoy these great moments. You will treasure them for the rest of  your lives. Go Lions.                                Running Start     Mr. Speaker, in 2019, there are more women serving  in Congress than at any other point in American history. This is a  tremendous achievement for our Nation and a trend I hope will continue,  because while women are half the population, they still make up less  than one-quarter of my congressional colleagues.   I rise today to recognize an organization that is doing crucial work  to bridge this gap. Since its inception in 2007, Running Start has  trained over 10,000 young women to run for office. I am proud to be a  congressional co-chair of Running Start because our elected leaders  must better reflect the makeup of our country.   With all the problems we face as a nation, the only way we are going  to solve them is by working together, and that will require including  more women in the conversation. Running Start is training the next  generation of women leaders who do just that.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the incredible young  women in Running Start's network and encourage the young women in their  lives and our lives to never let anyone ever tell them they are not  capable of running for office.                            ____________________
