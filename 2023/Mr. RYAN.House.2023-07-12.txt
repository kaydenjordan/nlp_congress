 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in  support of the NDAA as it was reported out of committee under the  strong bipartisan leadership of Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member  Smith.   I proudly served two combat tours in Iraq and sadly and personally  know the human cost of conflict. The landscape we face is as serious as  ever, from a land war in Europe to the significant threats from China.   This body has a crucial decision in front of us, one that will have  ramifications for my two young boys and for many generations of  Americans to come. Will we choose to be patriots, continuing the 60- plus year precedent of coming together in a bipartisan manner as  Americans to keep our Nation safe? Or will we give in and give up,  ceding the ground of our democracy to a small group of extremists  willing to hijack our Nation's security for their own narrow, selfish  political gain?   So many of the foundational challenges our military faces, from  declining trust in the institution to significant recruiting challenges  for all of our services, can and must be directly attributed to this  introduction of inherently partisan, divisive rhetoric into what should  be a sober and bipartisan discussion.   If I hear one more colleague, especially one who never served a day  in uniform, use the W word--which I won't use here on the floor--then  struggle to define what the heck they even mean by it, I am going to  lose it.   Every time I hear that, I think about the faces of our soldiers,  sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians currently in harm's way as we  speak. I think about the 4,000 young cadets I have the privilege of  representing at West Point. I have only been here a little less than a  year, but in my time, I have never had a single military family,  veteran, or servicemember ever bring up the issue of wokeness in the  military. Zero times, never.                                time  1500    What they do bring up over and over, our veterans and military  families, is that they are proud of their service that they have done  and the service they are doing. They are proud of our military today.  They are proud of our work to make it better, and they are  [[Page H3241]]  proud of our country. It is our job to remind them here in Congress  that we are proud of them and that we will have their backs.   Our men and women in uniform deserve that 5.2 percent pay raise. Our  female servicemembers deserve access to quality reproductive  healthcare. A diverse force, critical to solving diverse problems,  deserves to be welcomed into our ranks. These men and women in uniform  deserve Senate-confirmed senior leaders--something that one of these  extremists is currently standing in the way of.   We must rise above this division. We must come together as a  Congress, as Americans, as patriots to do the right thing. I trust that  we will ultimately do so.
