 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 994) to amend title 18, United States  Code, to provide for the protection of community centers with religious  affiliation, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1051, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6691) to amend title 18, United States Code, to  clarify the definition of ``crime of violence'', and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 6691.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6691, the Community Safety and  Security Act of 2018. This legislation provides critical clarity to the  definition of ``crime of violence'' in the United States Code in order  to keep violent criminals off the streets and ensure the safety of our  communities.   In the recent U.S. Supreme Court case United States v. Dimaya, the  term ``crime of violence'' was determined to be unconstitutionally  vague. Therefore, it is incumbent upon Congress to act to provide the  necessary clarity in the law that allows our law enforcement and our  judicial systems to work and, importantly, to protect the victims of  these violent crimes.   The Community Safety and Security Act of 2018 provides that clarity  by precisely and legally defining the phrase ``crime of violence'' and  the related criminal acts that, when combined with the element of force  are, indeed, considered violent.   They include crimes such as voluntary manslaughter, attempted  kidnapping, lewd acts upon a child, sexual assault, assault on a police  officer, domestic violence, murder, and all other crimes that a normal,  regular individual would think of as a violent crime, as well as human  trafficking.   In my State of Georgia, metro Atlanta is well known as a haven for  human and sex trafficking, and as a recruiting center for vulnerable  young people. In 2017 alone, it was reported that nearly 3,600 females  and more than 600 males were trafficked. These are just the reported  cases. Thousands more go unreported every year.   This legislation that I bring forward today provides essential legal  clarity to ensure that crimes like human trafficking and others in the  bill are deemed legally as crimes of violence.   Failure to address this issue would foster vagueness and uncertainty  in our courts, and potentially disrupt the prosecution of certain  crimes of violence, like human trafficking, child abuse, domestic  violence, and other acts that any reasonable individual would consider  a crime of violence.   This legislation has the support of a number of organizations,  including the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Association of  Police Organizations.   In a recent letter to Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi, the Fraternal  Order of Police noted that ``there are numerous convictions and pending  cases that would be jeopardized'' in the wake of the Dimaya decision.   The Community Safety and Security Act of 2018 is another step that  we, as Congress, can take, that we must take, in order to make our  communities the safest that they can possibly be. I urge my colleagues  to support this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, to my colleague from Texas, I want to say good morning  to her as well and also recognize her significant efforts in criminal  justice reform, and indeed I was proud to be able to support that  recent piece of legislation that came through our committee as well.   A couple of points. I very much appreciate the concerns that have  been raised, Mr. Speaker, but I assure you that this law, as crafted,  does not go beyond the scope contemplated when Section 16 was  originally crafted.   This is a responsible, carefully crafted piece of legislation that  does what the United States Supreme Court recommended. It enumerates  what crimes are crimes of violence so that there can be no vagueness  and people know what the law is. In fact, it goes to protect due  process, Mr. Speaker.   This is our responsibility as legislators. And indeed, Mr. Speaker,  time is of the essence, given the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision,  and indeed  [[Page H7929]]  there would be substantial harmful effects if we fail as Congress to  act today on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, I certainly appreciate my colleagues and the fact  that they have read the bill so very thoroughly.   I must reiterate, however, that this legislation is not overly broad.  In fact, it specifically maintains the status quo. And we drew those  lines because  [[Page H7930]]  we crafted the bill to maintain that status quo.   The legislation will not be able to fix some of the outrageous  injustices that have occurred when courts have found certain offenses  do not qualify as crimes of violence. For example, where a defendant  who has a conviction for sexual abuse escapes more serious consequences  because the State's sexual abuse statute also encompasses certain  consensual conduct and, therefore, it was not categorically a crime of  violence even when and where this particular defendant committed  horrific acts that were most certainly not consensual.                                time  0945    Some of these injustices must be fixed through State legislation. We  refrained specifically from expanding the law, despite the very human  desire to want to fix these kinds of injustices and recognizing that  the States have the duty to fix this.   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, does affect people's lives.  Specifically, it is going to affect the lives of individuals who are  victims of violent crimes.   A couple more points have been raised. First of all, on the issue of  fleeing, we have heard the concerns that the written text is a little  bit too broad on fleeing. Well, let me just correct that. Courts have  found fleeing to be a crime of violence. This is not an expansion. This  applies only in vehicles. It is not on foot.   The Seventh Circuit called this specific conduct ``inherently  aggressive.'' The 11th Circuit reasoned that ``fleeing from law  enforcement, an individual has already resorted to an extreme measure  to avoid arrest, signaling that he is likely prepared to resort to the  use of physical force.''   So, Mr. Speaker, we approach this bill with great diligence. Time, as  I said, is of the essence, given the recent U.S. Supreme Court  decision. We heard from the police officers association that they are  very concerned about the fact that pending cases and convictions could  be effective if Congress does not act. Indeed, substantial harm will  occur if we fail to act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just one clarification to the most recent  comments. The part that was left out in those comments was the fact  that it would apply only if a violent crime is committed.   May I inquire as to how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I have two additional speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Holding).    Mr. Speaker, again, I want to make the point that time  really is of the essence in being able to protect due process and,  equally and perhaps more importantly, being able to protect victims of  certain violent crimes.   For example, right now, today, under Fourth Circuit precedent, sex  trafficking is not considered a crime of violence; and I think that  most of us would all agree that sex trafficking is, indeed, a crime of  violence.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first let me address the criticism regarding burglary  being too broad in the way it is addressed in the legislation. This is  the Federal generic definition of burglary and one that courts have  found satisfies the definition of ``crime of violence.''   Mr. Speaker, the detractors of this fail to recognize that these  definitions are not an expansion of actual State laws but only seek to  cover the generic definition and reasonable iterations found in State  law.   In fact, prior to the Dimaya Supreme Court case, the Supreme Court  had previously unanimously agreed in Leocal v. Ashcroft that ``burglary  is the classic example of a crime of violence under subsection 16(b).''   The Community Safety and Security Act of 2018 is a necessary, crucial  piece of legislation that will fix a major loophole in our system. We  squarely address the issues raised by the United States Supreme Court,  eliminating the vagueness, giving notice, and explaining which offenses  Congress intended to cover when they had first crafted the language in  clause 16(b) from the very beginning.   By moving the legislation, we are avoiding potentially dangerous  consequences of giving very serious, dangerous criminals a pass. We  have examined the case law surrounding these offenses; we have  considered the equities; we have been deliberative; and we have shown  great restraint in many ways.   Congress cannot sit idly by and allow criminals to disrupt our  communities because of this loophole. This bill is a product of  necessity, and we do not have the privilege to squabble over  hypotheticals that ultimately have no bearing on real-life applications  of this law. We must move to protect our communities to prevent more  victims of crime.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I can assure my colleagues that this bill is  not overly broad. It is not, as some have irresponsibly stated, a  ``dangerous expansion of criminal law.'' Instead, it is a carefully  crafted response to the U.S. Supreme Court's recommendations in the  Dimaya case. Frankly, it is just the sort of bill that our system was  designed to produce.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for this bill. Vote  ``yes,'' and in doing so, demonstrate to your constituents your  commitment to protecting law-abiding Americans from violent criminals.  It is a simple choice. Make the correct one and vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
