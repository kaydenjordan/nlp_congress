 Madam Speaker, as we heard at the State of the  [[Page H1278]]  Union address, President Biden's first year delivered a record-breaking  number of new jobs. In total, 6.7 million new jobs were created for  hardworking Americans.   America also saw the largest calendar-year decrease in unemployment  in the Nation's history, paired with record-breaking GDP growth.   But America's economic prosperity is only one side of the equation.  America's public health has also been strengthened during Biden's first  year.   Vaccination rates have tremendously risen from 15 percent to a  whopping 65 percent in 1 year for full vaccination. That is more than  215 million fully vaccinated Americans--again, a record. In addition,  70 million households also received free COVID tests, and those numbers  will only rise.   While these are tremendous accomplishments, I can't say I am too  surprised. You see, we have a strong leader in the White House and the  backing of the American people. As President Biden said on Tuesday,  never bet against the American people.                            ____________________
