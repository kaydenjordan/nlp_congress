 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my strong support for the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2020.   Especially I would like to commend the bill's author, my friend,  Representative Susan Davis. It is due to her steadfast and visionary  leadership on the Higher Education and Workforce Development  Subcommittee that we are here today advancing this important and timely  legislation. This bill is an apt capstone on her remarkable legacy.   Registered apprenticeships are a tried and true system for preparing  our workforce for stable jobs that provide family sustaining wages and  benefits. I have seen firsthand how unions have put this tool to  excellent use over the years. In fact, just last year I visited the  Laborers' training facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, where young  apprentices are training for careers in construction. The Laborers  recognize the importance of this bill, which is why they have endorsed  it and urged its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter.                                                          LiUNA!,                                  Washington, DC, November 18, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the 500,000       hardworking men and women of the Laborers' International       Union of North America (LIUNA) to ask you to vote for H.R.       8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2020, when it comes       to the House floor for a vote this week. LIUNA is proud to       support this important bill to keep our union apprenticeship       programs strong.        Registered Apprenticeship Programs, like the ones that       LIUNA has had for decades, help workers earn while they       learn. H.R. 8294 invests more than $3.5 billion over five (5)       years in expanding opportunities and access to Registered       Apprenticeship Programs and Preapprenticeship Programs, among       others. The bill creates nearly a million new apprenticeship       opportunities on top of the current expected growth of the       apprenticeship system. It would also yield $10.6 billion in       net benefits to U.S. taxpayers in the form of increased       workers productivity and decreased spending on public       assistance programs and unemployment insurance. The rigorous       standards in the bill ensure that the programs that       apprentices will work in will be top-quality.        At a time when our nation's infrastructure needs are so       great, H.R. 8294 will ensure that we continue to train the       best workforce in the world.        Again, I ask that you vote in favor of this important bill       on the House floor.        With kind regards, I am.            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.     However, for far too long, apprenticeship opportunities  have been utilized almost exclusively for just a handful of  construction-oriented occupations. It is time to open this successful  model to a wider range of careers and invite folks from a more diverse  array of backgrounds to participate. This bill accomplishes both.   I am particularly pleased it includes legislation that Representative  Morelle and I filed to assist small businesses in participating in  registered apprenticeship programs and provide a particular focus on  opportunities for people of color, women, and veterans.   At a time when college students are drowning in debt, we need to  advance measures that offer more affordable pathways to the middle  class. The bill before us will help countless people achieve the  American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair and Representative Davis for their  excellent work, and I urge the bill's passage.
