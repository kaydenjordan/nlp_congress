 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this  opportunity to offer my condolences to the families of the three  individuals whose lives were cut tragically short because of gun  violence in my district.   Last Friday, a senseless shooting at a bowling alley in Torrance  claimed the lives of Michael Radford, Robert Meekins, and Astin  Edwards, while injuring four others.   Gable House Bowl, where the mass shooting took place, is a staple in  my hometown. It is a place where I have visited; where my kids have  celebrated birthdays; where folks in my community go to spend quality  time together, and it should have been a place last Friday where people  of all ages could have had fun safely.   My heart aches for the victims' families who lost their loved ones in  a senseless, preventable manner. I am also dismayed that our community  now joins an ever-growing cohort of communities touched by mass  shootings.   Gun safety reform is a complicated task, but I am grateful that the  House, now under Democratic leadership, is taking this challenge on.  Yesterday, we introduced H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act  of 2019, which is an excellent place to start addressing gun safety  reform. We must continue to push for sensible gun safety measures.                            ____________________
