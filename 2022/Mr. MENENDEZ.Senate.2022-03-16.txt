 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 6:30 p.m. tonight, the Senate vote on the  cloture motions with respect to Executive Calendar Nos. 683, 737, 679,  680, 681, 684, 685 and 662; that at 11:45 a.m. tomorrow, March 17, the  Senate vote on confirmation of Executive Calendar Nos. 656 and 738;  that at 1:45 p.m. tomorrow, the Senate vote on the cloture motion with  respect to Executive Calendar No. 677; finally, that if cloture is  invoked on any of the nominations, all postcloture time be considered  expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the nominations at a  time to be determined by the majority leader or his designee following  consultation with the Republican leader.    Mr. President, I rise today to seek unanimous consent  to confirm four nominees to posts that are critical--critical--to our  response to Putin's war against Ukraine.   Through smoke and rubble and artillery fire, Ukrainians are leaving  their homes with nothing more than a backpack, nothing more than their  children in their hands.   Over the past 20 days, Vladimir Putin's illegal and horrific assault  on Ukraine has led more than 3 million refugees to flee into  neighboring countries. Those who remain are suffering from a dire and  deteriorating humanitarian situation.   With Putin's army blocking aid convoys, millions of Ukrainians are  facing lack of water, food, and heat. Meanwhile, Putin orders  unprovoked, unjustified attacks on civilians--shelling apartment  buildings, bombing maternity hospitals, and destroying kindergartens,  committing atrocities throughout the country.   The United States and the world have a duty to exact costs on Putin,  to demand accountability for war crimes, and to provide aid for the  millions of innocent Ukrainians who are suffering. If we want to rise  to this challenge, if we want to respond to the mounting human  suffering, one thing is clear: We need to have the people in place--the  people the President has selected--to lead and carry out this work.  Their leadership is critical in our response to the growing crisis in  Ukraine and the looming refugee crisis across Eastern Europe. They will  fight to defend human rights when they are violated. They will fight to  defend democracy when it is attacked. They will make sure we maximize  the pain and the price Putin pays for this heinous war.    Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator from  Florida, through the Chair, does the Assistant Administrator for Europe  and Eurasia at USAID have anything to do with PAHO?   Does the Assistant Secretary for International Security and  Nonproliferation have anything to do with PAHO?   I guess the Senator doesn't want to engage in a colloquy.   Madam President, it is amazing to me. My colleagues who get up and  applaud Zelenskyy, my colleagues who come to the Senate floor and talk  about both the need to help Ukraine and the humanitarian realities that  are compounding every day--and yet here we are with four pertinent, key  positions that could help in regard to each and every one of those  elements, and on some unrelated issue, not Ukraine, not even Europe,  not about proliferation, not about humanitarian response, no, there is  a wholesale objection.   Now, if you wanted to pick your objection and target it, that might  make sense, but I am deeply troubled that the junior Senator from  Florida is once again obstructing the Senate's responsibility to  provide advice and consent on Presidential nominations, not only  preventing us from fulfilling our constitutional duties, but in this  case, moreover, he is singlehandedly undermining the ability of the  U.S. Government to respond fully to Russia's brutal invasion. In doing  so, he seeks to singlehandedly damage our ability to ensure a  coordinated international effort to sanction Putin, his cronies,  sectors of the Russian Government.   He is undercutting the U.S. Government's ability to support the  Ukrainian people and our allies. He is undercutting our ability to  provide and coordinate the humanitarian assistance for 3 million  Ukrainians who have left and millions more who are inside the country  and need help. It is mind-boggling--mind boggling. Get up, (applauds)  and then come to the floor and object to the very things that can make  it happen. Mind-boggling.   Now, let me address the issue that the junior Senator from Florida  has raised here today--the Cuban regime's trafficking of doctors and  medical personnel. Simply put, the Diaz-Canel regime, like the Castro  regime before it, does subject Cuban doctors to forced labor schemes  abroad while pocketing the doctors' wages in profit-making schemes that  generate billions of dollars annually.   Now, I have been working on this issue since before my colleague ever  held public office. I have engaged multiple administrations on this  issue. I have actually authored legislation and resolutions on the  subject. So my track record for standing up for Cuban doctors who are  trafficked by the Cuban regime eclipses that of any other Member of  Congress, period. But, my God, as passionate as I am about that issue-- no one would be more passionate  [[Page S1209]]  than me--it is not right to hold up everything we are trying to do on  Ukraine.   This is a global emergency. The fate of not only Ukraine but of  democracy and its ability to achieve victory is under threat. And here  we have objections to critical positions that can help us make sure  that we win in that battle.    Madam President, so here we go. The person who would be  responsible for helping the humanitarian challenge in Ukraine and in  the surrounding countries where 3 million people have fled to, we can't  get her in position--can't get her into a position to do the job to  help millions of Ukrainians who are fleeing.   I don't understand how the party of Reagan, the party of freedom and  democracy, the party of standing up to these people can actually create  a set of circumstances where this is like helping Putin at the end of  the day. It is like helping Putin at the end of the day.   Now, while Senator Marshall didn't speak to it, I understand his  concerns are about COVID origins. Well, there is nothing wrong with  that. It has been a lively topic of discussion in many forums,  including the Senate. But these things have nothing to do with what  Ambassador McKee is nominated for: Assistant Administrator for Europe  and Eurasia.   All of us, including Senator Marshall, know that we need to do  everything possible to support Ukrainians in their time of need.  Blocking Ambassador McKee is self-defeating.   It is also not clear to me what more USAID can do to satisfy Senator  Marshall. I have inquired because I heard this was the issue. USAID has  been engaged at the most senior levels in trying to be helpful and  responsive to Senator Marshall. They offered him and his team  briefings, and I understand that none of those offers have been  accepted. They have also pointed Senator Marshall's office to a wealth  of information on specific USAID projects of interest.   So I would urge the Senator, instead of blocking nominees, to act on  USAID's multiple briefing offers and engage them meaningfully. That  would be more helpful to his ultimate goal--but not to be helping  Putin, at the end of the day, by not being able to take care of the  humanitarian needs of the Ukrainians.   I have seen a lot over my course of 40 years in public service and 30  years in the Congress. I just--this is mind-boggling. But more than  that, it really undermines our national security. It really undermines  our help with the Ukrainian people. And so I hope that some saner minds  will prevail in the days ahead when I come back to the floor to try  this once again.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

The proposed sale will improve Spain's capability to meet       current and future threats. The MH-60R Multi-Mission       Helicopter will provide the capability to perform anti-      surface and anti-submarine warfare missions along with the       ability to perform secondary missions including vertical       replenishment, search and rescue, and communications relay       and will bolster the Spanish Navy's ability to support NATO       and remain interoperable with the U.S. and the NATO alliance.       Spain will have no difficulty absorbing these helicopters       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin Rotary and       Mission Systems, Owego, NY. There are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale may require the       assignment of two (2) contractor representatives to Spain.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-09       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter focuses primarily on       anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare missions. The MH-60R       carries several sensors and data links to enhance its ability       to work in a network centric battle group and as an extension       of its home ship/main operating base. The mission equipment       subsystem consists of the following sensors and subsystems:       an acoustics systems consisting of a dipping sonar and       sonobuoys, Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) with integral       Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) interrogator, Radios with       COMSEC, Electronic Support Measures (ESM), Integrated Self-      Defense (ISD), and Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS). The       aircraft processes sensor data onboard, and transmits data       via Common Data Link (CDL) (also referred to as Hawklink).       The aircraft is night vision compatible. It can carry AGM-      114A/B/K/N Hellfire missiles to engage surface and sub-      surface targets.        a. The AGM-114 Hellfire missile is an air-to-surface       missile with a multi-mission, multi-target, precision strike       capability. The Hellfire can be launched from multiple air       platforms and is the primary precision weapon for the United       States Army.        b. Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) laser       guided rocket to counter the fast attack craft and fast       inshore attack craft threat.        c. Communications security (COMSEC) devices contain       sensitive encryption algorithms and keying material.        d. Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) (KIV-78) contains       embedded security devices containing sensitive encryption       algorithms and keying material.        e. GPS/PPS/SAASM--Global Positioning System (GPS) provides       a space-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that       has reliable location and time information in all weather and       at all times and anywhere on or near the earth when and where       there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS       satellites. Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module       (SAASM) (AN/PSN-11) is used by military GPS receivers to       allow decryption of precision GPS coordinates. In addition,       the GPS Antenna System (GAS-1) provides protection from enemy       manipulation of the GPS system.        f. Acoustics algorithms are used to process dipping sonar       and sonobuoy data for target tracking and for the Acoustics       Mission Planner (AMP), which is a tactical aid employed  [[Page S1222]]       to optimize the deployment of sonobuoys and the dipping       sonar.        g. The AN/APS-153 multi-mode radar with an integrated IFF       and Inverse Synthetic Aperture (ISAR) provides target       surveillance/detection capability.        h. The AN/ALQ-210 (ESM) system identifies the location of       an emitter.        i. The AN/AAS-44C(V) Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS)       operates in day/night and adverse weather conditions. Imagery       is provided by a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor, a       color/monochrome day television (DTV) camera, and a Low-Light       TV (LLTV).        j. Ultra High Frequency/Very High Frequency (UHF/VHF)       Radios (ARC-210) contain embedded sensitive encryption       algorithms and keying material.        k. Advanced Data Transfer System (ADTS) with Type 1       encryption for data at rest.        l. Satellite Communications Demand Assigned Multiple Access       (SATCOM DAMA), which provides increased, interoperable       communications capabilities with U.S. forces.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems, which might reduce system effectiveness       or be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Spain can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Spain.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have eight requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
