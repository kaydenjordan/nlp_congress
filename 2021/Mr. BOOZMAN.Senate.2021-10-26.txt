 Madam President, I rise today to offer my sincere  congratulations to DaySpring on 50 years of sharing God's love through  creativity and expression.   DaySpring, a Christian cards and e-cards, boxed cards, inspirational  gifts, home decor, and art company, calls Siloam Springs, AR, home to  its world headquarters. We are tremendously proud to host this faith- based industry in the Natural State and benefit from all the stirring  and encouraging work it does.   The commitment and continued dedication DaySpring and its employees  display in sharing their Christian faith through uplifting,  inspirational, and prayerful formats is a testament to the role faith  plays in their mission. In a time where deep divisions exist within our  country, its hopeful messages are a powerful and effective reminder to  choose kindness. The work it does brings Americans together and prompts  us to recall that we are all created in God's image and loved by our  Creator. I am so appreciative for its passion to spread God's love as  well as the beauty and sincerity that characterizes the products it so  thoughtfully creates to deliver that message.   We are very pleased to have witnessed what DaySpring has accomplished  over the last five decades. Because of its hard, intentional work to  reach people with God's word, I am certain more people are leading a  life devoted to Christ. With a vision to ``see every person experience  and express the life-changing message of God's love,'' the company has  charted a path that has kept it focused, relevant, and undeniably  impactful.   As Colossians 3:23 says, ``Whatever you do, work at it with all your  heart, as working for the Lord.'' DaySpring's staff has certainly  followed that admonition each and every day for 50 years. In the years  ahead, I encourage them to continue inspiring us to look to our  Heavenly Father, and to love and help one another along the way.   Americans, now more than ever, are in need of this hopeful and  sincere message. I am confident the guidance and direction consistently  provided by DaySpring will be instrumental as we continue teaching and  sharing God's word in the years to come.                            ____________________
