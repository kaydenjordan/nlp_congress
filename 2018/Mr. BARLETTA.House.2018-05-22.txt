 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 113) authorizing the use of the  Capitol Grounds for the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby.

The Capitol Police Board shall provide for enforcement of       the restrictions contained in section 5104(c) of title 40,       United States Code, concerning sales, advertisements,       displays, and solicitations on the Capitol Grounds, as well       as other restrictions applicable to the Capitol Grounds, with       respect to the event.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 113.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 113 authorizes the use of the Capitol  Grounds for the annual Greater Washington Soap Box Derby in June. The  mission of the Soap Box Derby is to build knowledge and character in  our children and to teach them fair and honest competition.   This American tradition, started in 1934, encourages kids to be  creative and teaches them problem-solving and engineering skills. I am  pleased this tradition continues, including in my home State of  Pennsylvania. Winners from this local competition will join winners of  other races in competing at the world championship in Akron, Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this resolution, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
