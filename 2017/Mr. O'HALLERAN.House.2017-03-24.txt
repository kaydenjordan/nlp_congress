 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the so- called American Health Care Act. I am alarmed at the real consequences  this bill will have on rural Arizona and rural America.   These communities will be disproportionately harmed by this bill. In  Coconino County, a 40-year-old making $30,000 a year will go from a  $2,400 payment to a $6,000 payment.   Getting away from my script for a second, I spent many years on the  west side of Chicago looking at what the core side of poverty looks  like night after night, family after family, in our cities and our  towns in this wonderful America. I know a little bit about math, and I  know that 20 million people insured is better than 24 million people  uninsured.   Please vote ``no.''
