 Madam Speaker, in all the hubbub over the significant  legislation and the debt limit last week, I think this body let the  founding of Earth Day pass.   Of course, the father of Earth Day was none other than Wisconsin  Senator Gaylord Nelson. I am sure all of Wisconsin's little  schoolchildren are taught that.   Given that we are celebrating the 73rd anniversary of Earth Day, I  think we should go back and look at what some of the founders of Earth  Day said at that time.   Gaylord Nelson said that within 25 years of the first Earth Day,  which was in 1970, 75 to 80 percent of the species of the Earth would  be extinct.   Paul Ehrlich, biologist and author of the best-selling book ``The  Population Bomb,'' predicted that 100 to 200 million people would be  starving per year in the 1980s and that 65 million Americans would die  in the 1980s.   George Wald, a well-known Harvard biologist, predicted that  civilization would end within 15 to 30 years unless action was taken  quickly.   Barry Commoner, another windbag who was on television all the time in  the 1970s, also predicted that all the oxygen would be used up in  America's freshwater rivers.   The lesson is: Go back and see what those founders of Earth Day said  and see how little they really knew about what the future held for us.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, we are here to commemorate another  police week, and I think the average American never has an opportunity  to see what the average policeman goes through and the risks they take.   Fortunately, as a Congressman and, as you mentioned before that, a  State legislator, I had an opportunity to try to do a couple ride- alongs with local police departments and local sheriff's departments.   I think until you spend time with law enforcement, you don't realize  the risks that they go through routinely and without complaining.  Whether it is a domestic situation where they are going up to a door  not knowing if one of these people is armed, not knowing what you are  going to confront, but having to knock on that door and go in there  anyway.   Doing a routine traffic stop--because if you are in a squad car, no  traffic stop seems routine--you have no idea whether that person is  armed, whether that car is going to take off, or what is going to  happen. Every night, due to the job, the average law enforcement  officer will be involved in, I would estimate, three or four incidents.  During these incidents, the officer is faced with the unknown. Who is  the other person in that car? Who is the person behind that door?   I encourage all my colleagues to take advantage of their position, do  a ride-along, get to know a little bit more about your police so you  not only respect what they are doing, but know how incredibly  professional they are. See what a great job they do. You will quickly  realize that the few naysayers in this building who run down the  police, it is not consistent with the statistics at all.   In fact, there are few occupations as noble, respectful, and make you  feel good about yourself and your accomplishments than what a policeman  does every night.   I will make another comment, Madam Speaker. It is good to spend a  shift with this batch, as well.
