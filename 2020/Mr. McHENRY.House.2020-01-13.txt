 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, I begin by thanking Chairwoman Waters and her  staff for working with my staff and me to bring this bill to the floor  today and, indeed, making it a bipartisan outcome.   It is a nice way to start a year. We started last year on the floor  passing bipartisan bills, and from time to time, we have been able to  do that over the last year. So I thank Chairwoman Waters for working  with me where we can, but when we disagree in our committee, we are  able to disagree and still have the capacity to talk to one another. I  think that is a very special thing. Now, the rest of our politics, they  are what they are, but it is good to celebrate when we have our  bipartisan victories.   Madam Speaker, the bill we have before us will ensure the government  regulators are taking seriously the systemic risk that cybersecurity  attacks pose to the global economy.   For the first time, this legislation will require U.S. bank  regulators--the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  [[Page H197]]  and the National Credit Union Administration--to provide Congress with  a detailed analysis of what they are doing to protect against  cyberattacks, both internally and in the entities they oversee.   This includes the regulators' technical procedures, their operational  policies to ensure accountability for cybersecurity at the highest  management levels, their cooperation with domestic and foreign  financial institutions, as well as their forecasts on emerging threats  to the resilience of the financial system--important stuff.   The need for this bill is clear. We have witnessed nearly half a  billion data records exposed as a result of breaches in the private  sector.   We know that the world is digitizing. Our government is trying to  keep pace, but the private sector is moving very quickly as we, as  consumers, drive this move to greater digitization.   Not surprisingly, one recent survey found that no less than two- thirds of our large financial institutions had experienced an increase  in cyberattacks over the previous year, with 79 percent of them  concluding that hackers were becoming more sophisticated. Certainly,  they are.   At an April 2019 hearing of the Financial Services Committee, CEOs  from five of America's seven largest banks cited cyberattacks as the  foremost risk they face. Now, that is not productivity growth. It is  not political upheaval overseas. It is not an economic slowdown in  China or Europe. They ranked their highest concern as cybersecurity  threats.    In the private sector, they are not alone in this exposure. Last  year, we saw ransomware attacks against Baltimore and three towns in  Florida that forced local government operations to be suspended, in  some cases jeopardizing basic public services.   What would happen if hackers had that same success in a large attack  that has systemic implications? Here is just one example.   The Federal Reserve settles $35 billion in global payments in just  the first hour of operations each business day. A cyberattack on the  Fed that could be just partially successful would have and could have  disastrous consequences. It is precisely the scale and  interconnectedness of the financial sector that makes such scenarios so  alarming.   As the 2019 annual report of the Financial Stability Oversight  Council explains: ``The increasing reliance of financial firms on  information technology increases the risk that a cybersecurity event  could have severe negative consequences for the U.S. economy,  potentially impacting financial stability.'' True.   The FSOC report goes on to say: ``The unique and complex threats  posed by cyber risks require the public and private sectors to  cooperate to identify, understand, and protect against these risks.''   It is a new threat. It is a complex one. While I appreciate our  regulators' growing sensitivity to cyber-related risks, we can and must  do more.   As the Fed acknowledged in its most recent financial stability  report, cyber resiliency is a potential risk for financial stability  that doesn't fit neatly into existing risk frameworks.                                time  1800    This bill will help our regulators, including the Fed, incorporate  cybersecurity into those risk assessments more effectively.   To be clear, Madam Speaker, the answer to cyber threats is not to  return to some bygone, less technologically sophisticated age,  something we can't do. On the contrary, ensuring the resiliency of the  financial system means increasing vigilance and innovation. That means  we need to have the best and brightest protecting our important  institutions of government and the best and brightest protecting our  important institutions in the private sector.   It is a lack of technological sophistication in the public and  private sectors that will offer an opening to attackers if we don't  take this action, and that is why Congress needs to hold our regulators  to the highest standards of accountability so that they will remain a  step ahead of tomorrow's threats.   Again, I want to thank my Democratic colleagues for working with us  on this important measure, and I urge all Members to support its  passage.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I include in the Record a letter from the Credit Union National  Association in support of H.R. 4458 and a blog post by the  International Monetary Fund which highlights the global threat of  cybersecurity attacks and the need for better preparation and risk  assessments.                              Credit Union National Association,                                   Washington, DC, October 29, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry: On       behalf of America's credit unions, I am writing regarding the       House Financial Services Committee's markup of H.R. 4458,       ``the Cybersecurity and Financial System Resilience Act.''       The Credit Union National Association (CUNA) represents       America's credit unions and their 115 million members.        National Cybersecurity Awareness Month is an important       reminder to assess cyber dangers and consider what can be       done to help protect Americans and American businesses from       cyber-attacks. For credit unions, protecting American's       financial and other personal information no matter what       business or entity possess or handle it is of the utmost       importance. Theft and misuse of members' information from       other businesses and entities cost credit unions and by       extension their member-owners significant money while lining       the pockets of criminals and criminal nation states who use       the money to hurt the Unites States.        CUNA supports H.R. 4458, the ``Cybersecurity and Financial       System Resilience Act.'' America's credit unions support       efforts to ensure that the entire financial services sector       has proper cyber safeguards in place and this effort should       extend to the sectors' regulators. H.R. 4458 would require       the sectors' regulators to each issue an annual report to       Congress describing measures the respective agency has taken       to strengthen cybersecurity with respect to its functions as       a regulator, including the supervision and regulation of       financial institutions and, where applicable, third-party       service providers.        The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)       requires the sectors' regulators to develop, document, and       implement an agency-wide program to provide information       security for the information and information systems that       support the operations and assets of the agency, including       those provided or managed by another agency. It appears that       H.R. 4458 would enhance FISMA through reporting requirements       while also requiring the regulators to ensure robust       oversight of their regulated entities, which is already a       primary duty of the regulators.        The regulators should be given wide latitude to decide the       information reported publicly on the status of their       regulated entities. Any information that details cyber       vulnerabilities at financial institutions should not be       reported publicly as it could harm the sector as bad actors       could use reports as a roadmap for future attacks.       Furthermore, the regulators should coordinate publicly       reporting their regulated financial institutions for the same       reason.        Lastly, we commend the National Credit Union Administration       (NCUA) Chairman Rodney Hood for recently appointing a       cybersecurity advisor. We believe this is a critical step to       ensure the agency stays focused on important cyber issues. We       appreciate that NCUA has taken proactive efforts to work to       secure the cyber security framework for credit unions and       their members.        On behalf of America's credit unions and their 115 million       members, thank you for the opportunity to share our views. We       look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on       safeguarding the financial services sector against cyber-      attacks.        Sincerely,                                                        Jim Nussle,      President & CEO.                                   ____                          [From IMF, Jan. 13, 2020]                      Cybersecurity Threats Call for a                             Global Response                             (By David Lipton)         Last March, Operation Taiex led to the arrest of the gang       leader behind the Carbanak and Cobalt malware attacks on over       100 financial institutions worldwide. This law enforcement       operation included the Spanish national police, Europol, FBI,       the Romanian, Moldovan, Belarusian, and Taiwanese       authorities, as well as private cybersecurity companies.       Investigators found out that hackers were operating in at       least 15 countries.        We all know that money moves quickly around the world. As       Operation Taiex shows, cybercrime is doing the same, becoming       increasingly able to collaborate rapidly across borders.        To create a cyber-secure world, we must be as fast and       globally integrated as the criminals. Facing a global threat       with local resources will not be enough. Countries need to  [[Page H198]]       do more internally and internationally to coordinate their       efforts.                          How to best work together         To begin, the private sector offers many good examples of       cooperation. The industry deserves credit for taking the lead       in many areas--developing technical and risk management       standards, convening information-sharing forums, and spending       considerable resources. International bodies, including the       Group of 7 Cyber Experts group and the Basel Committee, are       creating awareness and identifying sound practices for       financial sector supervisors. This is important work.        But there is more to be done, especially if we take a       global perspective. There are four areas where the       international community can come together and boost the work       being done at the national level:        First, we need to develop a greater understanding of the       risks: the source and nature of threats and how they might       impact financial stability. We need more data on threats and       on the impact of successful attacks to better understand the       risks.        Second, we need to improve collaboration on threat       intelligence, incident reporting and best practices in       resilience and response. Information sharing between the       private and public sector needs to be improved--for example,       by reducing barriers to banks reporting issues to financial       supervisors and law enforcement.        Different public agencies within a country need to       communicate seamlessly. And most challenging, information       sharing between countries must improve.        Third, and related, regulatory approaches need to achieve       greater consistency. Today, countries have different       standards, regulations, and terminology. Reducing this       inconsistency will facilitate more communication.        Finally, knowing that attacks will come, countries need to       be ready for them. Crisis preparation and response protocols       should be developed at both the national and cross-border       level, so as to be able to respond and recover operations as       soon as possible. Crisis exercises have become crucial in       building resilience and the ability to respond, by revealing       gaps and weaknesses in processes and decision making.                          Connecting the Global Dots         Because a cyberattack can come from anywhere in the world,       or many places at once, crisis response protocols must be       articulated within regions and globally.        That means the relevant authorities need to know ``whom to       call'' during a crisis, in nearby and, ideally, also in       faraway countries. For small or developing countries, this is       a challenge that needs international attention. Many rely on       financial services or correspondent lines provided by global       banks for financial connection. Developing cross-border       response protocols will help countries understand their       respective roles in a crisis and ensure a coordinated       response in the event of a crisis.        The Group of 7 countries has made an excellent start at       building collaboration on cybersecurity, but this effort       needs to be broadened to each and every country.        Here the IMF can play an important role. With a much       broader representation than most of the standard-setting       institutions, the IMF has the ability to raise the concerns       of emerging-market and developing countries to a global       level. Because any place is a good place to start an attack,       it is in the ultimate interest of advanced economies to work       with other countries to share information, coordinate       actions, and build capacity.        At the IMF, we work with countries that need to build this       capacity, developing the skills and expertise needed to       recognize and effectively counter cybersecurity threats. Our       international partners are doing the same, and we work       regularly with an array of stakeholders in the public and       private sector.        Successful cyberattacks have the potential to hamper       financial development by creating distrust, especially if       personal and financial data are compromised.        If we want to reap the benefits of new technologies that       can develop markets and expand financial inclusion, we have       to preserve trust, and ensure the security of information and       communications technologies. With cybersecurity, there is       always more to be done simply because the pace of change is       breathtakingly fast.    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   ``There could be no definition of a successful life that does not  include service to others''--the words of George Herbert Walker Bush.   ``Each day we should do something to help others''--the words of  Barbara Pierce Bush.   We know them as the President and the First Lady. The people of  Houston know them and knew them as kind and wonderful and thoughtful  neighbors. That is the reason why so much of Houston is named after 41  and his wife, Barbara. They are special people, indeed.   In a special time in American history, they served their country and  they devoted their life to public service: first, here in the House of  Representatives, where George H.W. Bush served for but a short period  of time; then, at the highest levels of government, as Ambassador to  the United Nations, as Director of the CIA, and as an Ambassador to  China.   Sadly, we lost President George H.W. Bush in November of 2018, just a  few months after his wife, Barbara, passed away on April 17, 2018.   We know of their devotion to the American people, and what we have  before us is legislation that authorizes the U.S. Mint to make $1 coins  honoring the service and extraordinary lives of former President and  First Lady Bush.   President Bush's decades of service first began in World War II,  where he made a rare feat of surviving after being shot down over the  Pacific. So we know of his full life of service. We know of their  family's full devotion to us as the American people, and we thank them  for their service.   It is an honor to be on the floor of this House of Representatives to  speak in honor of such an important life and work. This is but a small  statement of our gratitude for what they did for us and how they served  us.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  the great State of Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who is the ranking member of  the National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy  Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Williams), my colleague and member of the House Financial  Services Committee, the lead House sponsor of the legislation we are  considering today.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire of the Chair the time  remaining on our side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Arrington), a former George W. Bush administration  appointee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, in writing about George H.W. Bush it was said duty was  duty. In 1975, there is this move in the administration to shuttle off  George H.W. Bush to a nondescript position. The assumption was if  George H.W. Bush was offered a job in public service, he was going to  say no because it wasn't the right job for him. Instead, President Bush  said yes and served our Nation as director of the CIA at a moment in  American history where that agency had massive need for reform and  change and also to rebuild its capacity to protect us as Americans.   It was written about him, ``Your message came as a total and complete  shock,'' Bush wrote to his friend, Henry Kissinger. ``Henry, you did  not know my father. The President did,'' meaning President Nixon. ``My  dad inculcated into his sons a set of values that have served me well.  In my own short public life''--not realizing that 20 years hence he  would still be in public service--``one of these values quite simply is  that one should serve his country and his President.''   That is what George H.W. Bush wrote in 1975, his notion of public  service. Whether you are a Republican or Democrat, those words of  public service of the need for us as individual Americans to do our  duty when called upon and to offer ourselves to serve the public and to  serve our fellow man is something that was commendable in 1975 and is  absolutely commendable and especially commendable this day.   On the floor this day, on both sides of the aisle, we honor an  amazing legacy of what he became known as, as 41. The 41st President of  the United States and his First Lady, not just during his time in the  White House, but his first lady in his life, Barbara Pierce Bush. We  know of their family legacy and the generations they have given this  country in public service, but we also know the amazing legacy of that  World War II generation that he represented and the legacy of public  service and trying to get things done for the American people.                                time  1830    Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to speak in favor of this resolution,  this bill today, and I ask my colleagues to support this recognition of  the lives, the dedication, and the selflessness of 41 and First Lady  Bush.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
