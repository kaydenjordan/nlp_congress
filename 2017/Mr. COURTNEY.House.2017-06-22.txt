 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support on reauthorizing  the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which really  should be just called the JOBS Act. As we have heard from Members all  across the country, Members are hearing the same thing from their  employer community, which is jobs exist, but skills don't.   What this bill does is it connects people to that job market in  response to the fact that the 21st century market is dynamic and  changing, and this bill really gets it in terms of getting to that  point.   In May, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that there are 5.9  million job openings in the U.S. economy; a record high since they even  started collecting that data. So our job as Members of Congress is to  update the law and update these programs to align  [[Page H5079]]  it with the Workforce Investment Act, which was passed in 2014, and the  Every Student Succeeds Act, which was passed again in the last  Congress.   This will be the final piece of the puzzle, which will, again, make  sure that millions of Americans will have the opportunity to have good- paying jobs that they can support themselves and their families. In  sector after sector, whether it is IT, whether it is healthcare,  whether it is advanced manufacturing, all are going to benefit from  this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate both of the sponsors for their great work  on this, and I urge all Members to support it.
