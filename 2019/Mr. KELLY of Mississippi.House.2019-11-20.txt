 Madam Speaker, as we remember the first  Thanksgiving when settlers broke bread with their Native American  allies and shared fruits of their harvest, I rise today to thank our  Nation's farmers.   As Thanksgiving approaches and we prepare to enjoy the holiday meal  with our families, I would be remiss if I did not take time to thank  the Americans whose labor allows us to put food on our tables.   Along with our military, our farmers are the hardest working, most  skilled, and patriotic citizens in our country. They rise before dawn  and work long after dusk to ensure our Nation can feed and clothe the  world.   I urge this body to uphold its commitment to our farmers by passing  the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and ensure American  agriculture remains the strongest and most competitive in the world.   I hope my colleagues will join me today in giving thanks to America's  farmers during this Thanksgiving season.                            ____________________
