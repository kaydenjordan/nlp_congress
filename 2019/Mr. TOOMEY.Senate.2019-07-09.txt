 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the very high- stakes political and social crisis that has been unfolding in Hong Kong  over the past several weeks.   Hong Kong is a very exceptional city. It boasts of a very robust free  market economy that has thrived for centuries. It has a very vibrant  free press. It has an independent judiciary and a partially democratic  election system. Those freedoms, combined with Hongkongers' natural  entrepreneurial spirit and appreciation for individual liberty, have  made Hong Kong a jewel of the financial and business world, one of the  freest places in Asia, and a great place to live--for a time, anyway,  as I did back in 1991.   Economic and political achievements are particularly impressive when  you consider that Hong Kong is, after all, a part of China, which has  neither a free economy nor a politically free society.   Back in 1997, Great Britain transferred Hong Kong to China on a  condition--an explicit written agreement--that Hong Kong's social and  economic systems would remain unchanged under a ``one country, two  systems'' arrangement that would last for at least 50 years, until  2047.   The Chinese Government also made a pledge at the time--a pledge that  Hong Kong's legislative and executive leaders would be elected through  ``universal suffrage.'' Yet, here we are, 22 years later. Hongkongers  still do not enjoy complete universal suffrage, and Hong Kong has faced  deep and persistent efforts by the mainland to erode the independence  and the authority of Hongkongers.   On the surface, this ongoing crisis in Hong Kong was clearly caused  by the Hong Kong Government, probably at the behest of the Chinese  leadership in Beijing to pass a deeply unpopular extradition bill. This  bill would diminish Hong Kong's independent legal system very  dramatically, and it would do so by allowing and exposing individuals  in Hong Kong--including Hong Kong citizens, foreigners, and even  tourists--to being extradited to China.   The accused would then face prosecution by an authoritarian  government in mainland China that does not uphold the rule of law, nor  does it practice the fair and impartial administration of justice.  Let's face it. The judicial system in China is politicized and  controlled by the Chinese Communist Party.   Some people are concerned that if this bill were to become law, it  would even pave the way for Chinese state-sponsored kidnapping of  dissidents. It certainly would have a chilling effect on freedom in  Hong Kong, a chilling effect on the ability of Hong Kong people to live  their lives and express their views without the fear of political  repercussions. It is simply a fact that mainland China is a legal black  hole, and Hong Kong's extradition bill would be a step to exposing Hong  Kong residents directly to mainland China's opaque and often blatantly  unfair legal system.   In response to this threat, the people of Hong Kong have for weeks  poured into the streets, calling for a withdrawal of this bill and  deeper democratic reforms. Remarkably, last month, one of these  protests--one of these demonstrations brought together an estimated 2  million Hongkongers into the streets. It is stunning anywhere in the  world that 2 million people would come out to protest anything. But in  Hong Kong, it is truly staggering because the total population of Hong  Kong is only 7.4 million. That is about one in four Hongkongers who  were on the streets protesting.   Just today, the Hong Kong Chief Executive said that bill was dead.  But it has not been formally withdrawn, as I understand it, and I think  the threat remains.   It is also important to note that on a deeper level these ongoing  protests are really a response to efforts by the Chinese Government to  ``mainlandize'' Hong Kong. It is an effort in which political,  cultural, and even physical distinctions between Hong Kong and mainland  China are meant to be diminished, the differences blurred, and the  distinction eroded.   The extradition bill is just the latest example of the Hong Kong  people's struggle for the freedom, democracy, and respect for human  rights that they cherish, that they want to hold on to, and that were  promised to them when the handover occurred in 1997.   Hongkongers really have a rich history of protest, and I think that  history reveals their enduring grassroots desire for the freedoms they  have grown to love and cherish and for a democratic form of government  that they deserve.   Back in 1989, the Tiananmen Square massacre that we all remember--the  30th anniversary was just last month. On the eve of the massacre, once  it was clear the Chinese Communist Government would respond to peaceful  protesters with bullets and tanks--once that became clear, about 1.5  million Hongkongers marched in the streets of Hong Kong in solidarity  with the students in Tiananmen.   In 2003, the Hong Kong leadership proposed an anti-subversion bill.  Hongkongers rightly saw this bill as an attack on their freedom of  speech and freedom of association. The Hong Kong leadership proposed  it--again, doing it at the behest of the mainland Chinese Government-- and 500,000 citizens protested and eventually forced the government to  withdraw the bill.   In 2014, the Hong Kong Government announced a reform to change how  Hong Kong's Chief Executive was selected. The proposal was meant to  continue what already existed, and that was mainland Chinese Communist  control over the election process in Hong Kong. One of the mechanisms  they used to achieve this was that only candidates vetted by a  committee of mostly pro-Beijing supporters would be allowed to seek the  office of Chief Executive.   In response to this undemocratic measure, Hong Kong students staged a  campaign of civil disobedience and peaceful protest to oppose this  effort. Up to a half a million people participated in the movement.  Students famously used umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas and  pepper spray that was being launched at them by the police, so much so  that the pro-democracy protesters were quickly termed the ``Umbrella  Movement.''   All of these protests and acts of civil disobedience make it clear  that Hongkongers want more freedom, not less freedom.   I think this matters. This matters obviously in Hong Kong, but it  matters  [[Page S4715]]  beyond Hong Kong. It matters to us. It should matter to us. What is  happening in Hong Kong is not just important for those residents but  for the rest of the world. Today the people of Hong Kong are fighting  against an unpopular and unfair extradition bill. They are really  fighting for a future in which they can enjoy basic human rights,  natural rights that everyone should have, including the right to free  speech, the right to a fair trial, the right to be confident that your  government will follow the laws of the society in which it exists, and  participation in a just and fair representative system of government.   If the Chinese officials in Beijing and the Communist Chinese who  rule mainland China have their way, they will extinguish these rights  for the people of Hong Kong. If the extradition bill were to become  law, it would threaten all of those rights because of the chilling  effect of the threat of being extradited to the lawlessness of the  Chinese judicial system.   In some important ways, I think Hong Kong can be seen as a canary in  a coal mine for Asia. What happens in Hong Kong will at least set  expectations, create a climate that will maybe affect what happens in  Taiwan over time, other Asian nations that are struggling for freedom  in the shadow of China. The fact is, China itself is controlled by an  authoritarian government, interested primarily in its own survival.  That is the top priority of Beijing's leadership. They have created a  modern-day police state. They use mass surveillance, censorship,  internet applications in order to control their own citizens. They have  imprisoned over a million of their own citizens, the Muslim Uighur  minorities, in concentration camps.   China's authoritarianism threatens free and open societies all around  the world. A democratic Hong Kong is a direct threat to the Communist  regime in Beijing because people across China, naturally, ask the  question: Why do Hongkongers get to have more rights and a better life  and more freedom than we have? That is the threat the government in  Beijing is trying to extinguish.   We, of course, recently had the blessing of being able to celebrate  our own Independence Day, when Americans reflect on our own struggle  against tyranny, against an unjust government, and our successful  effort to throw that off and establish this, the world's greatest, most  vibrant, and freest democratic society.   In many ways, the Hongkongers are fighting for some of the very same  values as our Founding Fathers did during the American Revolution. I  think it is important that we in the United States not turn a blind eye  to the struggle for freedom that is happening outside our borders. I  think it is important that Americans continue to stand in support of  the voices in Hong Kong calling for freedom, for democracy, and respect  for basic human rights. I will do what I can in the Senate to support  the people of Hong Kong in their peaceful protests for their own  freedom, and I call on my colleagues in this administration to join me.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
