 Madam President, I rise today to honor a group of  Missouri's finest high school football teams. Last week, there was a  lot of memorable football that was played for State trophies. From  Lamar High School's dramatic comeback to Marionville High School's  dominant display and Archie Whirlwind's victory, each game encapsulated  the spirit of determination and excellence. These championships not  only showcased remarkable individual and team performances but also  underscored the deep-rooted passion for football in Missouri. The  stories of these teams--their struggles, their strategies, and their  victories--are a testament to the celebrated history of high school  football in the State.   On December 2, 2023, the Lamar High School football team achieved a  remarkable 35-28 overtime victory against Valle Catholic (12-2) in the  Class 2 Show-Me Bowl. The Lamar Tigers, with a season record of 13-1,  overcame a challenging 21-0 first-quarter deficit to clinch their ninth  State championship. Quarterback Alex Wilkerson, alongside a formidable  defense that conceded only one touchdown after the first quarter,  played pivotal roles. Wilkerson's 25-yard touchdown kickstarted the  overtime, and the Tigers' defense sealed the win by preventing Valle  Catholic from gaining any first downs in OT.   On December 1, 2023, Marionville High School's football team won the  class 1 state championship, defeating North Platte (12-2) with a  decisive 29-0 score. The team's fast, physical playing style was  evident right from the start. Their opening drive was 14 plays that led  to a touchdown by Hugh Eaton. Head coach Padden Grubbs commended his  team's tough, physical approach and their resilience against  challenging weather conditions. For the seniors, this victory marked  the culmination of an impressive undefeated 14-0 record this season.   On November 30, 2023, the Archie High School Whirlwinds (14-0), in  the eight-man State title game, won 40-26 over the Worth County High  School Tigers (12-2). Archie Whirlwinds' quarterback, Briar McIntire,  scored an impressive five rushing touchdowns. This strong performance  by the team's quarterback was coupled with a dominant offensive and  defensive line. Despite Worth County's brief resurgence, Archie  maintained control, which was led by McIntire. The game ended with  Worth County scoring 12 unanswered points to make it a two-score game;  however, their attempt at comeback was thwarted by the Whirlwind's  strong defense.   In closing, the Missouri high school football championships of 2023  were an impressive combination of talent, teamwork, and tenacity. Each  team, regardless of victory, demonstrated a remarkable blend of skill,  strategy, and sportsmanship. These teams have etched their names in the  annals of Missouri's sports history. Congratulations to all the teams  that competed in these games, and a special congratulations to Lamar,  Marionville, and Archie for their outstanding accomplishments in the  2023 State championships.                            ____________________
