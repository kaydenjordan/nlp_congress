 Madam Speaker, today, I would like to acknowledge the  Puerto Rican Action Committee of southern New Jersey, an organization  dedicated to supporting the Hispanic community in our area.   PRAC was originally created in 1971 to promote economic opportunities  for agricultural workers and has since expanded its vision to encourage  social, cultural, and economic actions that better the lives of  Hispanic individuals. The organization has several programs in place to  celebrate the vibrant culture of these people and to provide  educational opportunity for the surrounding communities.   The PRAC of southern New Jersey has implemented Hispanic culture,  arts, heritage, entertainment, and sporting initiatives to bring people  together and to foster a sense of good community. Among all Hispanic  individuals in south Jersey, community is so important.   The group also offers cultural diversity training programs to local  companies in order to encourage a diverse workforce and to open job  opportunities for minorities across the entire region.   PRAC has been fundamental in lifting up the Hispanic members of our  community, and we thank them for the great work they do to make south  Jersey an inclusive and prosperous place.                            ____________________
