 Mr. Speaker, over the past year, we have witnessed  unacceptable acts of violence across our country. We have watched lives  and livelihoods being destroyed.   Even now, after one of the most challenging years Americans have  faced in recent history, the violence continues. In just the past few  days, in both Portland and Seattle, rioters smashed the doors and  windows of local small businesses, violently assaulted police officers,  and firebombed the local courthouse.   In January, I called on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  take a stand against political violence. But rather than condemning  these appalling acts, politicians and the media continue to turn a  blind eye. They ignore, downplay, and even defend these despicable and  violent actions. It is inexcusable.   When we see this violence, we must condemn it for what it is:  domestic terror.   Mr. Speaker, I stand firm against all acts of violence, and I  continue to call on this body to do the same.  [[Page H1483]]                                ____________________
