 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  work at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's research lab in Peoria,  Illinois.   For more than 75 years, the Ag Lab has conducted breakthrough  research, impacting lives of people all over the world.   Decades after discovering how to mass-produce penicillin, the Ag Lab  just found out how to enhance its effectiveness in people who have  developed antibiotic resistance. They have also developed an all- natural bug repellent that is more effective than DEET.   Unfortunately, the 200 employees at the Ag Lab have been sent home  due to this government shutdown, putting their groundbreaking research  at a dead halt.   It is time to stop using workers as pawns in this government  shutdown. We must put this shutdown to an end so the Ag Lab can  continue its advanced research that drives American agriculture and our  economy.                            ____________________
