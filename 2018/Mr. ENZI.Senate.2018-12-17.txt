 Mr. President, earlier this month, Congress sent the  President another continuing resolution to allow more time to resolve  the partisan impasse that has us on the brink of a government shutdown  once again. A continuing resolution just allows agencies to continue to  spend money without knowing how much they actually get to spend.   The current episode is yet another example of the breakdown of what  should be the basic nuts and bolts of government--keeping the  government open and funded. In other words, they have been spending  money since last October without knowing how much money they get to  spend. So I come to the floor today to talk about the need to reform  our broken budget and appropriations process and to lay out a few ideas  I have for how to do that.   As chairman of the Budget Committee, I have worked on budget  appropriations and process reform for several years and always believed  that changes need to be guided by two core principles. The first  principle is that reforms should end brinksmanship and the threat of  government shutdowns; and No. 2, reforms should guide us to create  enforceable plans to stop the outrageous growth of our Federal debt,  which is approaching $22 trillion.   According to the Congressional Budget Office, Federal debt held by  the public, as a percentage of our economy, is at the highest level  since shortly after World War II. That debt is expected to rise sharply  over the next 30 years if current laws generally remain unchanged.  Quite simply, our budget problems are too severe to be put off any  longer. Yet our dysfunctional budget and appropriations process is  making it harder for Congress to tackle our pressing fiscal challenges.   To start, one easy thing we could do to improve the process is to  change the names of the Budget and Appropriations Committees to better  reflect each committee's function.   The Budget Committee, which is tasked with crafting an annual fiscal  framework to guide Congress, really should be called the Debt Control  Committee. The Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for  making the actual decisions about how money is spent each year, should  be renamed the Budget and Appropriations Committee.   Too often, when we come up against appropriations deadlines, as we  are now, press reports declare that Congress has to pass the budget to  avoid a shutdown. Not true. The budget passed a long time ago. In  reality, the budget reflects the start of the process, and  appropriations reflects the end. Changing these committees' names would  more clearly delineate their actual responsibilities and thereby make  it easier for them to be carried out and understood by the public.   A second important change would be to finally admit that Congress is  not capable of sending 12 appropriations bills to the President before  the September 30 end of the fiscal year each year. The current process  leaves Congress in a nearly perpetual quest to develop and pass 12  funding bills for the next fiscal year to avoid a funding lapse. Yet  the sheer size and complexity of the Federal budget and appropriations  process virtually guarantee that Congress will not consider all the  appropriations bills individually each year. In the last 40 years, we  have succeeded only four times in passing all of the appropriations  bills on time. Let me repeat that. In the last 40 years, we have  succeeded only four times in passing all of the appropriations bills on  time.    Our inability to pass appropriations bills on the current schedule  has made reliance on continuing resolutions a routine part of the  process, and it comes with a cost. The Department of Defense has  operated under a continuing resolution for an average of 81 days per  year; that is almost 3 months per year since 2001, with a particularly  bad spate since 2009, in which we averaged 134 days per year. That is  almost 4\1/2\ months of not knowing how much they are going to get to  spend, let alone planning for the future.   Earlier this year, the Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer,  identified $4 billion in waste owing to the lack of financial stability  resulting from these continuing resolutions--this lack of knowing how  much to spend. He said:         Since 2001, we have put $4 billion in the trash can, poured       lighter fluid on top of it, and burned it. . . . It's enough       money that it can buy us the additional capacity and       capability that we need. Instead, the $4 billion of taxpayer       money has been lost because of inefficiencies [caused by]       continuing resolutions.    While it is true that this year we were able to pass and get signed  five appropriation bills prior to September 30--remarkably, an  improvement from recent years--that still leaves seven bills yet to be  enacted.   To address this problem, I have proposed moving to a biennial system  and halving the number of appropriations  [[Page S7649]]  bills considered each year so that six would be considered in the first  session of Congress and six would be considered in the second--each of  them, of course, for 2 years to allow for more planning. By providing a  more realistic and attainable schedule, we could allow for a more  thoughtful process for considering individual bills. We would free up  more time for oversight of Federal spending. We would actually get to  look at some of the details of the dollars we are spending, and we  would reduce the likelihood of continuing resolutions and large, year- end spending bills--with everything attached to it--that are  inefficient and too often loaded with waste. We could also give  agencies the certainty they need to plan and make wise decisions  regarding how to implement funding.   But successful and timely enactment of the appropriations bills is  only part of the solution. We also need to look at the mandatory side  of the ledger and programs that don't have adequate revenue to maintain  obligations--the ones we don't ever get to make a decision on. Any new  mandatory programs should be self-financing or offset by the  elimination of existing programs that we would continue to fund. In  other words, nothing should be mandatory if it doesn't have a stream of  money big enough to pay for it.   We also need to look at ending the spending bias that begins with a  current baseline--current amount of spending--and automatically adjusts  for inflation.   To address the long-term structural deficit problems, we need to  create enforceable spending targets that are monitored and enforced  annually to make sure lawmakers stay focused on deficit reduction and  achieving a suitable Federal budget. The newly revamped Debt Control  Committee should be empowered to establish its targets and enforce  spending constraints. For example, if we followed my penny plan and cut  spending by 1 cent out of every dollar each year for the next 5 years,  we could balance the budget.   Once enforceable targets are agreed upon, we should conform the debt  limit to them. I know that dealing with the debt limit in a responsible  manner is a priority for many of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle. I am ready to work with them on it.   We are not talking about sequester here; I am suggesting precision  cuts on the low priorities. First of all, sequester happened late in  the year, so there wasn't much money left to take the money out of,  which made it a much larger reduction from those spending bills. They  also picked the projects they thought would be most noticeable and cut  those, realizing that the American public would rise up in arms and  make sure that it was reinstated, and that happened. They always picked  the most visible and the most painful.   What we have to do is get to precision cuts in the things we haven't  even looked at. I have a list of how many things we haven't looked at.  Some programs haven't been looked at since 1983, but they continue to  get an annual inflation increase anyway--sometimes greater than the  annual increase.   Each of the above suggestions would improve our process, help us  control spending, and meet our constitutional obligations. I plan to  pursue them in the next Congress and look forward to working with my  colleagues on these and other ideas.   However, while reforms are needed, the reality is there will never be  a perfect process, and no reform by itself could force the hard  decisions that are needed. What we need is leadership and a commitment  from both sides to work together to do what we know needs to be done to  confront these challenges.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on these critical  challenges in the next Congress.   I yield the floor.
