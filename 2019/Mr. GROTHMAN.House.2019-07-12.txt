 Madam Speaker, on July 12, 2019, the House voted to  pass the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2020. I missed the  vote and was not recorded due to a previously scheduled engagement in  Wisconsin with President Trump. Had I been present I would have voted  no on Roll Call 473.                            ____________________
