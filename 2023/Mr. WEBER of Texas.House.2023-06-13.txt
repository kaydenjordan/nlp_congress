 Mr. Chair, would that the other side of the aisle  cared as much about unborn babies and worried about their safety as  well.   Mr. Chair, let's get this right. First, the Biden administration  decides to come after the cars that Americans drive, then it is how  Americans heat their homes, and now they want to determine how  Americans cook their food? For what?   All in the name of climate change? Oh, this ought to help, making  sure that Americans can only use stoves that they think they ought to  use.   Mr. Chair, I am not sure what dimension--or might I say dementia-- that the Biden administration is living in, but the American people do  not want out-of-touch bureaucrats to control what stoves they use in  their houses.   I might add that folks in my great State of Texas have a slogan,  ``Don't Mess with Texas.'' My message to the Biden administration is,  don't mess with our gas stoves.   House Republicans, Mr. Chair, are tired of the blatant overreach, and  that is why I am proud to cosponsor the Save Our Gas Stoves Act, and I  urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.   Once we get this bill passed, then we can say, now we are cooking  with gas.
