 Madam Speaker, I rise today to strongly oppose the lack of  transparency by Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats' impeachment inquiry  into President Donald Trump, our duly elected President.   Instead of following precedent and putting the Judiciary Committee in  charge of this process, Speaker Pelosi has empowered the House  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence chairman, Adam Schiff, to  run this effort behind closed doors in secret, with no accountability,  and he is handpicking what information to leak.   What happened to Chairman Nadler over in the Judiciary Committee? If  Democrats truly believe that this is the right thing to do, why don't  they hold a vote? The Democrats' complete disregard for following a  fair process is alarming, and quite frankly, it is un-American.   They are misleading the American people while ignoring action on the  pressing issues at hand. The truth is, they have only one goal, and  that is to undermine President Trump and ensure he cannot do what he  was elected to do, like passing the USMCA, immigration reform,  modernizing healthcare, and securing our border.   Let's end this nonsense and get to work on issues that matter to the  American people.                            ____________________
