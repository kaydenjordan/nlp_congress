 Madam Speaker, as the Congresswoman from the District of  Columbia, where the January 6 insurrection occurred, I was one of the  first Members of Congress to call for and introduce legislation to  create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the attack and to ensure  that it never happens again. I strongly support the commission bill.   The supplemental security appropriations bill provides $66.7 million  to eliminate the long-running deficit in the Federally-funded D.C.  Emergency Planning and Security Fund. That fund pays for the unique  public safety and security costs D.C. incurs as the Nation's capital,  and is designed to cover the District's costs up front, so that D.C.  does not have to expend local funds for Federal purposes and seek an  appropriation to be reimbursed after the fact.   Over the last several years, our Republican colleagues have opposed  fully funding the D.C. Fund. The January 6 insurrection shows Congress  must never shortchange security in the Nation's Capitol again.   I also appreciate that the appropriations bill would mirror two of my  bills.    I also appreciate that the appropriations bill would  mirror two of my bills, prohibiting the use of funds in the bill to  install permanent aboveground fencing at the Capitol complex, and  requiring Capitol Police officers to wear body cameras.   In February, I introduced legislation to prohibit funds for permanent  fencing at the Capitol complex, and in March the House passed my bill  to require Federal police officers to wear body cameras as part of the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021.
