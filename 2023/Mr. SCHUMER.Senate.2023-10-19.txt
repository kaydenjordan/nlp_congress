 Mr. President, yesterday, I joined with Senate  colleagues for an all-Senators classified briefing on the Israel-Gaza  conflict.   At the briefing, I asked Secretary Austin when he needs emergency  funding for our ongoing efforts, and what he said was clear. He said:  ``We need it,'' and in very strong terms, he said the word  ``yesterday.'' The Israeli leaders we met over the weekend used the  same exact word, ``yesterday.'' That means the Senate cannot wait, and  we will not wait. We also talked about the situation on the ground in  Israel and Gaza at our briefing.   As was made clear yesterday, the intelligence community assesses that  according to the current analysis and available intelligence, Israel is  not to blame for the explosion of the hospital in Gaza. As was made  clear yesterday--and I checked this, and I was allowed to say it from  our intelligence community--the intelligence community assesses that  according to the current analysis and available intelligence, Israel is  not to blame for the explosion of the hospital in Gaza. Our  intelligence believes it was an errant rocket from terrorists aligned  with Hamas in Gaza.   Spreading inaccuracies, as Hamas so often does at painful times like  this, is supremely risky and only endangers more human life. There is a  lot of misinformation circulating in the chaos of this war, and it is  incumbent on all of us to ensure that we don't fan the flames and  increase tensions, particularly when we are relying on a very, very  difficult issue from a source that is known to lie all the time.   We all know, of course, the loss of any innocent life is terrible.  The loss of innocent Israeli life, Palestinian life, any innocent life.  I saw the pictures of the children in the hospital. I feel very badly  about it. We have to condemn that at every turn.   But when seeking the truth, it is imperative--utterly imperative-- that people don't merely take the first thing they hear and run with  it, particularly when it comes from a group like Hamas, known to spread  lie after lie after lie. We should not sprint to believe the word of  organizations like Hamas, a terrorist group, while ignoring the facts  and findings of our own intelligence.   That is why I was pleased President Biden made clear that our  intelligence indicates terrorists in Gaza were responsible for this  tragedy. I was also  [[Page S5094]]  glad to see that the President in Tel Aviv yesterday was on point:  America will stand with Israel. America will help them defeat Hamas.   But he also said everyone must be deliberate at this moment, and we  must unequivocally work to protect civilian life during conflict. That  is a really tough job, particularly when Hamas puts hostages in the  middle of civilian populations, rockets, military equipment in the  middle of civilian populations and uses them as shields.   But even having said how difficult this is, Israel, being a  democracy, has to live to a higher standard. And we made that point-- all of us--when we visited Israel, as much as we wanted the Israelis to  know we stand by them and will give them the equipment that they need.   This morning, the Senate will pass a bipartisan resolution affirming  that the Senate stands firmly with Israel and firmly against Hamas.  Hopefully, the Senate will speak in one voice that Israel is our friend  and that Hamas's attack is reprehensible and that we will stand with  our friends to defend themselves.   Our resolution has overwhelming--nearly unanimous--support in the  Senate on both sides. We are working with the few who have some  problems to solve their problems so we can get this done.   By the end of the week, the President will send the Senate a  supplemental request to provide Israel the military intelligence,  diplomatic, and humanitarian aid it needs. When the Senate receives  this request, we will spring into action and move it as soon as we can.   Secretary Austin was clear: They need these funds yesterday,  especially right now as extremists have brought the House of  Representatives to complete paralysis. The world needs to see a U.S.  Senate united in action. Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber must  send an unmistakable message that the work of legislating is not going  to stop over here because of chaos in the other Chamber. And if we act  with enough bipartisan strength, it is my hope that it could help the  House snap out of its delirium and get back to the business of  governing, not letting a small hard-right group simply tie the House in  a knot because they are not getting their way. Every day counts  immensely.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on a detained journalist.  Unfortunately, yesterday, authorities detained a journalist with dual  U.S.-Russian citizenship on specious charges of failing to register as  a foreign agent. Alsu Kurmasheva is now the second American journalist  detained by Russia this year after Evan Gershkovich of the Wall Street  Journal was arrested in March.   We unequivocally condemn Russia's unjustifiable detention of Alsu  Kurmasheva and of Evan Gershkovich, and we demand they be released  immediately.   It is no secret that Russia has a long and disturbing history of  unjustly detaining U.S. citizens, especially members of the free press.  But let me be clear: Journalism is not a crime and should never be met  with persecution, intimidation, and suppression.   America stands with Alsu Kurmasheva, Evan Gershkovich, and their  families.                            ____________________     Now on the minibus, over the course of this week, I have  worked closely with Democratic and Republican appropriators to move  forward on the bipartisan Senate appropriations process. We have made a  lot of progress this week trying to reach an agreement on amendments.  We are getting close to an agreement, but we are not there yet, so we  will keep working today.   Here in the Senate, unlike the chaos of the House, most Members on  both sides want to see bipartisanship because that is the only way  things move forward in a divided government. And the Appropriations  Committee, under the leadership of Chair Murray and Ranking Member  Collins, have done a very good job passing out all the bills with  overwhelming bipartisan majorities, many of them unanimously.   But there is one crucial point: When we came to agreement to move  these bills, both sides committed to stopping poison pill amendments  because that would risk ending the process. Sadly, a small group on the  other side have tried adding poison pills, and we have been dealing  with them over the last few weeks. I am optimistic that we will work  through these poison pills and pass these bipartisan bills soon.   Democrats made a commitment to our Republican colleagues to pursue  regular order as much as possible because we want to get these  appropriations bills done. We have committed to having debates and  votes on relevant, non-poison pill amendments. I think there are 39 or  so lined up. But while we are getting close, the work is not done.   We are going to keep working today. If people want to know why it is  moving slowly, it is because of Republican insistence on poison pill  amendments. But that is not going to stop us. We are going to keep  moving forward, and we are going to try to vote on amendments soon.   So, once again, thank you to the whole Appropriations Committee on  both sides. I am optimistic we can get this done.                            ____________________     Finally on our wonderful Senate Historian. An old quote  goes:         To study history means submitting yourself to chaos, but       nevertheless retaining your faith in order and meaning.    That is a great quote, very relevant today in this Congress. I don't  imagine that the author of that line was thinking about the U.S.  Senate, but I cannot think of a more apt description of the duties of  the Senate Historian.   For the last 8 years, the Senate has been blessed with the wonderful  erudite Historian, Betty Koed--only the third Historian ever and the  first woman to hold the position.   Sadly, this week marks the end of Betty's remarkable tenure in the  Senate, which dates back to her earliest days as Assistant Historian in  1998. So she began in the Senate Historical Office the same year I  began running for the Senate. I didn't know her at that point, but I am  sure glad I have gotten to know her now.   It is a great undertaking to chronicle the history of an institution  so unique, so rich with significant events, so influential in the  landscape of our Nation. But for the last 25 years, Betty has done that  with the utmost professionalism, devotion, and a bit of a flair.   Every week, she gives us a little history lesson at our Tuesday  lunches, and every Member looks forward to hearing what she has come up  with, and it is amazing. We learn a lot, and we enjoy it.   As Senate Historian, Betty was tasked with the extraordinary  responsibility to preserve, protect, and promote the history of the  Senate and the multitudes of Members who served in this Chamber. She  has not only been a student of Senate history but a teacher of it as  well. Thanks to her work developing education programs and exhibits,  generations of Americans will have the means to learn about the Senate  and the U.S. Capitol.   I was proud to lead a resolution with Leader McConnell and all other  98 Senators commemorating Betty's decades of service and officially  designating her--congratulations, Betty--as ``Historian Emerita'' of  the United States Senate.   So on behalf of a grateful Senate, a grateful country, and a very  grateful majority leader, I thank Betty for her service and wish her  the best moving forward.   Congratulations, Historian Emerita.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 417, submitted  earlier today; that at 1:45 p.m., the Senate vote on adoption of the  resolution; that if the resolution is agreed to, the preamble be agreed  to and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table without intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have two cloture motions, and then I  ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to address the Senate before we  vote on the resolution.    Mr. President, first, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 364.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.  [[Page S5102]]     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 116.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, October 19, be waived.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I have a brief statement on this very  important resolution we are about to vote on.   Mr. President, October 7, 2023, will go down as a day of infamy. As  Israel faces the darkest hour of its 75-year history, the bipartisan  resolution we are about to vote on proclaims that so long as there is a  United States of America, the people of Israel will never stand alone.  So long as there is a United States Senate, the people of Israel will  never stand alone.   Today's bipartisan resolution shows exactly where the United States  Senate stands. We stand firmly with Israel and her right to defend  herself. Today's bipartisan resolution shows exactly where the United  States Senate stands. We condemn the heinous, vicious attacks by the  terrorist group Hamas. It is rare that all 100 Senators agree on  anything, but every one of the 100 of us is here today, united, saying  that we are behind Israel. Today's bipartisan resolution shows where we  stand.   We demand Hamas stop their attacks and release all hostages,  including American hostages. We urge the world to unite against Hamas  and against nations like Iran that support global terrorism.   This resolution is not the end; it is the beginning. The Senate will  back up this resolution with real, swift, decisive action and  resources.   Let the entire world see that today Democrats and Republicans alike  stand in total unity. We support Israel's absolute right to defend  itself.   To the Israeli people, we say: We stand with you, we feel your pain,  we ache with you, and we will act.   To any actor that seeks to take advantage of Israel, the United  States Senate says with one unified voice: Don't.   The resolution also does what everyone in this country in elected  office and the press should do: condemn Hamas as a heinous terrorist  organization.   This resolution is momentous. The entire Senate today is unified in  our support of the Israeli people and against Hamas. And again, to  repeat, this resolution is just the start. We will follow it up with  swift action and get Israel the help and resources she needs.   In conclusion, I want to thank Leader McConnell for joining me in  this statement and championing the measure. I want to thank Chairman  Cardin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as Ranking  Member Risch, for helping draft this resolution. I thank every Senator,  all 99 of my colleagues, for supporting this. We needed to stand  united, and today, we are. In the Senate, we will not waiver in our  friendship with the Israeli people.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Butler)  and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) are necessarily absent.
