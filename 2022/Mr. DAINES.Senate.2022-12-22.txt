 Mr. President, the purpose of the Pregnant Workers  Fairness Act is to help pregnant mothers in the workplace receive  accommodations so that they can maintain a healthy pregnancy and  childbirth. Therefore, I want to make clear for the record that the  terms ``pregnancy'' and ``related medical conditions,'' for which  accommodations to their known limitations are required under the  legislation, do not include abortion.   On December 8, the sponsor of this legislation, Senator Bob Casey  stated on the Senate floor as follows: ``I want to say for the record,  however, that under the act, under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act,  the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, the EEOC, could not--could  not--issue any regulation that requires abortion leave, nor does the  act permit the EEOC to require employers to provide abortions in  violation of State law.''   Senator Casey's statement reflects the intent of Congress in  advancing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act today. This legislation  should not be misconstrued by the EEOC or Federal courts to impose  abortion-related mandates on employers, or otherwise to promote  abortions, contrary to the intent of Congress.                            ____________________
