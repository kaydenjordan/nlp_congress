 Mr. President, some of our Republican colleagues said in  the past days, the budget debate is all about getting the tax reform.  The fact is, this is a fast lane to a partisan process for dealing with  taxes. When it comes to the Republican plan, you get a lot of rhetoric  and a lot of happy talk. You hear it is the biggest tax cut ever. You  hear it is about the middle class.   Just this morning, the President tweeted the Democrats will only vote  for tax increases, but that rhetoric is just out of touch with reality.  For example, our 2015 bill, of which I was the lead Democratic sponsor,  cut taxes $650 billion. It went to the heart of the needs of young  people in this country with the American opportunity tax credit, the  earned-income tax credit, but it also helped farmers--farmers who are  concerned about expensing the research and development credit for our  innovators.   That is the kind of approach we ought to take that is bipartisan,  that helps people in this country. Everybody has a chance to get ahead.  The fact is, the Tax Code on the books is now a tale of two systems.  There is a strict mandatory system for a cop or a nurse. Their taxes  come right out of every paycheck. It is mandatory. There are no special  Cayman Island deals for them.   Then there is another set of rules for the highfliers, the most  fortunate. They can, with good lawyers and good accountants, decide  what they want to pay and when they want to pay it. That is the rotting  source of unfairness that is at the heart of the American Tax Code.  That is why so many hard-working Americans think they are getting a  rotten deal every April 15. That is the brand of unfairness Ronald  Reagan was interested in going after, but somehow we can't get that  same kind of spirit from Republicans at this point on this tax bill.   The Trump tax cut doubles down on the rotten unfairness in the Tax  Code. It is a multitrillion-dollar handout to those who are the most  powerful, and it is very generous to those at the top of the top, which  is why this amendment with Senator Sanders is so important. The Trump  tax plan, at this point, doesn't just fail to close the most egregious  loopholes, but it enshrines them for good.    The amendment that Senator Sanders and I are putting forward is  pretty simple. It says that in this tax bill we are going to put the  focus on the middle class. We are not just going to focus on people at  the top. That is why the amendment creates a point of order against the  plan that gives a tax handout to the top of the top of the income  spectrum in our country.   If you are a middle-class family, according to what is offered now,  the Republican plan giveth with one hand and taketh away with another.  The standard deduction might be doubled, but you are going to lose  personal exemptions, and if you come from a State with a significant  State and local tax structure, you are going to find it very hard to  get ahead.   That is what we want to change. We will not want a scheme that hides  the true multitrillion-dollar cost of the tax giveaways to those at the  top. We want relief to go to those at the middle.   I close by saying that the Sanders-Wyden amendment is based on a  simple principle, and that is that we want to expand the winners'  circle for working Americans--those without lobbyists, those without  clout--to have a chance to get ahead. They have been left out of the  economic winners' circle for too long. We want to put a focus on those  people who have felt the panic of seeing the costs of rent, college,  and medicine go up and up and up. Tax reform should be about helping  them. That is what the Sanders-Wyden amendment proposes.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.                              Amendment No. 1144     Mr. President, very briefly, I strongly support this  amendment, colleagues.   The point of this is, this is an amendment that does what the  President says he wants to do, which is not give relief to the people  at the top, but the reality is, when you look at their proposal, it  really does drive much of the wealth in America to those at the very  top.   The Sanders amendment is to ensure that people at the top of the top  don't get relief. We get it to working families and the vulnerable. I  urge colleagues to strongly support this amendment.
