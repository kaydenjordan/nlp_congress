 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address my strong  opposition to H.R. 8297, the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act.   Protecting the voiceless ought to be a top priority in this House and  in every corner of this land.   As a mother of four beautiful and strong children, I find it hard to  believe there are those who think defending life is optional, even to  the last month of pregnancy.   H.R. 8297 is the opposite of what brought me to Congress, and it is  the opposite of the values of the people of my district, Texas 34.   Let's be clear what this bill does: Undermines the ability of States  to hold sexual abusers accountable, stops States from preventing  abortion pill mills, and it gives human traffickers and abusers more  direct access to chemical abortions in all 50 States.   Protecting life shouldn't be political.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 8297.
