 Mr. Speaker, my friend Fahari Jeffers' legacy as a civil  rights and labor rights leader in American history had its beginning in  the Black Power movement. She joined the San Diego chapter of the U.S.  organization in 1967 and served as a teacher in the weekend School of  Afro-American Culture for Children.   A dedicated civil rights advocate and cultural rights powerhouse, she  became involved in labor union organizing, having convened the major  African People's gatherings in the 1970s and worked with the NIA  cultural organization in San Diego.   Fahari was proud of her roots in the Black Power movement. Her early  work prepared her for the work that Cesar Chavez recruited and trained  her and her husband, Ken Msemaji, to do in founding and building the  United Domestic Workers of America. Today, over 200,000 California  homecare workers and nearly 2 million nationally work under union  contracts. Her model of collective bargaining rights law is now  patterned across the Nation. On Sunday, March 18, 2018, Fahari Jeffers  [[Page H9104]]  was inducted into the San Diego Women's Hall of Fame for her work in  cofounding the United Domestic Workers of America.   With her passing, the State of California and our Nation suffered a  tremendous loss. She will be remembered for her ``si, se puede''  attitude and for exemplifying the meaning of her Swahili given name,  Fahari, which means magnificent, and magnificent she was.                            ____________________
