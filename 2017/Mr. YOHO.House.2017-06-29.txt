 Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure today to rise to welcome  Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the United States on the  occasion of his first visit as President.   The United States and the Republic of Korea share a longstanding  pivotal defense alliance, and we are bound together as fellow  democracies who share common values.  [[Page H5308]]    The U.S.-Korea relationship has been a growing partnership, and now  they are the United State's sixth largest trading partner. It is  Florida's third largest export market, and we have over 1,700 Korean  Americans in my district.   Korea is one of only five U.S. mutual defense allies in Asia, one of  only three nations in the region to have completed a bilateral trade  agreement with the United States, and hosts a U.S. military presence of  nearly 38,000 Americans.   The Republic of Korea is our foundational partner in facing the  gravest threats to the world's peace and security, and that is the  rogue nuclear regime of Kim Jong-un. We will continue to stand together  to address this grave threat and maintain our close bilateral  relationship.   I give my most sincere congratulations to President Moon Jae-in on  his first electoral victory, and I welcome him warmly to Washington  during such an important time.                            ____________________
