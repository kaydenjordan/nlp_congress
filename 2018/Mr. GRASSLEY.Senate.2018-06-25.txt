 Madam President, I come here to raise an issue, not  with the actual bill we will be voting on today but with language  included in a committee report accompanying the bill.   The Environmental Protection Agency has reportedly given out  unprecedented numbers of so-called small refinery hardship waivers to  the renewable fuel standard. These are given, in some cases, to huge  multibillion-dollar companies that probably would not be entitled to  what is really a hardship.   The EPA has yet to disclose what waivers it has granted and the  rationale, but based on what has been reported, its actions seem pretty  darn fishy, from my point of view. Refiners speaking with the press  have noted:         Anyone with a brain submitted an application. The EPA was       handing out those exemptions like trick or treat candy.    The EPA is hiding behind a very narrow court case for specific  refineries, as well as report language accompanying last year's Energy  and Water appropriations bill. Neither I nor any other Senator voted  for this report language. Report language accompanying bills are not  actually law so they are not legally binding.   Still, I wrote to the subcommittee that it should not include  language purporting to tell the EPA to do anything other than follow  the law. The law mandates blending 15 billion gallons of renewable  fuels into our fuel supply. Estimates are that these retroactive  waivers have reduced that by as much as 1.63 billion gallons. Every  billion gallons lost equates to a loss of more than 2 million acres of  harvested corn and an increase in emissions.   My constituents are outraged at this activity by the EPA. Agriculture  Secretary Perdue has called these waivers, in his words, ``demand  destruction'' for biofuels.   I wrote to the Energy and Water Subcommittee that it should urge the  EPA to disclose the waivers it gives and the rationale for any of these  grants and that any waivers should not result in a lowering of the 15  billion gallon renewable volume obligation in the law.   I am disappointed that the appropriators didn't include my  commonsense language about transparency, but I am very upset that it  renewed the previous language purporting to direct EPA how to consider  small refinery waivers. The Appropriations Committee should drop the  controversial report language and EPA should simply follow the law.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
