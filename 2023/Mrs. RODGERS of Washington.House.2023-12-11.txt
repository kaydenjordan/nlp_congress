Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1042, the Prohibiting  Russian Uranium Imports Act, which I introduced with Mr. Latta.   American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear technology is  critical to our economic and national security. One of the most urgent  security threats America faces right now is our dangerous reliance on  Russia's supply of nuclear fuels for our nuclear fleet. This threat has  intensified as a result of the war in Ukraine.   American nuclear fuel infrastructure has been stunted by policies  that Russia has exploited by flooding the U.S. market with this cheaper  fuel. Today that accounts for more than 20 percent of our nuclear fuels  for American reactors.   Last year alone, our industry paid over $800 million to Russia's  state-owned nuclear energy corporation, Rosatom and its fuel  subsidiaries. That number could be even higher this year, and these  resources are no doubt going towards funding Putin's war efforts in  Ukraine.   Further, we have seen how Putin has weaponized Europe's reliance on  Russian natural gas. There is no reason to believe that Russia wouldn't  do the same with our nuclear fuel supply if Putin saw an opportunity.   Rosatom has also supported China's nuclear energy ambitions. The  risks of continuing this dependence on Russia for our nuclear fuel are  simply too great. It is weakening America's nuclear fuel  infrastructure, which has significantly declined because of the  reliance on these cheap fuels.   That is why I am leading H.R. 1042.   Our bill bans fuel imports from Russia and sends a strong signal to  the market that will help ensure America's nuclear leadership and fuel  infrastructure. Our legislation also provides waivers to cover any  supply gaps leading up to 2028, at which point no more Russian fuel  will be allowed to be imported into the U.S.   This bill both protects any short-term needs of the industry and  provides the long-term certainty necessary to build out American  capacity, as well as European capacity that serves our markets.   H.R. 1042 has bipartisan support from the Committee on Energy and  Commerce. It also has support from the nuclear industry, the nuclear  fuels industry, and policy advocates.   Additionally, the Biden administration has also said that a ban on  Russian fuels is necessary to advance our domestic fuel build-out,  including the fuels for advanced reactors.   Across Europe, utility providers are starting to transition away from  Russian fuels, announce new capacity, and invest in plant projects. We  are seeing important fuel processes returning online in the United  States.   For example, the uranium conversion facility in Metropolis, Illinois,  has restarted operations for the first time in years. That facility  alone could meet the domestic uranium conversion needs within 2 years,  but only if they have assurances that cheap Russian fuel won't undercut  their business.   The reality is, no facility owner is going to be able to invest to  expand production capacity without the certainty of long-term contracts  for their products. Those long-term contracts from fuel customers, the  utility companies, will not be written if there remains uncertainty  about Russian fuel continuing to flow into the United States, and the  risk that Russia will once again be able to flood the market with  cheaper products.   H.R. 1042 provides those assurances to industry.   American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear technology is  critical to our economic, energy, and national security, and a strong  domestic nuclear fuel system, from mining to enrichment, is vital to  our leadership.   In the U.S. alone, nuclear energy provides nearly 20 percent of our  electricity generation, all of which is emissions free.   Nuclear plants operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a  year, making them one of the most reliable, zero-carbon, baseload  energy resources.   H.R. 1042 will protect the short-term needs of the nuclear industry  and provide the long-term certainty necessary to encourage investment  and secure a durable domestic supply of fuel.   I urge my colleagues to support the Prohibiting Russian Uranium  Imports Act to restore our industry and take down Russia's nuclear fuel  empire.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, urge support for  this bill. I am pleased we have been able to come together to move this  legislation forward, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5378) to promote price transparency in the  health care sector, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

(b) Permitted Purposes.--The purposes described in this       subsection are limited to the following purposes, insofar as       such purposes are to carry out the provisions of, including       the amendments made by, title I and IV:        (1) Preparing, drafting, and issuing proposed and final       regulations or interim regulations.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material in the Record on the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I rise in support of the Lower Cost, More Transparency Act. We all  know that healthcare is too expensive, and the system is far too  complicated. In the Committee on Energy and Commerce, we have heard  countless stories about real patients who were victims of an opaque  system and were on the hook for staggering amounts of money for seeing  a doctor, going to a hospital, or getting medicine.   We heard about a patient who tried to shop for her care and was  billed thousands of dollars more than what she was quoted. We heard  about a patient who was overcharged $11,000 by a hospital for services  she didn't receive. We heard moving testimony from cancer patient  advocates about policies we can enact right now to lower their drug  costs.   The Lower Costs, More Transparency Act includes these and other  policies that would directly help all these patients. It lowers costs  for Americans through increased healthcare price transparency. It  ensures that senior citizens on Medicare never pay more for a drug  because of where it is administered, and it makes drug prices  transparent to help patients and employers  [[Page H6786]]  get the best deals possible on medicines.   Over 90 percent of Americans support increased price transparency in  healthcare. By passing this bill, we will be delivering results people  are counting on. Further, CBO confirms that the bill would save  taxpayers more than $700 million over the next decade.   I thank Chairman Jason Smith, Chairwoman Virginia Foxx, and Ranking  Member Frank Pallone for their leadership. I thank Majority Leader    Steve Scalise for working with us to bring this bill to the floor  today.   Also, a special thank you to Ranking Member Pallone's team, notably  Tiffany Guarascio, Waverly Gordon, Una Lee, and Saha Khaterzai for  working with us to find this bipartisan agreement.   Finally, I thank my own staff, especially Grace Graham, Corey  Ensslin, and Kristin Flukey for their tireless efforts that will make a  meaningful difference for patients all across this Nation.   In sum, this bill is a legislative opportunity, bipartisan, regular  order, and fully paid for. It advances foundational healthcare reforms  for patients, lowers healthcare costs, and reduces the deficit.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the Lower Costs,  More Transparency Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to engage in a  colloquy with Ranking Member Pallone.   This bill codifies and strengthens healthcare price transparency  requirements. Congress asserting itself to declare price transparency  the law of the land is critical, but Congress can't account for every  specificity and eventuality that is needed to ensure price transparency  policies established by the Trump and Biden administrations are set in  stone. We have to allow implementing agencies discretion to update  regulations that reflect changes in terminology and technology over  time.   For example, with respect to health insurance price transparency, it  is the intent of this House that this law shall be implemented to  ensure that health plans report the prices that they have negotiated  with the hospitals, other providers, and drug manufacturers to allow  patients and employers purchasing coverage to use these data to drive  down healthcare prices through open competition.   Under existing regulations, health plans and insurers must disclose  very specific price information for all  [[Page H6787]]  healthcare items and services. This bill codifies the authority holding  up those regulations to ensure that such robust data continues to be  disclosed. These data include all billing codes and modifiers, using  industry-standard, government-recognized, commonly used code sets used  by all medical providers to define specific healthcare items and  services. We ensure the data are accurate by requiring providers' ID  codes, place of service codes, and health plan identifiers assigned to  the group health plan and insurer, all critical information that makes  price disclosures comparable across different health plans.   It is our intent that the requirements for transparency in coverage  should be as comprehensive as possible, without limitations. I yield to  the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member for the  purpose of a colloquy.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Pallone for his ongoing leadership, and I agree it is critical that the  legislation meets our intent when it comes to ensuring that the PBMs  must be transparent with multiemployer, public sector, and retiree-only  health plans along with all other employer health plans. I do concur  that we will address this issue in negotiations with the Senate, and I  look forward to working to make sure this bill becomes law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the chairwoman of the  Education and the Workforce Committee. I appreciate her partnership on  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the chairman of the Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the House Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), a subcommittee chair.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), the vice chair of the Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to urge support  for this major bipartisan legislation. It is very important healthcare  legislation. We are concerned about consolidation within healthcare and  the rising costs within healthcare.   The first way we are going to address that is by demanding  transparency. We have to know what the prices actually are so that we  can empower patients and we can get some more competition within our  healthcare system.   I thank everyone who has worked together. This was a priority we laid  out at the very beginning of this Congress. It has been months' worth  of work.   A big thank you, again, to the ranking member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, as well as the other committees, the chairmanship  of Virginia Foxx and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,  Jason Smith, for working together. We have all contributed, and we have  a better product because of it.   I definitely urge support by my colleagues both Republicans and  Democrats. This is one that we need to get on the President's desk with  a big vote today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the SUPPORT Act.   This bill is about offering hope to those in despair: those battling  substance use disorder, their families and loved ones, and the  healthcare workers and law enforcement officers who need continued  support to help save lives.   Since 2020, overdose deaths have surged to more than 100,000 lives  lost per year. Today, illicit fentanyl poisonings are now the number  one cause of death among adults aged 18 to 49, and my home State of  Washington has seen the greatest increase in drug overdose and  poisoning deaths nationwide in the past year.   The House took a critical step to help get illicit fentanyl off our  streets by passing the HALT Fentanyl Act earlier this year. Now we are  moving forward with this legislation to increase support for  individuals suffering from substance use disorder and to help make sure  they receive the treatment they need.                                time  1645    H.R. 4531, the Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization  Act modifies and reauthorizes key programs that expand access to  substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery.   Specifically, this bill increases treatment options for intensive  inpatient care, allows law enforcement to crack down on illicit  xylazine distribution, and continues support for at-risk youth, among  many other important provisions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Kristin Flukey and Seth Gold from the Energy and  Commerce Committee staff for their dedicated work on this legislation.  I am hopeful that by reauthorizing programs with proven success and  increasing access to treatment, we can address the troubling trend in  drug-related deaths, saving lives and restoring hope and healing to  those who need it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lamborn for  bringing us all together tonight.   The Bible is a book that has endured for generations. Around the  world, it is the number one bestseller. For 6,000 years of history, it  is the Bible that has shaped who we are, how we govern, and our laws,  morality, education, and family values.   The Bible has influenced the greatest philosophers, scholars,  artists, musicians, and scientific work and discoveries.   The Bible answers questions like: Who am I? What makes me human? What  is the purpose of life?   At a time when we are divided, angry, and fearful--the Surgeon  General says we have a public health crisis of loneliness and isolation  driving record suicides, deaths of despair, divorce, substance abuse,  depression, and anxiety--perhaps more of us should read the Bible.   In 1863, Abraham Lincoln proclaimed: ``We have forgotten God. We have  forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace and multiplied  and enriched and strengthened us, and we have vainly imagined, in the  deceitfulness of our hearts, that all these blessings were produced by  some superior wisdom and virtue of our own.''   In 2023, have we forgotten God? How about doing something new in  2024? How about reading the Bible, all 435 Members of the House of  Representatives? With our family and friends, it is only 15 minutes a  day. We can read through the old book together for wisdom, like in  Proverbs to ``trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on  your own understanding.''   God is with us in everything that we do. May we discover the truth  and freedom of His ways as revealed in the sacred Scripture.   Together, with His abundant grace, we can bring hope and healing to  our land.
