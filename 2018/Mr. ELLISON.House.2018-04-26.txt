 Mr. Speaker, today we are going to talk about Medicare  for All, the importance of making sure that every American, regardless  of income, can get the healthcare that they need. That will be our  topic over the course of the next hour.   So I would like to invite to the podium to kick off our discussion  the gentleman from California, Mr. Ro Khanna, a distinguished gentleman  from the great State of California who has been a leader on economic  justice, and justice in general.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman again for his  comments. We can talk about statistics. We can talk about the way the  program is going to work. We can talk about all these things. But there  is nothing that can replace the precious life of the young woman whom  you talked about. She had people who loved her. She had people who knew  her. She had everything to look forward to.   She just needed her society, her community, to step forward for her  and to help her. And because we don't have the kind of healthcare  system we could have, we weren't there for her. But in her memory, we  have to be able to make it right for the young people and the people  who are still with us. In her memory, we will fight for Medicare for  All.   I thank the gentleman. Would the gentleman like to make any final  comments?    Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite to share a few  remarks the gentleman from the great State of Vermont. As you can see  from the course of this debate, Mr. Speaker, we have tremendous  geographic diversity: California, Vermont. But we have one thing in  common: we need a healthcare system that works for everybody.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), my  good friend.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague from Vermont for  his comments. And if I can ask him a quick question.   If we are already paying the most in the world per capita, why aren't  we getting the best healthcare outcomes?    That is a big reason. I want to thank the gentleman for  his work. Let's keep working on this.   Mr. Speaker, we are talking about Medicare for All tonight, H.R. 676.  Mr. John Conyers carried the bill all these years, and I'd like to  thank him.   But we are carrying the fight forward. It is important to note from  the onset that I recognize, the Progressive Caucus recognizes, the  Affordable Care Act made important steps, critical steps, for getting  more people covered, and we must continue to fight for it.   We have to protect the Affordable Care Act. We have to do what we can  to defend it. There are people in our Congress who want to just get rid  of it. But the truth is, it actually helped many people. It helped  bring coverage to people who hadn't had it. It helped bring real  answers for families that needed it.   But we can look further down the line. We can think about a system in  which everybody pays and everybody benefits. We could look forward to a  system like that. We can look to a Medicare for All-styled system where  we can say healthcare is a right for everybody.   This is not something that should surprise anyone. Education is  guaranteed for everyone. Every schoolkid in America can go to a public  school in the United States.                                time  1830    Fire services--you don't have to pay a separate contract to get the  fire department to put out your fire. If you live in the city and there  is a fire, you can call them, and they will help you. They are paid out  of the taxes that we all pay. The police department, public works--we  have systems in our society now that we pay for through our taxes and  other sorts of things that we do to afford these services. Healthcare,  I believe, is a service that we should look at in a similar light.   A Medicare for All system would decrease overall cost of healthcare  for a multitude of reasons, but most importantly, because it would  allow the government to negotiate decreases in the cost of care with  service providers.   I think that my good friend, Peter Welch, had an excellent example  when it came to prescription drugs. There is a company called  CorePharma that hiked the price of a DARAPRIM pill from $1 to $13.50  and watched revenues climb.   In 2015, CorePharma sold the rights to DARAPRIM to Turing, which  raised the price to $750. So in a system like that, of course, whatever  somebody can make more money doing, they are going to do. And yet, we  don't have any real controls to make sure that they don't do it. It is  the kind of thing that we have to step forward and address.   In 2012, for example, the average cost of coronary bypass surgery was  more that $73,000 in the United States, but it was less than $23,000 in  France. France has good healthcare. The world doesn't deny that-- $73,000 for a coronary bypass surgery in the United States; $23,000 in  France.   A Medicare for All single-payer system would lower administrative  costs and nearly eliminate spending for competitive advertising, which  doesn't really bring health to anyone. The U.S. spends about 18 percent  of its GDP on healthcare, while Canada spends about 11\1/2\ percent on  healthcare.   The United Kingdom, Britain, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, the  U.K. spends about 9 percent of its GDP on healthcare. Germany and  France spend about 11 percent. We spend substantially more, and yet, we  do not have the best outcomes in the world. We have to look at this  system and whether it is working for the American people.   I just make this point because we really could join the rest of the  world and have more affordable, more effective healthcare. It is not  only countries like Germany, France, and Canada that spend less and get  better outcomes than the United States. It is also New Zealand, Norway,  Denmark, Sweden, all have systems that are similar in style, and they  cover more people and the people benefit from that.   Our systems like Medicaid and Medicare are some of the most popular  systems out there. People tend to like it. Now, I am not saying they  are trouble-free, but anybody who thinks there is some program made by  human beings that is going to be absolutely perfect all the time, of  course, they are going to be wrong.   But I guarantee you, I spent plenty of time in Montreal, Canada,  Calgary, and I tell you, for all the Americans down south of the border  who complain about Canadian healthcare, Canadians kind of like their  healthcare. They don't want to switch with us; neither do the people in  England. We need A Better Deal, and we can have one if we were to move  forward.   Taiwan has a healthcare system that also is similar to Canada, New  Zealand, Norway, and Denmark. We can do better than we are doing right  now, and we should.   As I mentioned before, Medicaid and Medicare are popular. These are  programs where people get the benefit of a healthcare system that is a  system that we benefit from as a government of, by, and for the people,  and millions of our constituents, from birth until death, benefit, and  they support people with disabilities, having children, pregnant women,  and seniors. They are wildly popular, and they actually have pretty low  administrative costs and essential to the stability of our country.   It also makes sense that Americans must also support Medicare for All  single-payer. Both a Harvard-Harris poll from 2007 and a 2018 Kaiser  Family Foundation poll found that the majority of Americans support a  single-payer healthcare system funded by the government. Yet some folks  in this body want to actually cut Medicaid. They want to cut--they want  to drain funds from the Medicare trust fund.   The fact is Americans all over this country, they think that many of  our programs, whether it be the VA or Medicare or Medicaid, actually  help a lot of people. These programs are popular, and yet, we continue  to have to fight to protect them every day.   What if we just move forward instead so that more people can benefit  from a program like a Medicare-style program? An expanded Medicare for  All will create millions of good jobs. It is a program that would bring  more people in; therefore, we need more healthcare professionals to  cover folks, more nurses, more doctors, more nurse anesthetists, more  folks to keep folks healthy, even more exercise professionals, because  we know that in a good, solid, single-payer system, we would put an  emphasis on preventative care and try to make sure people stay well,  stay healthy.   Let me just say that cost savings for individuals is an important  factor here. Medicare fraud isn't just a fringe idea that will help  very few people. Medicare for All is good for business and  [[Page H3694]]  good for people. A single-payer system would lift the significant  financial burden from businesses that currently fund the healthcare  insurance for their employees and would largely eliminate the financial  burden of illness, a leading cause of bankruptcy, and debt sent into  collection.   Even with the Affordable Care Act, which substantially helped 28  million people, or about 9 percent of the Nation, still remain  uninsured. I am grateful for the Affordable Care Act. It made  substantial advances, but we still can do better.   A single-payer system is not just about ensuring that no person is  uninsured. It is also about making sure that nobody is underinsured.  Many people are underinsured. They face costs associated with their  insurance that they just can't afford to handle, and that is also a  substantial problem.    Underinsured individuals are less likely to obtain healthcare when  they need it. They skip doctor visits, they avoid filling  prescriptions, and they are more likely to end up in medical debt. We  can have a system that can help us avoid these problems. Medical debt  is one of the leading causes of personal bankruptcy in the United  States.   If we were to set up a system that was focused more on health and  wellness where we all could pay and then we can all benefit, it would  make our society stronger, better financially and physically.   Now, Medicare for All would actually help reduce income inequality.  One of the problems of the society we live in now is that we have  really historic record inequality. The rich and the top 1 percent are  far more wealthy relative to the rest of their countrymen and women  than has been the case since the Great Depression, since the Guilded  Age. You probably have to go back to the time when the Great Gatsby was  written to actually see the level of inequality that we see today and  marks the society that we live in.   In a time when we are facing these record levels of inequality, a  single-payer system can also help level the playing field and help  working people make a better go at this economy. Medicare for All would  make sure that everyone would have the same access and level of care,  regardless of their income, their job, or the community that they live  in. A Medicare for All system would mean that people would be able to  cover their medications, cover their bills. It would mean that they  would be able to get what they need.   And if you compare this, what if we had a system--what if we did  healthcare the way we do education, that you have to have a private--it  is a private system and you couldn't go unless you could pay? The  bottom line is that what we would end up with is a system that would be  very unequal, educationally speaking. It would undermine our  productivity. It would weaken our society.   If we were to have a Medicare for All system that would help make  sure that everybody had a basic health benefit, and it didn't matter  whether you had a job at the moment or not, didn't matter whether you-- where you lived, then it would provide a platform for economic  prosperity in the marketplace where people would work.   This would also make our society more equal when it comes to  opportunity for people of color and racial minorities. Black and  Hispanic Americans are more likely to be uninsured than others. The  studies show a direct link between being uninsured and a higher  mortality rate.   By the way, when people have died with a higher mortality rate, they  don't just die. Often, they end up in the ER, which is one of the most  expensive places to treat somebody. But what if they actually had the  treatment that they needed, they had a regular doctor, they had the  treatments they needed, they had ways to keep themselves healthy?  African Americans and indigenous people tend to have lower life  expectancies than White Americans, experiencing higher rates in most  major causes of death: infant mortality, trauma, heart disease, and  diabetes. Much of this is just related to the fact that healthcare  access is not evenly distributed, and, therefore, the disproportionate  impact is on people with the lower income.   Rates of unemployment are higher among African-American men and women  than their non-Hispanic White counterparts, and job loss is more  prevalent among minority groups. Getting employer-based coverage is not  easy if you work a few part-time jobs you have to piece together rather  than a solid full-time job.   So what do people do when that happens? You go without healthcare or  you have gaps in your healthcare coverage, especially if you live in a  State where things like expanding Medicaid are not preferred. If you  are a Governor and your State legislature doesn't want to expand  Medicaid, then the chances that you are going to experience these gaps  in coverage and be uninsured are higher, and consequently, people's  health outcomes are worse.   The U.S. healthcare system is ranked, when we look at it, among the  worst among countries with advanced economies, despite the fact that we  are among the ones that spend the most on healthcare. If we want to  have more equality based on people's different racial backgrounds, if  we want more opportunity for all, regardless of their race but based on  income, and we want to make sure that this is a country where a middle  class person, a working class person can do better, then the fact  stands true that we have got to move to a Medicare for All style  system.   Now, Medicare for All style system and drug pricing--very important  topic to take up. We are one of the only countries in the world that  doesn't in some way regulate the cost of prescription drugs. We talked  a little bit about this before, using the examples of DARAPRIM, but it  just seems to me that if we were to move to a system, a Medicare for  All style system, an expanded better system, we could find ourselves in  a situation where Americans could actually start affording their drugs.  While prescription drugs are not covered by Canada's system, there are  price controls for medications, so prescription drugs are often cheaper  than they are in the U.S.    We have a drug pricing crisis in this country. American people know  it. They live it every day. The worried parent struggling to pay their  kid's insulin, a senior living on a fixed income who takes arthritis  medication, and millions of working people who have to take medication  at some point or another in their life, they know that we have a system  that is uncontrolled and out of control.   In a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll, over 50 percent of the  people said that addressing this medication crisis would be one--should  be one of the President's and Congress' top priorities. This should  come as no surprise to us.   A majority of Americans are using prescription medication. For too  many folks, people have to choose between paying their bills and  getting the medicine that their family needs.   In fact, 92 percent of Americans support the Federal Government  negotiating lower drug prices for folks on Medicare part D. Medicare  part D is a very unfortunate program where it is written into the law  that we cannot negotiate drug prices. This is an outrageous thing, and  for people dedicated to free-market principles, the fact that you  couldn't negotiate a price seems extremely ironic to me. It seems more  like crony capitalism than free market.   Eighty-six percent of Americans support requiring drug companies to  release information on how they make their drug prices. I think, while  that is certainly something that we should know, it is not particularly  difficult to figure out. They price based on as much as they can get.  And 78 percent of surveyed Americans support lifting what drug  corporations can charge for drugs for illnesses like cancer.                                time  1845    We must continue to fight to protect the ACA and fight for Medicare  for All as a solution. We should, and we could, begin to tackle so many  of our Nation's problems if we had a shot at good health and stable  healthcare.   There is proof from our fellow wealthy nations that you can have a  free market economy and you can have a national health insurance  program that works. They are doing it in Canada; they are doing it in  the UK; they are doing it in New Zealand; they are doing it in Taiwan;  they are doing it in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden; and they are doing it  all over the world. There is no reason why we can't do it  [[Page H3695]]  here, other than some people want to benefit while other people  actually suffer.   There is an important debate going on in our country. There is an  important conversation that we are having in communities all over. I  hope that all across the United States, in church basements, synagogue  basements, mosques, Quaker meeting rooms, VFW halls and union halls, in  lodges and coffee shops all across America, wherever people gather,  folks will get together and discuss our healthcare future as Americans.   There is a better way, and I think that it is right in front of us.   I was speaking about this issue with somebody who told me: Well,  Keith, I mean, look, how are we going to pay for this?   I thought that was an interesting question, given that we just passed  a Republican tax bill that carved about $1.5 trillion out of Federal  revenue over the next 10 years. Some people have estimated it is even  higher than that. Nobody was particularly worried about how we are  going to pay for that. But the question is still a legitimate question.  We do have to pay for things.   I think that, if we look at the fact that about two-thirds of all the  healthcare spending now is public spending, we are two-thirds of the  way there now. We need to figure out how we are going to come up with  the rest. People will see the healthcare expenditures that they are  already making be able to be part of how we will pay this. But the  other part is a legitimate question.   I think that we can set out a system of a payroll tax or, perhaps, a  tax on Wall Street trades. There are a number of things that we can do.  And we also can squeeze costs out of the system.   We know that simply because you have got multiple insurance  companies, multiple payers, that there is rampant waste in the system;  and if we were to squeeze it out and we get efficiencies, we would be  able to lower costs in the system. If we could control costs better, we  would be able to have a world-class system, as other countries have,  with excellent health outcomes and be able to still pay for it. It is  not beyond our reach.   I can tell you that it has often been said that single-payer systems  have long waiting lines. Well, not according to the data. One grant  from the Commonwealth Fund looks at what percent of adults can get a  same-day doctor's appointment when they are sick, counting systems like  Canada, the United Kingdom, and the rest. And the fact is that in New  Zealand, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom, people can get  same-day doctor visits at a higher rate than in the United States. It  is not the case that you have to have these long lines and you have to  wait so long in every system.   Of course, the U.S. system will be an American system. We will design  it for our own purposes. But it simply is not true that a single-payer  system will have longer waiting lines. It is just not the case. People  will say this, but it is not true.   The fact is that we need to have the debate. We need to have the  discussion. We need businesses to say: Well, what would it mean to me  if I didn't have to pay health insurance out of my business expenses?   Individuals have to ask: What would it mean if they never had to pay  for copays, deductibles, things like that, if they could get eyes,  ears, other types of coverages that they need, what would it mean if  these things were possible? How would it impact our economy? Would it  free people and allow them to be more creative and more innovative?   We have seen our country see a decline in small business development  first in startups. Is this in part because people are locked into debt  in jobs just so they can have insurance? I think there is certainly a  possibility there.   At the end of the day, we have got to have a dialogue about how we  can better serve the American people. Other countries around the world  are doing it, and it is time for us to move forward in that direction,  too.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
