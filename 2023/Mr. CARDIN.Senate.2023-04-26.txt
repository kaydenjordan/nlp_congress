 Madam President, I take this time--and I am going to be  joined by several of my colleagues--to talk about a vote that we are  going to have tomorrow on S.J. Res. 4. This is the resolution that  would rescind the deadline for the ratification of the Equal Rights  Amendment.   This is an issue that I have been working on for a long time,  including during my time in the Maryland General Assembly in 1972, when  the Maryland legislature ratified the Equal Rights Amendment.   So this goes back a long time, and it is time to finish the work. I  want to thank Chairman Durbin for his leadership on this issue, the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for the work he did so that we  could reach this moment where we have a chance to take the step that is  critically important, removing any ambiguity in regards to the  ratification process.   I also want to thank Leader Schumer for making this time available so  we will be able to vote on this issue tomorrow.   I particularly want to acknowledge the extraordinary leadership of  Senator Lisa Murkowski, my coleader on this resolution. The two of us  have worked together. This should never be a partisan issue. Equality  should enjoy support, I would hope, from both Democrats and  Republicans.   There is no time limit on equality. The 28th Amendment to the  Constitution, the Equal Rights Amendment, was approved by the U.S.  Congress in both the House and Senate by a two-thirds vote, as required  in the Constitution, and has been ratified by 38 States--that is,  three-fourths necessary for the ratification of a constitutional  amendment.   The sole purpose of S.J. Res. 4 is to remove any ambiguity, to remove  the time limit that was included originally in the 1972 act of Congress  of 7 years and previously extended to 10 years.   I want to acknowledge the help I have received on this through the  incredible staff we all have here in the U.S. Senate. Bill Van Horne,  who is my chief counsel, has been working on this issue since my days  in the House of Representatives, and I thank him for his leadership in  bringing all the groups together. Helen Rogers has helped a great deal  in this effort. I just want to acknowledge the work both of them have  done on the Equal Rights Amendment.   The ERA simply states:         Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or       abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.    That is it. That is exactly what the Equal Rights Amendment to the  Constitution says. Ratification would affirm women's equality in our  Constitution, enshrining the principle of women's equality and explicit  prohibition against sex discrimination in our Nation's founding  document.   Currently, the only explicitly guaranteed right in our Constitution  based upon sex is the 19th Amendment, which is the right to vote.   Existing legal protections against sex-based discrimination fall well  short of addressing systemic sex-based inequality in our society.   As the 28th Amendment, the ERA would serve as a new tool for  Congress, for Federal Agencies, and in courts to advance equality in  the fields of workforce and pay, pregnancy discrimination, sexual  harassment and violence, reproductive autonomy, and protection of  LBGTQ+ individuals. Enshrining this protection in our Constitution also  ensures enduring protections for all Americans across the country.   Existing legal protections against sex-based discrimination fall well  short of addressing the systemic sex-based inequality in our society.   It is also a signal to the courts that they should apply a more  rigorous level of review to laws and government policies that  discriminate on the basis of sex.   That is what the ERA is all about: equality--the most fundamental of  American values.   We need to finally get the job done. Last Congress, a bipartisan  majority in the Senate cosponsored this joint resolution, and the House  of Representatives has already passed this legislation on two  occasions--first in the 116th Congress and then in the 117th Congress.   Virginia became the 38th and final State required by the Constitution  to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment on January 27, 2020.   Our resolution, S.J. Res. 4, would clarify once and for all that the  Equal Rights Amendment has met all the requirements of article V of our  Constitution.   Let me read what it says:         That notwithstanding any time limit contained in House       Joint Resolution 208, the 92nd Congress, as agreed to in the       Senate on March 22, 1972, the article of amendment proposed       to the States in that joint resolution shall be valid to all       intents and purposes as part of the Constitution, whenever       ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several       States.    It is a clarification resolution. Congress has the power to do it.  Congress approved it by more than the required two-thirds majority in  both Chambers, and three-quarters of States have now ratified it.  Article V of the Constitution has been complied with.   You are going to hear legal arguments surrounding whether a Senate  [[Page S1369]]  joint resolution can remove a deadline, so let me talk about some of  these issues.   First, in the Constitution, there is nothing in the Constitution that  sets a time limit on ratification. Read Article V. It talks about the  votes necessary in Congress--we have had that--and the votes of  ratification by the States--we have done that. There is no time limit  in the Constitution.   The 27th Amendment effecting congressional pay raise was ratified  after two centuries, after being initially proposed by Congress as part  of the Bill of Rights in 1791, two centuries before--over 200 years  before it was ratified.   Congress has the authority to act. There is precedent for Congress to  extend the deadline for ratification of an amendment, as it did once  before for the ERA. Note that the ERA deadline was contained in the  preamble to the text of the constitutional amendment, not in the  constitutional amendment itself.   There is precedent for Congress to declare that the requisite number  of States have ratified a constitutional amendment, as the House and  Senate did in 1992 by resolutions affirming the validity of the 27th  Amendment regarding congressional pay raises. That is the one that took  over 200 years to ratify.   In terms of Article V, the only question is whether a State has  ratified. Ratification is something that happens at a moment in time.  It either happens or it doesn't happen. History tells us that once a  State has ratified, it can't take it back. The 14th Amendment became  part of the Constitution after the Civil War even though two States had  attempted to rescind prior ratifications. Those States were included on  the list of States that ratified. The effectiveness of a rescission is  ultimately a question for Congress. S.J. Res. 4 answers that question.   Then the most recent opinion by the Department of Justice, the  opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel, noted that Congress, as a  coequal branch of government, is not precluded from taking further  action regarding the ratification of the ERA.   So we have all of the legal requirements. We can act.   Now let me lay out a few more things here.   Most Americans believe the ERA is already part of our Constitution.  Just ask them. They think it is there. Most of our States have  provisions in the State constitutions to provide equal rights based  upon sex. So we already have it in States, and it is working.   Most democracies--in fact, every constitution that has been written  since World War II contains an equal rights amendment. The United  States is an outlier on this issue. We are the leader of democratic  values in human rights globally, but we don't have an equal rights  amendment in our Constitution.   The Pew Research Center did a survey on this. Seventy-eight percent  of Americans support the Equal Rights Amendment being added to the  Constitution. This is overwhelmingly popular among all of our  constituents--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, men, women. Two- hundred fifty national and local groups support the ERA, including the  League of Women Voters, the National Urban League, the National Council  of Jewish Women, the SEIU, and many, many other civil rights, labor,  and civic groups.   This resolution language removes any doubt of ratification, and it is  the right way to go under our Constitution. We had the advice of  constitutional scholars who support what we are doing--Erwin  Chemerinsky, Larry Tribe, Kathleen Sullivan, Catharine MacKinnon,  Victoria Nourse, former Senator Russ Feingold. All have endorsed the  way we are proceeding.   The ERA is needed not only to keep progress moving forward but also  to protect against incursions on the progress we have already made.  Based on recent decisions by the Supreme Court, some Justices ascribe  to the view that the meaning of equality under the equal protection  clause should be frozen in time in 1868 when the 14th Amendment was  ratified. That approach may cast in doubt even the limited precedents  currently holding that the equal protection clause applies to sex  discrimination.   It has been more than 100 years since women won the right to vote and  nearly 100 since the effort to enshrine the ERA in the Constitution  began. Generations have fought to achieve major points of progress in  our laws and our society since then. However, it is undeniable that  work remains.   Finally, enshrining the ERA into the Constitution would be one major  step that we could take towards a society that is truly equal on the  basis of sex.   I therefore urge my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to invoke  cloture on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 4. The women of America  have waited long enough. Don't filibuster equality. You don't want to  be on that side of history.   There should be no time limit on equality. Let us use this  opportunity to complete the action of equality based on sex in our  Constitution.   I yield the floor.    I want to thank Senator Stabenow for her leadership in  the Senate and in our community on these issues. I serve with her and  Senator Cortez Masto on the Finance Committee, and I see the duo there  fighting for removing a lot of the discrimination we have in our  healthcare system--again, that women are discriminated against. Both of  these Senators do a great job being here, protecting the rights.   But it is so important that we have in our toolbox the constitutional  amendment to help us in fighting discrimination so that we have a  fairer playing field in the courts to protect the rights of women. So I  thank her.   We are also joined by Senator Klobuchar. We were elected at the same  time to the U.S. Senate. She has been an advocate on behalf of equality  for all communities, but particularly her efforts on behalf of women is  known throughout the Nation, and I am glad she could join us today.    Mr. President, first, I want to thank Senator Durbin, the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his leadership on this issue  but, just as importantly, for his leadership on so  [[Page S1373]]  many human rights and civil rights issues.   Thank you for the hearing that you conducted in the Judiciary  Committee. It shed light on a lot of the ridiculous arguments that some  have made against the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. More  importantly, it showed why it is important for us to remove any  ambiguity on the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. I also  want to just acknowledge your extraordinary leadership around the  world.   When there is a human rights struggle, Senator Durbin is going to be  the spokesperson for those who would otherwise not be heard. I have  joined him many times in those efforts, and I am proud to be on his  team. I thank him for really giving us the leadership here in the U.S.  Senate and the best values of America here at home and abroad. I thank  him for his leadership on this issue and on so many other issues.   I am joined by a couple of my other colleagues--first, Senator  Blumenthal from Connecticut. I also want to acknowledge Senator Van  Hollen from Maryland. Both have been real leaders in regard to the  equal rights of women but also in regard to civil liberties and civil  rights. Both are good friends. One I have the honor of representing the  State of Maryland with, so I have seen him in action for equal rights  in our State. As for the other, we have been together on the Helsinki  Commission, fighting globally for human rights. So I thank them for  being here.    Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for his  leadership on the Equal Rights Amendment. He is our leader on  protecting our democratic institutions, which include equality for all.  Senator Whitehouse's leadership in protecting the election process and  protecting us against dark money and an independent judiciary will go  down in history as one of the great contributions made.   I thank him for his help in regard to the Equal Rights Amendment, and  I thank him for his leadership on so many issues here in the U.S.  Senate.   Let me just conclude this part of our discussion. We will have a  chance tomorrow to vote on this.   What we are asking is very simple: to put the Equal Rights Amendment  in the Constitution without any ambiguity and remove the time limit. We  have already done everything necessary for its ratification.   This document is a precious document: the Constitution of the United  States. Most Americans believe the Equal Rights Amendment is in this  document. It is not. The consequences are that we are not protecting  women's rights and discrimination against sex in the manner we should  be protecting them.   Now, the vote tomorrow is going to be on a cloture motion. You see,  the majority of the Members of the Senate support the resolution that  Senator Murkowski and I are bringing forward. And the way the minority  can stop it is by denying us an opportunity to vote up or down on the  resolution.  [[Page S1375]]    This is a matter of rights. I would hope that my colleagues would  support the resolution or they will at least allow the majority of this  body to make the decision on this resolution.   I hope my colleagues will vote for the cloture motion so that we can  have a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate on this resolution, which  will, once and for all, make it clear equal rights are part of the  American Constitution, part of our commitment to future generations.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, on Saturday, Earth Day turned 53. For  the past half-plus century, we have paused each spring to celebrate and  reflect on our relationship with the natural world and to demonstrate  support for environmental protection.   This year's theme, Invest in Our Planet, served as a reminder of our  responsibility to deliver Federal resources and spur innovation to  ensure peace and prosperity for future generations.   The environmental challenges facing our planet, fueled increasingly  by climate change, are urgent and require immediate action. According  to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency--EPA--nearly half of our  rivers and streams are polluted by excess nutrients. During extreme  rain events, river flow increases, pouring more fresh water into  estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay.   Stormwater runoff pushes nutrients, sediment, and other pollutants  off the land and into rivers and streams. Excess nutrients then lead to  the growth of harmful algal blooms that harm plants and animals.  Pollution not only affects our aquatic life but can contaminate  drinking water sources and impart costly impacts to recreation,  tourism, and fisheries.   Low-income and communities of color often face disproportionately  high pollutant exposures. The communities who are most affected by  nitrates are also less likely to be able to afford the necessary water  treatment. That is why I applaud the Biden administration's focused  attention on delivering the benefits of historic Federal investments to  disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and  overburdened by pollution. For too long, the Nation has underinvested  in water infrastructure. Failing water infrastructure threatens the  environment, and it risks people's health, safety, and livelihoods.   Congress responded with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which  delivers more than $50 billion to EPA to improve our Nation's drinking  water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure. This is the single  largest investment in water that the Federal Government has ever made.  EPA recently announced $775 million in funding Congress appropriated  for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, CWSRF. This funding, along  with the investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is  critical for communities across the country to upgrade their wastewater  and stormwater systems, protect public health and preserve our precious  water bodies. In its allotment, my home State of Maryland received  $18.3 million towards improving water quality, toward a total of over  $167 million this fiscal year to upgrade drinking water and wastewater  infrastructure.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act also invested in EPA's  geographic programs, including the Chesapeake Bay Program. These  programs are long-standing, location-specific programs that help  protect local ecosystems and communities from climate change, habitat  loss, and pollution.   I am also pleased to report that due in part to concerted efforts to  control nutrient pollution, the Chesapeake Bay had the tenth smallest  area impacted by low-oxygen water this past summer. Long-term trends  indicate this ``dead zone'' where fish, crab, and other species cannot  live because there is not enough oxygen in the water has been getting  smaller. Low-oxygen or hypoxic water is caused by excess nutrients like  nitrogen or phosphorus from agricultural runoff and urban and suburban  stormwater entering the bay. It is encouraging to see that efforts to  reduce nutrient pollution are making a difference. The Chesapeake Bay  Program is a model for a regional partnership that unites an array of  stakeholders--from producers to nonprofits to local governments--behind  a common goal: Restore and protect the Bay.   Globally, cooperation offers similar benefits. The recovery of the  Earth's protective ozone layer announced in January is a hopeful  example. The ozone layer plays a critical role in shielding us from  harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Human activities, such as  the use of ozone-depleting substances like chlorofluorocarbons--CFCs-- have caused significant damage to the ozone layer. Fortunately,  collective action to limit these substances, such as the Montreal  Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, an international  agreement to protect the ozone layer, is allowing it to recover.  According to the United Nations, if commitments like these stay in  place, the ozone layer could fully recover to 1980 levels by 2040.  However,  [[Page S1378]]  we must ensure solving one environmental challenge does not create  another. Hydrofluorocarbons--HFCs--which are often used as substitutes  for ozone-depleting substances, are even more potent greenhouse gases  than carbon dioxide.   The Kigali amendment addresses this issue by adding HFCs to the list  of substances that need to be limited in the Montreal Protocol. For our  part, Congress not only passed the American Innovation and  Manufacturing Act--AIM Act--to phase down HFCs, but also ratified the  amendment. It was America's space Agency that demonstrated the link  between hydrofluorocarbons--HFCs--and climate change. In 2015, a NASA  study found that HFCs damage the ozone layer and that their impact  could cause a 0.035 percent decrease in ozone by 2050. Today, federally  supported science is returning the U.S. to the Moon: Artemis II is  NASA's first crewed Artemis mission. On this 10-day long mission, four  astronauts announced earlier this month will fly around the Moon before  returning to Earth and test the Space Launch System and Orion  spacecraft capabilities that will help send more people to space in the  future.   This kind of exploration enables us to learn more about our planet  and gather valuable data on the environment. I am so proud of the  Marylanders involved with the mission, including Commander Reid  Wiseman, with whom I had the opportunity to speak earlier this month.  The flight, set to build upon the successful uncrewed Artemis I mission  completed in December, will set the stage for the first woman and first  person of color on the Moon through the Artemis Program, paving the way  for future for long-term human exploration missions to the Moon and,  eventually, Mars. This is the Agency's Moon to Mars exploration  approach. Overcoming the challenges of working in space will lead to  many more technological and scientific advances here on Earth in areas  including healthcare, transportation, public safety, consumer goods,  energy, information technology, and industrial productivity.   I am heartened by all the positive changes to improve our  environment, but there is still work to be done. The Inflation  Reduction Act laid the groundwork to make a just, clean U.S. economy a  reality, saving trillions of dollars from avoided illness and death,  reduced property damage from climate-related disasters and sea level  rise, and reduced costs related to increasing temperatures.   Still, climate change and other environmental issues continue to pose  a threat to Earth's health that disproportionally impacts vulnerable  communities. Further steps will be needed to fully meet President  Biden's pledge to reduce U.S. climate pollution by 50 to 52 percent  below 2005 levels by 2030. We cannot become complacent; we must remain  committed to taking action to protect our environment. I am confident  that our Nation can further promote sustainability through thoughtful  policies and legislation.   This year, let us celebrate our achievements and not forget our  responsibility to invest in our planet.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have 13 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
