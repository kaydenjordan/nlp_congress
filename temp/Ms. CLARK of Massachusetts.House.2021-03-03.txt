 Mr. Speaker, the insurrection on January  6 had a specific purpose: to overturn our election and to violently  disenfranchise millions of voters.   The immediate threat to the Capitol has been quelled, but our  democracy's future is still unclear. Across the country there are  ongoing efforts to suppress and limit votes. Dark money fuels campaigns  without transparency and accountability, and partisan gerrymandering  tilts the playing field.   A vote for H.R. 1 is a vote for equality, for transparency, and for  returning power to the people.   Mr. Speaker, 56 years ago on March 7, John Lewis almost lost his life  on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right to vote. He said: ``Your vote  is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful, nonviolent tool we  have to create a more perfect union.''   Let's strive for that more perfect union. Let's confirm our democracy  and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1.                                time  1045
