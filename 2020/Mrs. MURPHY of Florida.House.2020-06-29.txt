 Madam Speaker, every American should have  affordable access to doctor care, hospital care, and prescription  drugs. This is important in normal times and vital during a pandemic.   Before COVID, Florida had one of the worst uninsured rates in the  country. That is because State leaders refused to expand Medicaid,  placing politics over public health. It is also because many Floridians  chose not to buy a marketplace plan because they couldn't find an  affordable option.   COVID has made a bad situation worse. In Florida, cases,  hospitalizations, and deaths are rising sharply. Millions of workers  have lost their jobs and their employer-sponsored health coverage.   Passage of this bill would make an immediate difference in the lives  of my constituents who are really struggling. The bill would encourage  Florida and other holdout States to expand Medicaid by having the  Federal Government pay nearly the full cost. It would make exchange  coverage more affordable, reducing premiums and deductibles. It would  lower the cost of prescription drugs, which are far too high.   Finally, it would guarantee that no American can be denied coverage  because of a preexisting condition. This protection is even more  important than ever since there is a risk that insurers could classify  a COVID-19 diagnosis as a preexisting condition.   I strongly support this bill and urge its passage.
