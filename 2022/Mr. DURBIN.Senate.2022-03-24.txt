 I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Casey), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin), and the Senator  from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I was disappointed but not surprised that  Senator McConnell came to the floor and announced that he would not  support the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson, by President Biden, to  fill the vacancy of Stephen Breyer on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Just this morning, or early afternoon, we wrapped up the 4-day  process in the Senate Judiciary Committee to consider her nomination,  and that is why some of the statements which the Senator made in  justifying his opposition, I believe, need to be addressed. I will be  brief in doing so, but I wanted to make a record of it quickly.   It seems that he is concerned, as many Republicans are, with the  notion of packing of the Court. The notion behind that is that the  Democrats are inspired to appoint some number of new Justices to that  Court--maybe four--and, thereby, tip the balance back toward the  Democratic side.   The question, obviously, before us is, Where does that idea come  from?   I will be honest with you, even as chairman of the committee, I don't  know. I suppose there are some academics and theorists and researchers  who believe that is well worthy of conversation, but let's be honest  about this issue which seems to consume the Republicans in the Senate.   There is only one U.S. Senator who has had a direct impact on the  composition of the U.S. Supreme Court in modern memory. Who was that  Senator? It was Senator Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, because he  decided to keep the Court at eight Justices for almost a year after the  death of Antonin Scalia. He refused to give President Obama his  constitutional and legal option of filling the vacancy from the Scalia  departure on the Court, and for a year, Mitch McConnell, for his own  political purposes, kept the Court's composition at eight. So, when it  comes to moving the numbers of Justices, he has retired the trophy in  modern times because he was the one who did it.   When he starts speculating about the possibility of, ``Well, maybe  they will add one, two, three, or four more Justices if the Democrats  get an opportunity,'' I happen to know--and the Presiding Officer does  as well--that nothing is going to happen in changing the composition of  the Court unless it passes the U.S. Senate, which, under current rules,  requires 60 votes. There are currently 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.  So the likelihood of ``packing the Court'' is very unlikely in the near  future unless some decision is made by the electorate that dramatically  changes that.   In the meantime, we are in a situation wherein we have a vacancy on  the Court which we are trying to fill with a very competent person, and  this notion of packing the Court being the No. 1 issue in deciding is  beyond me. There  [[Page S1786]]  is no sinister conspiracy that I am even aware of that suggests that  this is an agenda item for the Democrats. Of course, we would like to  see the Court be more sympathetic to our point of view, but there is no  grand plan for this to happen.   Incidentally, the Constitution of the United States--I usually keep a  copy in my desk here--does not mandate the number of Supreme Court  Justices. We have had various numbers over the years, and we arrived at  the number of nine in 1869. I believe that was the year. So it has been  a tradition on the Court since that time.   The answer by Ketanji Brown Jackson--a Federal judge, a DC Circuit  judge--was the obvious answer when asked about whether she wanted to  pack the Court. She said: Senator, that is not my job. I would be a  judge. You are a legislator, and you would have the power, if you  wished, to change the composition of the Court. I, as a judge, don't  have that authority.   So to make that the No. 1 reason you can't support her nomination is  less than compelling.   The second thing he raised was one we heard over and over again.  Judge Jackson, what is your philosophy? Tell us your philosophy when it  comes to the Court. What is your judicial philosophy? We want to make  sure we know.   Well, there are different schools of thought when it comes to the  Constitution. Antonin Scalia was a so-called originalist, and Supreme  Court Justice Kavanaugh is a textualist, I believe, and there may be  many other schools of thought.   The bottom line is, she has said: I have published 578 written  opinions. If you want to know what I think about the law, here is my  body of work--take a look at it--on almost every topic under the Sun.   So, if you want to know how she rules and what she thinks, she can  represent whatever she wishes, but her words already speak for  themselves. She has been very open and has provided 12,000 pages from  her time on the Sentencing Commission that also reflect her views on  very important topics.   There is also the old saw. We knew it was coming. The Republicans are  testing their messages for the November election, and I will bet you  have heard some of them.   One of them is that Democrats are soft on crime. They said that about  Judge Jackson, but they have got a problem. Judge Jackson has been  endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the International  Association of Chiefs of Police, and NOBLE, the National Organization  of Black Law Enforcement Executives, in addition to other law  enforcement leaders.   She has a history in her family of brothers and other members,  uncles, who have been in law enforcement, risking their lives for the  safety of their communities over and over. One of her uncles is the  chief of police of Miami, FL.   This woman is no stranger to law enforcement. It is part of her  family; it is part of what she grew up in. To argue that she is ``soft  on crime'' ignores the obvious. She has got it in her blood. She is  going to be fair, I am sure, when she is on the Supreme Court, but she  has no prejudice against police groups. It is part of her family  history.   There is also the question about giving light sentences. We spent  more time on this than one can imagine.   Three or four Republican Senators were dwelling on her sentencing in  a handful of cases and wouldn't let go of it, day after day for 2  straight days. They refused to acknowledge--and the reality is--that  her choice of sentencing guidelines was within the same limits and  boundaries of 70 percent of current Federal judges; in some regions, 80  percent. She was not out of the mainstream; she was directly in the  mainstream when it came to sentencing. You would think the opposite was  true.   When you look at these facts and realize that here is our opportunity  to put the first African-American woman on the U.S. Supreme Court and  that these are the best arguments they could come up with against her,  it really troubles me.   I sincerely hope--I really hope and not just because I want to make  sure she is on the Court--that we will have bipartisan support for her  nomination. If this turns out to be a strictly partisan vote with this  historic opportunity, it will be sad, sad for our country and sad as a  commentary on where the parties are today.   I am hoping--I am still hoping--that several Republicans and, I hope,  many more will step forward and support her nomination. I am  disappointed in Senator McConnell's decision, but I am not surprised.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills at  the desk, and I ask for their first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place the  bills on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to my  own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session and that the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works be discharged from further consideration  of PN1696, Chris Saunders, of Vermont, to be Federal Cochairperson of  the Northern Border Regional Commission, and that the Senate consider  the following nominations en bloc: PN1696 and Calendar Nos. 793, 731,  462, 760, 788, 812, 813 and all nominations on the Secretary's desk in  the Coast Guard and Foreign Service; that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record;  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and  that the Senate resume legislative session.   There being no objection, the committee was discharged, and the  Senate proceeded to consider the nominations en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 557, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to;  that the preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m. on Monday,  March 28; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; and that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 282, H.R.  4521, the America COMPETES Act.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:19 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, March 28, 2022, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
