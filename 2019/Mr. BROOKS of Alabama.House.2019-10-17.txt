He earned his bachelor of science degree from the University of  Alabama and completed seminary at Luther Rice Theological Seminary in  Georgia.   Through his ministries, Reverend Waldrep connects with audiences of  all ages and sizes with his sense of humor, powerful illustrations, and  Scriptural insight.   He is a frequent speaker at some of America's largest churches and  conferences and has been a vocational evangelist since 1975.   Reverend Waldrep is also an author, having published ``Beyond  Betrayal: Overcome Past Hurts and Begin to Trust Again,'' ``Reaching  Your Prodigal: What Did I Do Wrong?
