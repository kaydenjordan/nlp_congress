 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it was a hopeful day yesterday as the  first COVID vaccines in the United States were distributed to  healthcare workers on the frontlines of the COVID battle, and later  this week, the FDA will hold a meeting on an emergency use  authorization for Moderna's COVID vaccine, meaning that we could have a  second coronavirus vaccine authorized before Christmas.   If all goes well, we expect to have 100 million Americans vaccinated  by March. That is a pretty amazing statistic when you consider that  just a year ago, we didn't even know about the virus, and it is a  tribute to the innovative power of the private sector and the efforts  of Congress and the Trump administration to expedite vaccine  development. It has been a long, hard year, but the light at the end of  the tunnel is coming.   But, while yesterday was an encouraging day, we have more work to do  on the COVID front.   First, we all need to keep following the CDC's recommendations. The  rollout of Pfizer's vaccine is wonderful news, but cases in the United  States are still surging. Until we can get a lot more people  vaccinated, we need to do everything we can to slow the spread of the  virus and avoid overwhelming our hospitals.   Second, we need to pass another COVID bill here in Congress to  provide additional funding for vaccines and deliver other urgently  needed relief to our fellow Americans. Republicans, of course, have  been trying to pass additional COVID legislation literally for months,  and I am encouraged that, in the past few weeks, a number of Democrats  have stepped forward to work with the Republicans to develop bipartisan  legislation. Just yesterday, a bipartisan group of Senators released  legislation along the lines of what the majority leader has advocated-- targeted relief that focuses on our most critical needs in the areas  where Republicans and Democrats agree. This includes important COVID  priorities like vaccine funding, money for schools, and help for the  hardest hit small businesses.   The Republicans and Democrats' ideal COVID bills might look very  different, but there are a number of things that all of us agree need  to be addressed, and we should--in fact, we must--pass legislation to  take care of those priorities. I am thinking about vaccine distribution  especially. We have been blessed with not one but two viable vaccines,  with more on the horizon. We can't afford to undermine this success by  failing to provide the resources that are necessary for widespread  distribution.   The ball is in the Senate Democratic leader and Speaker Pelosi's  court. We have bipartisan support for targeted relief to address our  most critical priorities. In fact, the Democratic leader in the House  noted on Sunday:         I think we need to get an agreement, and we need to get       this bill passed. . . . Nobody  [[Page S7477]]       ever gets everything they want. And . . . it's critically       important that we deal with these very, very important       objectives even if we don't get on either side everything we       want.    That was from the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives.   Meanwhile, the Democratic whip on the Senate side was part of the  bipartisan group who suggested dropping the most controversial aspects  and focusing on those things on which we agree.   So the answer really lies with Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic  leader here in the Senate. Are they going to heed the bipartisan calls  to deliver critical coronavirus funding, or are they going to continue  to block relief for Americans?   Around our country, Americans are struggling under the worst wave of  the virus to date. They need more help. Above all, they need the  vaccinations that will help bring this pandemic to an end. We can pass  additional coronavirus relief legislation this week. To quote the  majority leader, let's ``get it done.''   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Nebraska (Mrs. Fischer), the Senator from Georgia (Mrs. Loeffler),  the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Perdue), and the Senator from Florida  (Mr. Rubio).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio)  would have voted ``yea.''
