 Mr. Speaker, I would like to encourage the body to pass  the Senior Independence Act.   When I was back home over the last week, as I toured my businesses,  wherever I went--be it in agriculture, tourism, transportation,  manufacturing, or retail--businesses all had the same problem. They  couldn't find enough people to work. They suggested I look at a change  in Social Security law.   Social Security is great, but currently under Social Security law-- and kind of a mistake that Franklin Roosevelt made in the original way  it was proposed--as soon as you make $19,500, you wind up losing a  dollar for every additional $2 you earn. This is causing people who  would like to work more to stop working because the tax rate is just  too high.   It is time to pass the Senior Independence Act and move toward the  point where you can make up to $30,000 before they take away your  money, allowing more independence for our seniors and more labor for  our businesses.                            ____________________
