 Madam Speaker, for 1\1/2\ years now, people in Texas  who are able to do so have been traveling out of State to obtain  abortion care, and now that 15 other States have banned abortion, more  people are traveling even farther to get the reproductive healthcare  that they need.   In response to this exercise of the constitutional right to travel,  lawmakers and others in Texas--and in States across the country--are  threatening to take away that right, too.   These threats fail not only to reflect the will of the majority of  people in this country, these threats fail to recognize the fundamental  rights of Americans guaranteed in our Constitution.   Congress has the authority and the responsibility to protect people  from these unconstitutional efforts to prevent, restrict, impede, or  otherwise punish a person traveling to another State to obtain a legal  abortion and to protect healthcare providers and others who assist that  person.   Last week, I reintroduced the Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive  Freedom Act which passed this House last year with Congresswoman  Marilyn Strickland, Congressman Jamie Raskin, and more than 150  original cosponsors.   Madam Speaker, I urge the House to pass this bill, once again, to  protect this fundamental right.                            ____________________
