 Madam Speaker, the so-called Republican tax plan will  increase taxes on the middle class, explode the deficit, and undermine  Medicare and Medicaid. It will saddle your children and grandchildren  with more than $1 trillion in debt, simply to provide millionaires and  billionaires with a massive tax cut.   Now, House Republicans will argue that trickle-down economics,  supply-side economics, and dynamic scoring will somehow magically save  the day. But the notion that massive tax cuts for millionaires and  billionaires will somehow result in strong economic growth is a phony,  fraudulent, and fake argument. It has no basis in reality. There is no  evidence to support this fantasy.   When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires, it  didn't result in strong economic growth. It led to a massive deficit.   When George W. Bush cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires, it  didn't result in strong economic growth. It led to the Great Recession.   When the Republican Governor of Kansas cut taxes on millionaires and  billionaires, it didn't result in strong economic growth. It led to  prison riots, overcrowded schools, and crumbling infrastructure.   We cannot allow this scheme to happen to the United States of  America. The American people deserve a better deal.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Jayapal, my good  friend and tremendous colleague on both the House Budget Committee and  the House Judiciary Committee, the distinguished gentlewoman from the  great State of Washington, for her tremendous advocacy, for anchoring  this Congressional Progressive Caucus Special Order, and for addressing  the American people on this critically important issue, so-called tax  reform put forth by House Republicans today in a manner that is clear- eyed, that is authentic, that is comprehensive, and that will hopefully  awaken the American people to the notion that this is an attempt by  House Republicans to do nothing more than to jam tax cuts for  millionaires and billionaires down the throats of the American people.                                time  1800    Now, I represent the Eighth Congressional District in Brooklyn and  Queens. I am proud to be a Member of the House of Representatives,  proud to be from the city of New York. And we are generous people in  New York City; generous people in New York State. In fact, New York  State regularly sends tens of billions of dollars more to the Federal  Government than we get back in return.   The State of Connecticut sends billions of dollars more to the  Federal Government than they get back in return. So does New Jersey. So  does California. So does Illinois. So does Pennsylvania. And, for  decades, we have allowed that generosity to continue to show itself in  terms of the fact that we get shortchanged in homeland security  dollars, transportation and infrastructure dollars, and a whole host of  other Federal funds that disproportionately make its way to other parts  of the country, often to States in the deep South.   We are generous people. But at what point is enough enough? And  today, you have crossed the line by putting a target on the backs of  people in New York, and New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and Illinois, and  California, and several other States, including people who live in  places like Charleston, South Carolina, or other cities that may have  relatively modest State taxes, if any at all, but who are taxed at the  local level, or who pay property taxes.   And so everyone throughout the United States of America, tens of  millions of people, are going to be hurt by this Republican tax plan,  because of the limitations on deductibility related to State and local  taxes, because of the draconian limitations on deducting property  taxes, and because of the limitations placed on middle class homeowners  as it relates to the mortgage interest deduction. You can't make this  stuff up.   The Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme to  provide a windfall to millionaires and billionaires, the wealthy and  the well-off, to special interest corporations, and to hide it in the  notion that it is a middle class tax cut. The Republican tax plan won't  help the middle class. It will hurt the middle class. It is a Ponzi  scheme. It will undermine Medicare and Medicaid. It will impose  billions and billions of dollars in additional deficit. It will force  your children and grandchildren to shoulder approximately $1.5 trillion  in additional debt. And this is all being done in order to provide  massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires, the overwhelming  majority of whom will be the ones who disproportionately benefit from  the so-called tax reform plan. Yes, it is a Ponzi scheme.   And why do I say that? Well, because what you are going to hear is  that trickle-down economic theory; supply-side economic theory; or the  latest word craft that they have come up with, dynamic scoring, will  result in a situation where these massive tax cuts for millionaires and  billionaires, and for special interest corporations, will somehow  magically result in unprecedented economic growth. Sounds good.   The only problem is that it is a failed, fraudulent, and fake  argument. It is a fantasy that has no basis in reality.   When Ronald Reagan, in 1981, cut taxes for the wealthy and for the  well-off, we didn't get unprecedented economic growth, we got massive  deficits.   When George W. Bush cut taxes for the wealthy and for the well-off in  2001 and 2003, we didn't get unprecedented economic growth, we got a  Great Recession--the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.   When the Republican Governor of Kansas moved forward with what he  [[Page H8428]]  called the Kansas experiment, massively cut taxes for the wealthy and  for the well-off in Kansas, so much so that the wealthiest 300,000  folks from Kansas didn't pay a single dollar in taxes at all--the  people of Kansas were promised unprecedented economic growth,  unprecedented job creation--this is the Republican Governor of Kansas-- when he cut taxes, you didn't get unprecedented economic growth. What  you got were prison riots, overcrowded classrooms, and crumbling  infrastructure.   The Republican tax plan is nothing more than a Ponzi scheme. Supply- side economics has failed; trickle-down economics has failed; dynamic  scoring is a fantasy. We would say in Brooklyn: Don't believe the hype.  We will surgically communicate to the American people why the  Republican tax plan will hurt the middle class, hurt working families,  hurt children, hurt senior citizens, and hurt those who aspire to be  part of the middle class.   And one last point that I would make: I am shocked that you would put  a target on the back of people who are paying State and local taxes-- presumably because you think this is a deduction that the American  people no longer deserve--but then in your same tax plan you allow  corporations and businesses, wealthy titans of corporate America who  run these companies, to continue to deduct State and local taxes on  their corporate tax returns. Seriously? You don't even pretend to have  equitable treatment? Oh, I forgot: corporations are people, too.   This is an extraordinary scheme that they are going to try to jam  down the throats of the American people. But we are here, as Democrats,  to make sure that the American people understand that you are being  offered a raw deal. We are going to present to you and fight for a  better deal for middle class tax cuts, for tax cuts for small  businesses, tax cuts for working families, and to make sure that people  in America continue to pay their fair share.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Washington  for yielding to me.    Mr. Speaker, I think that is a great question, and it  is deeply troubling.   You hear the words ``regular order.'' That is a Washington, D.C.,  phrase, but we can translate it for the American people. Regular order  equals democracy, and democracy is being undermined as it relates to  the Republican tax plan, Ponzi scheme, because they are going to try to  jam it down the throats of the American people.   Not a single meaningful hearing, as was done on a bipartisan basis in  1986, when Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill got together to reform the Tax  Code in a meaningful way, in a bipartisan way, in a thoughtful way.  But, unfortunately, regular order, democracy, is being undermined by  this Republican-led Congress, as it relates to this tax bill.    Well, I appreciate you going through that important  list. I think it can be distilled, you know, quite simply.   The winners of the Republican tax plan are the billionaire boys club;  the losers are the American people, everyday Americans, all premised,  again, on, and you are going to hear this over and over again, dynamic  scoring--sounds great--trickle-down economics.   You know, I figured out that trickle-down economics essentially  means, for the middle class, you may get a trickle, but you are  guaranteed to stay down, because there is no evidence--no evidence from  the Reagan experiment, no evidence from the Bush experiment, no  evidence from the Brownback experiment in Kansas, no evidence--that if  you cut taxes for the wealthy or the well off, for special interest  corporations, whether you do it directly or through passthrough  entities, that when you cut those taxes, it results in strong,  unprecedented economic growth. In fact, our history tells us precisely  the opposite.   Bill Clinton raised the top tax rate on high-income earners from 35  percent to 39.6 percent. Did we suffer from a recession as a result of  increasing taxes on millionaires and billionaires so that they would  pay their fair share? No, quite the opposite--unprecedented economic  growth, 20 million-plus jobs created during 8 years of Bill Clinton.   Then George W. Bush comes into town, and we actually had a balanced  budget at that time. What does he do? Deficits don't matter according  to the Bush administration. We are going to stimulate tremendous  economic growth by cutting taxes on millionaires and billionaires  because of trickle-down economics, supply-side economics, dynamic  scoring, lower the tax rate from 39.6 on millionaires and billionaires  to 35.   What happened? We lost more than 500,000 jobs in 8 years of the Bush  Presidency.   Barack Obama comes into town and we had all of these doom-and-gloom  projections from my good friends on the other side in terms of what was  going to happen. He campaigns on millionaires and billionaires paying  their fair share, raises the top tax rate from 35 percent to 39.6  percent. Twelve million-plus private sector jobs were created during 8  years of the Obama Presidency.   That is why I say that the Republican tax plan is nothing more than a  Ponzi scheme based on a failed, fraudulent, phony theory of trickle- down economics that has no basis in reality.   I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Washington for yielding  and being so generous and thoughtful in her discussion.
