 Madam Speaker, every single day, eight kids  are killed or injured by unintentional shootings with guns found in the  home. Last week a 9-year-old child accidentally shot their 4-year-old  sibling in the face at their home in Tennessee. Earlier this year a 4- year-old boy in Oakland barely survived after accidentally shooting  himself in the head with a gun he found under the pillow.   These accidental shootings are preventable. That is why I am  introducing the Prevent Family Fire Act of 2019, a bipartisan bill to  reduce gun violence by providing a modest tax credit to incentivize the  sale of things like gun safes. If we expand safe storage, we can reduce  accidental shootings by 73 percent.   It is not just accidental shootings. Over 75 percent of school  shootings involve kids and teens having access to unsecured guns at  home, and more than 80 percent of guns used by youth in suicide  attempts were kept in the home of a victim, a relative, or a friend.   There is much more we need to do to address gunfire, but this  commonsense bill is a step we can take to save lives.                            ____________________
