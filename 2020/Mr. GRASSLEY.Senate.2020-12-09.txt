 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, on November 27, it was announced that  the Iowa Air National Guard's 185th Air Refueling Wing in Sioux City,  IA, has been awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.   This award was earned for the wing's exceptional service to the Air  Force in 2019, which included the usual thousands of flying hours and  refueling, but it also included things like the humanitarian efforts of  this wing's effort in the multiple Puerto Rican natural disasters.   In addition, the 185th Wing has been working tirelessly to support  cleanup efforts from this great windstorm in Iowa called the derecho,  which wiped out 800,000 acres of crops through the middle of Iowa. It  also included such things that they may not be recognized for enough-- helping with the COVID-19 testings in the State of Iowa.   So I say congratulations to the 185th Wing, and, most importantly,  thank you for your dedication to serving our State and country.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
