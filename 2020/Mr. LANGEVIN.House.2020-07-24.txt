 Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago this Sunday, President George  H.W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act into law and  ushered in a new era of equality and justice for people with  disabilities.   This law was ushered through Congress with the great leadership of  people like Senator Tom Harkin; Congressman Tony Coelho; our current  majority leader, Steny Hoyer; Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner; and  countless others who rallied behind this cause, including from the  private sector, people like Justin Dart. This was an extraordinary  grassroots effort from around the country.   The ADA guaranteed that the one in four Americans living with a  disability have the right to learn, work, and live in their  communities, free from discrimination.   As someone who has lived with a disability since the age of 16, I  have witnessed the transformation we have made into a more accessible  and inclusive society. In fact, without the ADA, I quite possibly  wouldn't have the privilege of representing Rhode Island's Second  Congressional District in the United States Congress.   However, our work is not yet finished. We must strengthen the promise  of the ADA to ensure that all people with disabilities can pursue the  life that they choose. Accessible transportation, comprehensive home  and community-based services, inclusive workplaces, and universally  designed technology are only a few of the challenges that we must  tackle moving forward.   Madam Speaker, inclusivity benefits us all, and we must continue  fighting for a world where accessibility is the default, not an  afterthought.   Happy 30th anniversary to all those who have been a part of this  effort to include all those with disabilities in achieving a more  active and inclusive life in our country.                            ____________________
