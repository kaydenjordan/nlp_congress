 Madam Clerk, I rise to nominate the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Hern) as Speaker of the House.   Madam Clerk, we have been accused of not having a plan. Well, we have  presented many plans and are even presenting two plans simultaneously  right now for Speaker of the people's House.    I sat in my chair anticipating to vote for Byron Donalds, whom I  respect, whom I see as a leader, and there was a gut check that said we  need someone that is going to convince my colleagues on this side of  the aisle that it is time to get going. It is time to build momentum.   Many of you have said it. You see that Kevin McCarthy does not have  the votes. You are understanding that he is not going to get there.   We had the votes for him. I cannot produce those anymore. The  colleagues that I brought with me to offer those 218 votes on the first  ballot aren't there anymore. It is not happening.   As it has been said, we need to get to a point where we start  evaluating what life after Kevin McCarthy looks like.   America doesn't want more talk, and I am going to keep my speech a  little short. They want action. I will take that. I want to get to  work, too.   America is tired of rhetoric, and they want results. This isn't  chaos. This is a constitutional republic at work.   I am a mom of four boys. I know what chaos and dysfunction look like.  This is actually a really beautiful thing, to be here with all of my  colleagues debating.   Just as the gentleman from Montana said, we have not experienced this  in the 2 years that we have served here in Washington, D.C. This is the  most debate that has taken place, and I love it. I love the  conversations that are going on, on the floor, in the Cloakroom, and in  the Halls. There is nothing extreme. There is nothing unreasonable. We  are trying to get this right.   As my conservative colleagues and I have stated time and time again,  Congress is broken and fundamentally needs change. I am here to get  this right.   We need a leader that is not of the broken system, someone who is not  beholden to the lobbyists but to the people who sent us here, someone  who can unite our party, and, most importantly, someone who can deliver  on the promises that we have all made to the American people.   I believe that there are many people on the floor today that can do  just that. I voted for my friend   Jim Jordan. I voted for my friend  Byron Donalds. I am voting for Kevin Hern, the gentleman from Oklahoma.   Mr. Hern went from rags to riches. Like myself and many other  Members, he is a small business owner. He has lived the American Dream.   He is a father, a family man, and as Kevin likes to say, he is a  conservative, but he is not mad about it. We can have a happy warrior  leading us.   I understand that threats have been made about committee assignments,  that you won't receive committee assignments if you do not vote for  Kevin McCarthy. That is true; it happened in Conference. That is  exactly what we were told, but we don't govern in fear. We govern for  the people on principle. Don't be afraid to do the right thing.   I believe that Kevin Hern is a unifier. He just received the  chairmanship of the Republican Study Committee by unanimous consent.  This is the largest caucus in our Conference. Look how many people have  already put their trust in Kevin Hern to lead them.   I get asked by my constituents: Where does this go? Who can unify the  party? Who can deliver results?   Representative Kevin Hern can do just that, and I am proud to enter  his name into nomination, and I hope that some of you join me.   The CLERK. The Reading Clerk will now call the roll.   The tellers having taken their places, the House proceeded to vote  for the Speaker.   The following is the result of the vote:                               [Roll No. 11]                               JEFFRIES--212       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Balint      Barragan      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bowman      Boyle (PA)      Brown      Brownley      Budzinski      Bush      Caraveo      Carbajal      Cardenas      Carson      Carter (LA)      Cartwright      Casar      Case      Casten      Castor (FL)      Castro (TX)      Cherfilus-McCormick      Chu      Cicilline      Clark (MA)      Clarke (NY)      Cleaver      Clyburn      Cohen      Connolly      Correa      Costa      Courtney      Craig      Crockett      Crow      Cuellar      Davids (KS)      Davis (IL)      Davis (NC)      Dean (PA)      DeGette      DeLauro      DelBene      Deluzio      DeSaulnier      Dingell      Doggett      Escobar      Eshoo      Espaillat      Evans      Fletcher      Foster      Foushee      Frankel, Lois      Frost      Gallego      Garamendi      Garcia (IL)      Garcia (TX)      Garcia, Robert      Golden (ME)      Goldman (NY)      Gomez      Gonzalez, Vicente      Gottheimer      Green (TX)      Grijalva      Harder (CA)      Hayes      Higgins (NY)      Himes      Horsford      Houlahan      Hoyer      Hoyle (OR)      Huffman      Ivey      Jackson (IL)      Jackson (NC)      Jackson Lee      Jacobs      Jayapal      Jeffries      Johnson (GA)      Kamlager-Dove      Kaptur      Keating      Kelly (IL)      Khanna      Kildee      Kilmer      Kim (NJ)      Krishnamoorthi      Kuster      Landsman      Larsen (WA)      Larson (CT)      Lee (CA)      Lee (NV)      Lee (PA)      Leger Fernandez      Levin      Lieu      Lofgren      Lynch      Magaziner      Manning      Matsui      McBath      McCollum      McGarvey      McGovern      Meeks      Menendez      Meng      Mfume      Moore (WI)      Morelle      Moskowitz      Moulton      Mrvan      Mullin      Nadler      Napolitano      Neal      Neguse      Nickel      Norcross      Ocasio-Cortez      Omar      Pallone      Panetta      Pappas      Pascrell      Payne      Pelosi      Peltola      Perez      Peters      Pettersen      Phillips      Pingree      Pocan      Porter      Pressley      Quigley      Ramirez      Raskin      Ross      Ruiz      Ruppersberger      Ryan      Salinas      Sanchez      Sarbanes      Scanlon      Schakowsky      Schiff      Schneider      Scholten      Schrier      Scott (VA)      Scott, David      Sewell      Sherman      Sherrill      Slotkin      Smith (WA)      Sorensen      Soto      Spanberger      Stansbury      Stanton      Stevens      Strickland      Swalwell      Sykes      Takano      Thanedar      Thompson (CA)      Thompson (MS)      Titus      Tlaib      Tokuda      Tonko      Torres (CA)      Torres (NY)      Trahan      Trone      Underwood      Vargas      Vasquez      Veasey      Velazquez      Wasserman Schultz      Waters      Watson Coleman      Wexton      Wild      Williams (GA)      Wilson (FL)                               McCARTHY--200       Aderholt      Alford      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bean (FL)      Bentz      Bergman      Bice      Bilirakis      Bost      Buchanan      Bucshon      Burchett      Burgess      Burlison      Calvert      Cammack      Carey      Carl      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chavez-DeRemer      Ciscomani      Cline      Cole      Collins      Comer      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davidson      De La Cruz      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Duarte      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Edwards      Ellzey      Emmer      Estes      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flood      Foxx      Franklin, C.

The tellers agree in their tallies that the total number  of votes cast is 432, of which the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries of the  State of New York has received 212 votes, the Honorable Kevin McCarthy  of the State of California has received 200 votes, the Honorable Byron  Donalds of the State of Florida has received 17 votes, the Honorable  Kevin Hern of the State of Oklahoma has received 3 votes, with 1  recorded as present.   No Member-elect having received a majority of the votes cast, a  Speaker has not been elected.   The Clerk recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Ciscomani).    Madam Clerk, I rise to nominate Kevin Hern for Speaker  of the House.   It is as simple as that. Let's start getting somewhere with this;  realize the fact that Kevin McCarthy does not have the votes.   Let's elect a Republican who can unify our Conference, who is a true  leader. I am casting my vote for Kevin Hern, and I hope you will, as  well.   The CLERK. The Reading Clerk will now call the roll.
