 Madam Speaker, a cyberattack on a software  supply chain is like an infectious disease outbreak, spreading widely  and rapidly, and causing untold damage far and wide.   The SolarWinds espionage campaign against the United States, which  spread surreptitiously through a software product, represents the  greatest intrusion into the Federal Government in the history of the  United States.   SolarWinds should serve as a wake-up call. The United States  Government can no longer take for granted the safety of the software it  uses. The Federal Government must be proactive in identifying and  correcting cyber vulnerabilities; and as the lead agency on  cybersecurity, DHS in particular must emerge as the gold standard.   I am therefore proud to partner, on a bipartisan basis, with my  colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Garbarino), to pass H.R.  4611, the DHS Software Supply Chain Risk Management Act of 2021.   H.R. 4611 would require the DHS Under Secretary for Management to  issue department-wide guidance that in turn requires DHS contractors to  submit a software bill of materials, identifying the origin of each  component of software provided to DHS.   DHS should know the precise origin of the software it uses; whether a  software component comes from a questionable firm that fails to follow  best practices in cybersecurity; whether it comes from a hostile  nation-state intent on planting back doors.   Homeland security can easily die in darkness, and the purpose of H.R.  4611 is to bring greater light, greater transparency to the software  supply chains which for far too long have been left wide open to cyber  espionage and sabotage. We owe it to ourselves to learn from the  experience of SolarWinds, for those who fail to learn from history are  doomed to repeat it.    Mr. Speaker, one of the central values of the  Build Back Better Act is pandemic preparedness.   COVID-19 has left a death toll of more than 600,000 Americans and a  cost of $16 trillion. If the cataclysm of COVID-19 cannot move our  country to prioritize pandemic preparedness, then nothing will.   A wise person once said, Those who fail to learn from history are  doomed to repeat it. And if we fail to pass the Build Back Better Act,  we are in danger of reliving a history whose repeat we cannot afford.   The Build Back Better Act would enable the United States to develop  and distribute vaccines within a few months of a new pandemic threat.  It would enable the United States to develop vaccines not only for  particular viruses but whole families of viruses with pandemic  potential. It would shore up domestic manufacturing of critical  supplies so that we are no longer at the mercy of a fragile global  supply chain.   We have the resources to prevent the next pandemic. The only question  that remains is do we have the political will to Build Back Better.                            ____________________
