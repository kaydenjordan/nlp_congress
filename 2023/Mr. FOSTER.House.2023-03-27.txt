 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of  one of my district staff members, Wendy Salberg, as she marks 10 years  serving in my office and 15 years serving the people of Illinois.   Wendy began her work as a congressional staffer in the office of  Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert, who for many years represented  the old 13th District of Illinois.   In 2012, after I was fortunate to win the election to represent the  newly created 11th Congressional District, which incorporated many of  the areas of the old 13th District, it soon became clear that we needed  to keep Wendy Salberg on the job.   Wendy has dedicated herself to serving constituents, no matter what  their background, helping them navigate the world of the Federal  agencies. Wendy quickly earned a reputation throughout the Illinois  congressional delegation as being one of the best advocates for people  with immigration and international travel issues, from simple passport  applications to complicated citizenship cases.   I was fortunate that Wendy agreed to stay on and manage immigration  casework for my office, and countless constituents who have worked with  her over the past 10 years would undoubtedly agree. I cannot tell you  how many people have reached out to me over the years or come to me at  events I have attended to tell me how grateful they were for the work  that Wendy put into their cases.   Beyond her day-to-day work, Wendy's value to our office cannot be  understated. No matter what she is doing, she will drop everything to  help her coworkers with whatever they need, whether it be advice, a  good laugh, or just an ear to listen. Day in and day out, she is a  warm, welcoming presence who truly embodies our mission to serve the  people of Illinois and to serve those around her.   I could not be prouder to have her on my staff, and her former boss,  Representative Judy Biggert, agrees. In joining me in celebrating  Wendy's service to the people of Illinois, she wrote, ``Helping  constituents navigate their way through layers of government  bureaucracy is seldom easy, but no bureaucratic barrier was ever a  serious match for Wendy's tenacity and inventiveness. When she is on  your case, it is like a dog with a bone--dedicated, persistent, and  completely involved. If there is a way to solve your problem, Wendy  will find it.''   All of us who know her know that these words could not be more true.   It is my distinct honor to recognize the service of Wendy Salberg on  behalf of the people of the 11th Congressional District and the old  13th District of Illinois.                            ____________________
