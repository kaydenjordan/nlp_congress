 Mr. President, I want to congratulate the  students, faculty, and parents of Kindred Elementary School, located in  Kindred, ND, on being awarded the 2017 National Blue Ribbon School  Award.   Founded in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes  public and private elementary, middle, and high schools where students  perform at very high levels or where significant improvements are being  made in students' academic achievement. A National Blue Ribbon Schools  flag overhead has become a mark of excellence in education recognized  by everyone from parents to policymakers in thousands of communities.  Since the program's founding, the U.S. Department of Education has  bestowed this coveted award to more than 8,500 of America's best  schools.   Kindred Elementary School serves nearly 460 students and was one of  three schools in North Dakota to be designated as an Exemplary High  Performing School under this award. Receiving recognition as a National  Blue Ribbon School signifies the hard work and dedication of the  educators, students, and parents involved, and I have no doubt the  students at Kindred Elementary are on a path to success. Kindred  Elementary hires and retains highly effective teachers that operate  using professional learning communities. This allows school staff to  collaborate on a daily basis and develop methods for continuous  improvement based on student data and progress. To support its  students, the school uses a multitiered approach called response-to- intervention, RtI, that offers timely support to students' academic and  behavioral needs. The RtI team consists of classroom teachers, special  education teachers, speech and occupational therapy staff, and other  key staff. Kindred's innovative approach and commitment to developing  student potential has resulted in high student outcomes that we can all  be proud of.   School leadership states the ``school district thrives because of the  strong relationship between students, their families, community  members, and the school district staff.'' To further the communal  relationship, the school offers enrichment opportunities through  lyceums, field trips, and guest presenters and performers. It is  through this dedication that the school provides a tailored education  that allows student, staff, and faculty to succeed.   The Kindred Public School District's mission statement reads,  ``Improving tomorrow, by learning today.'' This mission embodies all  that Kindred Elementary is working to accomplish by looking at the  needs of each individual student, as well as providing a safe and  respectful learning environment that breeds success. I wish the very  best to the community of Kindred and congratulations to all engaged at  Kindred Elementary for achieving this high honor. Thank you for your  commitment to our children and leaders of tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to congratulate the  students, faculty, and parents of Legacy Elementary School, located in  West Fargo, ND, on being awarded the 2017 National Blue Ribbon School  Award.
