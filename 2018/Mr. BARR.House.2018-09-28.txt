 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the families of the Commonwealth  of Kentucky which suffers from the third highest opioid overdose  mortality rate in the Nation, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, and I  thank the chairman for his leadership on this.   This legislation marks a critical investment to help individuals and  families struggling with addiction rise above addiction and transition  back into the workforce.   Specifically, H.R. 6 includes my legislation, the CAREER Act, which  creates a demonstration program to promote evidence-based transitional  housing that pairs recovery support with life skills, workforce  training, and job placement.   I would like to thank the many nonprofits in my home State of  Kentucky for inspiring this legislation.  [[Page H9249]]
