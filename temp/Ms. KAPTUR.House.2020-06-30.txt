 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2, the  INVEST in America Act.   Through robust Federal recovery efforts, this legislation will create  real jobs. It will empower communities across our country. America will  rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, bring our transit and highway  systems into the 21st century, and advance historic investments in  clean energy technologies toward a modern power future.   Additionally, H.R. 2 reauthorizes funding for the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative. This invaluable program is central to the  preservation of the Great Lakes freshwater economy. A Federal helping  hand will authorize key investments in wastewater infrastructure,  cleaning up algal blooms, and modernizing the weatherization program to  confront the 21st century challenges of climate change.   Crafted with the expert hand of my friend and colleague, Chairman  DeFazio, with significant input from Members of Congress on both sides  of the aisle, this legislation will build America forward as a Nation.   The eloquent words of   Daniel Webster, enshrined on the walls of  this House Chamber urge us to ``develop the resources of our land, call  forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great  interests, and see whether we also in our day and generation may not  perform something worthy to be remembered.''   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2 will be remembered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Lipinski, the Rules Committee,  and Chairman DeFazio for making my amendment to H.R. 2 in order under  en bloc.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment expresses the sense of Congress that  Amtrak has taken a wrongheaded and shortsighted approach to limiting  daily service on numerous long-distance routes. Amtrak's proposal to  limit service on 13 of its long-distance routes will be devastating for  the system as a whole and the communities it serves.   After receiving over $1 billion from the CARES Act, Amtrak's plan to  limit services of long-distance routes is unacceptable and may lead to  a long-term, slash-and-burn strategy by the carrier.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Northeast Ohio  Areawide Coordinating Agency that shows just how critical Amtrak is to  the economic future of our Nation.                                      Cleveland, OH, June 29, 2020.      Hon. Marcy Kaptur,      House of Representatives Washington, D.C.        Congresswoman Kaptur: I am writing as Executive Director of       the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA), the       metropolitan planning organization for the five counties       surrounding Cleveland that represents 2.1 million people and       166 cities, villages, and towns. NOACA is responsible for       creating the federally mandated long range transportation       vision for the region, and we are currently in the beginning       phases of developing our next 30-year Long Range Plan:       eNE02050--an Equitable Future for Northeast Ohio. As NOACA's       Board of Directors considers the current and future       transportation needs of our region, we make important       decisions about how to best provide transportation options       for all users in an equitable and environmentally sustainable       manner. As stated in NOACA's Board-adopted vision statement,       NOACA will strengthen regional cohesion, preserve existing       infrastructure, and build a sustainable multimodal       transportation system to support economic development and       enhance quality of life in Northeast Ohio.        In this context, I am writing to express support for your       effort to sustain daily Amtrak service to Northeast Ohio, in       order to give all residents equitable access to points east       and west for education, business, and recreational       opportunities. NOACA supports the notion of transportation       choice, and Amtrak has long provided an essential option to       residents seeking safe and affordable travel to other regions       and states. As you know, NOACA is part of a public private       partnership to develop Great Lakes Hyperloop, a next-      generation hyperloop route that will carry passengers quickly       and efficiently to Chicago and Pittsburgh, and beyond. NOACA       has entered into an agreement with Hyperloop Transportation       Technology (HTT) to make this project a reality in the       future. But until that happens, it's important that Amtrak       rail service continue on a daily basis, to help students get       to college without a car, give business travelers an option       other than flying, and give all residents access they deserve       to destinations across the nation.        Furthermore, reducing rail service at this time, while the       nation is recovering from the COVID-19 economic crisis, would       only serve to limit the region's ability to continue moving       forward. Even a temporary reduction in service would be       detrimental to economic recovery and continued job growth in       the important Great Lakes region.        In closing, thank you for your leadership on this issue,       and I am pleased to add NOACA's support for your amendment to       retain Amtrak daily service as part of Northeast Ohio's       transportation network.            Sincerely,                                                    Grace Gallucci,                                                Executive Director.     Mr. Speaker, Amtrak's proposal will stifle economic  recovery and only add to the growing unemployment in communities that  are served by these long-distance routes.   Mr. Speaker, despite an infusion of CARES Act funding, these proposed  routes guarantee a slimmer workforce that endangers the carrier's long- term health.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for en bloc amendment C and  to support H.R. 2.
