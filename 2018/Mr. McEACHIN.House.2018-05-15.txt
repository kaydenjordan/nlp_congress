 Mr. Speaker, more than 24 million people in the United  States are affected by asthma. Of that, more than 6 million are  children. The children who live with asthma must limit their physical  activities or even miss schooldays because of lung disease that is  linked to outdoor air pollution. But if we act now, future generations  will not have to face such a reality.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on our Nation's leaders to protect  human health and promote a healthy environment for this generation and  the next.   Last month I introduced the Healthy Environment for Children Act  because our children deserve an environment that will not hurt, hinder,  or force them to live indoors. The Healthy Environment for Children Act  would prohibit any reduction, consolidation, or  [[Page H3959]]  termination of the National Center for Environmental Research, also  known as the NCER, and its affiliated programs. By preventing such  changes, my bill will safeguard critical research into the effect of  chemicals, climate change, and air quality on children's health.   Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. I urge you to think of our  future and to bring this bill to the floor for a vote.                            ____________________
