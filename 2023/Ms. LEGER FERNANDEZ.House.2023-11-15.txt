 Mr. Speaker, indeed, today we have yet another  extreme Republican appropriations bill that focuses more on tax breaks  for wealthy tax cheats than keeping our communities safe.   When asked what bothers them most about taxes, nearly two-thirds of  Americans said they feel that the wealthy and corporations are not  paying their fair share. Instead of making sure the IRS has the tools  it needs to go after wealthy tax cheats, this bill slashes its budget  by $22 billion.   For every dollar cut from IRS law enforcement, we tend to lose $2 in  tax revenue. Republicans are clearly bad at budgeting when they are  giving away revenue.   But wait, there is more. Republicans like to say they are the party  of law and order, but this bill also cuts the FBI's law enforcement  work by $400 million. Cutting the FBI's budget would hurt our rural  communities. FBI agents can bring in technology and tools that help  solve crimes that a small police force, like in my district, just don't  have.   How can we expect to interdict fentanyl in our rural areas or to go  after criminal cartels when we are cutting the FBI and cutting the  Department of Justice, which would prosecute those despicable  traffickers of death and despair?   Republicans are clearly bad at making sure criminals are  investigated, charged, tried, and sent to prison.   But wait, that is not all. While Democrats are putting people over  politics and growing the middle class, the extreme Republican  appropriations bills are blockading the road to the middle class. This  appropriations bill cuts the pathway to prosperity when it cuts  economic development programming to 51 percent below last year's  levels.                                time  1000    In New Mexico, these cuts would jeopardize local and Tribal economic  development projects helping us grow jobs and businesses after the  closure of coal mines and coal plants. These cuts would take economic  funding down to a level not seen since 2014. Extreme Republicans are  clearly looking backward.   My focus in Congress must be toward a future of hope, prosperity, and  opportunity.   At the Rules Committee yesterday, Republicans told me they didn't  have a choice but to make these cuts. That is not true. Remember, they  are choosing to give up billions of dollars of tax revenue owed by  wealthy tax cheats. Republicans built the deficit. In 2017, 2003, and  2001, Republicans chose tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations.  Their choices tell us their priorities.   Mr. Speaker, I have no other choice but to urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on this rule, and if we ever see it on the floor, vote ``no'' on  this bill.
