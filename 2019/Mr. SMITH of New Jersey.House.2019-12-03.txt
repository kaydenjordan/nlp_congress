 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 517, a  resolution by Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul, supporting the  Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.   The Global Fund is a financing partnership of governments, private  donors, and civil societies that have a shared purpose of ending HIV/ AIDS, TB, and malaria. Since its founding in 2002, the Global Fund is  credited with saving millions of lives.   Nor is our contribution to combat these diseases limited to the  Global Fund. As my colleagues know, since its inception in 2002, the  Global Fund has worked with U.S. programs, such as the President's  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has radically and  positively changed the course of health outcomes.  [[Page H9193]]    President Bush initiated the PEPFAR program, which has been  transformative in so many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan  Africa. According to PEPFAR's latest data, over 18 million lives have  been saved due to PEPFAR's intervention.   I would note the success in blocking mother-to-child transmission of  AIDS during pregnancy. At the end of September 2019, Mr. Speaker, over  2.6 million babies born of HIV-infected mothers have been born HIV  free.   In addition to President Bush's extraordinary leadership, we should  also note the lasting reforms and contributions of Mark Dybul. Mark  served as the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator from 2006 to 2009,  implementing PEPFAR during that critical period. He then went on to  serve as the executive director of the Global Fund, instituting reforms  such that we stand here today recognizing the critical role that the  Global Fund is playing in the fight against HIV/AIDS.   Among other things, Mark insisted on the key role that faith-based  organizations play in the fight against the spread of HIV. Africa, in  particular, is a faith-based continent, and to neglect the role of the  churches, as some had advocated at the time, would be to neglect the  single most important grassroots institution in the lives of the people  on the continent.   Mark also spearheaded risk avoidance strategies, including keeping  adolescent girls in school, which has proven critical in delaying the  onset of sexual activity and reducing the transmission of AIDS.   Mr. Speaker, the American people allocate $6 billion a year to the  President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which Congress  extended for another 5 years via legislation that I authored with  Democrat Barbara Lee and that President Trump signed into law on  December 11 last year.    Along with funds we dedicate in USAID's global health account to  combat AIDS, TB, and malaria, our contributions to PEPFAR and the  Global Fund make our global leadership unparalleled in the entire  world. And it is not just simply providing funds. It is the leadership  and commitment to excellence demonstrated by people such as our Global  AIDS Coordinator today, Deborah Birx, and her team, which makes our  commitment so impactful.   Yet, to sustain its progress, the Global Fund needs at least $14  billion over the next 3 years. To help the fund reach its goal, the  U.S. commitment would need to be $1.56 billion. I am happy to say, 2  months ago, the Global Fund held its replenishment meeting, where  pledge amounts for the next 3 years were submitted. The United States  Government pledged $1.56 billion, with other donors coming to the table  to help the Global Fund raise the critically needed money.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the ranking member of  the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  [[Page H9196]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Sires for his strong support for this  legislation and for his leadership on neglected tropical diseases. I  thank my other colleagues, Mr. McCaul and, of course, Ms. Bass, who has  also been a great supporter of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, neglected tropical diseases, or NTDs, are a group of  parasitic and bacterial diseases, including worms, which blind,  disfigure, and sometimes kill victims from among the world's poorest  people, trapping the most marginalized communities in cycles of  poverty. There are numerous examples of them, including Chagas, dengue,  and leprosy.   Can you believe, Mr. Speaker, that there are over 200,000 cases of  leprosy in the world today? And there is an intervention. There are  drugs that can treat, mitigate, and even cure it, but sometimes people  do not get access to them, and that causes serious, serious problems.   The worms--and I will get into that in a minute--are absolutely  devastating, as well, and they need to be addressed very aggressively.   Mr. Speaker, approximately 2 billion people--almost one-third of the  world's population--are at risk of contracting an NTD, and over 1.4  billion people are currently afflicted with one or more NTDs.   Over the years, Mr. Speaker, I have chaired numerous hearings on  this: one in 2013; one in 2016, the global Zika epidemic; and many  others, always focusing on the fact that we need to do more.   These are preventable, but they are certainly treatable. But if you  don't get the drugs and you don't get the intervention, that person is  made--and those who are like that person--to suffer horrifically.   I introduced the End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act in four separate  Congresses--2014, 2015, 2017, and again this year--so I deeply  appreciate Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul's strong support  for this legislation and the leadership for bringing it up today.   NTDs have an enormous impact in terms of disease burden and quality  of life. It causes the loss of life to about 534,000 people. NTDs  surpass both malaria and tuberculosis in causing greater loss of life- years to disability and premature death. They cause disfigurement and  disability, often leading to stigma, social discrimination, and  societal marginalization.   NTDs create an economic burden of billions of dollars through the  loss of productivity and the high costs of healthcare required for  treatment when it gets, especially, to a critical stage.    People afflicted by NTDs are less productive than their healthy  counterparts. They jeopardize the ability of people to attend work and  school or to produce at full capacity.   The social, economic, and health burden of NTDs falls primarily on  low- and middle-income countries, where access to safe water,  sanitation, and healthcare is limited.   At least 100 countries face two endemic NTD burdens, and 30 countries  carry six or more endemic neglected tropical diseases.   As I said, they can be controlled. They can be prevented and even  eliminated, using low-cost, effective, and feasible solutions,  especially when treated early.   Research and development efforts are immediately needed for all NTDs,  especially those for which no treatment currently exists.   Recent data published by the WHO confirm that, in 2018, more than 1  billion people were treated for at least one of five neglected tropical  diseases.   Not well understood, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that neglected tropical  diseases are infecting large numbers of vulnerable people--especially  children--in developed countries, including the United States. Of  course, these include West Nile virus, dengue fever, and, most  recently, Zika.   An article published in the medical journal The Lancet scrutinized  this emerging threat and was titled, ``Neglected Tropical Diseases: No  Longer Someone Else's Problem.'' The article references world-renowned  NTD expert Dr. Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine, who, I note  parenthetically, twice testified at hearings that I chaired.   I read his book--and I read it not once, but twice. It is a wake-up  call to what these horrible diseases do. But he estimates that more  than half of the 20 million Americans living in extreme poverty are  infected with at least one neglected tropical disease. That is right  here in the United States of America.   The End Neglected Tropical Diseases Act supports the treatment,  control, and elimination of NTDs primarily by ensuring that USAID's NTD  Program effectively integrates treatment, control, and elimination  efforts with other development issues, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, water  and sanitation, and education.   It also directs, as my good friend Mr. Sires pointed out a moment  ago, the U.S. Government to advocate for increased efforts to address  NTDs among international institutions such as the U.N., World Health  Organization, and World Bank.   Let's not forget that of the 14 most common NTDs, roughly 80 percent  of infections are caused by soil-transmitted helminths and  schistosomiasis.   Soil-transmitted helminths are a group of three parasitic worms-- roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms--that afflict more than 1 billion  people worldwide, including 600 million school-age children, of whom  more than 300 million suffer from severe morbidity.   Schistosomiasis is another helminth infection affecting at least 220  million people in developing countries, and the World Health  Organization estimates that 90 percent of those individuals are in sub- Saharan Africa.   The benefits of deworming are immediate and enduring. A rigorous,  randomized controlled trial has shown that school-based deworming  treatment reduces absenteeism by 25 percent. School-based deworming  also benefits young siblings and other children who live nearby but are  too young to be treated, leading to large cognitive improvements  equivalent to half a year of schooling.   Let me also point out to my colleagues that the treatment for worms  is simple and cost-effective. Treatment for hookworm, for example, in  Tanzania costs about 4 cents per treatment to knock this terrible  disease out of the intestinal tract. Yet one-off deworming treatment is  not enough, as, without sanitary and hygiene behavioral changes, people  will get reinfected.   What we need to do, and what this bill does, is to integrate our  USAID deworming programs with our WaSH programs--water, sanitation, and  health--coupled with our nutrition interventions.   Let me just also make a point that needs to be underscored with  exclamation points. There is a very, very robust public-private  partnership that USAID leads with pharmaceutical industry companies  such as GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, and Merck.   And, of course, my friend in the chair and my friend managing the  bill on the Democrat side know, because these companies hail from the  great State of New Jersey--Merck in Rahway, for example--every U.S.  taxpayer dollar invested is leveraged with $26 in donated medicines,  resulting in $22 billion worth of donated medicine, which is  extraordinary. I don't know of any other health program where the  pharmaceuticals have stepped up like this to say: We are not going to  sell you these drugs; we are going to donate them.   We also have helped train 6.5 million individuals in countries around  the world to fight NTDs, helping them build and strengthen health  systems. So we are, I think, making a difference. We need to do more.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield  such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul),  the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 546.   I want to thank Mr. Sires for authoring this very important  resolution, which reiterates that Russia should not be permitted to  rejoin the Group of Eight summits until Putin's flagrant aggression  radically changes.   Since the Russian invasion in 2014, Ukraine has been embroiled in a  battle for territorial sovereignty. For 6 years, Russia has illegally  occupied the Crimean Peninsula and supported separatist fighting in the  Donbas region of Ukraine.   For over a decade, Russia has also illegally occupied the Abkhazia  and South Ossetia regions of Georgia, which constitute 20 percent of  Georgia's territory.   Mr. Speaker, I visited Tbilisi within a week after Putin's invasion  into South Ossetia when the thought was they might even go the rest of  the way into Tbilisi, and I can say I saw firsthand the IDPs--the  internally displaced persons--the refugees, the loss of life, and  people who were wounded; and, again, it was all reminiscent of the bad  old days of the Soviet Union now being replicated by Vladimir Putin.   Putin has violated fundamental principles of international law, and  he has done so with impunity. He has refused to respect the territorial  integrity of its neighbors and denied the standards of democratic  societies.   These invasions and occupations have displaced thousands of ethnic  Ukrainians and Georgians and resulted in severe human rights abuses  against both populations. Moreover, Russia's meddling in the democratic  elections of the United States and our allies throughout Europe have  further demonstrated Putin's complete disrespect for the values and  beliefs shared by other members of the Group of Seven.   This resolution condemns Russia's occupation of Crimea and other  destabilization efforts in eastern Ukraine, reaffirms U.S. support for  Ukraine's territory and sovereignty, and admonishes Putin's assaults on  democratic processes around the world.   Most importantly, this legislation establishes that Russia should  continue to be suspended from the Group of Seven until Putin adheres to  the standards of democratic societies.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and colleague from  New Jersey for authoring this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield such time as he may consume  to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), who is the  ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 585, which calls for the  protection of the Good Friday Agreement and any Brexit deal that may  come to fruition. I congratulate the bill's sponsor,  Tom Suozzi from  New York, for this important initiative.   The Good Friday Agreement brought resolution to the decades-long  violent conflict known as The Troubles. The signing of the Good Friday  Agreement 20 years ago was truly historic, extraordinarily difficult to  achieve, a remarkable framework for peace, and the hope for the  beginning of reconciliation.   In its most important provisions, the agreement launched a series of  challenging protocols by which the leaders of the nationalist and  unionist communities in Northern Ireland agreed to strive for better  governance and a peaceful solution of differences. It was characterized  by prisoner releases, new government structures, British  demilitarization of the North, the decommissioning of paramilitary  weapons, and systemic police reform.   In terms of realizing peace, consider this: In the 30 years between  1969 and 1998, approximately 3,500 people were killed in political  violence, while in the 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement, fewer  than 100 have lost their lives due to intersectarian violence--though  there was also the ongoing phenomenon of intrasectarian killings  attributable to internal disputes among paramilitary groups.   Mr. Speaker, there is a broad bipartisan consensus on peace for  Northern Ireland, dating back to the integral role played by President  Bill Clinton and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell in the  negotiation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.   Congressman Suozzi's resolution, introduced with Peter King as the  lead Republican--and I am proud, like Mr. Sires, to be a cosponsor-- reflects this bipartisan interest. I, myself, Mr. Speaker, have  personally chaired 16 congressional hearings and markups of legislation  on human rights issues in Northern Ireland, most of them with a special  focus on police reform and the need to establish a public, independent  judicial inquiry into state-sponsored collusion in the murder of human  rights attorney Patrick Finucane and  [[Page H9200]]  others who were the victims of political assassinations on both sides  of the divide.   Mr. Speaker, I also sponsored an amendment that resulted in  suspending all U.S. support for and exchanges with the then-British  police force in Northern Ireland, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.  Vetting standards for RUC officers were implemented and then enforced.  President Bush was then able to certify that human rights principles  were part of police training going forward, both in the RUC and in its  reformed successor, the Police Service of Northern Ireland.   Thus, I, too, like many in this Chamber, have a strong personal  interest in the subject of Congressman Suozzi's resolution.   Also, I am extremely worried about the negative implications of a  hard Brexit. This 1998 agreement has kept the peace on the island of  Ireland for over two decades by maintaining a soft border between the  two entities. A Brexit deal that results in a hard border between  Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could very possibly  instigate another outbreak of violence. The fact is that armed  paramilitary groups still exist and could reengage in killing, should  there be a sustained backsliding attributable to the failure to achieve  an equitable Brexit resolution.   It is vital to the safety and security of Ireland that any potential  Brexit deal effectively address the Irish backstop issue and maintain  all components of the Good Friday Agreement. This resolution affirms  this as the U.S. position on Brexit, and I commend its author. Mr.  Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank the Speaker for her very eloquent  remarks and for her tenacity in promoting human rights and respect for  the rule of law in all of China, including and especially with today's  focus on Xinjiang, where, unfortunately, Xi  [[Page H9204]]  Jinping is conducting massive, massive crimes against humanity against  the Muslim Uighurs. So I thank her for that leadership.   I thank Chairman Engel, Ranking Member McCaul, Brad Sherman, and  Ranking Member Ted Yoho for their deep and abiding commitment to the  suffering people of Xinjiang as well.    I would also like to express my special thanks to the 128 bipartisan  cosponsors of my bill, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, H.R.  649, comprehensive human rights legislation that I introduced earlier  this year with lead Democratic cosponsor Tom Suozzi to address the  massive crimes against humanity committed by the Chinese Government  against the Uighurs.   The legislation would require the administration to categorize and  report on the human rights abuses being committed by the Chinese  Communist Party each and every day, take specific steps to sanction  Chinese officials for these abuses, especially through the use of the  Magnitsky Act, and stop, to the greatest extent possible, the Chinese  Government's efforts to create a high-tech police and surveillance  state.   With endorsement of our bill 12 months ago and cosponsorship by the  Speaker herself, as well as endorsement by the Washington Post, which  said, a full year ago, ``This has become''--that is to say, the  situation in Xinjiang--``one of the world's most urgent human rights  crises. Congress should pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act.''  Today the Senate bill is before us, and I encourage my colleagues and  the cosponsors of H.R. 649 to vote for it.   Mr. Speaker, at a congressional hearing that I cochaired last year,  Mihrigul Tursun recounted her horrifying ordeal with torture, sexual  abuse, and detention in one of China's mass internment camps in  Xinjiang.   She broke down weeping, telling us that she pleaded with God to end  her life. Her Chinese jailers restrained her to a table, increased the  electrical currents coursing through her body, and mocked her belief in  God. She was tortured simply for being an ethnic Uighur and a Muslim in  China.   There are millions of stories like this waiting to be told about the  crimes against humanity being committed each and every day by the  Chinese Government against the Uighurs, the Kazakhs, and the Turkic  Muslims.   Given that this year is the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square  massacre, maybe we should not be surprised by the cruelty and brutality  of the Chinese Communist Party. But the size and scale of what is  happening in Xinjiang is audaciously repressive, even by China's low  standards:   The mass internment of millions of people on a scale that has not  been seen since the Holocaust; children ripped from the warm embrace of  their families to be indoctrinated in communist ideology and forced to  renounce their religious culture and language; rape, sexual abuse, and  forced abortions of women being held in internment camps; forced labor  on a scale that allows Chinese companies to profit from modern-day  slavery.   That atrocities such as these can exist in the 21st century is  astounding and enormously sad.   We cannot be silent. We must demand an end to these barbaric  practices and accountability from the Chinese Government. We must say  ``never again'' to the cultural genocide and the atrocities suffered by  the Uighurs and others in China.   Chinese authorities initially denied the existence of mass internment  camps, Mr. Speaker, and even now portray them as vocational training  centers. What a cruel joke. They employed lies, censorship, and  economic coercion to stifle discussion of their crimes.   But documents obtained by The New York Times and the International  Consortium of Investigative Journalists have exposed the brutality  behind Beijing's plans to radically and coercively transform the  culture and religion of ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims in  China.   The leaked internal papers show detailed plans to intern between 1  million and 3 million Uighurs in modern-day concentration camps, where  they are subjected to severe human rights abuses and Orwellian  indoctrination efforts for those ``whose thinking has been infected.''   At the same time, Beijing instituted plans to erase the influence of  Islam in western China, bulldozing mosques and shrines, severely  throttling all religious practice, and forcing camp detainees to  renounce their faith.   The leaked documents also show that Xi Jinping himself has directed  the crackdown, saying that the Communist Party must put ``the organs of  dictatorship'' to work and show--his words--``absolutely no mercy'' in  dealing with the Uighurs and other Muslims.   In one speech exposed by the leaked documents, President Xi Jinping  says, ``The weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship must be  wielded without any hesitation or wavering.''   In 2017, he told thousands of police officers and troops standing at  attention to prepare for ``a smashing, obliterating offensive.''   According to the documents, Communist Party officials who were  reluctant to carry out Xi's draconian policies were investigated and  expunged--and worse:   ``Secret teams of investigators traveled across the region,  identifying those who were not doing enough. In 2017, the party opened  more than 12,000 investigations into party members in Xinjiang.''   Xi Jinping has created, Mr. Speaker, one of the worst human rights  tragedies on the face of the Earth. Xi Jinping and his government are  directly responsible--directly responsible--for these crimes against  humanity.   Our hope is that a reckoning is coming, but only if the international  community stands up to China. I would note with some sadness, notably  absent are voices from many Muslim countries, and I have raised it  myself with many leaders of Muslim countries.                                time  1730    They have not been as critical of China as they ought to be. They  need to speak out and to do it boldly and very clearly.   I do want to commend the Trump administration for its actions over  the past several years. They have issued strong statements and,  according to the U.S. Commerce Department just last month, 28  government agencies and businesses were placed on the Entity List and  barred.   The way the Secretary of Commerce put it: `` `The U.S. Government and  Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal  suppression of ethnic minorities within China,' said Secretary of  Commerce Wilbur Ross. `This action will ensure that our technologies,  fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise,  are not used to repress defenseless minority populations.' ''   These are important steps. This legislation, however, takes the next  step. More must be done. Chinese officials, as I said earlier, need to  be held accountable for crimes against humanity, including Global  Magnitsky and international sanctions and U.N. investigations.   Those who tortured Mihrigul Turson should know that justice is coming  for them as well. And the Chinese Government companies profiting from  forced labor need to be barred from selling their products made so  horribly by forced labor from coming into this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the  ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, beyond what has been done to date, Chinese companies  profiting from forced labor in Xinjiang must be prohibited from  exporting goods to the United States and to other countries. The  administration has, to its credit, blocked one Chinese company for  forced labor manufacturing, but there are many other companies,  particularly in the manufacturing of cotton and garments, that are  profiting off the slavery of detained Uighurs. Many more companies need  to be barred from entry into the U.S. market.    In addition to the crimes against humanity that Xi Jinping has  imposed upon the people of Xinjiang, the United States also needs to  address the high-tech authoritarianism of the future being auditioned  in Xinjiang.   Beijing is using Xinjiang as a proving ground for an all-knowing  police and surveillance state. The technology used to construct China's  high-tech police state is being exported around the world to some  countries in Africa, central Asia, and beyond. Every petty dictator and  aspiring totalitarian can use this technology to crush democratic  aspirations, human rights, religious freedom, and the rule of law.   Let me also say a word or two about Uighur Americans, like the great  Rebiya Kadeer, who I have been friends with since 2006--I have had her  at hearings. She is an unbelievable leader. Her entire family and  extended family, dozens of people, have been rounded up and have been  put into prison. Nury Turkel, Rushan Abbas, and Gulchehra Hoja have had  their families, as well, threatened and detained because they dared to  speak up here in the United States.   So many Uighur Americans have experienced the agony of family  detentions and disappearances, again, a cruelty laid at the feet of Xi  Jinping. He not only goes after the individual, he goes after the whole  family. And again, the women in prisons in China are sexually abused  and tortured. The men are abused, as well.   For those watching us today, the message you hear should be clear.  The United States wants to hold the Chinese Government and the Chinese  companies accountable for crimes against humanity and the cruelty they  inflict on your families and your loved ones. We will not be silent.  Justice is coming. We are demanding accountability.   I also want to take a moment to thank the reporters of Radio Free  Asia's Uyghur Service. Their families have been rounded up and put into  prison, into concentration camps by Xi Jinping's dictatorship. This is  beyond horrific, and we need to respond accordingly.   I also want to thank and note the contribution of Dr. Scott Flipse to  the legislation before us today, and also the Uyghur Human Rights  Policy Act and, frankly, to the Hong Kong Democracy and Human Rights  Act that was signed into law just a few days ago.   I also want to thank former CECC staff directors Paul Protic and  Elyse Anderson and current staff members Jon Stivers, Peter Mattis,  Megan Fluker, and Amy Reger for helping this Congress shine a bright  light on the atrocities.   And, of course, our full and subcommittee staffers, as well, have  done yeoman's work on this terrible issue.   We are united today. We need to be united with all Americans in  saying, never again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
