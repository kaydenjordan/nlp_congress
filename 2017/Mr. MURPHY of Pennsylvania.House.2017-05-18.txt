 Mr. Speaker, last November, Canonsburg,  Pennsylvania, Police Officer Scott Bashioum was shot and killed as he  and his partner responded to a domestic disturbance call. They were  ambushed as they approached the home. Officer Bashioum was also a  United  [[Page H4339]]  States Air Force veteran. He retired as a senior master sergeant with  29 years of service.   He will be remembered for his service both in the Canonsburg  community as a police officer, and to the country as a veteran.   Mr. Speaker, when our brothers and sisters are killed in the line of  duty, we can memorialize them by building monuments. We can remember  them by renaming buildings. We can support them by raising funds to  help their widows and their orphaned children.                                time  1530    But most importantly, we can make sure we do all we can so that they  return home at the end of their watch and that we protect their right  to raise their children and their children's right to be raised by  them. The community needs to know that we do all we can to make sure  that thin blue line does not break and that thin blue line does not  bend. We need to work together as a nation to protect those who protect  the safety of all of us.
