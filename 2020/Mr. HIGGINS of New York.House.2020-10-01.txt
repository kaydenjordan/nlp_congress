 Madam Speaker, one of the first actions of  this administration was to shut down our Nation's doors to families,  women, and children around the world fleeing violence and seeking  refuge within our borders.   These bans showed a lack of decency and empathy, and they ignored the  lessons of history. Immigrants built America, and they helped sustain  and expand all that is good in a just and free society.   The President's ignorance of this history is perhaps the point of his  policy, one that he uses to exploit and divide. Reports now show that  the country intends to admit only 15,000 refugees this year, down from  nearly 100,000 4 years ago.   The refugee community in western New York has helped revitalize  entire neighborhoods, bringing diversity, culture, and new economic  opportunity.   The organizations that support refugees, like the International  Institute of Buffalo, Journey's End, Jewish Family Services, and  others, continue to do their work with dwindling Federal support, but  still they continue to do their good work.   I believe that we can once again be a generous and welcoming nation  to the world's most vulnerable. It is imperative for our future that we  do so.
