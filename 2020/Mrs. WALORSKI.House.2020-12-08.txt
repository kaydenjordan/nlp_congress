 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2477, the Beneficiary  Enrollment Notification and Eligibility Simplification Act, or the  BENES Act.   This important bipartisan legislation will improve education and  outreach to Americans approaching Medicare age while simplifying the  part B enrollment process, which hasn't been updated in over 50 years.   Currently, Medicare enrollment is often too complicated and  confusing, and in the event of a mistake, very costly. The consequences  of making a simple mistake in the enrollment process can be  significant, with a lifetime late enrollment penalty of 10 percent for  every year a beneficiary hasn't enrolled in part B.   According to a Congressional Research Service report, last year,  approximately 764,000 part B enrollees paid an average penalty of  nearly 30 percent higher Medicare premiums. That is a superheavy  financial burden these Medicare beneficiaries will carry throughout  their retirement. That is what the BENES Act aims to help seniors  avoid.   This vital bill will help prevent late enrollment penalties by  sending an advance notice about the Medicare enrollment process to  Americans approaching Medicare eligibility. It will also prevent gaps  in coverage by requiring that part B coverage begin during the first  month after an individual enrolls through either the initial enrollment  period or general enrollment period.   These long-overdue reforms will significantly improve the health and  well-being of Medicare beneficiaries and protect America's seniors from  unnecessary penalties and unexpected healthcare bills.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Reed).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 2477, the Beneficiary Enrollment Notification and Eligibility  Simplification Act.   The notification system created in this bill for individuals  approaching the age of eligibility for Social Security will soon  provide a notice explaining: First, enrollment; second, eligibility;  and coordination of Medicare benefits.   And why is that so important in the case of Puerto Rico?   Puerto Rico has a participation rate of 70 percent in Medicare  Advantage. That will tell you how important it is for us. This will be  especially beneficial where Medicare recipients must make the  affirmative step of signing up for Medicare Part B, rather than be  automatically enrolled upon turning 65, unlike anywhere else in the  Nation. This is something that we have been fighting for many years.   The lack of adequate notice of this difference has resulted in a  substantially higher percentage of Medicare Part B enrollees in Puerto  Rico paying lifetime late enrollment penalties of 10 percent of the  premium for every year they failed to enroll.   Currently, almost 40,000 Medicare beneficiaries who live in Puerto  Rico are paying lifetime penalties of $20.3 million a year. These  penalties are particularly difficult when you take into account that  43.5 percent of my constituents live in poverty and they are not  eligible for SSI or Medicare subsidies.   Madam Speaker, I introduced H.R. 2310 to address this disparity and  encourage my colleagues to also support this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2477 and support our seniors.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as more and more Americans reach Medicare age, we need  to simplify the part B enrollment process and improve education and  outreach to seniors. The commonsense reforms in this bipartisan BENES  Act will protect seniors from unnecessary late enrollment penalties,  gaps in coverage, and unexpected healthcare bills.   I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation that  will simplify complicated Medicare enrollment rules.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
