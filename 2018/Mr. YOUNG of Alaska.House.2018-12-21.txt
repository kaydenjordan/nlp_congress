 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing  this up.   This is not a Trump bill. This is a bill that affects one area:  Alaska. This bill was asked for by the people who live in Alaska, not  New Yorkers, by people who need power, that have not had power. It has  been put in, in the past, they can't meet these standards imposed by  the EPA. It doesn't work in the cold climate. They do not have the  money to buy new generators.    Some say we have to protect their health. The gentleman from New York  is going to shut down the clinics, the schools, and individual homes  that cannot be heated, because there will be no electricity. There are  no roads.   I am talking about small villages, 60 people, 25 people. They all  have generators now that are outdated, but that is the only thing they  can afford.   You know, we hear a lot from that side of the aisle, and sometimes  this  [[Page H10559]]  side, about how we are protecting the people. Well, let's see how you  are protecting them when they don't have healthcare, and they don't  have schools. You really are helping them out.   As usual, the other side of this aisle, unfortunately, stands on this  House floor and says what is best for people when they haven't the  slightest idea.   You know, I don't wish bad luck on anybody, but maybe we want to have  a blackout in New York and see how you would feel in a snowstorm. Maybe  we would have some people understand that you are affecting people's  lives directly by not supporting this bill.   This is a Senate bill that passed unanimously, supported by Tom  Carper, supported by Ed Markey, supported by, I think, every Senator.  It doesn't have opposition on the House floor.   Unfortunately, this is under suspension, and you will probably have  enough votes to defeat this bill. Go home and feel good, say: I did the  Lord's work. I kept the air clean. I protected the people.   And you are full of it, really full of it. You are hurting the  people, hurting my Alaskans, my rural Alaskans.   I stand on this floor and watch this time and time again. Why would  you oppose something that is going to help people? Impose an unfunded  mandate on these villages is what, very frankly, the EPA has done.   The new ones, I might see, but the ones that are established there, I  would suggest, respectfully, we ought to let them use that, so they  could have heat in their houses, not air-conditioning. They can keep  their food frozen. They can have their clinics take care of their  people. And their schools can stay open.   These rural communities of my Alaska Natives, that is who you are  hurting.   I hear it all the time: We are going to help the impoverished. We are  going to help the poor.   You are not helping them. You are hurting them.   When you go to sleep tonight in your nice, warm house, and you fly in  your nice plane, and you get in your nice car and feel good about  helping the poor people, I say you are hurting them.    I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.    A village has, probably, no roads, only an  airport, small, fuel has to be shipped in by air or by boat.    It depends. In some areas, it is 3 hours, and  you are having to fly in the fuel.   They have had this generator. They had enough money to buy it maybe  10, 15 years ago, and now they will have to put on a so-called air  cleaner. They don't have the knowledge to run it, and it doesn't work.    Oh, 25, 50, 100. My village that I live in has  got 550. That is all.   To give you an idea, if the gentleman would yield to me for a second:  If you took Alaska, all the land east of the Mississippi River, to the  Atlantic Ocean, to the tip of Maine, to the tip of Florida, that is  part of Alaska. In that area that I am talking about, Maine to Florida,  there are 253 Congressmen and 52 Senators. Think about that.                                time  1130    Think about that. Why I say that, there are no roads, and you are  going to punish those people who finally got enough money to buy an  older generator by the EPA, an unfunded mandate, and say you are  helping them.    More than that. Usually, in that area, probably  about $150,000, if.    By the way, there is no income. This is a  poverty subsistence-style life.   They do have a school trying to improve their lot. They do have a  clinic trying to help their health. But you are going take the power  away because you want to keep the air pure?   Shame on you.
