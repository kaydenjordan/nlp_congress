 Mr. Speaker, in my hometown of Kissimmee, Florida, I joined  our local protest of the murder of George Floyd. We came together,  members of the NAACP, Black Lives Matter, our Sheriff Russ Gibson,  local police chiefs, and a multitude of my fellow Puerto Rican brothers  and sisters. We decried hate, condemned police brutality, and stood  unified for change.   I then led a conversation on justice and equality in America with  Black civil rights leaders, law enforcement, and local officials from  across central Florida. I listened intently, and their voices were  clear: Black lives matter, and support the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act of 2020.   We see you; we hear you, and we will honor those we lost with action.
