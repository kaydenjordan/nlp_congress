 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 2093, the Veterans and Family Information Act. This is the  legislation I introduced with my colleague, Representative Jeffries.   This bipartisan bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to  make versions of all fact sheets available in the 10 most commonly  spoken languages other than English in the United States, including  Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, and Korean.   My district is home to more than 27,000 veterans from diverse  backgrounds who faithfully served in the United States military,  including my own sister, brother-in-law, and my husband, too. With an  increasingly diverse population of veterans across the country, and  with United States veterans residing in the Philippines and in Puerto  Rico, this bill ensures that our veterans and their caretakers whose  first languages are not English are aware of and understand the VA's  benefits.   I want to thank Representative Jeffries for working with me to  improve language availability and accessibility at the VA. I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 2093.
