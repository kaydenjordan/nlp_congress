 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 11:58 a.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Blumenthal).                            ____________________
