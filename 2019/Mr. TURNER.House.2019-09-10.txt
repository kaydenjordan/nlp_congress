 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and  congratulate my good friend, Miamisburg Mayor Dick Church on his  retirement. Dick Church has faithfully served the city of Miamisburg as  mayor since 1992 and as a Miamisburg city councilman for 4 years prior  to that. Dick Church is the longest serving mayor in Miamisburg's  history   Mayor Church has transformed Miamisburg into an economic powerhouse,  a thriving downtown, and a safe and stable neighborhood. In addition,  his legacy has been the cleanup of a former U.S. Department of Energy  Cold War era defense production and deep space energy site in his  community known as Mound Laboratories.   Mayor Church has worked to make the Mound facility viable for  businesses again continuing the facility's legacy and southwest Ohio's  spirit of innovation. The Mound Business Park is now home to 15  businesses that conduct important research and development. The Mound  Business Park's development could not have come to fruition without  Dick Church's crucial work.   Dick Church has been a hands-on mayor. In many communities almost  everyone can say they know the mayor. In Miamisburg, the mayor can say  he practically knows everyone. Congratulations, Dick Church, on an  incredible career as mayor.                            ____________________
