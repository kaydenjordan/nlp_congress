 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2, the  Secure the Border Act of 2023.   America is facing a crisis on our northern, southern, and maritime  borders. Our Nation has witnessed a devastating effect of disastrous  open border policies to date. For the past 2 years, over 5 million  people have come into this country. That is more than the population of  Louisiana and Mississippi combined.   In my district, every day I have to face the families that have lost  their babies from fentanyl. A few weeks ago, in San Jacinto County, a  known cartel member who was taken out of the country, ended up  murdering five innocent people in one of my counties.   Now, thankfully, local law enforcement, FBI, State troopers, and  BORTAC caught that bastard. These are the problems that we should not  have.   Mr. Speaker, we are criticized on this side of the aisle for our  immigration policies, about DACA, where the funding is going.   Well, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: You had 2  years to fix DACA, where were you at?   You had 2 years to fund our ports of entry, where were you at?   You spent the money elsewhere.   We are criticized and criticized about this bill, which is a step in  the right direction, which starts to move and solve the problem.   My colleagues on the other side, I ask you: Where have you been?   We showed up. We came here to Congress in order to fix this problem.  We pushed this legislation across, and all you can do is criticize.  That is unacceptable.
