 Madam Speaker, everyone deserves to feel safe in their  community, whether they are at work, at home, at school, or at church.   Less than 2 weeks ago, five people, four of whom were my  constituents, left their homes for work at the Henry Pratt Company in  Aurora, Illinois, and never returned. Their lives were taken by a  horrific act of gun violence. I am committed to honoring the lives of  victims of gun violence through action.   H.R. 1112 is a commonsense and bipartisan bill that will help address  a deficiency in background check laws by allowing law enforcement to  conduct a thorough background check. I am proud to cosponsor an  amendment that will help ensure this legislation improves the safety of  victims of domestic violence, domestic abuse, dating partner violence,  sexual assault, and stalking.   Yesterday was the first time in more than two decades that the U.S.  House of Representatives passed a major gun safety bill, and today we  have an opportunity to take a further step. H.R. 1112 will help save  innocent lives, and I look forward to working on commonsense  legislation that balances protecting our gun rights and ensuring the  safety of our community.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, everyone deserves to feel safe in their  community, whether they are at work, at home, at school, or at church.
