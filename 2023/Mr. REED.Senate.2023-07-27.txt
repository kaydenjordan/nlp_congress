 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   An across-the-board cut of 10 percent makes no distinction between  those programs that are actually vital and necessary for the defense of  the country and those programs that may be subject to reduction based  on our evaluation of the program.   The Senator's amendment excludes defense health programs, military  personnel accounts, and assistance to Ukraine, but that means the  actual cuts on every other function will be much greater than 10  percent.   The other point that I think should be made--he has made a very  rousing description, an accurate description of some of the issues  facing us domestically, but we are now involved in an existential  conflict, helping the Ukrainians to defend democracy. That costs money.  We are in a situation where China has increased their military  dramatically, and we must be prepared to react to such a change.   This world is more dangerous perhaps today than at any time, and to  simply walk away from adequately funding our Defense Department would  be, I think, an error.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1030     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the  disposition of amendments under the previous order, that it be in order  to call up the following amendments to S. 2226: Schatz No. 1078; Scott  No. 944; further, that with respect to the amendments listed above, the  Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed, with no further  amendments or motions in order, and with 60 affirmative votes required  for adoption, and that there be 2 minutes, equally divided, prior to  each vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous  order be amended so that consideration of the Scott amendment No. 944  occur immediately, with all previous provisions remaining in effect.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous  order be amended so that the consideration of the Kennedy amendment  occur immediately preceding the Gillibrand amendment, with all previous  provisions remaining in effect.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I request the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I believe it is in order now to call up the  managers' package.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Go ahead.    Mr. President, first, let me commend Senator Wicker, the  ranking member, for his extraordinary cooperation, thoughtfulness, and  insight throughout this entire process. As a result, this evening, we  passed in an overwhelming vote a bipartisan piece of legislation that  confronts the challenges we face today in a very, very difficult world.   The first thing we did was we took care of the troops. We have a 5.2- percent increase in pay--one of the largest in decades. We also took  care of the troops by investing in the best possible platforms in  technology in many dimensions--underwater submarines, in the air. We  are recapitalizing our triad for nuclear deterrence. We are looking  closely at space, what we can do there both to defend ourselves and  prevent space from undermining our national security. All of these  things were done on a collaborative basis. Hundreds of amendments were  considered in both the committee and here on the floor. As a result, we  have legislation that I think we are all very, very proud of.   I would also like to thank and commend Leader Schumer and Leader  McConnell because they allowed us to conduct a very open process on the  floor, to entertain amendments, to work closely so that we could have  the conclusion we did this evening--- a strong, strong bipartisan vote.   I am confident that what we have done will provide the Department of  Defense and our military men and women with the resources they need to  meet and overcome the challenges of a dangerous world.   Like my colleague, I recognize that the work of others made our work  much easier. Indeed, the work of our staffs made this bill possible. So  let me thank first my staff director, Elizabeth King, and I also thank  John Keast, the staff director to Senator Wicker, who has done an  extraordinary job. Together, they are a formidable team and also  consummate professionals.   As my colleague has done, let me recognize the staff members on my  side of the aisle: Jody Bennett, who made a very strong contribution to  this effort, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jenny Davis, Jonathan Epstein,  Jorie Feldman, Kevin Gates, Creighton Greene,  [[Page S3731]]  Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara Cooper, Bill Monahan,  Mike Noblet, John Quirk, Andy Scott, Cole Stevens, Isabelle Picciotti,  Alison Warner, Leah Brewer, Megan Lustig, Joe Gallo, Brittany Amador,  Griffin Cannon, Sofia Kamali, Chad Johnson, Jessica Lewis, Vannary  Kong, Noah Sisk, Zachary Volpe, and once again my staff director,  Elizabeth King, who deserves great credit for this.   Let me also thank the floor staff and the leadership staff who have  been part of this process and who have been able to keep our floor open  so we could conclude this bill.   This is an important, important step. Now I look forward to joining  my colleague Senator Wicker and our colleagues in the committee to go  to conference to work out a bill that we can support as vigorously on a  bipartisan basis as we have this Senate legislation.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, among the many challenges to improving  educational outcomes for students and recruiting and retaining  educators for our public schools is the condition of school facilities.  A 2020 Government Accountability Office, GAO, report found that over  half, 54 percent, of school districts nationwide need to update or  replace multiple systems in their schools, such as heating,  ventilation, air-conditioning, HVAC, or plumbing. These systems are  especially critical to safeguarding public health, as we learned during  the COVID-19 pandemic. Functioning and efficient HVAC systems and  ventilation can help keep indoor air quality healthy and reduce the  spread of infectious airborne viral particles.   Investing in school buildings will make them healthy and safe  learning environments. It will also improve student learning, reduce  carbon emissions, and create jobs. That is why I am proud to partner  with Representative Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House Education  and Workforce Committee, to introduce the Rebuild America's Schools  Act--legislation that will invest $130 billion in fixing our schools. I  would like to thank my Senate colleagues who are joining in this  effort, including Senators Brown, Blumenthal, Booker, Casey, Cortez  Masto, Duckworth, Durbin, Heinrich, Hirono, Klobuchar, Lujan, Markey,  Merkley, Murphy, Shaheen, Smith, Stabenow, Van Hollen, and Whitehouse.   Public schools play a vital role in every community across the  Nation--educating the next generation, serving as polling places for  our elections, hosting community meetings and cultural events, and so  much more. When there is a natural disaster or an emergency, people  often gather at their public schools for shelter, information, and  resources. They are essential facilities and should be treated as  essential infrastructure.   Safe, healthy, modern, well-equipped schools are essential for  advancing student achievement and ensuring that the next generation is  prepared to meet the economic, social, environmental, and global  challenges our Nation faces. Yet too many of the over 50 million  students and 6 million staff who learn and work in our public schools  spend their days in facilities that fail to make the grade. In fact,  the American Society of Civil Engineers gave public school buildings  across the country an overall grade of D+ in its latest report card.  The 2021 State of our Schools Report identified an $85 billion annual  shortfall in school facilities investment.   States and local communities cannot bridge this gap alone, especially  when many struggle to simply keep teachers and staff on the payroll. We  know that budget shortfalls hit low-income and minority communities the  hardest. The GAO noted that capital construction expenditures, on  average, were about $300 less per student in high-poverty districts  compared to low-poverty districts. With inflation, interest rates, and  extreme weather events on the rise, the gap between what is needed to  maintain safe and modern schools and what communities can afford will  only grow. Addressing this need with robust Federal investment is not  only the right thing to do for our students; it will also give a needed  boost to our economy, putting people to work in family--sustaining  jobs. According to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, every  $1 billion spent on construction generates 17,785 jobs.   The Rebuild America's Schools Act will create a Federal-State  partnership for school infrastructure. It will provide, over 5 years, a  total of $130 billion in direct grants and school construction bonds to  help fill the annual gap in school facility capital needs, while  creating nearly 2 million jobs.   Specifically, the Rebuild America's Schools Act will provide $100  billion in formula funds to States for local competitive grants for  school repair, renovation, and construction. States will focus  assistance on communities with the greatest financial need, encourage  green construction practices, and expand access to high-speed broadband  to ensure that all students have access to digital learning. Our  legislation would also provide $30 billion for qualified school  infrastructure bonds, QSIBs, $10 billion each year from FY 2023 through  FY 2025, and restore the qualified zone academy bonds, QZABs, that were  eliminated in the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation  also eases the matching requirements and expands the authority and  eligible purposes of QZABs to allow local education agencies to  construct, rehabilitate, retrofit, or repair school facilities. The  Rebuild America's Schools  [[Page S3763]]  Act also supports American workers by ensuring that projects use  American-made iron, steel, and manufactured products and meet labor  standards.   I would like to thank the broad coalition of educators, community  organizations, unions, civil rights advocates, and employers that have  provided feedback and support for this legislation, including the 21st  Century Schools Fund, A4LE: the Association for Learning Environments,  AASA: The School Superintendents Association, American Federation of  State, County and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers,  American Industrial Hygiene Association, American Institute of  Architects, BASIC Coalition, Council of the Great City Schools, Heart  of America, International Unions of Bricklayers and Allied Craft  Workers, National Association of Energy Service Companies, National  Association of Federally Impacted Schools, National Council on School  Facilities, National Education Association, Rebuild America's Schools  Coalition, Safe Traces, Teach Plus, and the U.S. Green Building  Council.   We have no time to waste in fixing our deteriorating school  infrastructure. In the words of a student activist in Providence, Rhode  Island: ``Students cannot learn in a crumbling building, a school that  isn't fit to uplift our minds.'' We need to listen to our students,  strengthen our communities, and improve our school buildings. I urge  all of our colleagues to support the Rebuild America's Schools Act and  press for its passage.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 2630. A bill to establish the Shenandoah Mountain National Scenic  Area in the State of Virginia, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
