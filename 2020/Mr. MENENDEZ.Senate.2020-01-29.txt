 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk and  refer it to the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is from Senator Menendez to the House  managers:         President Trump has maintained that he withheld U.S.       security assistance to Ukraine because he was concerned about       corruption.  [[Page S676]]       Yet, his purported concern about corruption did not prevent       his Administration from sending congressionally-appropriated       assistance to Ukraine more than 45 times between January 2017       and June 2019, totaling more than $1.5 billion. So why did       the President suddenly become concerned about corruption in       early 2019?    Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for the  question.   He became concerned about corruption supposedly in early 2019 because  Vice President Biden was running for election for the Presidency. That  is what the overwhelming amount of the evidence shows because there is  no other legitimate reason, as your question points out.   First, the publicly released records of President Trump's April 21  and 25 calls to President Zelensky never mentioned the word  ``corruption'' despite the fact that the talking points for these calls  prepared by his own staff listed ``corruption.''   Second, in May 2019, the State Department certified to Congress  Ukraine had ``taken substantial actions for the purposes of decreasing  corruption'' and met the anti-corruption benchmarks this very body  established when it appropriated $250 million of those funds.   Third, by the time of the July 25 call, President Zelensky had  already established his anti-corruption bona fides, having introduced a  number of reform bills in Ukraine.   Fourth, on July 26, the day after his call with President Zelensky,  President Trump spoke to Ambassador Sondland, who was in Ukraine. The  one question the President asked Ambassador Sondland was not about  corruption but about whether or not President Zelensky was going to do  the investigations.   Fifth, the released aid--as your question points out, Senator, the  President released the aid in 2017 and in 2018, and he released it in  2019 only after having gotten caught. In the words of Lieutenant  Colonel Vindman and other witnesses, the conditions on the ground had  not changed.   So we are hearing a lot tonight about the concerns about corruption,  Burisma, Russia, but the facts still matter here. We are here for one  reason and one reason only: The President of the United States withheld  foreign aid that he was happy to give in the 2 prior years; that  suddenly, we are to believe, something changed, the conditions on the  ground changed, and he had an epiphany about corruption within a week  of Vice President Biden announcing his candidacy. It doesn't make any  sense.   One other thing I will say with regard to the aid is, this assertion  that President Trump has been the strongest supporter of Ukraine--I  talked about this earlier. Let's just assume that to be the case, and  if it is the case, as the President's counsel has contended over and  over again, then there is, of course, no reason to withhold the aid,  because nothing has changed.   This leads us inevitably to only one conclusion, and that is that the  President of the United States used taxpayer dollars--the American  people's money--to withhold aid from an ally at war to benefit his  political campaign.   Do not be distracted by Russian propaganda, by conspiracy theories,  by people asking you to look in other directions. That is what this is  about. That will not change. The facts will continue to come out.  Whether this body subpoenas them or not, the facts will come out. The  question now is, Will they come out in time, and will you be the ones  asking for them when you are going to be making the decision in a  couple of days to sit in judgment?   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Wisconsin.
