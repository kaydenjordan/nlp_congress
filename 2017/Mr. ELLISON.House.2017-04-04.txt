 Mr. Speaker, the value of companies doesn't always go  up. It is not true that the stock market always goes up and only goes  up. It would be nice if Methuselahs at Google and every other company  in America could get stock options and end up millionaires, but the  truth is the world doesn't work that way. That is why disclosure is  very important. That is why there is nothing wrong and no one objects  to employees being compensated with stock options, but those employees  ought to at least know the value of those stock options.   If you give me a check and it has a monetary value, I can read it and  I know how much it is. If you give me stock options and you don't tell  me because you don't have to disclose how much they are worth, then  that is not fair, and that is what we object to.   This bill simply allows companies to avoid disclosure to employees of  what those stock options are worth. That is wrong, and that is why we  oppose it.   Let me just start in terms of the context, Mr. Speaker. Today we  consider yet another bill in favor of the moneyed interests. Today we  consider another bill that basically helps out people who have a lot  while so many Americans are struggling to get by and problems abound  almost everywhere.   I have got to wonder, of all the things the American public want, why  is a revision to the SEC's rule--section 701, to be precise--the  priority for this week?   We have been here for about 3 months now. The Republicans have set  [[Page H2669]]  the agenda. They are in the majority. They get to decide which bills  come up. Why do they keep on bringing up bills that only the moneyed  interests want?   Mr. Speaker, in the past few months, congressional Republicans--I  almost called them corporate Republicans--who decide which bills are  the priority, have brought forth a hodgepodge of pieces of legislation.  I will just review a few.   Republicans made it easier to drug test people receiving unemployment  compensation.   Do you think the unemployed want that?   I doubt it.   Republicans have passed and the President even signed a law to  protect corporate firms from having to disclose labor violations like  wage theft before winning government contracts. I have got a feeling  the employees were not calling for that.   House and Senate Republicans passed laws that allow internet service  providers to sell your browser history. I don't think most folks on the  internet today were clamoring for that gem, which I was proud to vote  ``no'' on.   Republicans enacted a new law making it easier to dump coal debris  near rivers and streams.   Republicans stopped efforts to help governments around the world  avoid corruption.   H.J. Res. 41 removed the requirement that corporations disclose  resource payments to foreign governments, which is a crushing blow to  democracy activists working in fragile nations.   Mr. Speaker, this particular piece of legislation comes within a  certain kind of context--a context where we are not talking about  increase in pay, making people safer, making water cleaner, making  foreign governments more honest. It is quite the opposite.   In the 3 months that we have been back in Congress, these laws  removing competition, removing disclosure, and removing consumer  privacy are all priorities of Republicans, who set the agenda.   Mr. Speaker, people who might be clued into this broadcast today need  to know what the majority has been up to. It has not been up to  business.   These are all multinational corporate interests that don't punish  people for polluting, allow them to sell your internet browser's  history, allow them to make money off of testing laid-off workers  receiving employment compensation that is due them, and don't make  corporate interests disclose payments to foreign governments when they  drill for oil and minerals.   I just want the American people and Members to understand what is  going on here, what is the larger context of this piece of legislation  that we look at today.   When I talk to my constituents, they don't bring up any of this  stuff. Mr. Speaker, they want to know: Where is the jobs bill? When are  we going to get back to work? Somebody said we were going to work on  real infrastructure, real fair trade. When is that going to happen?   Well, the people who are in charge around here, I guess they are  going to get around to it at some point.   My constituents say: Can't we raise the minimum wage from something  higher than $7.25 an hour, which is the Federal minimum wage? When is  that bill coming up? Or, what about reconstructing our roads and our  bridges and allowing us to raise a gas tax to invest in our Nation's  infrastructure?   They say they want to increase skills. Let's invest in preschool,  Pell grants, and community college. Let's put the people, not the  corporate wish list, first.   Today we are asked to vote on a bill that basically makes it easier  for private companies to provide options, like stocks, rather than  compensation to their employees. As I have said, fundamentally, this  may not be a bad thing if disclosure is made. This bill makes it not  required. This bill makes it easier for firms to offload some of their  options to employees without disclosing financial information to them.    While I am glad to see employers reward employees with stock and  other compensation in addition to salaries, workers should be told the  value of the compensation they receive. I don't think that is asking  too much, Mr. Speaker.   With this bill, H.R. 1343, it is possible that employees would be  promised stock options which could be worth less than promised or even  completely worthless.    Employees could decide to forego a salary increase and  accept lower pay in order to receive more stock options; yet, those  stock options could be worth way less than they expected.   Why should employees receive less information than any other minority  shareholder?   If an employee is trusted enough to run day-to-day aspects of the  business, they should be trusted enough to receive full disclosure  about the stock. Employees should be able to receive information on the  financial position of the company so they can make an educated  decision.   It is not difficult to allow participating employees to sign  nondisclosure agreements, and it can't be because these disclosures are  an additional burden on the firm. These firms prepare these types of  disclosures to receive rule 701 exemption from the SEC in the first  place.                                time  1530    So I am also concerned about the mismatch of power between  corporations and their employees, and I am very concerned that  employees can be susceptible to pressure. Let me do a quick example.   George Maddox was one of 21,000 people who worked for Enron. After  working at Enron for 30 years, he had 14,000 shares of company stock  valued at $1.3 million. When Enron collapsed, he had literally nothing,  Mr. Speaker. All of his retirement was Enron stocks. If you haven't  watched the movie ``Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room'' recently, I  would urge you to watch it again. You could also read Bethany McLean's  book by the same name.   One image consistently stuck with me: a staff rally where leaders  extolled the virtues of the firm. Just as we heard on the other side of  the aisle a moment ago, leaders whipped employees into a frenzy to buy  Enron stock, even as leaders knew it was worthless. In fact, corporate  leaders had already sold their stock while urging employees to buy.  Enron had a strategy of buying companies and then pressuring new  employees to buy Enron stock to keep the stock price inflated. Since  Enron usually fired 10 percent of the workers every year, workers felt  pressured to buy stock to show commitment to the firm.   I can't just support a bill that gives employees fewer protections  than investors. I can't support a bill that encourages employees to  possibly forgo cash in their paychecks in exchange for some unverified  investment option. It is not right.   Mr. Speaker, I see you reaching for the gavel. I will include the  rest of my comments in the Record. I urge a ``no'' vote on this  particular piece of legislation until it allows for disclosures.   Today we consider another bill requested by corporations.   But, I got to wonder, of all the things the American public want, why  is a revision to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules--Section  701 to be precise--the priority for this week?   We've been here for three months now.   House Republicans set the agenda.   They lead this governing body.   Why do they keep bringing us bills that corporate America wants?   In the past few months, Congressional Republicans, who decide which  bills are priorities have brought forward a hodgepodge of corporate  requests.   Here are some of the bills that are now law.   Republicans made it easier to drug test people receiving unemployment  compensation (H.J. Res. 42).   Republicans passed--and the President signed--a law to protect  corporate firms from having to disclose labor violations--like wage  theft--before winning government contracts (H.J. Res. 37).   House and Senate Republicans passed laws that allow internet services  providers to sell your browser history.   Republicans enacted a new law making it easier to dump coal debris  near rivers and streams (H.J. Res. 38).   Republicans stopped efforts to help governments around the world  avoid corruption.   H.J. Res. 41 removed the requirement that corporations disclose  resource payments to foreign governments.  [[Page H2670]]    Which is a crushing blow to democracy activists working in fragile  nations.   And, a law preventing State governments from setting up retirement  plans for residents who do not have a work-based plan.   So, in the three months we've been back, these laws--removing  competition, disclosure, and consumer privacy--are the priorities of  Republicans who set the agenda.   These are all asks of corporate America--don't punish us for  polluting streams; let us sell your internet browser history; let us  make money drug testing laid off workers receiving unemployment due  them, and; don't make us disclose our payments to foreign governments  when we drill for oil or minerals.   When I talk to my constituents, they don't ask for any of these.   They say, ``Where's the jobs bill?''   My constituents say, can't we raise the minimum wage from $7.25 an  hour?   They say, our roads and bridges need work. Let's raise the gas tax a  skoch and invest in infrastructure?   They say, we want to increase our skills; let's invest in pre-school,  Pell grants and community colleges.   Let's put people, not corporate wish lists--first.   But, nope, today we are asked to vote on a bill that makes it easier  for private companies to provide options--like stocks--rather than  compensation to their employees.   This bill makes it easier for firms to offload some of their options  to their employees without disclosing financial information to them.   While I'm glad to see companies reward employees with stock and other  compensation in addition to salaries, workers should be told the value  of the compensation they receive.

So, employees could decide to forego a salary increase--or accept  lower pay--in order to receive more stock options, yet, those stock  options could be worth way less than expected.   Why should employees receive less information than that of any other  minority shareholder?   If an employee is trusted enough to run the day-to-day aspects of the  business, they should be trusted enough to receive full disclosure  about the stock.   Employees should be able to receive information on the financial  position of the company so they can make an educated decision.   It's not difficult to allow participating employees to sign non- disclosure agreements.   And it can't be because these disclosures are an additional burden on  the firm.   Because these companies prepared these types of disclosures to  receive the Rule 701 exemption from the SEC in the first place.   I'm also concerned about the mismatch in power between the  corporations and their employees.   I am very concerned that employees can be more susceptible to  pressure to take options instead of salary increases.   For example, we could ask George Maddox.   George was one of the 21,000 people who worked at ENRON.   After working at ENRON for 30 years, he had 14,000 shares of company  stock. It was valued at $1.3 million.   Then ENRON collapsed, and he had literally nothing.   All his retirement was in ENRON stocks.

And since ENRON usually fired 10% of workers every year, workers felt  pressured to buy stock to show a commitment to the firm.   I just can't support a bill that gives employees fewer protections  than investors.   I can't support a bill that encourages employees to possibly forego  cash in their paychecks in exchange for some unverified investment  option.   I don't think the supporters of this bill are doing this for  nefarious reasons.   I'm sure they find my reference to Enron hyperbolic.   They might also say that it's irrelevant since Enron was a public  company and we are talking about private companies.   So, let's talk about Palantir Technologies.   This $20 billion company convinced top-tier engineers to accept  below-market salaries by promising them generous stock options.   But some employees who accepted this bargain, hoping to make money on  selling their shares, cannot sell them.   The only buyer of their stocks is Palantir Technologies themselves-- or a buyer approved by Palantir Technologies.   Palantir is not a small firm.   Palantir is the third biggest American tech startup, behind only Uber  and AIR B-N-B.   It was also founded in 2004, which makes Palantir as old as  Facebook--which is a long time to wait to cash in your options.   Pushing employees to own more of employer's stock exposes workers-- like George Maddox--to put all their retirement eggs in one basket-- what we call ``concentration risk.''   I ask this Congress to stop doing the bidding of corporate America  until we address the priorities of American families and workers.   We should increase wages and access to affordable housing, provide  clean air and clean water, and protect our privacy.   We should not make it easier for employers to pressure workers to  choose options over salary without adequate disclosures. Vote no on  H.R. 1343.
