 Madam Speaker, House Democrats who attacked  unmasked and unvaccinated Americans as super-spreaders and said they  should be fired from their jobs suddenly decided to lift the mask  mandate and crowd together last night, hugging and kissing each other  in a packed room right before the State of the Union to benefit  President Biden's political optics.   COVID restrictions weren't lifted because they were destroying  children's lives or killing small businesses. The restrictions ended  because a politician's poll numbers got too low, and he needed a  political reset. The American people are disgusted by this political  double standard. They are never going to forget it.   But we are not surprised. Every decision the Biden administration  makes has gone against the needs and the will of the American people.   Americans want secure borders and police protection. What does the  left do? Open our borders, facilitate an invasion, and defund and  demoralize our police.   Americans want energy independence and affordable gas. What does the  left do? They dismantle our domestic energy industry and are forcing  Americans to buy Chinese solar panels and batteries.   The left may be woke, but Americans are awake. The state of the Union  is ready for a change.
