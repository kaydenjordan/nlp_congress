 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 1361 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1361         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (S. 1098) to amend       the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize borrowers to       separate joint consolidation loans. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Education and Labor or their respective designees; and (2)       one motion to commit.        Sec. 2. (a) At any time through the legislative day of       Thursday, September 22, 2022, the Speaker may entertain       motions offered by the Majority Leader or a designee that the       House suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV       with respect to multiple measures described in subsection       (b), and the Chair shall put the question on any such motion       without debate or intervening motion.

Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach) pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 1361, providing for consideration of S. 1098,  the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act, under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member on the Committee on Education and  Labor, as well as one motion to commit.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader, or his designee, the  ability to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension bills  considered on September 19 to September 22. This authority lasts  through September 22, 2022.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased we are here today to provide  consideration of  [[Page H7979]]  the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act, led by my colleagues  Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative   David Price of  North Carolina.   From 1993 to 2006, the Department of Education allowed married  couples to consolidate their student loans for a lower interest rate  through the Joint Consolidation Loan program requiring participating  borrowers to be jointly liable for repayment of their loans.   Congress ended the program in 2006, but Congress never provided a way  for borrowers to disentangle the joint debt. Across the country, there  are borrowers who remain liable for their former spouse's debt, even in  cases of domestic violence.                                time  1215    Today, we have an opportunity to address this problem and help  borrowers regain their financial independence.   The Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act allows borrowers to apply  to the Department of Education to split their consolidated loan into  two separate Federal direct loans. Borrowers can submit either a joint  application or an individual application in the case of domestic  violence, economic abuse, or inability to reach a former spouse.   The joint consolidation loan remainder would be split proportionally  based on the percentages that each borrower originally brought into the  loan. The two new Federal direct loans would have the same interest  rates as the joint consolidation loan.   Additionally, the bill would enable borrowers to regain access to  student loan relief programs such as the public service loan  forgiveness program and income-driven repayment programs for which they  were previously ineligible due to their joint consolidation loans.   Like many of my colleagues, I have heard from constituents who have  joint consolidated loans with their former spouses. Some of those  constituents express frustration that, due to having a joint loan, they  become ineligible to apply for other student loan relief programs, even  though they are no longer with their spouse and they are carrying the  burden of the joint loan.   Constituents also entrusted me with their personal stories of  domestic abuse and how these joint consolidated loans won't allow them  to get away from their abusive former spouses.   Just a few weeks ago, a constituent from Wheat Ridge, Colorado,  reached out to my office. It has been nearly 17 years since her  separation from her abusive spouse. Following her divorce, not only did  she and her family continue to receive harassment from this individual,  but she was left with the financial burden of paying the entire loan  balance because her former spouse refused to pay his share.   All she wanted was a fresh start, so she moved to Colorado, but her  joint consolidated loan with her former spouse continues to loom over  her.   She is not asking for her loans to be forgiven. She is simply asking  to be finally freed from this abusive relationship by passing this  Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act.   I thank her and all the other individuals who have come forward to  share how this loan program that ended nearly two decades ago continues  to affect their daily lives.   I commend Representative Price, Senator Warner, and all of my  colleagues for this work on this bill. I urge all my colleagues to  support the rule and the bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, first, I include in the Record a Statement of  Administration Policy, dated September 19, 2022, supporting this  particular piece of legislation.                     Statement of Administration Policy    S. 1098--JOINT CONSOLIDATION LOAN SEPARATION ACT--SEN. WARNER, D-VA,                              AND 3 COSPONSORS         The Administration supports House passage of S. 1098, the       Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act. The bill would build       on actions the Administration has taken to support federal       student loan borrowers.        While the authority to originate joint consolidation loans       ended in 2006, borrowers with these loans were given no way       to disentangle their debts, even in the event of divorce,       economic abuse, or unresponsiveness from a former spouse. S.       1098 would allow two borrowers with a joint consolidation       loan to jointly submit an application to the Department of       Education to separate their consolidated loan into two       separate loans. The loans would be split proportionately       based on the original loan amounts. This bill would also       allow survivors of domestic violence or economic abuse or       borrowers who are unable to reach the other borrower to       submit an individual application to separate their portion of       the joint consolidation loan.        The Administration urges the House to pass S. 1098, the       Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act, and send it to the       President, to fix one part of the student loan program and       provide this critical support to borrowers with joint       consolidation loans.     Madam Speaker, I listened to my friend from  Minnesota, and I appreciate her remarks. The amendment that has been  discussed that the Republicans are proposing simply does not go far  enough.   This bill really should be embraced unanimously in this House, just  as it was in the Senate between Democrats and Republicans, allowing for  spouses to separate, take on their own specific piece of the loan, and  move forward, no longer staying in this kind of locked-in relationship,  especially in those situations.   They do recognize the abusive relationships, but there are also some  where there is economic abuse or where you simply can't reach the  spouse. In those instances, too, there should be the ability to divide  these back into their original forms.   So, this bill, like it was in the Senate, should be accepted, I  think, universally by this House. I am sorry to see that there is  opposition. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, ordinarily, I would argue with my  friend from Illinois, but since it was such a nice testimonial to the  doctor, I will support him in his 1 minute and his nice comments as his  friend retires.   Getting back to the matter at hand, Madam Speaker, we are here to  deal with loan separation. I would say that we are looking at some  14,000 loans to which this might be applicable.   It will provide a path forward for borrowers with these loans who no  longer want their debt to be tied to their former spouse. It is  particularly important for borrowers who just want to meet their own  debt obligation without being saddled with someone else's.   We have heard from these constituents, as we heard from my  constituent from Wheat Ridge, Colorado, about the fact that she has  been divorced for 17 years and is still saddled with a debt that her  husband owed and won't take responsibility for.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.    I remind my friend, Mr. Pfluger, that this bill is about separating  loans. It is not about the energy policy, although I will address some  of his remarks in a second.   This is about the some 14,000 people that have taken advantage,  clearly of consolidating loans, but since that point, there has been  some disruption in their marriage. So we now have people, as I  mentioned earlier, that have been divorced for 17 years, still burdened  by a student loan of their ex-spouse and, in that particular instance,  an ex-spouse who had been abusive and continues to refuse to pay his  share of the loan.   So this gives the spouse who was in the abusive relationship, the  spouse who can't find the ex-spouse to help take care of this joint  loan, the ability to separate, take care of their own loans, and take  advantage of other programs that we, in Congress, the administration,  Democrats and Republicans, have put into place, like the public loan  forgiveness.   If you are working for the government, in some instances, you can get  credit for that service. Many of these people have been unable to take  advantage of that. So that is what this bill is about. That is what  this rule is about.   Now, as to my friend, I would say to him, you know, gas prices--I  don't know about Texas, maybe Texas has higher gas prices than  Colorado. But in Colorado, the gas prices have dropped a buck 30 to a  buck 50 over the course of the last 4 months, to the point where it is  under three bucks.   Madam Speaker, I refer my friend to the article in The New York Times  and that I will include in the Record titled: ``U.S. Gas Prices Have  Fallen for 91 Straight Days, a Relief for Consumers.''                 [From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 2022]      U.S. Gas Prices Have Fallen for 91 Straight Days, a Relief for                                 Consumers                          (By Isabella Simonetti)         The price of gasoline continues to fall steadily, easing       pressure on American consumers as the cost of filling a tank       continued to tumble from record levels reached earlier in the       summer.        Gas prices fell 10.6 percent in August, which helped       moderate still-sky-high inflation, Tuesday's Consumer Price       Index report showed.        The energy index, which tracks gasoline and electricity       among other energy sources, dropped 5 percent last month, as       electricity and natural gas prices rose.        After peaking at $5.02 in June, gasoline prices have       dropped for 91 straight days, and the national average stood       at just over $3.70 a gallon on Tuesday, data from AAA show.       But analysts point to a few reasons this streak of declines       is unlikely to continue.        Because they're determined by oil prices, gasoline prices       are also susceptible to a wide range of challenges, like       hurricanes that knock out drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and       efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine by       curbing its ability to sell crude on the global market.        While gas prices are down, the overall energy index still       remains up 23.8 percent over the 12 months that ended in       August. Electricity prices alone jumped 15.8 percent,       representing the largest 12-month increase since August 1981,       the inflation report said. The jump in electricity prices is       largely attributable to the high cost of natural gas, said       Laura Rosner-Warburton, an economist at MacroPolicy       Perspectives.        As winter approaches, other fuel prices could influence       inflation data. The cost of heating a home with natural gas,       the most common source of home-heating fuel in the United       States, is expected to jump more than 25 percent from last       year, to $952 for the six months from October through March,       according to the National Energy Assistance Directors       Association.        ``You would expect that a hard winter could create a       significant increase in demand in price of natural gas,''       said Bryan Benoit, U.S. national managing partner of energy       at Grant Thornton. ``And then of course all of this is       further exacerbated by what's going on with the war in the       Ukraine.''     Madam Speaker, I would also say to my friend from  Texas, as it relates to inflation, the gentleman is correct. There has  been, on a year-over-year basis, a jump of about 8 percent, 8.3  percent, I think he mentioned. But since the beginning of the year,  that has fallen dramatically.   Of course, over the summer we saw deflation in a couple of months,  and the most recent inflation report in August was it rose .1 percent.  So, annualized, that is a 1.2 percent inflation rate now because we are  seeing prices drop, particularly in the energy sector.   So as much as my friends on the other side would like to wish that we  had inflation, it is going away because we have been able to pass  legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, which takes a good look  at both climate responsibilities that we have in urging and  incentivizing towards renewable energy. But it also has a huge piece in  there to allow us to negotiate prescription drug prices and bring those  down.   So I would say to my friends on the other side, this bill is about  dealing with loans, consolidated loans that now need to be separated.   But on the subjects brought up, I can tell you that inflation is  dropping  [[Page H7982]]  based on the most recent reports, and gas prices are falling.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   With respect to the bill that we have before us and the rule that we  have before us involving the separation of these loans, I would just  say there was a woman named Angela who is on the hook for nearly  $200,000, she has been divorced since 2016.   What she owes is five times what her initial loan was because of this  consolidation of loans. And she suffered from domestic violence and has  had her credit score drop like a rock. She is faced with crippling  debt. And until we are able to uncouple and decouple these joint loans  through this separation loan act, she is going to continue to be  burdened by something that really is not her responsibility.   That is the bill we are here to really debate and discuss, S. 1098.  And obviously, the rule is to allow its debate on the floor of this  House.   This weekend, I was out walking precincts on Saturday--going back to  the energy discussion that we are having. And at one of the houses was  a young man getting his electrical engineering degree at the Colorado  School of Mines. And he didn't really recognize too many of the  candidates.   But he did say that he was familiar with the Inflation Reduction Act  because it is the first time we have done anything of any real  significance for a long time to deal with climate change, and he was  very appreciative of that. A gentleman who doesn't have an affiliation;  he is not a Democrat, he is not a Republican, unaffiliated. But he was  aware of the substantial policy changes and investments we are making  to deal with extreme climate that we face all across this country.   I am glad it is nice in North Dakota right now. But across the  country, we have seen wildfires at times that nobody has ever  experienced before. We have seen terrible floods, and we continue to  see the ocean rise.                                time  1245    There are so many pieces to that Inflation Reduction Act dealing with  improving our climate and dealing with the change that I certainly was  proud to have supported it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I compliment my friend or her Googling talent, because I am sure that  is true. The situation that we faced is gas prices shot up to about  4\1/2\ bucks, and they have dropped now almost to $3, or in places  across the State, less than $3.   But, obviously, in Colorado, we are enjoying a very good economy.  Virtually everybody is working. We have an unbelievably low  unemployment rate. So we feel gas prices are going in the right  direction, prices generally are going in the right direction, and there  are a lot of people to credit for that, starting with the President of  the United States.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining me here today to  speak on the rule and the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act.  [[Page H7983]]    Over the course of the Joint Consolidation Loan program, more than  14,000 borrowers participated. It seemed like a simple consent. Joint  consolidation loans allowed for couples to have one single monthly  payment with a lower interest rate, but Congress never provided a way  for individuals to separate their loans if and when the time came  necessary; whether it is an abusive relationship where there is  domestic violence, economic abuse, or you simply can't find your ex- spouse to have them help carry the burden.   To my friends on the other side of the aisle who claim they want to  help these borrowers, the opportunity to help them is right here, right  now. Borrowers who have experienced physical and mental abuse from  former partners who now refuse to pay their student loans, like my  constituent from Wheat Ridge, say this legislation would set them free.  Supporting this legislation is the right thing to do to help borrowers  who for years have been stuck in these joint loans with no way out.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1361         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 8749) to repeal the methane emissions and waste       reduction incentive program for petroleum and natural gas       systems. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy & Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 8749.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
