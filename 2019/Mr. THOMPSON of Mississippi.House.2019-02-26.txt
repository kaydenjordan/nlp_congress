 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution.   I was in west Texas this past weekend and saw nothing to justify the  President's designation of a national emergency. There aren't gangs of  violent criminals and terrorists overtaking our southern border.   If there were a crisis, it is hard to imagine a worse or less  effective response than a border wall, which will take months, if not  years, to build.   What I did see there are efforts to harden ports of entry. In fact,  just days before I arrived in El Paso, sharp barbed wire was installed  in the middle of a busy port of entry. This barbed wire did not give  off the impression that this busy port of entry was welcoming commerce  or visitors to the United States. When questioned, officials could not  say who had signed off on this project or how it fits into border  security.   It is time for the administration to stop fear-mongering and accept  reality. The only crisis on the border is a humanitarian crisis, one  created by this administration, and a border wall will do nothing to  alleviate the suffering.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this  resolution to  [[Page H2135]]  stop the President from stripping Congress of its constitutional power  of the purse.                                time  1615
