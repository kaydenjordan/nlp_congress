 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of  hurricane and disaster preparedness.   This month of June marks the start of hurricane season. Each year,  there are around 12 named storms; 6 of them are hurricanes, 3 of those  are major hurricanes.   Even as far as my district in New Jersey, hurricanes and other  tropical weather events can be destructive. Superstorm Sandy hit New  Jersey in 2012, and we are still feeling the effects.   With the hurricane season upon us, it is important to remind our  constituents to be prepared. Every family should know whether they are  in an area that has the potential to be affected by a hurricane.   Every family should have an evacuation plan as well as a plan for  sheltering in place. Every family should keep a list of important phone  numbers, and keep vital records and documents safe and with them. And  most importantly, every family should listen closely to their local  officials and follow their instructions.   Mr. Speaker, we can help educate constituents about hurricane  preparedness, and in the process, save lives.                            ____________________
