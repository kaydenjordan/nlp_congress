 Mr. President, today I recognize Heather Hickox,  the Baker County Teacher of the Year from Baker County Pre-K/ Kindergarten Center in Macclenny, FL.   Heather was named Teacher of the Year after exhibiting great use of  strategies to meet all learning styles. In her classroom, mathematical  concepts are taught well beyond what is expected to be seen at her  students' grade level. She is also known for showing excellent  orientation to her lessons through clearly posted objectives and  activation of background knowledge.   According to Heather, every student is important and deserves the  chance to achieve their goals. She believes it is the job of teachers  to support and encourage students on their journey, to help them find  their passions, and to give them the tools they need to be successful.   Heather received her bachelor of arts degree in elementary education  in 2010 from the University of North Florida, graduating summa cum  laude and on the president's list. She began her teaching career at  Baker County Pre-K/Kindergarten Center and has been there for 6 years.   I extend my best wishes to Heather for all the hard work and  dedication she has for her students and look forward to hearing of her  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to recognize  Brandon Jenkins, the Brevard County Teacher of the Year from Heritage  High School in Palm Bay, FL.   Brandon received this important recognition based on his teaching  philosophy and practice, leadership, professional development, and  encouragement of parental engagement in the learning process. After  Brandon was named Teacher of the Year, he said it felt like proof his  hard work was not in vain. It has always been a dream of his to touch  the lives of students, as his life was touched many years ago.   Under Brandon's leadership, Heritage has seen its band membership  grow from 15 to 130 students. The band's ratings have improved from  previously receiving poor ratings at competitions to becoming a  superior-rated concert band for the past 3 years.   Brandon earned his bachelor of science degree in music education from  Winston-Salem State University and master of music degree in wind  conducting from Messiah College. He became the band director at  Heritage High School and has been a Brevard County Public School  teacher for 5 years.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Brandon for all his  hard work and dedication he has given to his students. I wish him  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Asa  Jernigan, the Nassau County Teacher of the Year from Fernandina Beach  Middle School in Fernandina Beach, FL.   Asa's dedication to both his students and profession led to him being  named Teacher of the Year. For 34 years, Asa has taught at both the  middle and high school levels.
