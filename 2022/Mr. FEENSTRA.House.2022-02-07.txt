 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Iowa's  independent beef producers amid the ongoing DOJ investigations into  anticompetitive behavior by the Big Four Meat Packers.   On Wednesday, JBS Foods, the world's largest meat supplier, paid $52  million to sweep their price-fixing shenanigans under the rug. But they  can't hide what we have known all along. These big meat packers are  illegally distorting the market to increase their profits and at the  expense on Iowa family farmers. It is shameful and it is wrong.   That is why we need to pass the Cattle Price Discovery and  Transparency Act to finally hold big packers accountable and help  Iowa's small, independent producers compete on a level playing field.  That is what a free and fair market is all about. It is time that DOJ  do its job and take real steps to hold Big Four Meat Packers  accountable.   We have waited long enough.                            ____________________
