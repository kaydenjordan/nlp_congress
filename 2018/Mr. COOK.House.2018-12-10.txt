 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Bishop for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few minutes to talk about my  bill, H.R. 5513, the Big Bear Land Exchange Act. This bill would  authorize a land exchange of approximately 71 acres of land in the San  Bernardino National Forest for approximately 73 acres of land currently  owned by San Bernardino County.   This land would be used by the county to build a timber processing  facility that would serve the mountain communities. Currently, trees  and other forest waste are driven down the mountain through a narrow  and winding pass to a processing facility in the valley, resulting in  increased traffic congestion, significant wear and tear on mountain  roads, and numerous traffic accidents. This has been exacerbated this  week. We had quite a bit of snow, and, once again, it was very, very  treacherous. Safety is always a problem on these mountain roads.   This land exchange would require the relocation of a small portion of  the Pacific Crest Trail. I have worked closely with the Pacific Crest  Trail Association to include language ensuring that the relocation  would include environmental review and will occur before the exchange  takes place.   This land exchange has virtually unanimous local support, including  the city of Big Bear Lake, the Friends of Big Bear Valley, the Big Bear  Fire Department, the Big Bear City Community Services Department, the  Big Bear Municipal Water District, the Bear Valley Community Healthcare  District, the Big Bear Chamber of Commerce, and the local Big Bear  Group chapter of the Sierra Club. We haven't heard from the local bear  associations at all. That is a bad joke. It passed out of the House  Natural Resources Committee on a unanimous vote.
