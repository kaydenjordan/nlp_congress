 Madam President, crime is surging across this Nation.  Murder rates have risen over the last 3 years, carjackings are rising,  robberies are rising.   Today, I want to discuss the resolution disapproving of the DC City  Council's decision to eliminate mandatory minimums and to reduce  maximum sentences for violent crimes, including robbery, carjacking,  and burglary.   The DC City Council made this decision to lower penalties late last  year, despite the fact that crime has been skyrocketing in this city.  In the past 12 months, overall crime is up 25 percent in DC. Car theft  has increased 110 percent in DC. And homicides have increased 30  percent.   Who, in their right mind, looks to those rising crime rates and says  the answer is to lower the penalties for violent crime?   DC's spike in crime is hardly confined to the last 12 months. In  2021, the number of murders in DC was the highest it has been since  2003. The Mayor of DC, a Democrat, vetoed the city council's decision  to rewrite the Criminal Code, saying:         Any time there is a policy that reduces penalties, I think       it sends the wrong message.    Unfortunately, the Democrats on the city council in DC overrode her  veto.   Time and time again, we have seen Democrats in major cities reducing  penalties for crime; and we have seen, as a result, crime spiking. We  have seen this in San Francisco. We have seen this in Los Angeles. We  have seen this in Portland. We have seen this in Boston. We have seen  this in Philadelphia. We have seen this in New York. We have seen this  in St. Louis. We have seen this in Chicago.   Crime is spiking in DC, and it is incredibly harmful to the men and  women and children who live in DC to be lowering the penalties for  violent crime. That is why I am proud to support the resolution to  disapprove of the DC City Council's decision. And I thank my friend  from Tennessee for his leadership in bringing this resolution.   This has already passed the House. And I believe it will pass the  Senate as well. And, despite being soft on crime his entire Presidency,  President Biden has said he will sign it if it passes the Senate. Now  that is remarkable given Biden's record on crime. That is remarkable  given that Biden has nominated not one, not two, but three of the  leading advocates of abolishing the police to senior positions in the  Department of Justice.   I am sorry to say that every Democrat in this Chamber voted to  confirm not one, not two, but all three of those advocates of  abolishing the police to senior positions in the Department of Justice.  One of those was a George Soros-backed prosecutor in Massachusetts who,  like the DC City Council, put out a list of crimes that she would not  allow her prosecutors to prosecute, endangering the citizens she was  charged to protect.   What was her reward for refusing to prosecute violent criminals?  President Biden nominated her to be U.S. Attorney for the Commonwealth  of Massachusetts, and every Senate Democrat voted to confirm her as the  U.S. Attorney, the chief Federal prosecutor, in the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts.   Now, once President Biden said he would sign this bill, the political  pressure it has put on the DC City Council has had enormous impact.  This week, the council tried to withdraw the legislation. ``Never  mind,'' was their response. But simply withdrawing a bill doesn't  permanently get rid of it under the Home Rule Act, which allows  Congress to review legislation that comes out of the DC City Council.   To permanently stop the DC Council's harmful bill, Congress should  proceed and pass the Resolution of Disapproval and President Biden  should follow through on his commitment to sign it.   A recent poll found that 77 percent of Americans believe that violent  crime is a major problem. Democrats, tragically, have been soft on  crime for years; and crime has surged as a result.   At the end of the day, it is not complicated: If you let violent  criminals go, they commit more and more violent crimes. We have seen  patterns all over the country of mass murders carried out by violent  criminals who Democrat DA's have let out of jail, only to see them turn  around and commit more violent crimes.   Congress, right now, has an opportunity to come together and to speak  in a bipartisan way and to say: Enough is enough is enough. Stop  letting violent criminals out of jail. Let's protect our citizens.  Let's do our job.   I urge every Senator, Republican and Democrat, to support this  resolution.   I yield the floor.
