 Mr. President, I come to the floor, like many of my  colleagues, shocked at the Republican majority's brazen, secretive  effort to hijack the legislative process and pass a bill that would  hurt millions of Americans.   I have served in public office for more than four decades, and never  once in my 45 years as a mayor, a State legislator, a Congressman, or a  Senator has it been so hard to understand the motivations of an  opposing party. What kind of problems are Republicans trying to solve  with legislation that raises premiums, reduces coverage, decimates  Medicaid, and increases costs for everyone? Certainly not any of the  concerns I have heard in New Jersey. Never has someone come up to me at  the local diner to say that their premiums are too low or that Medicaid  covers too many children or that cancer patients don't pay enough out  of pocket.   There is only one place in America where these bad ideas have any  traction, and that is behind closed doors in Washington, where 13  Republican men are working on a secret bill to take healthcare away  from millions of people and raise costs on millions and millions more.  They want no transparency, no bipartisan input, no hearings.   Those are the same Republicans who in 2009 and 2010 accused Democrats  of ramming healthcare reform through Congress too quickly. In fact, it  was the majority leader who said at the time: ``This massive piece of  legislation that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy is being  written behind closed doors without input from anyone.'' Even the Vice  President--a Congressman at the time--said it is ``wrong for  legislation that'll affect 100 percent of the American people to be  negotiated behind closed doors.'' Mind you, all of these complaints  came during what was a far more open, transparent process.   I sit on the Senate Finance Committee. I remember the process quite  well. I remember our chairman at the time, Senator Baucus, bending over  backward to get Republican input. We held 53 meetings--hearings,  roundtables, briefings, and negotiations--on healthcare reform.  Afterward, we held the longest Finance Committee markup in over 20  years--a markup that led to the adoption of nearly a dozen Republican  amendments, on top of the two dozen amendments we accepted before the  markup began.   Democrats also made huge bipartisan overtures on the Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. They, too, held a transparent  process and adopted over 160 Republican amendments--160 Republican  amendments.   Then and only then did we bring the bill to the floor of the Senate,  and when we did, we spent 25 consecutive days in session debating the  bill on the Senate floor in front of the American people.   In short, Democrats spent months making compromise after compromise  in the hopes of getting Republicans on board, only to learn that they  never had any intention of working with us at all. They never cared  about expanding access to care or reducing prescription drug costs for  seniors or making insurance affordable. They didn't work with us then,  and they certainly are not working with us now.   Behind closed doors, 13 Republican men are debating just how many  millions of Americans will lose their coverage under this bill. Is it  23 million? Is it 20 million? Is it 16 million? Behind closed doors,  they are discussing just how high the age tax should be on middle-aged  workers. Is it $8,000 a year or $10,000 a year or $12,000 a year?   Behind closed doors, they are picking and choosing which consumer  protections to gut. Should they bring back lifetime limits on coverage,  which is a real problem if you have a serious disease? Before, there  were lifetime limits. So you had coverage, and then all of a sudden,  you hit that ceiling. If you had challenges, for example, with cancer,  and you expended all of your coverage, you still had an illness that  needed to be treated. Now you were one illness away from bankruptcy.   Would you let patients with preexisting conditions sink or swim in  high-risk pools, allowing insurers to once again charge women more than  men simply because they are women? Same age, same bracket, same  geography.   It is easy to see why Republicans want to keep this bill out of the  public eye. If it is anything like the House version passed earlier  this year, it is going to be a terrible, mean-spirited bill--a bill  that the Congressional Budget Office said would take insurance away  from 23 million people. It would raise premiums by 20 percent a year  and price middle-aged consumers out of the market. It is a bill that,  according to reports, even President Trump said is too mean. I have to  tell you something. If a bill is too mean for President Trump, it is  certainly too mean for New Jersey.   Today, I understand that a comment was attributed to the President.  He was meeting with a group of business leaders. He says he wants a  health bill with heart--with heart. I can tell you, it is not this bill  because the House bill--and, from what I am hearing, behind closed  doors, the potential Senate bill--is a heartless bill.   I am not the only one with that view. I was glad that most of my New  Jersey colleagues in the House of Representatives rejected this bill in  a bipartisan way. Indeed, every House Democrat and nearly every House  Republican in our delegation understood why this bill would devastate  New Jersey.   This bill will price thousands of New Jerseyans out of the private  health insurance market, especially those nearing retirement age.  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for a 60-year-old  worker who earns $20,000 a year in Monmouth County will see their  premiums increase by 900 percent--900 percent. That is an increase of  nearly $9,000.   Every day, New Jerseyans are reaching out to tell me what is at stake  in this debate and what this secretive effort will mean for their  health and their financial security. Take Dr. Howard Fredrics, a 54- year-old constituent from Park Ridge who emailed to say:         Without subsidies provided under the ACA, my 51-year-old       wife and I would have no insurance. . . . We could not afford       premiums in excess of $1100 a month. . . . Without these       subsidies, millions will go uninsured and many of these       people, myself included, will die.    Of course, my Republican colleagues like to say their plan will give  Americans more choice. We don't know what the plan is, but they keep  saying--at least the House plan--we are going to give Americans more  choice. But if all the choices are unaffordable, what good are they?  What good is it to have ``more choices'' if you can't afford any of the  choices?  [[Page S3638]]    If they provide significantly less coverage, what good is it to say I  have insurance when the moment I get sick, I don't have the coverage  for it? So I have been paying for a policy that doesn't really help me  at the moment I need it.   They also say their plan will give States more choice on how to run  Medicaid. When you cut Medicaid by $800 billion, you leave States no  choice but to scale back the health services they provide. That is not  choice. That is not choice.   Leaving nursing home patients out in the cold, ending respite care  for children with disabilities, denying low-income children a fair shot  of the American dream--that is not choice.   New Jersey alone will face $30 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the  next decade--cuts that will not only leave thousands of families  uninsured but, according to the Milken Institute, will cost New  Jerseyans more than 41,000 jobs. It is no wonder Senate Republicans are  terrified of having to defend this bill. It is a terrible, mean bill,  and they don't have the guts to tell the American people what is in it,  even though they want to pass it next week. If only they had the  courage that so many New Jerseyans have shown me in recent weeks as I  have toured our State--hard-working Americans who have been willing to  share their personal healthcare stories.    It is not easy to share a serious illness you have with everybody in  the world, but so compelled are they and so courageous, I would add,  that they do. People like Irma Rivera, a constituent I recently met in  Jersey City, told me about her battle with uterine cancer nearly a  decade ago. She was fortunate to survive, but without the Affordable  Care Act, she would be blacklisted by health insurance companies for  the rest of her life, simply because she is a survivor of that cancer.  Today Irma is covered and receiving world-class care.   I also met with Samantha Williams, a young mother in Burlington City.  She told me about her son's brush with a life-threatening asthma  attack. They were uninsured so they avoided going to the emergency  room, as so many people do. The illness gets worse and worse, more  consequential to your life, more consequential to the cost, but  eventually his breathing got so bad, she had no choice. The doctor said  if they had waited any longer, her son might have never made it. She  credits Medicaid with saving his life.   I also want to know how my Republican colleagues can reconcile their  concern with the opioid epidemic with their plan to end the Medicaid  expansion that is saving so many lives. Just yesterday, I received an  email from Irene in Oakhurst, NJ. She writes:         My daughter is a recovering drug addict on the Medicaid       program which pays for mental health care and services. . . .       She's part of the opioid epidemic that has taken the lives of       so many young people like her. She's been drug free for       almost a year. Taking money from this program would be       disastrous not only for her but for so many people who cannot       afford any other healthcare.    So I listen to those compelling stories. They are courageous to tell  their stories to the whole world--very personal stories. Yet there  isn't the courage here to come forth with a bill and let's debate it  open, in public. This bill leaves millions of low-income Americans who  depend on Medicaid expansion with no options at all. And for what? To  give insurance health executives, real estate moguls, and hedge fund  managers a massive tax cut they don't need. If there was ever such a  thing as class warfare, this is it.   In my home State of New Jersey, 250 millionaires are slated to get a  collective tax cut of $14 million. You heard it right--250 millionaires  get a tax cut, while over half a million New Jerseyans lose their  healthcare coverage. That is a pretty awesome thought--an incredible  thought. It is totally mean-spirited. It is certainly without heart.  Many of them are people who work in some of the toughest jobs, but they  don't get healthcare benefits at the job where they work, from  dishwashers and cashiers and home health aides, just to mention a few.  These were my neighbors growing up in the tenement in Union City-- people who worked tirelessly to give their children a better life and  so often put their own health on the back burner.   Many of us thought the cruel legislation Republicans passed through  the House would be dead on arrival in the Senate. Instead, an  incredibly unpopular bill has a new lease on life. Why? Because padding  the pockets of the health insurance industry, capping Medicaid  spending, and cutting taxes for millionaires have been at the top of  Republican wish lists for years.   The notion that the GOP can pass this secret bill with no debate is  insulting to our democracy, and the idea that they can dismantle this  historic law without hurting millions of people is just not true  because, make no mistake, when you take $800 billion out of Medicaid,  everyone feels the pain. When you add 23 million people to the ranks of  the uninsured, everyone feels the pain. When you send more people back  to the emergency room as their way of getting healthcare, saddle  consumers with higher out-of-pocket costs, and end protections against  insurance company abuses for patients, everyone feels the pain.   What really boggles my mind--what I just can't understand is, there  is no shortage of problems in our healthcare system--real problems that  need real solutions. Ask anyone, and I mean anyone, about our  healthcare system. I will guarantee you will get an earful about what  is wrong with it. You will hear from parents about deductibles that are  too high, from workers about how hard it is to find in-network doctors,  from seniors about generic drugs that suddenly cost thousands of  dollars, police officers about the opioid crisis tearing apart our  communities, and hospital staff concerned about the nursing shortage,  business owners, like the group I met from Cumberland County, NJ,  yesterday who want Congress to work in a bipartisan way to lower  employees' healthcare costs.   Imagine, just for a moment, how thrilled Americans would be if  Republicans actually had a bill that solved some of their problems  instead of bringing back old ones. Imagine how excited my Republican  colleagues would be to show off a bill that improved, instead of  endangered, people's lives, but my Republican friends are not excited  to show off this bill because when you are excited to show a bill--when  you have a great product, you want the whole world to know about it.  When you have a terrible product, you don't want anyone to know about  it, and they don't want to defend it because they know it is  indefensible.   For 7 years, my Republican colleagues put politics over policy. For 7  years, they demonized ObamaCare, with no substance behind their  rhetoric. Now their poll-tested platitudes have caught up with them,  and they know it. That is why they let 13 Senators, who represent less  than one-quarter of the country, meet behind closed doors, and that is  why their hope is to keep this bill a secret until the very last  minute.    So today I have come to the floor with a message for my Republican  colleagues: If you want to have a debate about how to improve our  healthcare system and about how to help more families get covered and  about how to lower costs more and create a healthy, more productive  nation, these are issues Democrats have been ready to have that debate  on. I have said it in the Senate Finance Committee. We did remarkable  things under the Affordable Care Act, but there is still room for  improvement. We are ready to have that debate because Democrats know  that while the Affordable Care Act was a historic law--a law that  stopped insurance companies from dropping your coverage if you got  sick, that covered 90 percent of Americans for the first time in our  history, that required healthcare plans to cover essential health  benefits like visits with specialists, prenatal care, mental health and  addiction treatment, hospital stays, and more--despite all of the  positive steps forward, in spite of all the good the Affordable Care  Act did, Democrats have never stopped believing we could even make it  better.   Before we can make our health system better, we must stop Republicans  from making it worse. We cannot go back to a time when healthcare was a  privilege granted only to those who could afford it, when it was  always, I think, a right afforded to all Americans. The only way we can  go forward is by working together with bipartisan input, with open  debate, with full transparency on an issue that affects virtually every  American, in full view  [[Page S3639]]  of the American people we were elected to serve. They deserve no less,  but they are getting a lot less by the majority as it relates to this  bill--behind closed doors, in secret, that even the President of the  United States says is mean. The only thing I can agree with President  Trump on is we need a bill with heart, and from what I have seen and  heard so far, this is pretty heartless.   I yield the floor.
