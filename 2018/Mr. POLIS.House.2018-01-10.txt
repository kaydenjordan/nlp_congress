 Mr. Speaker, I was gravely concerned last week when  Attorney General Sessions removed the guidance of the Cole memo  regarding the way that the Department of Justice treats marijuana in  jurisdictions where it is legal for medicinal or commercial  circumstances. I happen to represent one of those States, the State of  Colorado, which has a regulatory system for marijuana that has now been  called into jeopardy through a Federal overreach.   Effectively, Attorney General Sessions has left the entire fate of  not just the industry and those who work in it but also consumers in my  State in the hands of 93 U.S. attorneys, including the one for our  State who, if they wake up on the wrong side of the bed one morning,  could engage in a mass enforcement action against residents of Colorado  who are following our State law.   I call on President Trump to overturn his attorney, and I call upon  this body to put the appropriate funding restrictions, based on the  McClintock-Polis amendment, into the final funding bill in the next few  weeks to prevent the Department of Justice from using funds given to  them by Congress to contravene State law in jurisdictions that have  chosen to regulate marijuana.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, over 3 months ago, the funding for the Children's Health  Insurance Program, or CHIP, expired. Today, families throughout the  country, including 90,000 children in my home State of Colorado, face  great uncertainty about the future of their healthcare.   When CHIP was first passed, over 20 years ago, it was done in a  bipartisan manner, and, until recently, CHIP has always been a  bipartisan, nondivisive issue. It is unfortunate to see that, today,  here, we are in this body under Republican leadership and, somehow,  even children's health insurance has become a political football while  we while away our time, our precious legislative time, on bills that  have passed this body before and don't go anywhere.   In our most recent Band-Aid for government funding, House Republicans  made a claim that CHIP was extended until March 31, but that wasn't the  case. By some reports, States could run out of funding in the next few  weeks. In fact, in Colorado, our own budget experts predict the State  will run out of children's health insurance money by the end of  February. Cancellation letters are literally scheduled to go out at the  end of this month.   Mr. Speaker, this simply isn't a way to govern, crisis to crisis,  ignoring the real issues people care about in order to consider special  interest legislation. Republican leadership and the Trump  administration continue to refuse to work on finding a bipartisan  solution for the hundreds of thousands who have Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrival--or DACA recipients--who are in limbo. We can simply  put that bill on the floor today, the Dream Act, and I feel it would  pass.   We have the votes to do so, Mr. Speaker. Let's simply have a vote. It  is a purely manufactured crisis.   I am happy to say we will be giving the opportunity for Members of  this body to defeat the previous question and move to a vote on the  Dream Act, shortly. My colleague, Mr. Correa, has joined us to offer  that motion in a few minutes.   Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle often say that  the real deadline for a DACA solution isn't until March, but, in  reality, every day, already over 100 Deferred Action recipients lose  their protected status, are unable to work with their situation  unresolved.   For those DACA recipients, the deadline isn't March. The deadline has  already passed, hence, the urgency. Now is the time to pass the Dream  Act, to allow these DACA recipients to continue to live and work and  serve in the only Nation that many of them have ever known their whole  lives.   All the while, congressional Republicans still refuse to work with  Democrats on a long-term government funding solution. Here we are less  than 10 days from another government shutdown. The Federal Government  continues to move from quick spending patch to quick spending patch,  costing taxpayers more in the long run by preventing our agencies from  doing the planning necessary to improve efficiency.   Today we are only 5 legislative days away--9 actual days--from a  government shutdown and the huge negative repercussions that would  follow. As a former businessowner, I know, firsthand, the value of  long-term budgeting and stability. Millions of Americans know how to  plan their family budget and their home budget. Why can't Congress do  it for the country?   Instead of working on a long-term budget solution, the House is  spending its time on other legislation. Here we have a bill that  undermines workers' rights and their protections under the National  Labor Relations Act.   In addition to this controversial bill, there are two attached pieces  of legislation that were originally separate  [[Page H98]]  bills that easily could have gone on the suspension calendar and would  have largely been noncontroversial. They passed on unanimous consent in  the Senate and in the House Natural Resources Committee, but their fate  is put in jeopardy by putting them onto a controversial bill.   The first bill amends the White Mountain Apache Tribe Water Rights  Quantification Act of 2010. To clarify, that is a separate economic  development fund known as the WMAT settlement fund that can be accessed  to cover potential cost overruns for this rural water project.   The Interior Department has said it is unsure if the settlement fund  could be used for additional costs, and so this clarifies that water- related economic development projects would specifically include the  planning, design, and construction of the rural water system. This  legislation could have passed and, likely, could have become law but,  instead, has been put into jeopardy by affixing it to a bill that is  unlikely to go anywhere.   The second uncontroversial bill that is wrapped up is regarding the  authority of pueblos. It concerns two New Mexican pueblos and simply  clarifies that they could lease their lands that are held in trust by  the Federal Government for 99 years. This legislation ensures Native  Americans have the right to their lands that they deserve. It respects  their sovereignty and nations in a noncontroversial way.   I am fully supportive of these two technical and simple pieces of  legislation, but, unfortunately, because they are attached to a bill  that isn't going anywhere, are very unlikely to become law.   These are the types of bills that could go straight to the suspension  calendar and straight through the Senate and should be signed by the  President, but, instead, they are being put in jeopardy by lumping them  in with a bill that is unlikely to become law.    There are so many of these types of Natural Resources Committee bills  from both Democrats and Republicans that should be making their way  forward as stand-alone items.   I am glad, for instance, that one that I authored, my Bolt's Ditch  and the WEDGE Act--actually, two that I authored--were put forward and  passed by this House and not attached to other controversial  legislation.   I am also reintroducing, soon, a bicameral bill that I also consider  noncontroversial, the Continental Divide Wilderness, Recreation and  Camp Hale Legacy Act bill. It would preserve over 90,000 acres of  wilderness and recreation lands in Summit and eastern Eagle Counties,  and is endorsed by local businesses, commissioners, and towns across  the area.   It was crafted with input from dozens of stakeholder groups,  including the Wilderness Society, Vail Resorts, the Outdoor Industry  Association, the International Mountain Bicycling Association,  Conservation Colorado, and many municipalities and local businesses. It  will help sustain our recreational economy in Eagle and Summit  Counties, protect watersheds, and preserve important wildlife corridors  and tourism opportunities.   These are the kinds of bills that we should be moving forward from  the Natural Resources Committee, not controversial bills that actually  take away the rights of American citizens, including Native American  citizens.   And, while we are not today, we should never be moving forward on  Natural Resources Committee bills that actually whittle away at the  public lands we all own and the Antiquities Act by shrinking monuments  like Bears Ears or making it easier to destroy lands we cherish and  value.   All I ask is that we separate out these two Natural Resources bills,  send them to the suspension calendar, and not let them be put in  jeopardy by affixing them to the fundamental underlying legislation  which is controversial, namely, the Tribal labor bill. That is the bill  that is the main controversial bill in this package.   And, of course, I stand here as a supporter of the rights of every  American to organize. I am a supporter of workers' rights, and I am  also a strong supporter of Tribal sovereignty, not only principles  under American law, but the right thing to do.   I, like many of my colleagues, place a great deal of importance in  Tribal self-determination, autonomy, local control, and independent  governance for our nations. In fact, I have been the champion of  sovereignty, and I have long voted in favor of legislation that allows  Tribal discretion in the judicial processes and in education.   But, of course, the right to organize is an inalienable right of  every American, protecting our workers, including Native American  workers, to fight for a safe working environment regardless of what  entity owns the company they work for. Legislation balancing these two  competing principles is possible.   Reconciling these two priorities can be difficult, but I think that  there is a way to do it. Instead, this bill drives a wedge between  issues or groups that have a history of working strongly together, such  as Native Americans and labor unions.   We can balance critical rights to sovereignty with the protections  that are due to every American citizen regardless of their race,  ethnicity, cultural practices, membership in an Indian nation, or  governing structures. This legislation does not find the right balance.  It hurts workers of all stripes and colors, including many Native  American workers.   Workers have the right to collectively bargain; otherwise, workplaces  become unsafe, sexual harassment can go unchecked, and the income gap  continues to widen. This legislation would strip Native Americans and  non-Native Americans, many of whom work for Native American  enterprises, of the right to collectively bargain.   Without the right to self-governance, we would not have the strong  communities present across the country today. Without the right to  collective bargaining, we would not have the strong and growing economy  that supports our middle class. This legislation simply does not  succeed in balancing both of these values.   I also want to point out that President Trump agrees with me, or at  least he did last time he commented on this 25 years ago. In 1993, at a  hearing before the House Committee on Natural Resources regarding the  Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, then private citizen Trump testified  regarding the legal barriers facing labor unions at that time to  organize workers employed at Tribal casinos. His testimony said, in  part: ``At present, even union workers in States like New Jersey would  have no federally or State protected rights or the ability to organize  in casinos on Tribal lands. The unions hope to do something about this.  They hope to gain the right to recognition, the right to organize if  they so choose. Quite frankly, I hope they have better luck than we  have had so far.''   Mr. Speaker, the last time the President commented on this, it is  clear that he also believed that workers on Tribal land should have the  right to collectively bargain. I hope that his administration would not  be supportive of this legislation if it were to move through Congress,  which it is unlikely to do.   Instead of policies that benefit those at the top, I have a number of  ideas that I will be talking about later that we can move forward to  empower workers and help make sure that the 21st century economy works  for everyone.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule--not just any amendment, but an amendment to  bring up the bipartisan, bicameral bill, H.R. 3440, the Dream Act.   It is far past time that we consider this urgent piece of  legislation, the lack of which is tearing apart the lives of over 100  aspiring Americans every day who are unable to do what you and I take  for granted, Mr. Speaker, which is simply go to work the next day.  Every day that we fail to act, approximately 122 DREAMers lose their  legal ability to work.   Mr. Speaker, even Republicans have called for a vote on this critical  issue. At the end of last year, 34 Republican colleagues sent a letter  to Speaker Ryan urging a vote before the year's end, a vote that never  happened, a vote my colleague, Mr. Correa, is giving us a chance to  take now.   How much longer will this body be complicit in the Trump  administration's assault on DREAMers?   It is time we listen to the vast majority of Americans and the  majority of this body and act to protect courageous, aspiring Americans  like the group from Colorado I met with yesterday.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address some of the things that my colleague,  Mr. Cole, said. The big difference here between Tribal-owned and -run  businesses and State and local governments is that State and local  governments are not generally in the business of owning/operating  companies. With very few exceptions, we don't have a socialist form of  government in this country where cities or States are actually  operating businesses in competition with the private sector.   Tribes, in addition to their Tribal workers, which are more analogous  to State or local workers--and it is an appropriate discussion--also  happen to own businesses, which is fine, and they produce revenue for  the Tribes, which is great. However, they should play by the same  economic rules as other businesses, which in no way impede businesses  from succeeding in our country.   Of course, many of these Tribal-owned businesses are the main source  of support and income for Tribes. If our labor laws work for any other  business, they should also work for them.   American citizens, including Native American citizens of our country,  don't lose their rights as workers because of the ownership of the  organization and company that they happen to be employed by. That is a  key tenet that needs to be balanced with, of course, Tribal  sovereignty, which I am a strong supporter of.   If the discussion were simply about Tribal employees, it would be a  different discussion. To be clear, it is about businesses that are  owned by Tribes, and we simply don't have an analogy on the State and  local side with very few exceptions. I am sure there is one somewhere.  But, in general, municipalities and counties are not the owners of  operating businesses that compete in the private sector.   Now, I want to talk about what is possible with regard to enhancing  the rights of workers and labor. Instead of these kinds of policies  that take away the rights of workers, including Native American  workers, we should be moving forward on policies that put workers  first.   My bill, the Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act, would do that. The bill  would provide reasonable solutions to address the growing inequality in  the United States by helping workers and ensuring that companies follow  the law, emphasizing the need for corporate accountability.   It would remove unfair obstacles to forming a union, enhance  transparency from employers, and increase penalties for violating our  labor laws, which are strong but often not enforced.    First, all too often, employers frequently drag their feet on a newly  formed union's first contract for months, sometimes for years, often  with the goal of avoiding an agreement. Sometimes that means a newly  certified union that the voters have voted in fails to receive a first  contract.   My bill would set up a first-contract arbitration system where the  union or the employer has the option of seeking mediation if they feel  one party is not responding adequately to a negotiation request.   It would also ensure that no taxpayer funds are used for union  busting or persuaders, activities like planning and implementing  activities that deter employees from joining or forming a union. Again,  it simply makes sure that no taxpayer funds are used for that explicit  purpose.   Third, the bill updates the National Labor Relations Act's definition  of ``supervisor.'' Too often, workers are reclassified as supervisors  for effectively gerrymandering bargaining units. This updated  definition helps prevent that sort of manipulation and would make it  easier for employees to be able to form a union if they so choose.   Fourth, the bill reaffirms the importance for the government to  protect workers from having their rights violated by increasing  criminal and civil  [[Page H101]]  penalties for individuals and executives who violate critical labor  laws.   Injured workers and worker deaths should never be simply a cost of  doing business. These robust protections help make sure that this is  truly a criminal issue for the few bad actors that exist on the  employer side.   Finally, the legislation empowers shareholders and creates new  accountability for CEOs and executives by preventing the CEO and  chairman at a publicly traded company from being the same person. We  would all love to work for ourselves, but that is not in the long-term  economic interest of the shareholders, the customers, or the workers.   The bill also expands insider trading restrictions for executives to  1 year after they leave a company.   In my district and across Colorado, people are clamoring for  proactive policies that actually help address the income gap and put  the needs of middle class families and workers first. Policies like the  Giving Workers a Fair Shot Act would do that.   Now, this legislation that we are seeing here today is not the only  controversial legislation we are seeing this week. Unfortunately, the  next rule up will be one that takes away our constitutional rights as  Americans.   The FISA reauthorization legislation has been described as a  compromise, but that is not the case.                                time  1430    This legislation is not the necessary FISA reform bill that many in  Congress, including myself, have called for, which is why I and so many  of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are opposed to it in its  form and support the Amash-Polis amendment, cosponsored by many others.   It is also why the current FISA reauthorization bill is opposed not  only by privacy and civil liberties groups and consumers but also  technology companies and job creators across the political spectrum.  Businesses are, rightfully, afraid that, if this bill passes, it will  make it even harder for American companies to engage in international  commerce.   Many countries in Europe, for example, will simply refuse to do  business with a technology company that is housed in the U.S. because  they are afraid of what will happen to their citizens' data, perhaps  even in contravention of their own stronger privacy laws.   This bill does not make any steps in the direction of reform that are  necessary. It falls short on several grounds. In fact, in some ways, it  makes the FISA program worse by codifying the ``abouts'' collections  term that refers to the NSA searching through the internet traffic to  collect not only communications to or from an intelligence target but  also those that simply mention an identifier used by a target, even  though that has been declared unconstitutional twice. It could be the  name of a city or State or even a country that can be used as an  identifier; in theory, subjecting close to 100 percent of tax and  emails and internet traffic to warrantless searches.   This bill fails to consider the core concern that I have and that  many Members on both sides of the aisle share; namely, the government's  use of section 702 information against American citizens in  investigations that have nothing to do with national security and does  not require a warrant or the due process of our Constitution.   Instead, the bill codifies the ability of the government to access  the content of our emails and telephone calls without a warrant. It  creates an unprecedented and unworkable ``optional'' warrant, which is  merely window dressing but does nothing to address the legitimate  concerns.   These massive flaws could have been addressed, had we proceeded under  regular order, but this version was reported only from the Intelligence  Committee and bypassed the Judiciary Committee, which was cut out of  negotiations when they agreed to go along with the Intelligence  Committee railroading their committee. That is why I signed a  bipartisan letter with dozens of our Members demanding FISA be handled  under regular order.   I am proud to have offered the amendment that will be considered  later with Representatives Lofgren and Amash and others that would  provide a better path to keep American citizens safe and protect our  privacy and ensure that American companies can remain competitive  abroad. It will protect our constitutional rights and keep us safe.   My amendment, which is based off the USA RIGHTS Act, ends backdoor  searches, ends reverse targeting, bans ``abouts'' collections, and  strengthens FISA court oversight and transparency. I think these are  all commonsense and necessary changes that Americans have been  demanding for years.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to oppose the FISA  reauthorization and support the Amash-Lofgren amendment when they are  brought forth shortly.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to address something my friend, Mr. Cole,  said.   Again, I am sure you can find a few instances in municipal and State  government, but I am sure the gentleman would agree that, relative to  size, they are very few and far between. Even most municipal golf  courses are run by private operators under contract to municipalities.  I am sure the gentleman can find a couple that aren't.   I have interacted with businesses in my district that are owned by  Tribal nations, and I worked with them. There are a number of  provisions in law that help them. I support those.   But I do believe that workers don't give up their rights simply  because they work for a company that happens to be owned by a Tribal  nation, as opposed to an American or even a Native American citizen of  our country who, in their personal capacity, is the owner of a company  and would not have the same ability to deprive workers of their rights  as a company that was owned by his or her Tribe.   So, again, we want to make sure we support Tribal autonomy. And I do.  Perhaps there is a bill to be had here, but it is simply not this bill.   I want to share a story of one of my constituents from Fort Collins,  Colorado, that I think will bring this back to what our body should be  doing.   I understand there are arguments on both sides of this. I understand  there are people on both sides of the aisle who have concerns and also  who support this bill. But it is not the urgency that we face with  regard to deferred action or child health insurance.   In July of 2017, Carla and her husband from Fort Collins found out  they were expecting another child. Both Carla and her husband work full  time. Carla works at a local childcare center. Her husband works at a  local retail store.   Even with their two full-time incomes, like many Americans, they felt  the Children's Health Insurance Program was the only medical coverage  for them, and Carla enrolled in CHIP.   Carla is due to deliver her baby in March of this year, but she  worries that, when the baby comes, she won't have medical coverage  anymore. Unfortunately, Carla is right to worry. Right now, Colorado is  expected to run out of CHIP funding at the end of February, just a few  weeks before Carla is due.   That is why this issue is so urgent, Mr. Speaker. For the tens of  thousands of children and pregnant women, like Carla, we can't wait  another minute to provide a permanent extension of the Children's  Health Insurance Program.   But instead of finding a bipartisan fix for the Children's Health  Insurance Program or for deferred action or to keep the government  open, instead, here we have yet another bill that people will have  different opinions on, and I feel that it undermines workers' rights  and is not supportive in the way that I would be of the rights of our  nations. It is, unfortunately, another example of misguided priorities.   We have precious little time--I believe 4 days--until the funding of  the government expires. We should have acted on the Children's Health  Insurance Program last year. We should have acted on deferred action  last year. We need to act now.   Mr. Speaker, for that reason, I oppose the underlying bill, I urge a  ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
