 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  February as Career and Technical Education Month.   During this month, we celebrate and highlight the value career and  technical education, or CTE, which restores the rungs on the ladder of  opportunity for many individuals and gives them the tools to succeed.   As the co-chair of the Bipartisan Career and Technical Education  Caucus and a senior member of the House Committee on Education and  Labor, I have always supported, and will continue to support, CTE  programs that provide learners of all ages with career-ready skills.   Our students should be aware of their educational options and  understand a bachelor's degree is not the only path to a meaningful,  family-sustaining career.   A highly skilled workforce is important to the success of America's  economic growth and competitiveness.  [[Page H1079]]    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman  Jim Langevin from Rhode  Island, for joining me and introducing this resolution to recognize the  importance of career and technical education.   We will continue to work hard to close the Nation's skills gap.                            ____________________
