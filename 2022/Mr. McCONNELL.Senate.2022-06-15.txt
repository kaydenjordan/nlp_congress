 Mr. President, American families are being crushed by  a giant backdoor inflation tax, and it has been fueled, in large part,  by Democrats' huge mistakes.   Month after month, families pick up the newspaper, flip on the  television, and hear that Democrats' inflation is setting new 40-year  records.   Month after month, families find themselves shelling out hundreds  upon hundreds of extra dollars per month just to actually tread water.  Forget about saving and getting ahead.   In this Democrat-run economy, working Americans have to shell out  hundreds of extra dollars every month just to remain standing still.  Even when you factor in the nominal pay raises that workers have  earned, the average American worker got a 3.9 percent pay cut--pay  cut--last year due to Democrats' inflation.   According to the Joint Economic Committee, inflation cost the average  American household $635 last month alone--$635 in 1 month.   For families in Colorado, combined effects of Democrats' inflation  and higher household spending put that number at a staggering $825. In  Arizona, it is $733 extra per month. In Nevada it is $731. For New  Hampshire families, it is $653. It is $599 in Washington State, and  $598 in Georgia.   Everybody knows why this is. Food costs are up more than 10 percent,  year on year. Gas is up nearly--listen to this--50 percent. Rent is at  a 35-year high, and would-be home buyers are being squeezed between  high prices and soaring interest rates.   In my home State, Kentucky, that monthly inflation bill comes out to  more than $500 every month.   Right before Senate Democrats spent $2 trillion last spring, the  Democratic leader said he wasn't worried--wasn't worried--about the  possibility of inflation. Now, working families are paying dearly for  that incredibly bad judgment.   I hear from hard-working Kentuckians who are falling behind on home  payments or late on their utility bills  [[Page S2948]]  or cutting back at the grocery store, families who are skipping-- literally skipping--summer vacation.   Every month, the average Kentucky household now spends over $500 more  than they did before the Biden Presidency.   One of my constituents from Beaver Dam wrote to tell me:         Things are looking pretty grim for me and my family right       now. Everything--    Everything.       --is too expensive.    His family was already giving up buying chicken and beef at the  grocery store. Next they may have to stop making car payments. They are  literally out of slack.   Another constituent from Science Hill told me that his family is  maxing out credit cards to stay above water. He is watching as the  Democrats who control Congress continue--continue--to advocate for more  reckless spending and laments that Washington does not appear to  understand what is happening--what is happening--to our heartland.   A third constituent from Paint Lick is struggling because--clarifies  that she is not asking for a handout because she doesn't believe it  would help. ``After all,'' she writes, ``money is not free; taxpayers  must pay it back.'' If only Washington Democrats had that much wisdom.  If only our one-party government had exercised that much common sense  back last spring.   Three of the most basic duties that any government owes its citizens  are stable prices, public safety, and secure borders--stable prices,  public safety, and secure borders.   Unfortunately for our country, the Democrats have struck out--struck  out--swinging.                              Political Violence    Mr. President, now on a completely different matter, yesterday marked  5 years since the attempted assassination of numerous Congressmen on a  baseball field across the river.   The perpetrator was a far-left activist who doublechecked that it was  Republicans on the field before he started shooting.   Five years on, political violence and threats are again making  national headlines. The far left has spent weeks fomenting rage and  panic over the possibility that one or more upcoming Supreme Court  rulings may not deliver the liberal policy outcomes they would prefer.   Last week, the authorities arrested a deranged person who traveled to  Washington from California with a premeditated plan to assassinate an  Associate Justice for ideological reasons--fruit of a toxic culture  that is fueled by the precedent-breaking leak of a draft opinion last  month and a torrent of reckless talk from prominent Democrats.   It took that assassination attempt and then another week of wasted-- wasted--time for House Democrats to stop slow-walking a bipartisan bill  to beef up Supreme Court security that passed the Senate unanimously  more than a month ago. The same people--the same people--fanning the  flames of fear and anger blocked that noncontroversial bill for more  than a month--more than a month--before they finally sent it to the  President.   Meanwhile, as mobs continue to mount angry demonstrations outside  these Justices' private family homes, President Biden's Department of  Justice continues to assiduously ignore--ignore--the fact that this is  totally illegal now under existing law. Section 1507 of the Criminal  Code makes it perfectly clear: It is flat-out illegal to demonstrate at  a judge's private family residence to pressure them in a pending case.  That is the fact set that we have here. It is not just immoral; it is  not just civically toxic; it is literally a Federal crime.   Where is Attorney General Garland? As the former chief judge of the  DC Circuit, he should understand the need for judicial security and  independence as well as anyone. But the same soft-on-crime ethos that  pervades the modern Democratic Party apparently extends even--even--to  ignoring illegal pressure campaigns aimed at Federal judges.   Two years ago, a New Jersey judge had a gunman show up to her front  door in disguise and murder her son. Just recently, somebody murdered a  retired judge in Wisconsin, and then last week's near assassination.  But where is President Biden? He won't even denounce the ongoing  protests at Justices' private homes, and our supposedly nonpolitical  Attorney General will not lift a finger--a finger--to enforce existing  Federal law.   Today, every Republican member of the Judiciary Committee and I are  sending another--another--letter to Attorney General Garland. His  dereliction of duty on this subject must come to an end.   The far-left political violence and intimidation efforts do not stop  with judges. In the weeks since the draft opinion suggested the Court  may--may--overturn an abortion decision that even Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsberg acknowledged was poorly reasoned, a spate of vandalism,  threats, and even some arson attacks have been unleashed upon Catholic  churches--upon Catholic churches--and pro-life crisis pregnancy centers  all around the country. In 2022, simply being a Christian or being pro- life seems to be sufficient cause for angry radicals to call in  threats, graffiti your door, or firebomb your office. Once again,  President Biden and his Justice Department have been totally silent-- not word about any of it; unable to even simply denounce the hatred.   The same Democrats who want to make a national spectacle out of their  supposed opposition to political violence will not even call out  violence and intimidation from their own side, let alone--let alone-- fulfill their oaths and put a stop to it.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
