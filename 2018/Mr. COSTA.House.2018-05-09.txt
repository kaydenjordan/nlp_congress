 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Teacher Appreciation Week  to honor America's teachers.   I still know the names of my first nine teachers at the Houghton- Kearney Elementary School in Fresno County because they all made a  difference in my life: Ms. Waiye, Ms. Seely, Ms. Clark, Ms. Piper, Ms.  Collins, Mr. Garfield, Mr. Weens, Ms. Collins again, Mr. Reed, and Mr.  Jones, our principal.   Like so many teachers across our country, these educators dedicated  their careers to helping generations of students learn and grow.  Teachers today provide us with the tools we need to achieve our goals  and to be successful because they understand dedicating their lives to  this profession educates the future of America, our Nation. It creates  the foundation that lies ahead that ultimately creates the  opportunities that we as Americans pursue.   So I would like to take this opportunity to thank the teachers in the  San Joaquin Valley and across the Nation, throughout the United States,  for all that they do. Those first nine teachers who taught me, they saw  something in me and in thousands of students whom they have taught. You  know what: they made a difference. They made a difference in thousands  of lives, as teachers across the country do every day. So we should--it  is fitting and appropriate--honor the teachers of our Nation.                         Military Appreciation Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Military  Appreciation Month. This is a time that we dedicate throughout the  month of May honoring and celebrating those who have served our Nation,  sacrificed; those of our military servicemembers, their families, both  past and present, because families are a key part of those who have  served our Nation. Their courage and their sacrifice, therefore, should  never, ever be forgotten.   As a nation, on Memorial Day, later this month, we will honor and  remember the men and women who have given their lives to serve our  great Nation. Every year I join in the Memorial Day ceremonies across  California's San Joaquin Valley. This year I will participate in the  Memorial Day ceremony at the San Joaquin Valley National Cemetery in  Santa Nella. Hundreds will gather there with us. In Fresno, I will be  speaking both at the Veterans Liberty Cemetery and the Avenue of Flags  at Memorial Gardens.   But I believe most Members of Congress weekly--I certainly do--meet  with veterans. We meet to listen and to hear their concerns, as well as  men and women serving in Active Duty. Last week, when I was in the  district, I visited the Veterans Administration clinic in the city of  Merced to listen to veterans getting their healthcare, to their  concerns, to their needs, to ensure that they get the care that they  deserve.   And just yesterday, I spoke with a group of Valley veterans visiting  Washington, D.C., through the Central Valley Honor Flight. We have  these Honor Flights all across the country. It is the 16th Honor Flight  in 7 years from the San Joaquin Valley. Twenty-two of them were World  War II veterans, and they also served in Korea and in Vietnam.   It is appropriate to say ``thank you'' to them and to those men and  women we see across the country in uniform. I always remember to say  ``thank you.''   As President John F. Kennedy once said: ``As we express our  gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to  utter words but to live by them.''   With these words in mind, I call on my colleagues and my fellow  Americans to come together. America wants us to come together, not only  during this month but throughout the year, and thank those servicemen  and -women, the veterans, and their families; but also to do more than  just utter words of gratitude, because we can do better. We must, and  we should, work to ensure that our servicemembers, veterans, and  military families receive the resources, the justice, and the benefits  that they have earned.   These are our true American heroes.                            ____________________
