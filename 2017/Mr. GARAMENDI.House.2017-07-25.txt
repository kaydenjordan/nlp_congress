 Mr. Speaker, I want to follow along on my Republican  colleagues, as they were talking about rural America.   As a son of rural America, I agree with much of what they said about  the role of the Federal Government in providing support in so many  different ways to rural America. Many of the programs that they were  talking about are really found in the effort of the U.S. Government to  rebuild rural America following or during the days of the Great  Depression.   Mr. Speaker, I want to put up here on my easel one of the key  documents. This is actually etched in the marble at the Franklin Delano  Roosevelt Memorial here in Washington, D.C. I think it is instructive  as we talk about rural America and what is going on in rural America  today, and really across all of America.   During the height of the Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt said  these words:   ``The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the  abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for  those who have too little.''   During those days of the Depression, rural America was hurting, it  was devastated, and many of the programs that we just heard about from  our Republican colleagues were put in place at that time.   In 2010, the Congress of the United States, together with President  Obama, put in place another program that significantly helped rural  America. Today--in fact, just a couple of hours ago--the United States  Senate moved to remove from rural America the pillar of healthcare that  has provided millions of those 46 million Americans in rural America  with healthcare.                                time  1830    Through the expansion of the Medicaid program, the Medi-Cal program  in California, many of my constituents in rural America were able to  get healthcare for the first time, and they were also able to get  insurance because of the cost share reduction program where their  insurance premiums on the exchanges were reduced to a level that they  could afford.   A significant program for rural America is now in jeopardy as a  result of the Congress of the United States passing legislation a  couple of months ago that would repeal the Affordable Care Act and  replace it with whole cloth, ripping apart the Medicaid Expansion  program so that across this Nation some 16 million Americans would lose  their Medicaid coverage immediately, and more beyond that.   So in the initial year, 2018, 10 million Americans, many of them in  rural America, would lose their health coverage. Across this Nation in  the out-years, by 2025, 24 million Americans would lose their health  coverage as a result of the actions of the Republicans here in  Congress.   Today, just a couple of hours ago, the Senate decided to move forward  to make it even worse, to repeal and maybe not even replace, so that 32  million people would lose their coverage if that were to happen.  Eighteen million in 2018 and 2019 would lose their health coverage  under the program that was proposed by the U.S. Senate last week.   Unbelievable that, here on the floor, we heard a discussion about  rural America and the needs of rural America.   I am here to tell you, as the son of rural America, I grew up on a  ranch 2 miles from a community that had 500 people in it, that had a  three-room schoolhouse and just five of us in the eighth grade class. I  have raised my children in a community twice as large, a thousand  people in rural America, and I know that the people in my community  today depend upon the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, for the  healthcare coverage that they now have.   In California, over 5 million Californians gained coverage. The  uninsured rate dropped by 50 percent, from 18 to just over 9 percent.   Why? Why on Earth would we neglect this, these statements, this moral  imperative set down by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is not what we are  going to do for the wealthy.   And keep this in mind, that the legislation that passed this House  and repeated over in the Senate would be the largest transfer of wealth  of any legislation ever--ever--by the Congress of the United States,  transferring more than a trillion dollars from the men and women who  have been able to gain coverage in their healthcare.   This is real money taken out of their pockets as these programs  disappear because of the repeal and the replacement: a trillion dollars  taken from the working men and women and the poor in America and  transferred to the wealthy. That is what the legislation did that  passed this House; that is what is being considered in the Senate at  this moment: a monumental transfer of wealth, the largest transfer of  wealth in any single piece of legislation.   How can it be, if this is the test, not what we are doing for the  wealthy, not for those who have much, but, rather, for those in rural  America and urban America who have so little?   America ought to be upset. America ought to be outraged at what is  happening today.   We need to build America. We need a better America. We need better  jobs. We need better wages. We need better healthcare, better  education.   That is what we need, but where is this Congress going? It is going  in exactly the opposite direction. It is taking money out of the  pockets of Americans, rural and urban and everybody in between,  transferring a trillion dollars from their pockets to the superwealthy.   Who are they? Five members, including the President, in the Cabinet  of the United States are among the superwealthy, the 400 wealthiest  families in America. They are there in the Cabinet, in the President's  office.   What do they stand to gain? A $4 million, $5 million, $6 million, $7  million reduction in their taxes.   What do the working men and women of America stand to gain? Their  healthcare is going to be taken away from them, not just in the  reduction of the cost sharing, but also in the fact that, as we know it  today, the insurance market itself will be so destabilized, so  destabilized by the proposed action of the Senate and the House, that  it will really enter a death spiral, because the proposed laws allow  the healthy to opt out, and those who need insurance would continue to  try to get their insurance in an ever-increasing market of people who  have high health expenses. That is called a death spiral.   I know this. I was the insurance commissioner in California for 8  years, and we fought all those 8 years, from 1991 until I left that  office in 2006, we fought to try to put in place laws that are now in  place as a result of ObamaCare. The insurance companies cannot  discriminate on the basis of preexisting conditions. The fact that you  are a woman, the fact that you are older, they cannot discriminate. But  the bill that is now being debated in the Senate and will be back here  in the House allows for a return to those days of discrimination.   So if you happen to need healthcare, if you happen to have a  preexisting condition, if you happen to have high blood pressure,  diabetes, or you happen to be 60 years or 50 years of age, you will be  hit with a heavy increase in your premiums, perhaps two- to threefold  increases. That is what they are promising Americans.   We can't let it happen. And interestingly enough, America is pushing  back. They say: No more. No more. What we want is better healthcare. We  don't want to lose our healthcare policy. What we want is better  education. We want you in Congress to work on the education systems, on  the skills that my children need, your children need to be able to get  a decent job.   Americans want higher wages. They don't want their healthcare ripped  away as is happening here. They want us to focus on infrastructure.  They want us to focus on the well-paying jobs that occur from  infrastructure. Better jobs, better wages, better healthcare, better  education--that is where we are going.    And by God, we are going to protect the Affordable Care Act and we  are going to stand with Americans. We are going to stand with Americans  all across this Nation that say: No, we are not going to let it happen.   Mr. Trump, I know that you promised a repeal, but you are wrong, Mr.  President, you are wrong.   Mr. Speaker, I pass that message on to the President. You should not  take away from working men and women  [[Page H6288]]  who, for the first time, are able to get their healthcare and are able  to afford the private sector market or are able to get on the Medicaid  programs. You should not take it away so that you can give, to the  superwealthy, a trillion dollars. It is outrageous.   I need to take a deep breath. I am a bit riled up. I am a bit riled  up when I hear my colleagues come in and talk about rural America,  where I know, from my experience in my district, there is an opioid  epidemic and methamphetamines, and I know that those people are  dependent upon the Medicaid program that they intend to rip away.   Okay. Calm down, John. Don't get too excited. Don't get too mad. Take  a deep breath and turn it over to my colleague from the East Coast.   Congressman Tonko, you and I have been on this floor many times  talking about making it in America, about jobs, about making it better  for education. Give me a chance to take a deep breath.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York.   The view from the great State of New York and the State of  California, somewhere in between those two States lies the State of New  Mexico. I yield to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan  Grisham) to share with us the view from the great State of New Mexico.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I want to  thank my colleague, Mr. Garamendi, and certainly thank Mr. Tonko for  their incredible statements about what is really at risk and why it is  at risk.   I think it is very important for viewers, and our constituents, and  families, to really understand that this is not a healthcare debate.  This is not a healthcare reform measure.   Nothing that has occurred and passed in the House or in the Senate  has involved serious discussion or debate of any kind of healthcare  reform because what this really is, as you stated, is a tax break, not  just for the wealthiest of Americans, but for two critical  corporations, insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies, who, I  assure you, do not need additional tax breaks, who are still making  record profits. And when we look at the pharmaceutical industry, in  particular, it has been one of the most profitable industries in  America's history.   So this is an effort to provide more benefits to the three groups who  do not need these benefits; and the way in which they pay for it is to  remove healthcare benefits from millions of Americans. And as the  gentleman pointed out, 32 million Americans are at risk of losing their  healthcare, and many more who are in jeopardy of having to pay far more  for the benefits that are necessary and lifesaving.   I really wanted to weigh in because States like mine, rural,  frontier, very poor States, in fact, we have the most to lose of any  State in the Nation if this draconian measure, which is one step  closer, is passed in the Senate after today's procedural vote.   It means $11.4 billion out of our economy. It is a devastating blow  to one of the poorest States in the Nation, who has one of the highest  percentages of individuals in Medicaid to the expansion.   For the first time in my lifetime, I am seeing New Mexicans in a  position to have access to care, the right care at the right time at  the right place. If this country is going to get healthcare right, then  we have got to make sure that people have access so we are not the  sickest population in one of the wealthiest countries in the world.   The only way that you do that is providing access. We provide access  in the Affordable Care Act by giving people subsidies and asking  insurance companies to treat their beneficiaries and enrollees fairly,  right? Subsidies to afford those premiums, by making sure that they  have to cover preexisting conditions, by making sure that they are not  making women and other populations pay more for their care.   This is a Congress that has an obligation to address the things that  both Republicans in Congress and pharmaceutical companies and insurance  companies have done to us, not for us. Premiums are still too often too  high; copays still too often too high; and deductibles, still too high.   But is that the fault of the Democrats or an administration that  worked to make sure that insurance companies got payments to deal with  the rising costs of folks with serious catastrophic illnesses and  chronic disease? No, it is Republicans who refuse to continue to fund  those risk corridors and those cost-sharing mechanisms.   Did we do anything in this Congress to require pharmaceutical  companies who sell the very same drugs for 10 cents on a dollar to  nations around the world, to make sure that you got a fair drug price,  after your tax dollars helped those same pharmaceutical companies do  the research required? And then we give them patent protections to make  the most possible money, including now protections on generic brand  drugs?   No, we did nothing to hold that industry accountable, which would  mean lower costs for consumers.   But what I know happens for sure with this bill is, not only do they  rip the rug out from under any of those protections by hardworking New  Mexicans and hardworking Americans who deserve the protection and the  knowledge that their healthcare will be there for them tomorrow, we  also close every rural community health center, every rural hospital at  risk in the country, which is why no hospitals, no doctors, no  insurance companies, no pharmaceutical companies--because who are they  going to sell these proceeds to--are supporting this bill.   And the Senate is ignoring every Republican Governor whose State took  up Medicaid, who is saying this is a disaster. They want something  else.   Yet this is the path we are under because it would be more important  to give tax breaks than to do this--to protect Mr. Templeton in my  State, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in December 2016. He  began treatments in January 2017.   He explained in an email that, without the ACA, he is not able to  afford any of his treatments. He said: ``Am I being sentenced to death  by Congress? How many more U.S. citizens are out there like me?''   The answer to Mr. Templeton's question is there are at least 32  million.   As I close with what I think is an outrageous effort by Republicans  in the House and the Senate, and by that procedural vote in the Senate,  is at the same time they are looking at ripping healthcare away from  millions of Americans, they are willing to put $1.6 billion into a wall  that they promised that Americans would not pay for.   Here is an idea. You have got $1.6 billion to invest; invest that to  protect folks with their costs under the ACA. Give more subsidies.   Let's deal with Medicaid fairly. Let's make sure that we drop  prescription drug costs. Let's lower copays. Let's invest in rural  community health centers more. Let's have a targeted effort to deal, as  you said, with opioid and substance abuse problems that were created by  pharmaceutical companies. Let's do that.   If you really care, this is money that would hire more nurses. This  is money that would hire thousands more teachers. This is money that  would put thousands of New Mexicans and Americans back to work in  better, safer, more productive infrastructure for our futures--our very  future, Mr. Garamendi, Mr. Speaker, at stake by the wrong path and the  draconian efforts today in the Senate.   I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to highlight how terrible  these efforts are and how important it is for us to encourage our  supporters to fight for fairness and justice in this country.     Mr. Speaker, America has been enlightened by the  gentlewoman's very forthright statement. The voice of New Mexico has  been heard here on the House floor, Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham. I  cannot tell you how much I appreciate that message from New Mexico and  what it means with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Thank you so  very much for doing that, a very powerful statement, a very powerful  voice on behalf of New Mexicans and Americans.   Somewhere between New Mexico and New York lies the State of Ohio,  and, Ms. Kaptur, you have represented that State so very well for a few  years here. We won't say exactly how many years. But over those years,  you have always been the voice for the working men and women of Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Ms. Kaptur, thank you for your comments. For years you  have been the strong voice of working men and women in the State of  Ohio. Thank you for bringing us the message from mid-America.   Also, in your wrap-up, you began to talk about the issue of  prevention. One of things that the Affordable Care Act does so very  well--ObamaCare, if you will--is prevention, particularly for seniors.  There is a free annual healthcare checkup for seniors as a result of  the Affordable Care Act.   When seniors get that healthcare checkup, they also are able to  understand that they have high blood pressure, incipient diabetes or  other illnesses that ultimately, as Ms. Kaptur so correctly pointed  out, become extraordinarily expensive if they are not treated.   One other fact is that the Medicaid program in America, more than 50  percent of the total expenses in the Medicaid program are for men and  women who are in the nursing homes. We are not just talking about  families and  [[Page H6291]]  children. We are talking about the elderly that are being cared for in  nursing homes.   Now, the result of the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the  reduction of the Medicaid expenditure is that those men and women who  are in the nursing homes will no longer have the support to keep them  in a nursing home.   So what comes of those men and women? What happens to them if they  are no longer able to have care in a nursing home?   Just let that question hang there because it is a question that our  Republican colleagues and the Senate must answer, because the repeal  and replace legislation or repeal legislation and wait legislation goes  right to the heart of the Medicaid program and the support that enables  those seniors in nursing homes to receive that service.   In addition to that, what comes of the Medicare program? We know that  the Medicare program solvency was significantly increased to about 15  years. It is not going to go bankrupt in the near term as was predicted  before the Affordable Care Act but, rather, extended into the out- years. So the solvency of the Medicare program would be reduced, and  the free medical checkups, we are not sure whether they would be able  to continue or not.   So it is not just men and women who are not yet 65 years of age, but  it is men and women who are 65 that would see significant pressure on  the services that they now receive, and quite probably reductions in  the services that they would receive both in the Medicare as well as in  the Medicaid program.   Mr. Tonko, why don't we chat for a few moments back and forth here.   You in New York, you are faced with the same problems that my  constituents in California would be faced with, and that is a repeal  seriously hurts people, I mean, physically hurts them. They will not be  able to get the medical services that they currently have.   I yield to the gentleman from New York.    I thank Mr. Tonko so very much for his comments. He  covered the issues very well.   I want to go to two issues really quickly that need to, I think, be  wrapped up here.   First of all, the President talks about the Affordable Care Act  dying, and it is not going to make it. That could happen because of  actions that he is specifically telling the administration to take.   There are three different areas, one of which is being very late in  providing the cost-sharing funding programs for those people who are  purchasing insurance. It is discretionary right now. We ought to make  that mandatory and not given the President the option of not providing  those funds. If those funds are not provided, then, yes, the exchanges  will collapse.   Secondly, we know that there is the cross subsidization from one  insurance company to another called reinsurance that tries to balance  out the risk pool of each individual insurance company. Some insurance  companies, for many different reasons, wind up with a very high risk,  high cost population. Others are able to have a very low risk. The risk  needs to be balanced out between those two. If that is not done, then  there will be a death spiral amongst the insurance companies.    Thirdly, under the Affordable Care Act, people are mandated to buy  insurance or else pay a penalty. That penalty is enforced by the  Internal Revenue Service, which has been specifically given  instructions by the President not to enforce the law. That will lead to  those young and healthy invincibles not buying insurance because there  is no penalty. That will cause the insurance pool to become more risky  and, again, start that death spiral that is so much talked about.   The death spiral can be avoided, and the Affordable Care Act is  drafted and written in such a way as to avoid it. So my plea to the  President is: Use the law. Do not cause the Affordable Care Act to  collapse.   Mr. Speaker, please pass on to the President that the President has  within his power to maintain the Affordable Care Act. He also has  within his power to cause the Affordable Care Act to collapse.   Now, the final point--and help me with this, Mr. Tonko--is that the  Democrats have known for 5 years that there are improvements that need  to take place within the Affordable Care Act, and we have pleaded with  our Republican colleagues to allow those improvements to take place. We  have had a deaf ear from our Republican colleagues. So as we go into  this possible crisis, let it be known that the Democrats are seeking  improvements in a variety of areas. We heard about the drug prices. I  know, Mr. Tonko, you were talking in your earlier presentation about  some of the improvements that can be made. So jump in here. Interrupt  me, if you will.    I thank Mr. Tonko so very much, once again, from the  East Coast and the West Coast, I hope, to a message that America has  listened to.   I just looked out here in the audience and I noticed that our  colleague from Texas is here to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Garamendi for yielding. I  was detained at another meeting, but I could not help but conclude our  very important Special Order.   And I do want to emphasize that we have a better deal. We have the  opportunity to be able to stabilize the markets.   We heard from Mr. Cohen today, who is from the great State of  California, who says: The Affordable Care Act does work. Subsidies do  work. And if we go the route of the Senate--the tragic vote today-- Americans will wind up paying more for premiums than their own income.   So I join in saying we can fix and stabilize--fix the Affordable Care  Act, stabilize the healthcare system, and ensure that 49 million people  do not lose their insurance by 2026; or with the Senate bill, 32  million don't lose their insurance.   So I simply conclude with this: I met with a family who has an  autistic child--a young woman who wants to live on her own. She can't  do that without the Affordable Care Act.   I met with a young man by the name of Matthew, who spent $700,000  over a 2-year period because he has a chronic illness; $73,000 on his  medication in the last 6 months. The American people need us to do for  them what the government can do, and that is to ensure a healthcare  system for all.   That is what the Affordable Care Act's underlying premise is. That is  what Democrats have as their message. Mr. Garamendi, I believe in  saving lives. That is what I want to do with the Affordable Care Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Jackson Lee very much for her  comments.   Indeed, we do look for a better deal, better jobs, better wages,  better education. That is our goal, and we can do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
