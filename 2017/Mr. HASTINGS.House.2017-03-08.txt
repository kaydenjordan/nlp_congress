 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate a rule for a piece of legislation  that will, in the final analysis, make it more difficult for  hardworking Americans to stand up to corporate malfeasance; a piece of  legislation that jettisons a history of legal precedent in the blink of  an eye because, well, it helps keep the deep pockets of the  ultrawealthy as deep as possible.   I learned this law in law school in 1959, but it was in existence way  before that time, and now my friends across the aisle are going to tell  us that this legislation is needed because it will protect small  businesses. This is a feint, folks. Small businesses--indeed all of  us--have been and continue to be protected by the century-old  jurisprudential rule that the Republicans come here today to upend. In  reality, all this bill will do is make it more difficult for regular  folks across this country to bring lawsuits against massive  corporations.   I shudder to think what would have happened in the critically  important asbestos case had this particular law been in effect; and  there are many more.   This bill will make it more expensive both in time and treasure for  our fellow Americans to hold corporations responsible in the courtroom,  a need all the more prevalent today as my friends across the aisle have  been busy gutting regulations at a dizzying pace.   Let me make it clear, after we finish, my colleague from Colorado and  I are going to go back to the Rules Committee to discuss some more  judicial reform. A lot of it is stuff that is going to harm little  people in the courts and to cause them not to have access to the court  system, as have many of the regulations that we have already  disapproved.   Let us be clear, the American people didn't vote for dirty water, but  that is what they got with this Republican majority when it voted to  repeal a rule that barred corporations from dumping mining debris into  our drinking water, helping powerful mining companies by hurting all of  the rest of the people in their near curtilage.   The American people didn't vote to weaken the Securities and Exchange  Commission, but that is what this majority did when it passed a bill  adding more hurdles to the SEC rulemaking process, making it more  difficult for the agency to protect consumers, helping Wall Street  while putting our economy at risk. I will make a prediction  [[Page H1613]]  here. It may not happen right away, but just like we saw the Great  Depression that we are just coming out of, we are likely to see that  same kind of situation again by virtue of lessening the rules against  violations in securities.   The American people didn't vote to drug test Americans on  unemployment insurance--degrading the hardworking men and women in this  country--but that is what this Republican majority did without delay.   Mr. Speaker, the list really does go on and on. In fact, just  yesterday, Republicans continued to chant the corporate clarion call  with the unveiling of what I now will call their shameful replacement  of the Affordable Care Act. Until there is a resolution, I am going to  call it TrumpCare.   My colleagues like to tout how short the bill is compared to the  Affordable Care Act. Well, the American people will be surprised to  find that, in that brevity, Republicans managed to repeal an Affordable  Care Act provision that placed a limit on insurance executives'  compensation. Let me repeat that. They managed to repeal a provision  that placed a limit on insurance executives' compensation. The  insurance executives shouldn't be too surprised by this, however.  Repeatedly, Republicans have shown they represent corporate interests  over the interests of the American people.   But my Republican colleagues didn't stop there. Their so-called  replacement, the Trump bill, also claims to have done away with the  individual mandate. What they don't tell you is that, instead, their  plan calls for funneling money to the insurance companies in the form  of a 30 percent surcharge if an individual goes without health  insurance.   Let me tell all the older Americans and 80-year-old people like me to  get ready because they are going to be able to charge you just exactly  what they want to charge you, and all--mine and yours--insurance is  going to go up if this particular measure were to become law.   That is right. Under the Republican healthcare proposal, if you, the  American worker, goes without healthcare coverage for longer than 2  months--say you couldn't after a new plan between jobs--then  Republicans give insurance companies the right to charge you 30 percent  higher premiums. That is ridiculous.   Republicans didn't get rid of the individual mandate. They just  turned the mandate into a windfall for insurance companies--a windfall  that is going to work out great for insurance executives now that  Republicans also removed the cap on their compensation tax deductions.   Mr. Speaker, let us not lose sight of the fact that it took  Republicans 7 years of undermining the Affordable Care Act to finally  come up with this proposal for replacing it.                                time  1345    Their plan would kick millions of Americans off their health  insurance and force millions more to pay higher premiums. It would take  health care away from the poor, give tax cuts to the rich, and pull the  rug out from under seniors, families, and children.   In fact, this plan is so bad that Republicans literally hid not only  their horrific proposal, but themselves, from their constituents. Many  of their Members are seeing it just in the last 36 hours. They did this  by callously brushing off townhall meeting after townhall meeting.   Why all the smoke and mirrors regarding something as simple as this  measure is in light of the fact that they ran on replacing it? Why hide  it and why rush it and why go through this charade that most of us know  and several Senators said yesterday will be dead on arrival?   Actually, let me ask the American people. Who do you think the  Republican Party is representing, you or corporate America?   Mr. Speaker, we are not even a full 2 months into the Republican-led  government and, in addition to the unconstitutional Muslim bans--and  notice I said ``bans,'' because the old one is nothing but the new one,  and the new one is the old one, minus one, and that is the country of  Iraq--we have the Republican denial of clear Russian influence in our  most recent election.   Let me be very clear about this particular aspect. All of the  intelligence agencies have indicated that there was Russian  interference in this last election. I don't understand why we are not  totally outraged and why there is not extraordinary emphasis on this  kind of action against our fundamental democracy.   It is ridiculous that we are around here doing things that we know  are not likely to pass the United States Senate and that we are  disapproving regulations, yet we cannot get an independent commission  to make a determination of how this impact occurred. And we do know  that it occurred. I am outraged, and I would hope more Americans would  be as well.   We have also seen the almost immediate recusal of the Attorney  General due to his inability to be forthright with our Senate  colleagues; wild and baseless claims emanating from late-night Twitter  storms from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue or Mar-a-Lago; and we have a  Republican Party dedicated to ensuring that their corporate benefactors  can rest easy, no matter the harm they cause to everyday working  Americans.   Are we addressing any of these concerns here today?   I would imagine my colleague, rightly, will come back and argue that  all the things that I just talked about are not this particular rule.  Well, this rule is not even deserving of that kind of consideration,  largely for the reason it is yet another structured rule disallowing  Members of this House to have an opportunity to have input into a  measure that is getting rid of a century of precedent in our judiciary.  No, what we are doing is debating obscure civil procedure rules that  date back to the days of President Teddy Roosevelt.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the chairman of the Rules  Committee and he knows that.   I just heard him say his insurance went up under ObamaCare. Mine did,  too. I also want to remind him that, if this measure as offered  yesterday were to become law, his and my insurance is going to go up  again.   So we weren't doing all of the things that you said you were going to  do by bringing the price down. In addition, we don't even know what  CBO's score is with respect to this matter.   You said that you are reading it to understand it now, yet Members  are in the Energy and Commerce Committee, as you explained, marking it  up, and they don't even know what CBO's score is. I will get back to  that in a few minutes about all these people we pay over there to do  that work, and then we are not utilizing them.   I also want to address my friend from Colorado and have him  understand that I am not precluded from presenting to the American  public what legislation we wish to prioritize.   As the gentleman knows, we are currently debating the rule. This is a  tool used to set the House agenda and to prioritize consideration of  legislation. For that very reason, this is, in fact, the appropriate  time for us to explain to the American people what legislation we would  like to prioritize and what agenda we would like to pursue in this  House. I won't reiterate it, in the interest of time.   I will have a previous question that will demonstrably show what  legislation we think we should be addressing. I will do that for as  long as I am given the opportunity to manage rules. I will come down  here and present the position of the Democratic Party so that they  understand our priorities and not necessarily am I hidebound by this  rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer  an amendment to the rule which would modify the rules of the House to  require a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget Office before any  legislation that would amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act may be  considered in committee or on the House floor.   The Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and  Commerce are marking up repeal legislation today. Legislation this  significant should not advance through the committee process, let alone  the House, without first hearing from our nonpartisan budget experts at  the Congressional Budget Office on what the cost and overall impact  will be.   Mr. Speaker, we have over 200 employees at the Congressional Budget  Office. We pay them collectively--and administrative duties--nearly $50  million a year to advise us at times exactly like this.   House rules already require the Congressional Budget Office cost  estimates to be included in committee reports. We are simply trying to  improve and strengthen this principle of transparency in order to  ensure that we know the cost of this repeal legislation before we vote,  and that includes the members in the Committee on Energy and Commerce  today who are marking this up so as how they would know the cost before  they vote in committee today.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, it is not too late for my friends across  the aisle to tether themselves to the ideals that have made this  country great for generations; ideals that, if we are to be saved from  the rushing current we presently find ourselves being dragged down by,  will be, as they always have been, those ideals which save us from  ourselves.   We are a nation built upon the strength of immigrants, of teachers,  of doctors, of mill workers, garbagemen and -women, small-business  owners, and farmers. We are a nation of dreamers and innovators,  respectful of our individuality and mindful of our unparalleled power  once unified in common cause.   At some point, my Republican friends will, I hope, realize that their  unabashed and wholesale championing  [[Page H1616]]  of corporate interests at the expense of hardworking Americans is a  losing cause. For the sake of our environment, our children, our  grandchildren, and our unborn children, I hope this day is earlier  rather than later.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
