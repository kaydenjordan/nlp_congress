 Mr. President, as the former chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, the Senator from Iowa, has just pointed out, the Senate will  soon vote on the nomination of William Barr to serve as Attorney  General.   As has also been pointed out, this is, undoubtedly, one of the most  qualified nominees to come before the Senate in his having already held  the same position under President George H.W. Bush. He has also served  as an intelligence analyst at the CIA, as an Assistant Attorney General  in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, and as Deputy  Attorney General before he served as Attorney General.   His confirmation hearing lasted more than 12 hours, during which time  he and other witnesses answered hundreds of questions on a wide variety  of issues he might confront as Attorney General. He was straightforward  and forthcoming. He earned high praise even from the ranking Democrat  on that committee--our colleague, Senator Feinstein from California-- who said:         He's obviously very smart. He was Attorney General before.       . . . No one can say he isn't qualified. I was thinking last       night, obviously Mr. Barr is qualified. He is bright. He is       capable.    She could have said more, but one of the things she said after that  is, ``I won't be voting for him.''   This is an important job for the American people. There are a lot of  jobs out there to be filled. It is hard to argue that any of them are  more important than this one, but it is also hard to argue that there  is not something wrong with a process where that is the comment that  could be made, followed not too long after that by: I won't be voting  for him.   Senator Grassley pointed out that the last time Bill Barr was  confirmed to be Attorney General, it was by voice vote. It seems as if  that must have been a long time ago. It hasn't been that long ago; it  is just the way the Senate used to work. That is why the Rules  Committee that I chair voted out a Senate resolution earlier today  dealing with this issue. This should not be the problem that it is. It  shouldn't be an issue, but, frankly, the nomination process is broken.   In every election in this country, one thing has been certain: At  least one party will not be happy with the result. I certainly  understand why our Democratic colleagues weren't happy with the results  of the 2016 election. There have been elections I have not been happy  about and some that I have been happier about than others even when I  was happy. This is a process that makes it easy not to be pleased with  what voters decide to do, but that doesn't give you the right to stand  in the way of what voters try to do, and that is exactly what our  friends on the other side of the aisle have done.   Over the past 2 years, we have had unprecedented obstruction when it  comes to just trying to put a government in place, unprecedented  obstruction to confirming a President's nominees.  [[Page S1303]]    During the first Congress President Trump was in office, the previous  2 years, he submitted 1,136 nominees for jobs across the Federal  Government. During that same period of time, President Obama submitted  1,132 nominees.   By the way, President Trump is sometimes criticized for not getting  the nominees up here quickly enough. He actually got four more nominees  up during that period of time than President Obama did, but the Senate  confirmed 920 of President Obama's nominees during that first 2 years,  and the Senate only confirmed 714 of President Trump's nominees--barely  half for President Trump and about 70 percent, 75 percent for President  Obama. There is a nearly 200-person difference, but more important,  maybe, than the difference is the obvious effort for us not to be able  to get other work done.   At the end of the last Congress, we returned the largest number of  nominees from any President since Ronald Reagan. There are really only  two reasons for that. One is to, frankly, stall the confirmation  process and make it difficult for the President to do the job of being  President. If you don't get the people to help you do the job you are  elected to do, you can't do the job as effectively as you would  otherwise.   We just had a government shutdown, which I think all of us were  disappointed by. That is bad policy. We don't want to repeat it again.  We didn't want to repeat it that time. But we have a partial shutdown  of many of these Agencies and parts of the government every single day  because we don't have the people necessary to put the rules in place.   There was a lot of discussion during the government shutdown about  farmers who weren't able to get the loan guarantees they needed because  the office was closed. Well, to some extent, it is the same way when  the door is open but the people aren't there, when the door is open but  the rules for the new farm bill haven't been issued, and when the door  is open but the trade regulations that need to be made for the tax bill  aren't out there.   The other reason, by the way, the second reason, is just to use up  floor time. There are only so many things we can do here on the Senate  floor. The majority leader is fond of saying that the most precious  commodity in the Senate is floor time. If we are required to drag out  this process, as the minority has insisted we do for the last 2 years,  things don't happen otherwise.   During the first 2 years of the Trump administration, there were 128  cloture votes right here--128 cloture votes. That is where a Democrat-- usually the minority leader--insists that we are going to have to get a  majority of votes to even have the debate on a candidate. Once you file  that, that takes a day before you can even begin to have the debate,  and then the debate is 30 hours. So half a week is gone before the week  starts just trying to confirm one person for one thing. That could be  as important as a Supreme Court Justice, or it could be the lowest  level of confirmation in any of the Agencies of government.   By the way, those are the people who haven't been put in place  because obviously lifetime judges matter, and both parties would  prioritize that.   There have been 128 cloture votes. In the first 2 years of the past  three Presidents, there were cloture votes a total of 24 times--24  times. That is an average of 8 compared to 128. There is a lot of  difference between 8 and 128.   Because the tradition of the Senate--as a matter of fact, I think if  President Bush were on here, President George H. W. Bush--that number  was zero. No time. And that was much more traditional, up until that  time, than now.   When President Reagan was President, once a nominee got out of  committee, it was an average of 5 days before that nominee had a vote  here on the Senate floor. It was normally the same kind of voice vote  that Senator Grassley mentioned that Bill Barr had the last time. The  average was 5 days. With President Trump, it was 55 days before a  nominee could get a vote once they got out of committee.   Remember, if you have agreed to serve in one of these jobs, you have  given all of your financial information, you have given all of your  personal information, and you have been investigated through and  through. You have appeared before a committee, and they have asked you  every question they could think of to ask you. They have voted you out  of that committee. And then 24 people, at the end of last year, were  sent back to the White House, at the end of that conference--I think it  was over 24 people, over two dozen people--who had been waiting 1 year  to become maybe the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Interior.   This will not work. This is not how our system is supposed to work,  and we need to move forward. And it is not like when this happens--when  these 128 cloture votes happen--there is a huge debate. There are 30  hours, plus the intervening day, but that doesn't mean there is any big  debate. In fact, usually there is almost no debate at all on these  nominees. When the nominees were voted on, 48 percent of the nominees  got over 60 votes and 37 percent of the nominees got over 70 votes. So  clearly this is not about holding back somebody who could be confirmed;  it is about using up time that should be used for other things.   There are two jobs in the Senate. One of them is the personnel  business. One of them is confirming people the President nominates. But  the other is the legislating business. The other is the funding the  government business. The other is the talking about foreign policy  business. The other is talking about the economy and trade and taxes.  Every hour we spend on this is an hour we can't spend on that.   The resolution we passed out today was one I introduced with my  colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, who has been working on this  issue for 2 years now, and others of us have as well. We introduced  this bill to cut the amount of time back to what had been a temporary  standing order when Republicans were in the minority, and we agreed to  this temporary standing order. The Democrats were in the majority.  There was a Democrat in the White House. We agreed to essentially this  same framework: 2 hours for most nominees, 30 hours for circuit judges  and Supreme Court Justices and Cabinet officers. Seventy-eight Senators  voted for that temporary order.   Usually when you do you a temporary order, it is to see if it works.  Well, it worked, but we didn't do it again. So we are now saying, let's  make that temporary order a permanent part of the way the Senate  approaches this part of its job. We are moving in that direction. We  had a debate this morning in committee. The time we are spending on the  floor--if there is a nominee who needs 30 hours, they are almost  certainly going to be in that category that gets 30 hours. If there is  a nominee who would be in the 2-hour category, they are going to have  been through committee, they are going to have been thoroughly vetted,  and the committee will have decided they should be reported out. We  need to get back to where 5 days after that, the Senate lets this  person go on to fill a job that is, in all likelihood, not going to  last beyond one administration and maybe not even that.   It won't be long before nobody is willing to sign up if a year later,  after you have put your life on hold, you find out that the Senate  somehow can't get to the job you have agreed to serve on because we  have to take time that the Senate never took before.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle look at that standing  order that could change our rules in a way that allows people who are  willing to serve to be thoroughly vetted, thoroughly questioned, and  then voted on. This can't happen unless they get voted on. Clearly, the  current process of voting on people is a process that has been abused.   While the Senate is a place that recognizes the rights of the  minority, those rights have only been upheld when the minority viewed  them for what they are--rights of the minority rather than tools of the  minority to obstruct the elected Government of the United States of  America and the work of the Senate.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the Committee on Rules and Administration  has adopted rules governing its procedures for the 116th Congress.  Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, on behalf of myself and Senator Klobuchar, I ask unanimous  consent that a copy of the committee rules be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             Rules of Procedure                          MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE         Rule 1. The regular meeting dates of the Committee shall be       the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month, at 10:00       a.m., in room SR-301, Russell Senate Office Building.       Additional meetings of the Committee may be called by the       Chairman as he may deem necessary or pursuant to the       provision of paragraph 3 of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules       of the Senate.        Rule 2. Meetings of the committee, including meetings to       conduct hearings, shall be open to the public, except that a       meeting or series of meetings by the committee on the same       subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be       closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into       closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated       in subparagraphs (a) through (f) would require the meeting to       be closed followed immediately by a recorded vote in open       session by a majority of the Members of the committee when it       is determined that the matters to be discussed or the       testimony to be taken at such meeting or meetings:        (a) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in       the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct       of the foreign relations of the United States;        (b) will relate solely to matters of the committee staff       personnel or internal staff management or procedure;        (c) will tend to charge an individual with crime or       misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing       of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to       public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly       unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;        (d) will disclose the identity of any informer or law       enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating       to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense       that is required to be kept secret in the interests of       effective law enforcement;        (e) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets       or financial or commercial information pertaining       specifically to a given person if:        (1) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept       confidential by Government officers and employees; or        (2) the information has been obtained by the Government on       a confidential basis, other than through an application by       such person for a specific Government financial or other       benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to       prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such       person; or        (f) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential       under the provisions of law or  [[Page S1320]]       Government regulations. (Paragraph 5(b) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules.)        Rule 3. Written notices of committee meetings will normally       be sent by the committee's staff director to all Members of       the committee at least a week in advance. In addition, the       committee staff will telephone or e-mail reminders of       committee meetings to all Members of the committee or to the       appropriate assistants in their offices.        Rule 4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda       enumerating separate items of legislative business and       committee business will normally be sent to all Members of       the committee and released to the public at least 1 day in       advance of all meetings. This does not preclude any Member of       the committee from discussing appropriate non-agenda topics.        Rule 5. After the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member,       speaking order shall be based on order of arrival,       alternating between Majority and Minority Members, unless       otherwise directed by the Chairman.        Rule 6. Any witness who is to appear before the committee       in any hearing shall file with the clerk of the committee at       least 3 business days before the date of his or her       appearance, a written statement of his or her proposed       testimony and an executive summary thereof, in such form as       the chairman may direct, unless the Chairman and the Ranking       Minority Member waive such requirement for good cause.        Rule 7. In general, testimony will be restricted to 5       minutes for each witness. The time may be extended by the       Chairman, upon the Chair's own direction or at the request of       a Member. Each round of questions by Members will also be       limited to 5 minutes.                                   QUORUMS         Rule 8. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(1) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules, a majority of the Members of the committee       shall constitute a quorum for the reporting of legislative       measures.        Rule 9. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(1) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules, one-third of the Members of the committee       shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business,       including action on amendments to measures prior to voting to       report the measure to the Senate.        Rule 10. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(2) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules, 2 Members of the committee shall constitute a       quorum for the purpose of taking testimony under oath and 1       Member of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the       purpose of taking testimony not under oath; provided,       however, that in either instance, once a quorum is       established, any one Member can continue to take such       testimony.        Rule 11. Under no circumstances may proxies be considered       for the establishment of a quorum.                                    VOTING         Rule 12. Voting in the committee on any issue will normally       be by voice vote.        Rule 13. If a third of the Members present so demand a roll       call vote instead of a voice vote, a record vote will be       taken on any question by roll call.        Rule 14. The results of roll call votes taken in any       meeting upon any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be       stated in the committee report on that measure unless       previously announced by the committee, and such report or       announcement shall include a tabulation of the votes cast in       favor of and the votes cast in opposition to each such       measure and amendment by each Member of the committee.       (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)        Rule 15. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and       matters before the committee. However, the vote of the       committee to report a measure or matter shall require the       concurrence of a majority of the Members of the committee who       are physically present at the time of the vote. Proxies will       be allowed in such cases solely for the purpose of recording       a Member's position on the question and then only in those       instances when the absentee committee Member has been       informed of the question and has affirmatively requested that       he be recorded. (Paragraph 7(a)(3) of rule XXVI of the       Standing Rules.)                                  AMENDMENTS         Rule 16. Provided at least five business days' notice of       the agenda is given, and the text of the proposed bill or       resolution has been made available at least five business       days in advance, it shall not be in order for the Committee       to consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any       measure under consideration by the Committee unless such       amendment has been delivered to the office of the Committee       and by at least 5:00 p.m. the day prior to the scheduled       start of the meeting and circulated to each of the offices by       at least 6:00 pm.        Rule 17. In the event the Chairman introduces a substitute       amendment or a Chairman's mark, the requirements set forth in       Rule 16 shall be considered waived unless such substitute       amendment or Chairman's mark has been made available at least       five business days in advance of the scheduled meeting.        Rule 18. It shall be in order, without prior notice, for a       Member to offer a motion to strike a single section of any       bill, resolution, or amendment under consideration.        Rule 19. This section of the rule may be waived by       agreement of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member.                DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN         Rule 20. The Chairman is authorized to sign himself or by       delegation all necessary vouchers and routine papers for       which the committee's approval is required and to decide on       the committee's behalf all routine business.        Rule 21. The Chairman is authorized to engage commercial       reporters for the preparation of transcripts of committee       meetings and hearings.        Rule 22.

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND RANKING MINORITY                                   MEMBER         Rule 23. The Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, acting       jointly, are authorized to approve on behalf of the committee       any rule or regulation for which the committee's approval is       required, provided advance notice of their intention to do so       is given to Members of the committee.                            ____________________
