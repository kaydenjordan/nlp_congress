 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3537, the Accelerating  Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act.   I am a proud cosponsor of this bill and want to thank Representatives  Fortenberry and Quigley for their tireless efforts to move this bill  forward. We would not be here today without your hard work and the  tremendous advocacy efforts of the ALS community, who have so  passionately made the need for this legislation known to Congress.   ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve  cells in the brain and spinal cord. Many people lose the ability to  speak,  [[Page H7512]]  eat, move, and even breathe. Over 5,000 people are diagnosed with this  disease each year, and the average life expectancy is only 2 to 5 years  after diagnosis.   Recent years have brought a wealth of new scientific understanding  regarding this disease. There are currently five drugs available to  treat ALS, and while this is a remarkable achievement, we have more  work ahead of us.   H.R. 3537 establishes a grant program through HHS to support research  and access to investigational therapies to treat ALS for those patients  who cannot access clinical trials. It also directs HHS to establish a  public-private partnership for neurodegenerative diseases, which will  advance the development and regulatory approval of drugs to help treat  ALS and other rare neurodegenerative diseases.   This bill will ring hope to those with ALS and their loved ones by  promoting access to potentially breakthrough treatments and help us to  one day find a cure for this vicious disease.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Curtis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, there are over 300  cosponsors, and we all know that is not an easy task to do at all. It  takes a lot of work, a lot of leg work, a lot of effort. The two  hardest working people that we have seen this session are Mr. Quigley  from Illinois, and my good friend Jeff Fortenberry from Nebraska, who  put such effort into this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Fortenberry).                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I didn't mention a family as well.   Mr. Speaker, when you first come to Washington, you start getting to  know people who come to advocate for diseases and treatments like this.  I met the Ensor family. A lady named Kay Ensor came here with her 11-  or 12-year-old daughter at the time, Shelby. Shelby came to my office  and said:         I can't get a hug from my father anymore, and I don't want       any other little girl to feel this way. It may be too late       for us, but I don't want it to be too late for somebody in       the future.    I got to know them, and I visited them in Lebanon Junction, Kentucky.  [[Page H7514]]  Their son, Tanner, was probably 8 or 9 at the time. They rigged up a  wheelchair so he could go hunting with his father. But then it got to  the point where they couldn't do that at all. Then, unfortunately, I  was able to attend Mr. Ensor's funeral.    I don't have personal experiences in my family, but just seeing the  effort that a family has to go through and the love that they do it in  was an example for me to get involved in this issue, and the suffering  that the patient goes through but also the extremely difficult  circumstances for a family but how they were so loving in everything  they did.   I want to close with this: I know that Brian and his wife, Sandra,  were there at the hearing and touched every one of us. I want to yield  back in honor of the Ensor family from Lebanon Junction, Kentucky, Mr.  Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5487, the SHINE for  Autumn Act of 2021, led by Representatives Herrera Beutler, Roybal- Allard, Mullin, and Castor.   Each year, about 24,000 babies are stillborn in the United States,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite  medical innovations, stillbirth rates remain relatively unchanged and  affect women of different ages and backgrounds.   No family should have to go through such an unthinkable tragedy, and  this is, unfortunately, far too common.   H.R. 5487 aims to prevent stillbirth through enhanced research,  surveillance, and reporting. Specifically, the bill directs the  Department of Health and Human Services to better support States in  collecting more complete stillbirth data. It also establishes a  National Institutes of Health fellowship program focused on stillbirth  research and pathology.   This legislation will help provide much-needed outreach and education  on stillbirths, giving healthcare providers additional tools to improve  health outcomes for mothers and babies who deserve a fighting chance at  life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.   This is an important bill. I can't imagine what Autumn's mother has  gone through; what so many families have gone through with the  stillbirth of their child. I encourage all my colleagues to vote for  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5561, the Early  Hearing Detection and Intervention Act, which is also co-led by my  Energy and Commerce Committee colleague, Representative Matsui.   Hearing loss in children continues to be all too prevalent in the  United States. According to recent Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention data, almost 15 percent of children ages six to 19  experience either low or high-frequency hearing loss in one or both  ears.   The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention program, administered  through CDC and the Health Resources and Services Agency, has helped  providers to quickly identify babies and young children who are born  deaf or hard of hearing, which has led to improved health outcomes and  brought hope to so many families.   H.R. 5561 reauthorizes Federal support for these important statewide  programs that promote early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of deaf  and hearing impaired newborns, infants, and young children through  2026.   My bill will redouble our efforts to truly open the world of  communication to children experiencing hearing loss. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5551, the Improving the  Health of Children Act, led by my Energy and Commerce Committee  colleagues, Representatives Carter and Trahan.   Birth defects, unfortunately, are very common in the United States.  According to recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, 1  in every 33 babies are born with a birth defect each year, and birth  defects are the leading cause of death for all babies.   H.R. 5551 reauthorizes through 2026 the National Center on Birth  Defects and Developmental Disabilities, which has been critical to  improving the lives of children with birth defects and their families.   This would reestablish critical programming related to birth defects,  intellectual disabilities, and child development in order to bolster  the center's research efforts and improve more lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1193, the  Cardiovascular Advances and Opportunities Legacy Act, or the CAROL Act,  introduced by my good friend and fellow Kentuckian, Representative    Andy Barr.   Mr. Speaker, Congress is like a family, and we certainly laugh  together and we certainly argue with each other, but there are times we  cry with each other. I will never forget the phone call that I received  from   Robert Aderholt telling me that Carol Barr, who was a wonderful  woman, wonderful wife, and wonderful mother, had passed away.   Our friend and colleague, Representative   Andy Barr, has introduced  this bill to honor his wife, who passed away from mitral valve  prolapse.   Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death for most  demographic groups in the United States. Over 600,000 Americans die  from heart disease each year. This is equal to one person every 36  seconds.   We know that taking early action is critical to surviving a heart  condition. People need to know the warning signs and symptoms.  Understanding the gaps in education and information sharing will help  the healthcare system better detect these warning signs.   This bill authorizes grants administered by the National Heart, Lung,  and Blood Institute to support research on valvular heart disease and  convenes subject matter experts to identify research opportunities to  develop more  [[Page H7519]]  informed treatment guidelines for patients with valvular heart disease.   It also instructs the CDC to increase public awareness about the  symptoms associated with valvular heart disease and effective  strategies for preventing sudden cardiac arrest.   This bill will provide timely investments to adequately inform others  about valvular heart disease and ultimately save lives.   Mr. Speaker, as I said, every 36 seconds, one person dies from heart  disease. It is a life; it is a wife; it is a mother; it is Carol Barr.  That is who we are here today to honor. We should use the horrible  tragedy that the Barrs have gone through to prevent other families from  going through the same thing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I almost always enjoy when the Republican  leader comes to Kentucky, whether it is going to see Corvettes or the  Abraham Lincoln birthplace. Unfortunately, we got to spend time  together honoring Carol when we attended her funeral in Lexington.   I know he was a dear friend of Carol's. He is not just our Republican  leader, but he was a dear friend of hers as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), the Republican leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), another dear friend of my colleague from  Kentucky and his wife, Carol.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup), a good friend of Andy's, and I know he has taken  Andy under his wing over the last year. It is hard to believe it has  been over a year.    Madam Speaker, again, this is a great legacy for a great  woman and her children. Every time I see them, we all tear up but we  know that they are carrying on her legacy. I know that her husband is  here today moving forward with her legacy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the  bill, and I thank the gentleman for yielding to the gentlewoman from  Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
