 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, and I also thank the minority leader for her remarks in  support of 702.   I rise in support of the 702 reauthorization. It is critical to our  national security. You would see the color drain out of the faces of  all of our security personnel, the entire national security community,  if we lost the ability and went dark on 702.   We have got to follow through in this Congress. We have got to  provide the flexibility for them to use the tools that we have  available to us, and we have set up procedures that will approve of  this annually under the FISA courts. We have got a probable cause  requirement for any criminal investigation. That protects U.S. persons.  And we don't need to be protecting anything but U.S. persons when it  comes to this.   The gentlewoman spoke of civil liberties, and I stand in defense of  those civil liberties as well and in defense of the national security.  We have got an IG report that is written into this bill.    But I would remind the people who are concerned about this focus on  these civil liberties that Google and Facebook and Verizon and AT&T,  they hold more data than the U.S. Government has. That is where the  real information is, and if they are concerned about that, they should  raise that issue.   Meanwhile, I am going to oppose the Amash amendment and support the  reauthorization of 702. Our people in this America, U.S. persons,  deserve that protection for national security reasons. I urge its  adoption.
