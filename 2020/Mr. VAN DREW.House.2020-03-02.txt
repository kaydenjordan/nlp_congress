 Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday, I had the absolute  pleasure of attending the first Legacy Recognition Award Luncheon at  Abundant Life Worship Center Church with Bishop John R. Gandy.   They honored five individuals and their families whose commitment to  south Jersey is undeniable: the Fann family, Pastor Loretta Farmer,  Suffragan Bishop Otis Grayson, the Waiters family, and Apostle Luke  Witherspoon.   Thank you for your amazing work.   I would also like to recognize Bishop John R. Gandy for his  commitment and his leadership at Abundant Life. Bishop Gandy with his  wife, Patricia, have impacted so many lives in south Jersey and beyond.   Abundant Life is a loving church and helps lives to be transformed  through its threefold purpose to evangelize, edify, and equip the whole  man, the whole person--spirit, soul, and body--to lead a joyous,  abundant, and victorious Christian life.   Thank you, Bishop Gandy, your family, and those who we recognized  this past week. You truly are doing God's work in our community, and  may God bless you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
