 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  the remarkable life of Ms. LaTonya Barton, a military spouse who made  tremendous contributions to veterans, especially veteran entrepreneurs,  veteran-owned small businesses and service-disabled veteran-owned small  businesses.   Ms. Barton and her spouse, Mr. Timothy Barton, a U.S. Army veteran,  founded Kingdomware Technology, Incorporation, in 1993. After several  unsuccessful responses to requests for proposals issued by the U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs--VA--Ms. Barton suspected that the  Department was failing to comply with a statutory requirement known as  the Rule of Two. Under this Federal law, VA contracting officers are  required to restrict competition to veteran-owned small businesses when  it is reasonable to expect at least two veteran-owned small business  interests will compete for a given VA contract award.   Ms. Barton's legal challenge wove its way through the Federal  judiciary until it reached the Supreme Court of the United States of  America as the case Kingdomware Technologies, Inc. v. United States.  Ms. Barton ultimately prevailed in her case, as the Supreme Court  issued a unanimous 8-0 opinion which held that the Rule of Two is a  mandatory legal requirement that applies to all VA competitive contract  awards, including orders on the Federal Supply Schedule.   Ms. Barton's legal victory was a significant win for the rule of law  and every veteran-owned small business interest seeking to do business  with the VA. Throughout her years of conducting research for the  litigation and testifying before Congress, Ms. Barton always kept faith  in our justice system and remained steadfast in her determination to  make sure veteran small business owners who served our Nation in  uniform would benefit from laws enacted to help them do business with  the VA. Ms. Barton will be remembered by colleagues as a pioneer  businesswoman who was unwavering in her commitment to the principle  that when American tax dollars are expended by the VA, veteran-owned  small business interests must be empowered to compete with large  private sector competitors.   Of course, Ms. Barton was far more than a savvy businesswoman. She  was also a devoted mother, mentor, friend, and patriot who was loved  and respected in her community. Despite the significant demands placed  on her time by the litigation, Ms. Barton invested countless hours  developing her children's academic and athletic prowess.  [[Page S519]]  The fruits of her labor resulted in developing a successful veteran- owned small business that has lasted more than 20 years and three  outstanding student-athletes who excel in the classroom and on the  basketball court.   Ms. Barton passed away unexpectedly on November 3, 2021, leaving  behind a legacy for veteran entrepreneurs across our Nation. She will  always be remembered for her tenacity and dedication to doing right by  our country's veterans. Qualities that are taught and found in our  servicemembers came naturally to Ms. Barton, who was an outstanding  leader, refused to accept defeat, possessed a never-quit attitude, and  never gave up on the mission or her team.   Ms. Barton leaves behind her husband, Tim, and their three children,  Timothy, Jr., Carolae, and Johnathan. May her service, legacy and kind  spirit serve as an inspiration to all.                            ____________________
