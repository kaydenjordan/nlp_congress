 Mr. Speaker, today, on Twitter, President Trump threatened  to withhold FEMA disaster money from California.   Mr. Speaker, maybe the President doesn't know what FEMA disaster  funding goes for. It helps rebuild homes. It helps folks rebuild  schools, hospitals.   Maybe the President doesn't know that we have suffered devastating  wildfires in California. We have lost close to 28,000 structures. We  have had billions of dollars of damage. Close to my district, 14,000  homes were lost.   Mr. Speaker, what makes America great is when our neighbors, our  fellow countrymen suffer a tragedy, we come together as a Nation.   Mr. Speaker, what I find disgusting is that the President seems to  lack the compassion to know that fellow Americans are suffering right  now.   Mr. Speaker, we can do better than that.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of title III of the  House rules package. A district court recently ruled that the entire  Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional, and, sadly, President Trump's  Justice Department did nothing to defend the Affordable Care Act. They  even urged the judge to strike down protections to those with  preexisting conditions.   Now, I have heard and I understand my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle don't like the Affordable Care Act, but not to defend it, not  to talk about the benefits, is not defensible. I have heard many of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about how they want to  protect those with preexisting conditions. Well, this is one way to  protect those with preexisting conditions.   I see this as a doctor. I don't want to go back to the days when I  would see patients who had cancer, had diabetes, had heart conditions,  and through no action on their own, lost their health insurance. I  don't want to go back to the days where the health insurance companies  could deny people those coverages--often necessary lifesaving therapies  and coverage. This is about doing the right thing for America's  patients. That is why we are here.   Now, what title III of the rules package does is it says that the  House of Representatives should intervene in Texas v. United States. If  this lawsuit succeeds, it is going to repeal the Affordable Care Act  with no solution. None. Millions of Americans are going to lose their  health insurance coverage.   The American public spoke loud and clear. They want this body to sit  down, to come together to provide coverage for America--affordable  coverage. That is what we need to do as Democrats and Republicans. I  urge my colleagues to vote for title III and to make it clear this  Congress will protect those with preexisting conditions.   I have got friends on the other side of the aisle. I heard many of  them talk about how they want to protect those with preexisting  conditions. A vote against title III of the rules package is a vote  against protecting those Americans.
