 Mr. Speaker, on National Intern Day, I  rise to shine a spotlight on North Carolina's First Congressional  District's amazing interns.   First, let's give a big shout-out to Andrea Knight who holds down the  fort in Greenville, North Carolina, at our district office.   Here at our Nation's Capital we have Cierra Gilliam, Alice  Chatterjee, and Saahil Rao. These dynamic interns and their hard work  have tremendously impacted our legislative efforts, and I thank them.  Our future is in good hands.       Recognizing Joyce Hamlett, Keeper of the Mace, on Her Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I also rise to recognize  Joyce Hamlett, keeper of the mace. She grew up in the tobacco fields of  North Carolina to become the bearer of the historic House mace.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Joyce for being fair and getting on me just like  she got on everyone else. She has fulfilled her duties, and she hasn't  dropped the mace.   Congratulations on her retirement, and I look forward to seeing her  in North Carolina.                            ____________________
