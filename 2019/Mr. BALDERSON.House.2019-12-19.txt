 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Brady for yielding. I rise  this afternoon with enthusiasm for a bipartisan agreement, the United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.   This trade deal between our country and our top two trading partners  will be a major win for the Buckeye State. Ohio farmers and  manufacturers already export nearly $28 billion worth of goods to  Canada and Mexico every year. The USMCA opens up Canada's market to  American poultry and dairy so that Ohio farmers can now trade these  products across international lines.   In this digital era, many people's shopping is increasingly done  online. People can shop small businesses and larger companies alike,  especially during the holiday gifting season. USMCA brings an outdated  trade agreement into the 21st century with a previously nonexistent  section on digital trade.   USMCA is what our country needs now, and I am thrilled to support  this bipartisan agreement's passage. I thank Chairman Neal and Ranking  Member Brady.
