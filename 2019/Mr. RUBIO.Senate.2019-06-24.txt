 Mr. President, I recognize the Chipola College Lady  Indians softball team, winners of the National Junior College Athletic  Association Division I National Championship.   The Lady Indians are comprised of talented young women in Marianna,  FL and finished their season scoring a total of 69 runs and a 52-5-1  record, leading them to the team's third overall NJCAA championship  title.   In the national championship game, they played against Angelina  College from Lufkin, TX, and trailed by two runs after the first  inning. Beginning in the second inning, the Lady Indians scored five  runs, with Mikayla Lewin and Haley Sandridge both hitting homeruns. In  the third inning, the team scored five more runs on six hits from Thais  Uyeme, Sydney Mclain, Candela Figueroa, and Haley Sandridge, who all  had RBIs in the inning.   The Lady Indians led Angelina College 10-2 entering the fourth  inning. The scored remained the same until the sixth inning, when Eila  Infante and Mikayla Lewin scored two more runs for the team. In the  seventh and final inning, the Lady Indians scored seven more runs from  Yoshi Omori, Tammie Lijbers, Sandridge, Infante, Jadia Jones, and Ally  Clegg. At the bottom of the seventh, Amy Woodham recorded the first two  outs against Angelina College before Brianna Bailey entered the game  and recorded the final strikeout of the championship game. Chipola won  with a final score of 19-2.   I extend my best wishes to head softball coach Belinda Hendrix,  associate head softball coach Jimmy Hendrix, assistant softball coach  Kelly Brookins, Brianna Bailey, Tyra Brown, Payton Clark, Ally Clegg,  Candela Figeroa, Lauren Finch, Eila Infante, Jadia Jones, Madison Kent,  Mikayla Lewin, Tammie Lijbers Christine Marsland, Sydney Mclain, Yoshie  Omori, Naomi Parker, Haley Sandridge, Morgan Scala, Taylor Scala, Amy  Woodham, Thais Uyema, and the Lady Indians softball team on this  impressive accomplishment. I look forward to hearing of their continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________
