 Mr. Speaker, 20 days from now, the Homer  City Generating Station in Pennsylvania will power down its turbines  and close its doors. Since opening in 1969, the plant has reliably  utilized the coal that has been mined in Pennsylvania communities for  generations.   After years of continual operation, Homer City's closure will leave  just four operational coal plants functioning in the Keystone State.  The closing of this plant is not only a symbolic loss, but one that  will have real-world consequences for energy production.   What President Biden, liberals in Congress, and green energy  supporters across the United States fail to realize is that  technologies like wind turbines and solar panels lack the capacity to  keep the lights on.   These alternative methods of production simply cannot produce enough  power to meet the needs of our families and businesses. Without the  capacity to store enough energy to be used in peak hours, green  technologies are unable to support our electric grid.   Eliminating coal power will have disastrous consequences, including  rolling blackouts for families across America. We have seen the warning  signs. Look to Europe, as Austria, Germany, and Italy announce that  they are reopening coal plants and admit that the green technologies  have failed to produce the energy that those countries need.   Let's face it, Americans have always led on innovation, and now  countries around the world will rely on America to build the carbon  capture systems that will make coal plants safer and more reliable.  That will not be possible as long as the Biden administration continues  to force the shuttering of these facilities here at home.   We need to return to the energy resources that are underneath the  feet of my constituents in Pennsylvania. We need to return to American  energy dominance. It is time for the Biden administration to end its  reckless attacks on our energy producers.                            ____________________
