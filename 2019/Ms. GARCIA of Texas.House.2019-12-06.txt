 Mr. Speaker, today I want to congratulate our  very own Lina Hidalgo, the county judge and chief executive of Harris  County, for being named to the Forbes 30 Under 30.   A proud immigrant, born in Colombia, and the product of Houston-area  public schools, Lina was the first in her family to graduate from  college.   Lina went on to serve as a medical interpreter at the Texas Medical  Center and has supported immigrants throughout her career.   Last year, Lina became the first woman and the first minority ever  elected county judge in Harris County.   Lina is an inspiration to everyone in the community and has dedicated  her life to serving the public and promoting equality.   Lina is an example of how immigrants make America great, with her  hard work and contributions to her county and her country. She is the  product of the American Dream, an American value we must preserve so  that everyone who turns to America for an opportunity to achieve a  better life can achieve it.    I am so proud to congratulate my friend, Harris County Judge Lina  Hidalgo.   ``Felicidades y si se puede.'' Congratulations, and, yes, you can.

I support this bill and its efforts to protect access to the ballot  box and advance justice and democracy for all, including Latinos, which  represent 77 percent of my district.   Enfranchising minority voters will strengthen our democracy because  when all eligible voters can exercise their right, our government works  better by living up to its ideals of ``we the people.''   This bill aims to maintain elections free, fair, and accessible to  all eligible voters.   Congress must pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore our  ability to prevent voter discrimination. We are all equal at the ballot  box, and this bill aims to make sure that that is a reality today,  tomorrow, and every day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 4.
