 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Western  High School Pioneers on their first-ever CIF football championship.   Since Western High School opened its doors in 1955, the Pioneers have  never won this coveted prize. Now, 63 years later, Coach Dan Davidson  put together a very talented team that finally won CIF.   Having grown up in Anaheim, I have seen many, many talented Western  High School football teams come and go, but I have to tell Coach  Davidson: Congratulations. Job well done.   Again, congratulations to the Pioneers, to the parents, and to the  student body: Job well done. Congratulations. We are all proud of you.                            ____________________
