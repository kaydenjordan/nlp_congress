 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the  life of Renee Van Nett from Duluth, Minnesota, who bravely battled her  diagnosis of terminal cancer and recently passed away.   Renee was well-known and well-loved across the northland. She was a  dedicated mother, city council member, and active community member. Her  tragic passing has affected many, showing the countless lives she  touched and made a difference in.   Though the loss leaves a hole in the lives of many, the work Renee  accomplished has left a legacy that will live on beyond any of us.   As the first Native American person to have been elected to the  Duluth City Council, Renee will always be remembered as an inspiration  to her fellow Red Lake Nation members and to the entire Native American  community.   I am grateful for Renee sharing her compassion, dedication, and love  for Duluth and all its people. May we all continue to help carry on her  legacy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the vote closed prior to me being able to  vote.
