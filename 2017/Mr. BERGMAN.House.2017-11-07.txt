 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2123, the  Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act.   For veterans in my district, the challenge of receiving timely,  quality care from the VA is, at times, impossible. In fact, winter has  already arrived in northern and upper Michigan. Travel is complex and  sometimes hazardous.   With some of the most rural geography in the country, veterans in  Michigan's First District are forced to travel long distances, often  hours, into Wisconsin or hundreds of miles down into mid- and southeast  Michigan just to keep simple doctors' appointments.   Innovative healthcare solutions like telemedicine are long overdue.  Veterans in my district will help validate the requirements for and the  quality of such innovations.   H.R. 2123 will allow VA-licensed healthcare providers to practice  telemedicine at any location, in any State, regardless of where the  provider or patient is located. This bill will make it easier for  veterans in my district and all across the country to access healthcare  services in a convenient setting that fits their schedule, ultimately,  putting the veteran first. I have long said that if a program or policy  can work in Michigan's First District, it can work anywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 2123.
