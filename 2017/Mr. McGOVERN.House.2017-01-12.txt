 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 238,  legislation to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,  better known as the CFTC. Instead of working through regular order to  produce an authorization bill that both Democrats and Republicans could  have supported, the majority in this House rushed to the floor a deeply  flawed piece of legislation that hamstrings the CFTC and undermines its  ability to react to changing market conditions.   The burdensome requirements in this legislation and the lack of  appropriate funding are nothing more than a misguided attempt by  Republicans to make it more difficult for the Commission to function-- to make it harder to protect consumers and make it more difficult to  rein in the abuses of Wall Street.   I strongly object to the authorization level in this legislation.  Basically, my Republican friends are flat funding the CFTC for 5 years,  and that is despite calls from the former and current chairman asking  us to provide additional resources to the agency to enhance their  ability to police Wall Street.   Now, Dodd-Frank significantly expanded the Commission's role in  overseeing our financial markets, and the Commission has done its part  to create rules that will help to prevent another financial crisis,  despite the fact that Congress has not provided appropriate funding.   Now, I get it. My Republican friends don't like Dodd-Frank. Ever  since they took back control of the House, they have tried to dismantle  the law piece by piece, which was enacted to protect consumers and  protect our markets in the wake of that terrible financial crisis that  practically ruined our economy.   Now, Republicans say they don't like regulation, and it seems they  especially don't like any regulation on Wall Street. Have they  forgotten the recent financial crisis that nearly destroyed our  economy? Have they forgotten who was primarily responsible for that  crisis? Apparently, they have. Now, I am not for endless and  unnecessary regulation. Nobody is. But I do think it is appropriate for  us to create commonsense rules that protect our markets and protect our  constituents' hard-earned dollars.   I find it troubling the Republican leaders in this House don't want  to provide necessary resources to the Commission to patrol Wall Street.  Without cops on the beat, who will ensure Wall Street actors aren't  gaming the system and putting the economy at risk for another meltdown.  I ask my Republican friends: When will Main Street take priority over  Wall Street?   I also take issue with the various provisions of this bill that will  both slow the agency's work and create new avenues for costly and  lengthy legal battles.   By the way, implementing these provisions will cost the Commission an  additional $45 million over the next 5 years and will require an  additional 30 full-time employees. So in addition to underfunding an  already overworked agency, we are creating a situation where even more  resources will be needed to satisfy burdensome and unnecessary  requirements. Now, that means fewer dollars for the Commission to carry  out its core mission of combating abuse and fraud in our markets and  ensuring end users, investors, and the public are protected.   Now, Mr. Chairman, our constituents didn't send us to Washington to  ignore bad actors in our financial markets. They certainly didn't send  us to Washington to create a regulatory environment that could put us  on a path toward another downturn. So who are we here to represent, the  Wall Street banks or our hardworking constituents who deserve elected  Representatives who do everything in their power to prevent another  financial crisis?   I would also like to say a few words about the cross-border  requirements imposed by this bill, requirements that would hamstring  the Commission's efforts to regulate the global swaps industry in  cooperation with regulators around the globe.   My colleagues across the aisle keep saying that this bill is  essential to help farmers, ranchers, utilities, and Main Street small  business. But the farmers in this country don't have a London office to  trade their swaps, they don't have a derivatives desk in Tokyo, and  they aren't trading interest rate swaps in Geneva.    Mr. Chair, let's be clear about who the cross-border  provision in this bill is designed to help. It isn't end users. It  isn't farmers. It isn't manufacturers or utilities or Main Street  businesses. It is the small group of multinational financial firms that  have controlled the swaps market from the beginning. We have seen what  happens when they are left to their own devices. Crises in the swaps  market do not respect national borders and boundaries. And that is why  our regulators from the Commission have been engaged with their  international counterparts in crafting rules for these markets since  2009.                                time  1300    They should be encouraged in that effort in every way possible  through funding and expansive authority to get the rules right. This  bill provides neither.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided  legislation.
