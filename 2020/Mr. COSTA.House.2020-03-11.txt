 Mr. Speaker, every March, we honor the extraordinary  contributions of women who have shaped our Nation's history and those  who continue to pave the way for the next generation. This year also  marks the 100th year since the 19th Amendment granted women the right  to vote.   Think about it, just in the last 100 years. Our Nation is now going  on 245 years old. A century later, the women who have done so much for  our country throughout our Nation's entire history continue to make a  difference.   I am proud, today, to say that I serve with a record number of women  in Congress as we continue to fight for issues that are so important:  equal pay, reproductive freedom, and so much more.   Mr. Speaker, as we use this opportunity to celebrate the incredible  women who have changed the world in your life and in my life, I would  like to pay tribute to an iconic woman, an artist in my home of Fresno,  California, Margaret Hudson.   Ms. Hudson passed away last month, but her legacy lives on in her  clay sculptures of California wildlife that can be seen on display  throughout the valley. It is incredible work.    From a young age, Margaret loved to spend time outdoors hiking in  such places as Sequoia National Park. Her appreciation for the  beautiful landscape of the Central Valley would later influence so much  of her artwork that we enjoy today.   She attended college in New England and served as a missionary in  Japan and South Korea for several years. Her love for art blossomed  years later, when she began sculpting from memories of her time in  South Korea. She became one of the first female art entrepreneurs in  Fresno when she opened up her own studio in 1972.   Through the years, Margaret expanded her interest in the arts to  painting and held many of her own art shows to display her work and to  encourage young artists such as herself, especially women. Margaret's  artwork is a fixture throughout the Central Valley, with permanent  works on display at our Valley Children's Hospital and Fresno Chaffee  Zoo.   Her work continues to inspire us, and I think it is a reflection of  her appreciation and respect for the natural beauty and landscapes that  we have in California and throughout our country. Certainly, the Sierra  Nevada and the San Joaquin Valley were among many of the reflections  and renderings of the creation of the art that she was so proud of and  that we so much enjoy today.   So I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life and the  contributions of Margaret Hudson. Her artwork continues to inspire and  is cherished as a part of all of those who know it and who enjoy it.   God bless you, Margaret. You made a difference.                            ____________________
