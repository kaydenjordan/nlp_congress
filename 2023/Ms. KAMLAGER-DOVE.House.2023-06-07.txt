 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight June as  Caribbean American Heritage Month. This month allows us to celebrate  the diversity and influence of the Caribbean diaspora.   As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and Subcommittee on the  Western Hemisphere, we must ensure the prosperity of the Caribbean.   Just recently, I co-led a bipartisan resolution with Representatives  Lawler, Cherfilus-McCormick, and Salazar to redouble our diplomatic  efforts with Haiti. This resolution also expresses support in achieving  Haitian-centered solutions that restore the island's political  infrastructure and address the basic needs of its people. We cannot  ignore the plight of our neighbors who are just mere miles from our  shore.   Caribbean Americans have helped define the American story. Many of  them serve here with me in Congress, and many more have had important  roles throughout our country's history.   As a Representative of Los Angeles, I am fortunate to live in a  culturally vibrant city where Caribbean Angelenos influence the food,  music, and art of the city.    This month is about celebration of culture and community and reminds  us to look beyond the European patriarchal lens that dominates our  society. The U.S. is a country of immigrants, something the Governor of  Florida could stand to remember.                        Gun Violence Prevention Month     Mr. Speaker, June is Gun Violence Prevention  Month. June is Gun Violence Prevention Month. June is Gun Violence  Prevention Month. So why, in this full body, are we not talking about  the gun violence epidemic that has taken hold of this country?   Why is the Republican Party punting on this issue and continuing to  blame gun violence solely on mental health and ignorantly say that the  answer to gun violence is more guns?   The parents of the children killed by mass shootings, the survivors  of these mass shootings don't want or deserve to continue to hear that.  They deserve acknowledgment, honesty and, most of all, they deserve  action.   They deserve a Republican Party that cares as much about this issue  as they do stove tops which, when you think about it, is incredibly  painful and disrespectful.   Republicans seem to want to talk about everything except gun  violence, everything except gun violence, everything except gun  violence, and that silence, that silence on this issue is tantamount to  blaming the victims. That failure to act is equivalent to disregarding  these victims' lives and dismissing their deaths.   Mr. Speaker, June is Gun Violence Prevention Month. June is Gun  Violence Prevention Month, so let's act like it.                            ____________________
