 Madam Speaker, I am grateful that the  House Armed Services Committee included my amendment, the Small  Manufacturer Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, in the National Defense  Authorization Act, which passed yesterday by bipartisan vote.   This crucial amendment will provide much-needed assistance to small  defense manufacturers with cyber compliance, and it will enhance the  cybersecurity through our defense supply chain by expanding DOD cyber  initiatives with the manufacturing extension partnership centers. The  MEP national network is ideally situated to assist the Department to  help strengthen our national defense.   This bipartisan legislation was supported unanimously by all members  of the House Armed Services Committee. It is especially important to  the communities I represent adjacent to the Army Cyber Command at Fort  Gordon. The potential to create jobs is encouraged.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on Friday, our country  lost Congressman John Lewis, an inspiring individual who stirred so  much important change.   I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to Congressman John  Lewis' family, friends, and staff. Congressman Lewis will always be an  icon of courage to promote equality and freedom. I will always cherish  his thoughtful and cheerful encouragement during our time serving in  Congress together.   Congressman Lewis was especially appreciated by his neighbors--the  people of South Carolina.   We will always remember Congressman Lewis for his many significant  accomplishments. And although he is no longer with us, his legacy will  always live on. My prayers are with the Lewis family during this  incredibly painful time.
