 Madam Speaker, this week, Texas lost a son and America  lost one of our finest patriots. Ross Perot was a leader, risk-taker,  and a businessman who embodied the meaning of the American Dream.   Growing up in east Texas in what could be described as extreme  poverty, Perot sought to make a difference in the lives of many, and he  did just that. He was a leading example of the great things that can  happen in this great country.   He left his home to serve our country in the U.S. Navy and later  returned to grow his family and build his business empire. He was a  self-made man who always remembered his humble beginnings, graciously  giving time and resources to causes in both our Texas community and  around the world.   He especially loved our men and women in uniform and was one of the  first to speak out and do something about the treatment of our POWs.   Perot also long warned us about the dangers of our growing national  debt and sought to make politics and the economy less complicated.   Remember that he would say, ``It's just that simple.''   Throughout his life, he prioritized love of his family and his  country. We will all remember his service to our Nation and his fun and  feisty spirit.   May we all say a prayer for his wife, children, and grandchildren and  celebrate the life of this amazing man.   God bless Ross Perot. God bless his family. And God bless our  country.                            ____________________
