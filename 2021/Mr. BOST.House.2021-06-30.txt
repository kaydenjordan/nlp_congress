 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the men and women who  have proudly safeguarded the American way of life since 1776.   Generations of veterans have protected our homeland and its  principles against all enemies.   These everyday American heroes are willing to give their lives to  ensure a better tomorrow for our children and grandchildren.   We are forever indebted to them.   To the over 19 million veterans and 1.5 million Active Duty service  personnel who hail from every corner of our Nation, we say thank you.   To the military families whose loved ones took their last breath in  defense of tyranny, we will never forget the sacrifices.   This Independence Day, I will be thanking them, and I hope you will  be as well.   May God continue to bless this great United States of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   With this bill, House Democrats are saying that when it comes to our  Nation's infrastructure, it is either their way or the highway.   Instead of accurately investing in our roads and bridges, the House  Democrats have chosen to double down on a liberal wish list.   In fact, $1 of every $2 in this bill is spent on parts of Green New  Deal mandates.   It allows jurisdictions that have defunded the police to backfill  their budgets with Federal dollars for traffic enforcement activities.   It allows funds to be spent on art instead of roads, bridges, and  waterways. I will just repeat that again. It allows the funds to be  spent on art instead of roads, bridges, and waterways.   It punishes our Nation's truckers by raising their minimum insurance  costs by 167 percent and regulating when and how far they can drive  their own vehicles on their own personal time.   And it does not include any way to pay for this massive $547.9  billion price tag.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
