 Mr. Speaker, before I start, I include in the Record  two articles. One is a letter from the National Fraternal Order of  Police, representing 330,000 police officers in this country coming out  against this bill because it will affect their members in a very, very  terrible way. The other is an article in The New York Times today:  ``Republican Tax Plans Put Corporations Over People.''                                                  National Fraternal                                                 Order of Police,                                  Washington, DC, November 14, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker, Senator McConnell, Representative Pelosi       and Senator Schumer: I am writing on behalf of the members of       the Fraternal Order of Police to urge you to protect the       State and local tax (SALT) deduction in the current tax code.       Our members put their lives and safety at risk to protect our       homes, schools and communities. Their salaries and the       equipment they use are paid for by State and local taxes on       property, sales and income. These funds are then invested in       our law enforcement agencies and the men and women serving in       law enforcement.        The FOP is very concerned that the partial or total       elimination of the SALT deductions will endanger the ability       of our State and local governments to fund these agencies and       recruit the men and women we need to keep us safe. In       addition, our members are also citizens of these communities       who work and pay these State and local taxes. The elimination       of the SALT deductions, in whole or in part, will be deeply       harmful to them and their families, effectively raising their       taxes as much as $6,300 according to recent studies. The SALT       deduction has been part of the tax code since it was       originally drafted in 1913. Our members would certainly       oppose any effort of the Federal government to tax their       income twice by eliminating the SALT deduction.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I urge Congress to preserve the SALT       deductions, to reject any effort to eliminate, in whole or in       part, these deductions and oppose the final bill if these       deductions are included. I thank you in advance for your       consideration of our views. Please feel free to contact me or       my Senior Advisor Jim Pasco if I can provide any additional       information on this important issue.        Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, Nov. 16, 2017]             Republican Tax Plans Put Corporations Over People                            (By Jim Tankersley)         Washington.--There are tough choices at the heart of the       Republican tax bills speeding through Congress, and they make       clear what the party values most in economic policy right       now: deep and lasting tax cuts for corporations.        The bill set to pass the House on Thursday chooses to take       from high-tax Democratic states, particularly California and       New York, and give to lower-tax Republican states that       President Trump carried in 2016, particularly Florida and       Texas. It allows for tax increases on millions of families       several years from now, if a future Congress does not       intervene, but not for similar increases on corporations.        The version of the bill moving through the Senate Finance       Committee chooses to give peace of mind to corporate       executives planning their long-term investments. That comes       at the expense of added anxiety for individual taxpayers,       particularly those in the middle class, who could face stiff       tax increases on Jan. 1, 2026.        A consistent conservative philosophy underpins all those       decisions. So does a very large bet--economically and       politically--on the power of business tax cuts to deliver       rapid wage growth to United States workers.        There is also the appearance, to liberal critics in       particular, of Republicans seeking to reward their prized       constituencies first, while leaving others to bear the       consequences if their most optimistic scenarios do not play       out.        The tax plans have evolved rapidly since House leaders       first introduced their bill at the beginning of the month.       Amendments in the Ways and Means Committee restored some       cherished tax breaks that had been targeted for elimination,       including those for adoptive parents, and expanded the bill's       tax breaks for owners of businesses that are not organized as       traditional corporations.        The Senate bill differed from the House version when it was       introduced last week, and broke further away on Tuesday       night, with a package of amendments that included repealing       the Affordable Care Act's mandate that most individuals buy       health insurance. To comply with procedural rules that would       allow Republicans to pass the bill on a party-line vote in       the Senate, the amendment also set an expiration date--Dec.       25, 2025--on all the individual tax cuts in the legislation.        The plans also differ on their treatment of state and local       tax deductions. The Senate would kill them entirely. The       House would maintain them only for property taxes and cap the       deduction at $10,000 a year. Economists generally say that       those tax breaks are inefficient. But eliminating them, in       the context of the House bill, would add up to a large       geographic transfer of income, according to research by Carl       Davis, the research director of the Institute on Taxation and       Economic Policy in Washington.        The House bill would raise personal taxes on Californians       and New Yorkers by a combined $16 billion in 2027, Mr. Davis       found, while cutting personal taxes on Texans and Floridians       by more than $30 billion in total.        His analysis finds only one state that Mr. Trump carried in       2016 --Utah--would receive lower personal tax benefits under       the bill than would be expected, given its share of national       income, compared with 11 states won by his Democratic rival,       Hillary Clinton. The average Clinton state would receive 82       percent of its expected benefits, by share of national       income, under the plan. The average Trump state would receive       181 percent.        ``It's not unusual for a tax bill to have varying impacts       in different parts of the country,'' Mr. Davis said. ``But       the degree to which this bill makes winners and losers out of       different states is remarkable.''        Curtailing state and local deductions helps finance a core       feature of both the House and Senate bills, which happens to       be one of the few provisions Mr. Trump has called       nonnegotiable in tax discussions: cutting the corporate       income tax to a flat 20 percent rate, down from a top rate of       35 percent today. Republicans have kept those cuts permanent,       even as the Senate applied an expiration date to the       individual cuts and to a key tax credit for families in the       House bill. The Senate bill also sets an expiration date on       breaks for so-called pass-through businesses, whose owners       pay taxes on profits through the tax code for individuals.        In Washington, Republicans have stressed that cutting       corporate taxes will supercharge economic growth,       accelerating job creation and raising wages in the process.       By that theory, making such cuts permanent is essential.        The gamble is apparent. Polls show that voters want       corporations to pay higher, not lower, taxes and that they       doubt corporate rate cuts will show up in their own       paychecks, as the White House has claimed. Perhaps not       coincidentally, Republican leaders have pitched their bills       largely as middle-class tax cuts, stressing the benefits for       the typical American family during television appearances and       news conferences.        ``The policy expects that the corporate tax cuts will do       the most for growth,'' said Lanhee J. Chen, a research fellow       at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, who was the       policy director for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in       2012. ``On the other hand, they're the hardest to explain.''        It is an especially tricky explanation in the context of       the requests Republicans are making of individual taxpayers,       particularly the middle class, to trust that any benefits       they see from the bills will not vanish over a decade. The       Senate bill is scheduled to deliver an individual tax       increases on 137 million tax filers in 2027 if Congress does       not intervene first, according to calculations by Ernie       Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI. Liberals warn the       shock would be huge for low- and middle-income families.        Republicans are ``making a choice as to which elements of       their plan are permanent,'' said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior       adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a       former economic aide under President Barack Obama, ``and I       think it's worth starting with taking them at face value.''        Canceling those looming increases would further add to the       federal budget deficit, if the move is not paired with       spending cuts. Middle-class families planning ahead can       imagine two possible consequences from that decision: Either       an immediate increase in their taxes eight years from now, or       an explosion in federal budget deficits, which could       necessitate spending cuts to safety net programs like Social       Security and Medicare.        ``The bill reflects talking out of both sides of your mouth       at the same time--neither of  [[Page H9390]]       which is leading to good policy,'' said Maya MacGuineas, the       president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.        Republican leaders in both chambers have said that they       will not allow individual tax breaks to expire--and that       their corporate cuts will yield enough growth and additional       tax revenue to pay for themselves, or at least come close.       Ms. MacGuineas and others fear the opposite could be even       more likely: that growth will fall far short of those       optimistic projections, and when the expiring tax provisions       come up for reauthorization, budget deficits will be       swelling. The result, they say, would be more hard choices--      and predictable ones.                  Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore     Mr. Speaker, if it weren't bad enough, Mr. Speaker--and  I come over to this side for a reason: I have got many brothers and  sisters whom I love here--this is a terrible bill.   Unanimous consent here. The real price of this bill is hidden. $30  billion in interest on the debt every year. Who pays this?   If it weren't bad enough, the taxes that people have to pay today, as  well as our children and our grandchildren, but beyond that, the real  price of this bill is further hidden. The temporary family flexibility  credit expires after 5 years. The temporary exclusion for independent  care costs expires after 5 years.   Some have estimated that, if Republicans make these provisions  permanent, as they claim will happen in future Congresses, the costs of  the bill will increase to over $400 billion.   The Senate bill cuts off relief for families in 7 years. They are  hiding over $500 billion in costs.   I am particularly interested in the SALT exclusion as a deduction.  Folks in New Jersey, California, Maryland, New York, Connecticut, et  cetera, are going to be paying the costs of this deduction being  removed.   You can't make this up.   In fact, the increase mostly comes from eliminating the State and  local tax deduction for individuals, but corporations can continue to  deduct their State and local taxes. You can't, Mr. and Mrs. America.
