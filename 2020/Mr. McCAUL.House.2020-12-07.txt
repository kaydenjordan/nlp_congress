 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, all of us in this Chamber probably grew up with a mother  telling us to eat our vegetables. As a father myself, I have very  strong memories of chasing several of my children around the house,  trying to get healthy food into their mouths. That is because, as we  know, a child's growth and development is severely impacted when they  don't have proper nutrition.   Unfortunately, today, over 151 million children under the age of 5-- babies, really--suffer from chronic malnutrition. That is truly a  shocking and disturbing number. Over the last three decades, there has  been important progress to reduce chronic malnutrition around the  world, but, clearly, much more must be done.   That is why I am proud to be here today to offer my support for this  resolution, introduced by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall),  which calls for increased efforts to end maternal and child  malnutrition.   The United States has always been a leader when it comes to  addressing maternal and child malnutrition. We must continue our  leadership role in this important endeavor.   The USAID multi-sectoral nutrition strategy is an important effort to  ensure that nutrition interventions are effective in reaching the most  vulnerable populations.   I want to thank the chairman, and I want to thank my colleagues,  Representatives Marshall and McGovern, for leading this important  resolution and bringing this to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall), the sponsor of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to thank organizations like  Bread for the World, the Eleanor Crook Foundation, Catholic Relief  Services, and many others around the world. These are the people who  implement and advocate for these critical nutrition interventions.   As the world grapples with the impact of COVID-19, it is more  important than ever that we ramp up our fight to end chronic  malnutrition.   I have been proud to support this critical work, including advocating  for nutrition programs in annual appropriations bills. I look forward  to continuing to support these efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, over the last year, the world has watched as the Chinese  Communist Party has systematically destroyed the political freedoms  that were guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong under the British-Sino  treaty.   Hong Kongers are no longer allowed to exercise their rights of  freedom of speech, freedom of expression, or freedom to peacefully  assemble. Many protestors in Hong Kong have been beaten in the streets;  others have been arrested and thrown in jail without due process.   Last week, we learned Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong  was sentenced to 13 months in jail for simply demanding the freedoms he  was promised. Other activists like Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam were  sentenced to 10 months in jail as well.   This is the Chinese Communist Party showing its true colors as  enemies of freedom and brutal oppressors of its own people.   I have had the privilege to speak with Joshua Wong on several  occasions, including last year when he testified before our committee.  He is devoted to Hong Kong, to his people, and to democracy. The  Chinese Communist Party has jailed him for more than a year in what is  an appalling injustice.   It is no wonder that the Director of National Intelligence recently  wrote that the People's Republic of China poses the greatest threat to  America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom  worldwide since World War II. I couldn't agree more.   That is why I was proud to chair the China Task Force earlier this  year. And after months of classified and unclassified briefings, the  China Task Force released a report with 82 key findings and more than  400 recommendations, many of which are focused on what steps we should  take to help the people of Hong Kong, including providing support to  Hong Kong refugees fleeing the Chinese Communist Party persecution,  which this bill does.   The Hong Kong People's Freedom and Choice Act serves as a reminder to  the Chinese Communist Party that America stands with the people of Hong  Kong, and it will stand for freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, also, the sponsor of this bill, a  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Malinowski, for bringing  this bill forward here today. I urge my colleagues to join us in  support of this important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, at this point in time, I would like to take  a moment of personal privilege to honor my dear friend, the gentleman  from New York.   This may perhaps be our last time on the floor debating together. We  have become good friends over the last 2 years as chairman and ranking  member. I would argue that is the way it is supposed to be.   Chairman Engel often says, and I agree, that when it comes to foreign  policy, that partisanship stops at the water's edge. In fact, just last  year, RealClearPolitics described the Foreign Affairs Committee as an  island of calm in a sea of partisanship. An island of calm in a sea of  partisanship--I take that as a great compliment, and I know you should,  too.   No one embodies that more than our committee chairman, Eliot Engel. I  am honored to call him my friend.   Anyone who has ever worked with Chairman Engel, or just even had the  opportunity to meet him, knows that he is truly a gentleman in every  sense of the word. He always puts civility first, and he values public  service and honor above everything else.   But not everyone knows that the man has got a great sense of humor.  He is one of the funniest guys I know.                                time  1315    And that is why if you watch videos of us in the Foreign Affairs  Committee on the dais, you will often see him lean over and whisper  something to me, and I couldn't help but respond with laughter. And I  have shared that sense of humor with him over the last 2 years.   Perhaps one of the fondest memories I have, Mr. Speaker, is traveling  to Normandy on the 75th anniversary of D-day to see our D-day veterans,  ones like my father, who fought in World War II as part of the D-day  air campaign, to see those brave patriots who crushed and destroyed the  evils of Nazi Germany.   Now, for those of you who may not know, there is a younger picture of  Eliot that really looks just like one of the Beatles, and that would be  John Lennon. And I was thinking about blowing it up and putting it on  the floor, but I wanted to save you that. But it is not a bad looking  picture.   So when we were on this codel, we decided, you know what, we are  going to break away from the pack and have our own private dinner at Le  Meurice in Paris. And I bought this really cool pair of sunglasses.  They had to be readers, but they were sunglasses, and maybe for a guy  from Texas they were a little too funky, but then when I looked at  Eliot and that John Lennon look, I handed the glasses to Eliot, he put  them on, and he looked absolutely fantastic in those glasses. So I  said, Eliot, you can have those glasses. And it always charms me when  he puts those glasses on sometimes at a committee hearing.   But no matter where he goes, Eliot is always the one to lighten the  mood and make people feel more at ease. And that is really his way. He  wants people to know that they are heard and that he is in their  corner.   I will never forget the trip we took to the Colombia-Venezuela border  at the height of the humanitarian crisis. We saw firsthand the six  million people who fled the corrupt Maduro regime and the fallout that  it caused. It was truly the worst humanitarian and refugee crisis  facing the Western Hemisphere.   Eliot and I knew that something needed to be done, and as a result we  introduced the United States-Northern Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act,  which aimed to curb illegal migration, spur economic development, and  combat corruption in the area.   And not long after that, we introduced the bipartisan Global  Fragility Act to improve the way the United States deals with fragile  nations. And I am proud to say this bipartisan bill was signed into law  last year.   Both of these legislative achievements are aimed at helping people  who need it the most because that is who Chairman Engel truly is.   He sees this very large world that we live in and immediately wants  to come to the aid of those who are suffering, those who are sick, and  those who are needing a helping hand.   Under Chairman Engel's leadership on issues like these he has played  a pivotal role in shaping United States foreign policy. The world is  and will continue to be a more stable and secure place because of him.   In light of these accomplishments and so much more, I found it only  fitting to name this year's State Department Authorization Act after  the chairman, and I am proud to say the Eliot Engel State Department  Act passed the House last year.   You know, most people could not imagine a Democrat from the Bronx and  a Republican from the heart of Texas could not only work so well  together, but that we would become best of friends, especially not in a  town that is so often divided by politics.   But Mr. Engel and I decided early on from the start that we could  achieve more if we focused on the things we agreed on than the things  we didn't agree on. And the fact is, we agree on 95 percent of foreign  policy issues and it is through our friendship that we have been able  to accomplish so much.   I would say that serving with Chairman Engel has truly been a  highlight of my political and professional career on the Hill. I know  that wherever he goes next and wherever his lovely wife, Pat, and he go  next that he will continue to serve our country honorably.   For his decades of service to this country, for his unwavering  support for Israel and his long opposition to the Ayatollah in Iran and  his long list of policy achievements, I believe that I speak for all of  us here in the Chamber and all of us in the House when I say, ``Thank  you, sir. Thank you for your service.'' It has been an honor.   Your legacy of pursuing bipartisanship policy solutions that  strengthen our country will live on for years to come, and I hope it  will be a role model for future committees and chairmen  [[Page H6877]]  and ranking members as to how to work together to get good things done  for the American people because that is what most Americans care about.  They don't care about our political stripes; they want to know: What  are you doing for the American people? And we have shown and led by  example.   It is going to be hard for me to watch you, Mr. Chairman, leave this  Chamber. You are my favorite chairman. But there is so much to  celebrate with your time in Congress and the legacy that you will leave  behind. So from the bottom of my heart to my dear friend, Chairman  Engel, and to your wonderful wife Pat, who I have gotten to know over  the years, who is a beautiful, precious woman, let me just say that  both of you will truly be missed. We will miss you, but we know you are  not going to be far away. And we know that you will be there in the  future. And I look forward to working with you in your future position,  which we discussed over dinner last Saturday night with Ed Royce, as  well, your other dear friend, who has my utmost respect.   I would say this: Sometimes you have respect for a chairman because  you fear them. We have respect for you because we admire you because  you are an honest, decent man, and you are a true leader. You lead by  example, and people want to follow a good man like that. You are a good  man, Mr. Chairman, and it has been a great experience the time we have  had together.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, we can no longer deny the Chinese Communist Party is an  enemy of democracy and a threat to international security and to  freedom.   Nowhere is that more clear than in Hong Kong.   We cannot turn a blind eye to the CCP's brutal crackdown on freedom  and democracy there.   That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Hong  Kong People's Freedom and Choice Act.   With this legislation, we have the opportunity to assist the freedom- loving people of Hong Kong and to remind the world the United States of  America stands with anyone who stands for freedom.   I thank my friends and colleagues, Congressmen Malinowski and  Kinzinger and, most importantly, the chairman, Chairman Engel, for  their hard work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
