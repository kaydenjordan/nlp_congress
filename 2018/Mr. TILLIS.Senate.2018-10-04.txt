 Mr. President, I know that the Presiding Officer has been  present in the Chair a few times when I have given this speech. It is  not a prepared speech. It is an update on a travesty of justice that is  continuing in Turkey.   Today is October 4. On October 7, 2016, a man named Andrew Brunson, a  Presbyterian minister from my State of North Carolina, up near Black  Mountain, was arrested by Turkish authorities.   Pastor Brunson has been a missionary in Turkey for about 20 years. In  2016, there was an illegal coup attempt. The people associated with it  should go to prison because there should not be violent changes of  power in nations. They have an election process, and they should honor  it. I have no problem when there is evidence of people who have been  associated with an illegal coup going to prison, but I have a real  problem with a man who for the last 2 years has been in a Turkish  prison and went 19 months without an indictment. He was held without  charges for 19 months. Over the last couple of months, we finally got  him into house arrest.   Then they put together an indictment that is truly something that I  don't think could keep someone in an American jail overnight. I read it  and felt so strongly about it that I decided to go to Turkey and be in  the courtroom for 16 hours when he sat through his nearly 12-hour  hearing.   I was in that courtroom for the whole time, a courtroom just outside  of Izmir. It was the second time I was there. I was there 2 months  earlier to visit him in prison and to let him know that the U.S. Senate  and the U.S. Congress knows he is there and we are not going to forget  him. We had nearly 70 Senators sign on to a letter to that effect.   The reason I do this speech is to remind the American people about  Pastor Brunson and to remind them about other Americans and Turkish- Americans who are in prison, suggesting that they were a part of trying  to overthrow President Erdogan's government.   It will be 2 years on the 7th of this month. That is 727 days that he  has been held in prison.   But what I want to talk about is kind of related to a subject we are  discussing on the floor in another matter, and that is unsubstantiated  allegations. This man has over 11 unsubstantiated allegations. What  does that mean?   Somebody says: I saw somebody do this.   Yet they produce nobody else that can actually corroborate it, in  other words, saying: Yes, I remember that happening; I agree with that  testimony.   There were 11 different allegations. Many of the people who testified  wouldn't even show their faces. They were on a video screen with  digital blocking and with their voices hidden. Some of them we now know  are in Turkish prisons themselves.   None of the allegations have been corroborated by a single person.  Yet this American, this man who was bringing the word of God to the  people who wanted to hear it--he wasn't forcing it on them; he was  asking them into the church if they wanted to sit through a service on  a Sunday or during the week--was put in prison. He was put in prison  for allegations.   One person who is also in prison said that one night they saw a light  on up in the upstairs part of this very small church. It only fits  about 100 people, and there is a little office upstairs. There was a  light on for 4 hours, and, therefore, something bad must have been  happening in there.   There is another real problem with that allegation. It turns out that  when I went to Izmir and to that church, there is no window in that  upstairs room. Yet that is an unsubstantiated allegation that has  landed this man in prison and subjected him to a possible 35-year  prison sentence in Turkey.   Another was a media post by his daughter, who ate a meal that the  Turkish authorities said is a meal that is commonly eaten by terrorist  organizations and so, therefore, she must be associated with that  organization. That is the level of the allegation. In fact, it is one  the more popular dishes enjoyed by many people--Kurds, Turks, and a  number of people in the Middle East--but those are the unsubstantiated  allegations that have kept this man in prison for 2 years and could  potentially keep him in prison for 35 years.   He is coming up on his final court date, where they will either  release him or imprison him.   I want to thank President Trump for making this a priority. I want to  thank Secretary of State Pompeo for making this a priority. I want to  thank my colleagues, including the Presiding Officer, who voted on a  provision in the National Defense Authorization Act that says: Turkey,  if you go down this path, there will be consequences. If you go down  this path, you may not see the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ever on  Turkish territory. We may have to rethink the supply chain that runs  through Turkey to build the F-35. We may actually have to take  additional measures.   I am watching them. Right now, I am trying to show them respect and  hope that they do the right thing, but I want Pastor Brunson and his  wife Norine and all of the people who belong to his church--the same  church that the Reverend Billy Graham was associated with--to know that  if justice is not served, then, we will continue to put the pressure on  Turkey in any way that I can for as long as I am a U.S. Senator.   Tonight I would just ask anybody watching this on C-Span and all of  my colleagues to just pray for Pastor Brunson, to pray for his release.  I hope that I don't have to come to you for additional support to  remind Turkey that our American justice system would never put a  Turkish person in prison and our NATO ally should understand that we  want him treated with respect and their very strong partner, the United  States of America, treated with respect.
