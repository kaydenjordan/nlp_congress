 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her  leadership on this Special Order.   I think the message is getting through to the American people: 24  million of us are about to lose health care if this legislation goes  through.   In my home State of Maryland, 375,000 people are estimated to be on  the chopping block in terms of their health insurance. In my district,  the Eighth Congressional District--Montgomery, Frederick, and Carroll  Counties--we could have 75,000 or 80,000 people lose their health care.   We were able to cut the uninsured rate in half with passage of the  Affordable Care Act 7 years ago, and now they want to turn the clock  back and take us in exactly the wrong direction.   If a foreign power like Russia, for example, tried to throw 24  million Americans off of their health care, we would consider it an act  of sabotage, aggression, and war, but this is something that is  happening inside the country. Nobody knows why they want to do that to  older people with this age tax, why they want to do it to children, to  people who have special health needs, to the sick.   It is also getting through that there is going to be $600 billion  that travels upwards in America through a tax break to the wealthiest  Americans. That is $600 billion that is moving upwards. This is not a  healthcare plan, primarily. It is a wealth transfer plan, while we toss  millions of our co-citizens to the curbside.   Seven years ago, we passed the Affordable Care Act. Millions of  Americans have gotten health care for the first time, dramatically  improving public health in lots of different ways, making sure that  people could not be denied insurance coverage because of a preexisting  condition, making sure that people in their twenties could stay on  their parents' plan, ending lifetime insurance limits, ending annual  limits, requiring insurance plans to pay for preventive services like  flu shots and cancer screenings and mammograms, dramatically improving  the public health. This has been a great success.   Tom Paine once said you cannot ``make a man unknow his knowledge, or  unthink his thoughts.'' The American people know that we have made  dramatic progress under the Affordable Care Act. We need to be moving  more in the direction of covering more people and improving quality and  reducing people's premiums and copays and deductibles.   This legislation, the repeal nightmare, goes in exactly the wrong  direction. It jacks up everybody's premiums, increases the copays and  [[Page H2339]]  deductibles, while throwing millions of people to the sidelines.                                time  1700    I want to make one final point, which is the message has gotten  through. The public opinion polls are showing that the American people  are turning sharply against this terrible repeal plan, which means here  in Congress the organizers of the plan are getting increasingly  desperate, and they are making deals.   One of the deals that they have made with some upstate Republicans  apparently is colloquially known around here as the Buffalo bribe or  the Kinderhook kickback or the Hudson hustle. Someone called it today  the Empire State enticement or simply Niagara calls.   There are some Republicans in upstate New York who are very nervous  about voting for this bill, so what they have extracted is a promise, a  very special provision that doesn't apply to the other 49 States. It  applies only in New York, and it would say that New York State alone  cannot assess its counties to participate financially in the Medicaid  system. There are lots of other States that do it, but only New York  could not do it. It could not assess the counties, except it could  assess any jurisdiction with more than 5 million people.   Gee, what do you think that is? Maybe New York City.   Now, the problem with this other than it being sordid and unseemly-- this Buffalo bribery, this Hudson hustle--is that it is  unconstitutional because the Federal Government can try to persuade  States to do something by offering money, but it cannot extract a  concession through coercion, and it cannot treat one State differently  from every other State. It violates the principle of equal sovereignty.   I would just say, Congresswoman Jayapal, this legislation is not only  reactionary, taking us back to a past nobody wants to go back to, and  not only dangerous, but it is also unconstitutional because of the  Buffalo bribe that is built into it.
