 Mr. Speaker, I do thank my friend from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall) for his able presentation on this very good bill and our  colleague, Mr. Smith.   I am sorry to change the subject back to something that is relevant,  material, and germane. By the way, I am also looking forward to the  investigation into Russia and the sale of such a huge percentage of our  uranium by Hillary Clinton's State Department. They approved it. But we  will get into that later.   Right now we are talking about a fantastic bill because the EPA is  very close to being omniscient, omnipotent, and ubiquitous--they are  everywhere all the time. We have had a hard time in the last 20, 30  years as it got more and more heavenly in getting information on why  they were making the decisions they were. As the EPA has continued to  crush jobs, like in Texas if there were no EPA, we have agencies that  have continued to make our water and air cleaner and cleaner every  year, and, despite the EPA's constant interference, they are doing a  great job.   But one of the things that we have wanted, as my friend, Mr. Woodall,  was pointing out for years, is whether it is a Democrat in the White  House or a Republican, we just wanted some openness. We wanted to know  what these seemingly arbitrary rules were based upon. So the purpose of  this rule coming from Chairman Smith is let's go ahead and require the  EPA to do what anybody would have to do in one of our courtrooms, you  got to show why there is a reason to take action.   But since the EPA has been at this level where they were basically  unquestionable for so long and could make arbitrary and capricious  decisions which could not be challenged effectively, this may be a very  helpful start to stopping the EPA from being so heavenly they are not  earthly good.   So I think it is a fantastic bill. It is something I hope will be a  bipartisan vote as we require the EPA to just show the basis of what  you are doing, and then we can know whether this American god, this  EPA, actually has feet of clay or is back in the real world or is  actually killing jobs unnecessarily.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to my friend, the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).   Honoring the Dedicated Service and Selfless Sacrifice of Sergeant First                          Class Robert R. Boniface     Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank my friend from Florida  for such a compelling tribute to a great American hero.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson).                               Welfare BRAC Act     Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting few weeks here  in Washington, and we are not done with healthcare legislation. There  has been a lot of talk about that, but, Mr. Speaker, I would like to  say, I have been encouraged as today has worn on. We had a tough family  meeting this morning together as Republicans, but, to me, what I felt  was coming out of it in the end--disagreement on some important issues  but agreement among Republicans that people are hurting under  ObamaCare.   People need relief from the high premiums, the high deductibles. So  many people not only lost their doctor, lost their health insurance  policy, but they can't afford--they tell us--to go to the doctors. We  talked to constituents because they would have to get to several  thousand dollars before the insurance portion would kick in.   People are hurting across the country, and, of course, we know that,  without a single Republican vote, ObamaCare was passed, which cut  Medicare by $716 billion dollars, with a ``B.'' And I know President  Obama assured seniors: look, seniors, you know, you are not going to  have to worry about this $716 billion in cuts to Medicare. You won't be  able to tell the difference. This is only going to affect the doctors,  the healthcare providers.   What seniors have noticed who I have talked to around Texas and in  other places in the country, they have noticed that when Medicare  doesn't pay their doctor, doesn't pay for tests that are needed, and  doesn't pay for medication that they specifically need then it does  affect them personally.                                time  1915    The bill that we took up, that didn't get passed on Friday, that we  didn't vote on, there was nothing that was going to help those on  Medicare. There is apparently some difference of opinion, but it  appeared to many that some of us trusted that people between the ages  of 50 to 64 were going to get hammered.   I am very encouraged to have seen Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader  McCarthy, Whip Steve Scalise, and our Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry  incredibly busy today talking to Republican Members around the House  about how we can get to a bill that will get 218--actually we need 216  right now--so that we can send it down the hall to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged, and I hope others are, that we are not  done. We had indications that the Senate was not going to take up the  bill--even if we passed it on Friday, they were not going to take it up  until sometime in May. So we have time to address this issue and come  together on a bill that would pass.   Once again, a reference was made, Mr. Speaker--and it is so often  that this event is referenced by Republicans when they get frustrated  as to why we ended up with a bill that would require so many Republican  arms to be twisted, that would endanger Republican seats to have to  vote for it. People referenced back to this.   Remember some years back, some summers back--and I believe, actually,  that was the last week of July of 2014, as I recall--in which Speaker  Boehner had told us that he had cobbled together a bill that embraced  10 principles that every Republican in the House had agreed to. Some of  them seemed a bit esoteric to me, but we agreed to them all. And we  kept being told this is going to be a bill that embraces all the  principles that all of us have agreed to.   So when the bill was finally filed on Tuesday evening, with Speaker  Boehner having announced we were going to vote on it Thursday morning,  for the first time, we got a look at the bill we were going to be  voting on. By the time Thursday morning came rolling around, there had  been so much information that came out--not opinion, but actually  verbiage from the bill. It seems like it was around 60 pages, 70  [[Page H2512]]  pages, somewhere around there--but people were able to see for  themselves what was there. There was so much commotion made about it  that, by Thursday morning, much like Friday, Republicans made clear to  our leadership--at that time Speaker Boehner--that they couldn't vote  for it; that it didn't embody the 10 principles that we had all  embraced.   I was so proud of my Republican Conference that Thursday because  particularly a number of young Members, newer Members, got up in our  emergency conference that they asked for. Speaker Boehner said: Well, I  guess we just go on home and have the August recess.   Numerous Members said: No; let's have an emergency conference. Let's  talk about this. We need to do something. We need to pass a good bill.   So people got up and they pointed out, like in a good family: Look,  we have got differences, but we can reach agreement on this.   And there were probably 20 or so of us in a room for 2\1/2\ hours or  so, and we compromised, and we got a bill that we could all vote on.   Unfortunately, at that time, there was a Democratic majority in the  Senate, and we didn't get our bill passed through the Senate, but we  showed that it could be done.   Once again, after Friday's problems, there are Members that are  saying: Remember when we did that, where we just got people in a room  and we agreed?   Mr. Speaker, I do believe, knowing so many of the Tuesday Group so  well--they are good people--and the number one concern they have is  their constituents and the things they are hearing from their  constituents because they ran and they got elected to help people.   Everybody that I hear from on our side understands people have got to  have help because ObamaCare is creating so many problems. I am hearing  from many seniors, and it seems to be as a result of all of the $700- plus billion that Obama cut from Medicare.   Whereas, 7 or 8 years ago, even 6 years ago, before ObamaCare really  started being implemented, if they needed surgery, if they needed  something, under Medicare, the doctors immediately took care of it. If  it was medication, if it was a treatment, if it was surgery, whatever,  they took care of it.   I am hearing more and more east Texans who are on Medicare tell me:  Now, doctors are telling me they can't schedule it this week or next  week like they used to because of ObamaCare; that the only way they can  make ends meet and still stay in business, they need to schedule it a  couple of months down the road.   Many of us on the Republican side were pointing out, when ObamaCare  passed, that what this leads to is a form of rationed care. Whereas,  right now, if you have good insurance and you like your doctor and you  need something done, it gets done immediately. That is what made  America's medical care so attractive to other countries around the  world.   I have visited in Middle Eastern and north African countries where  the wealthy would say: If I needed surgery done, I'd fly to the United  States. Unfortunately, I have heard more than once that: Yeah, and the  great thing was that I flew back and never had to pay for it.   Well, somebody paid for that, that is for sure.   It is important that we fix our healthcare system as best we can. I  have an article from Conservative Review that came out today from  Daniel Horowitz. I don't agree with everything in the article; but  Daniel Horowitz, as usual, is quite thought-provoking.   He says: ``Earlier today, a couple of Republican officials, in a  refreshing display of honesty, admitted what we have known all along:  They don't want to repeal ObamaCare. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, admitted there won't be another  attempt.   ``He's certainly come a long way from his 2014 campaign promise to  repeal ObamaCare `root and branch' and his 2013 CPAC speech in which he  said `anybody who thinks we've moved beyond it is dead wrong.'   ``As we explained yesterday, the compromise solution for repealing  the core of ObamaCare, but not quite all of it, is already on the  table, and Paul Ryan, Republican from Wisconsin, has already agreed to  and campaigned on it. Why aren't they doing it? Because they don't want  to repeal ObamaCare and never intended to.''   That is the part I do disagree with.   I know we have all said this, but it was in Speaker Boehner's pledge  that he and his leadership colleagues cobbled together back in 2010 and  it was in the Better Way that Speaker Ryan and his leadership  colleagues cobbled together last fall that we have got to repeal  ObamaCare. We can't get down to this rationed care system where we are  currently headed.   This says: ``As early as 2014, the Chamber of Commerce made it clear  that their official position was to fix, not repeal ObamaCare. Money  talks, everything else from there walks.   ``The sentiment was evident today when Senator John Cornyn,  Republican from Texas, the Senate majority whip, said that they will no  longer pursue repeal of ObamaCare through budget reconciliation and  that `it needs to be done on a bipartisan basis, and so we're happy to  work on it with Democrats if we can find any who are willing to do so.'   ``There you have it, folks. They know darn well there are no  Democrats who will ever have incentive to work with them to repeal  ObamaCare. They have always known that this had to be done unilaterally  either through reconciliation or by blowing up the filibuster. But  Republicans never intended to do so. That's why we heard all these  phony excuses about process limitations. Now that they are proven  false, Cornyn is at least being honest by saying they will repeal it  when Democrats help them. When hell freezes over . . .''   And the article goes on.   Mr. Speaker, what Leader McConnell and Senator Cornyn are talking  about, I think they must have been discouraged when the House didn't  pass a bill that would come their way. But good news for Leader  McConnell and Senator Cornyn, we are not done. People are hurting, and  we are going to come together on a bill.   For those who attempted to say that those in the Freedom Caucus kept  moving the goalposts, I know that was not said maliciously, but it was  said. Anyone who said that was speaking just out of ignorance of what  actually was the case.   Anybody that bothers to actually check and get the facts will find  that, as many problems as people in the Freedom Caucus--and I am  probably the newest member, I guess--had with this bill, we were doing  what we could to reach a compromise that would give enough help, enough  relief to Americans who are desperate for that help and that relief  that we could hold our nose and vote for it.   There were all kinds of issues in that bill that create problems. For  one thing, I would have thought a good amendment that would easily be  accepted would be that, since this creates a new entitlement program, a  tax credit program where you actually can get more money back--like a  child tax credit, where we have so many people who are actually  illegally in the country, claiming children, as there have been  reports--and, of course, not everybody cheats on this. But there are  numerous examples of stories around the country of people claiming to  have children--mass numbers, dozens of them in the same house, and we  don't know if they are in the country, we don't know if they are in  another country, we don't know if they exist--and people getting more  and more money back.   I had a senior citizen from Tyler telling me she is no longer working  for H&R Block, that she used to during tax season. But it just grated  on her so much that it created tension headaches and she couldn't sleep  during tax season because she had so many people who did not have a  Social Security number. But they got a tax number, and she would fill  out the returns for them. Invariably, each would pull out a sheet of  paper and would say: Don't I get this?   And it was the income tax credit--child earned credit.   She would fill it out, as they requested. And, invariably, they would  get much more money back than they paid in. So it was a way of  redistributing--it is not wealth, because the people that are in east  Texas paying  [[Page H2513]]  those taxes, they are not wealthy. They are struggling to get by. That  is why they can't afford the high deductibles that ObamaCare has driven  them to.   Here it looks like we are going to have another program unless we get  this amendment in there when we bring the bill back up.                                time  1930    So I am hoping that that will be one of the adjustments because we  were seeking to have something in there to require you to be legally in  this country before you could get more money back from your income tax  than you paid in. It is a new form of welfare, just like some have  found the tax credit to be, where they get more back than they paid in.   So that is a concern, creating a new entitlement as we are about to  go over the $20 trillion mark in debt, that we are coming up with a new  way to go even deeper and quicker into further debt. But there were a  number of issues here with the bill.   The thing that I kept hearing--and I had telephone townhalls, Mr.  Speaker, with, really, tens of thousands of people that we reached out  to in east Texas. The technology is so great, I can ask questions and  have them punch a number for yes, no, and get results on what people  are thinking. It was feelings about ObamaCare and the need to do  something about it and the help that is needed and the losses of  insurance they had before ObamaCare, problems they have had since  ObamaCare.   East Texans, my constituents, need help. They want help. They want  ObamaCare repealed, and they want a system back where they can choose  their doctor, they have a relationship with their doctor, and they  don't have an insurance company between them and their doctor or their  hospital telling them what they can or can't have. And they don't want  the government in between them and their healthcare provider telling  them what they can or cannot have.   The health savings accounts that Republicans believe strongly could  get us off this final road to complete rationed care, socialized  medicine, like they have in England--it was a pleasure to talk to the  sister of a member of Parliament from England. I have been in his home  in England; he has been in my home in Tyler, Texas, just a great MP.   But talking about our systems, and I pointed out, I have a wife, I  have got three adult daughters, and so I am kind of sensitive to being  pushed into a system like England has, no offense to those in England.  But when we saw the numbers back during the ObamaCare debate that  indicated a 19 percent higher survivability rate from the same point of  breast cancer being discovered, well, that is one out of five are dying  in England unnecessarily, or at least back there when we got those  numbers. I am not sure what the numbers are now.   It may be that ObamaCare has created more problems and now we are  moving, already, toward the percentages of recovery that England had  that were not as good as ours. But I would just as soon not lose one  out of five women who have breast cancer, which we were not losing in  the U.S. and they were losing in England.   It was interesting. I didn't realize, and I learned yesterday that,  actually, that is why, in England, yes, they have socialized medicine,  but you can also pay for private care on top of the socialized medicine  because it just takes forever to get the kind of treatment that you  need when you need it. So people with any means in England, they have  the socialized medicine that is so inefficient, that tax funds pay for  so inefficiently, and you get as much government as you do health care.  But, if you have money, then, on top of the massive taxes you pay, you  can also, then, pay for your own health care on top of that. That is  different from Canada.   But, look, the bottom line is we don't need to continue down this  route. So, again, I am encouraged we are going to come together and we  are going to work toward a remedy.   It disturbed me that we heard from people who sounded like they knew  what they were talking about, that rates are going to go up for a  couple of years, and we are hoping that maybe 3 years after the  Republicans would lose the majority in the next election because people  are so upset about their higher premiums that then it might come down,  premiums might come down 10 percent.   But the concern to me is not about losing the majority. It is about  losing Americans unnecessarily if we don't fix this disastrous  ObamaCare that is costing seniors. It is costing 50- to 64-year-olds.  It is costing young people money that they shouldn't have to spend in  the way that they are being required.   So some say we were moving the goalposts as the House Freedom Caucus,  but, actually, from the beginning, we did indicate we would like to  remove what experts are telling us in title I would dramatically bring  down the cost of premiums very quickly--very quickly.   But we had agreed. Heck, we agreed with the Democrats, before they  pushed through ObamaCare, let's work on a law together, bipartisan,  that will make sure that insurance companies can't play games over  preexisting conditions because it has resulted in unfairness and, at  times, I can say as a former judge, actually, fraud. Let's work on that  one.   Then I think there was fairly universal agreement on both sides of  the aisle here that, if you are 26, you are still living with your  parents, then you ought to be able to be on their health insurance.  From my standpoint, I didn't even care. I didn't think we actually even  needed an age, a cutoff age.   If you are 50 and you are still living with your parents, which we  hope will soon be remedied by an economy turning around with a new  President who knows how to get things going, but if you are still at  home when you are 50, I don't have a problem. If you are still living  with your parents, then you ought to be able to have a family insurance  policy and be on it. So those were not problems.   I had a doctor friend back in east Texas who said I was a purist. I  like him. He is a great guy. He apparently was a great surgeon. But I  realized that, in his letter, he was speaking from a great deal of  ignorance as he continued to point out things that simply weren't true,  unless a purist is someone who says: Okay. Okay. I will vote for the  bill, but you have got to give us something in the way of amendments to  this bill that will help my constituents bring down the price.   Now, see, to me, that is not a purist because we were all willing to  compromise in the Freedom Caucus. Actually, in communicating with  President Trump two different times, we thought we had an agreement.  Then we would hear back from our leadership: No. No. You can't do that.  Either there is a problem with the Parliamentarian and it puts the  whole bill at risk, or, gee, you are going to lose votes from some  other group.    But I still believe, as I did then, if we would get the  intermediaries out of the way, that Republicans can come together,  Tuesday, more moderate group, Freedom Caucus. We can get people  together like we did 3 years ago in July. We can get together and work  out a compromise.   Now, to me, someone who agrees twice to a compromise that really  bothers them is not the purist that I would expect, but then again, I  guess it depends on your own personhood as to what you think is pure  and what you think is not.   So, anyway, I appreciate very much, Mr. Speaker, the former Speaker,  Newt Gingrich, pointing out yesterday that it is a good thing that this  bill did not pass on Friday because we know, as Speaker Gingrich  pointed out, in 1994, Democrats lost the majority in this room because  they tried to push through HillaryCare. We know that in 2010, Democrats  lost the majority in this room because they had pushed through  ObamaCare against the majority will of the American people.   As former Speaker Gingrich pointed out, if we had rammed through this  bill and, for example, people didn't see premiums come down before the  next election, we would justifiably lose the majority in this House,  and there are some good people that are serving here that should not be  defeated. They are doing the best they can.   But we can do better than where the bill stood on Friday, and I am  very grateful to Speaker Ryan, to leader McCarthy, our whip, for  working so hard today, reaching out, seeing them all over the place  trying to work, talking with different ones of us. It is really  encouraging, and I would hope, in  [[Page H2514]]  the future, that we will start those things, we will--yes, we  appreciate all the listening sessions, but then, as happened too often  under Speaker Boehner, somebody, we don't even know who--there were a  couple of things that made me wonder: Who wrote this? Is this the  insurance lobby? Where did this come from?   But bring the bill out and let us see it instead of telling every  Republican: It is going to go through committee; and Democrats are  going to have a million amendments and we have got to vote down every  one of them; we don't want any Republican amendments; we are going to  take it like it is.   Well, see, to some of us, that is not really regular order. Regular  order is a chance to have amendments, and especially from people in the  majority who see real problems with the bill.   So we can do that, and I look forward to doing that. And since we  knew the Senate wasn't going to take it up until May sometime anyway,  we have got time to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I hope you felt the same as I did hearing all across our  Conference, people saying, look, this is important enough. We are going  to have time where we go back to our districts between now and the  middle of May when the Senate might take this bill up.   Let's make sure we don't go on recess, go back to our districts to  have people scream at us because we hadn't passed something. Let's stay  here, and let's get it done like we did 3 years ago on the border  security bill.   But we have got a lot of work to do. There are serious problems with  the bill. But we also now know, despite what some have represented,  that, gee, we can't know what the Parliamentarians would say or  recommend. It is great to know that the Parliamentarian in the Senate,  actually, Assistant Parliamentarians work a great deal like our  splendid Parliamentarian here.   If you are getting ready to file a bill or if you are thinking about  an amendment, you can actually go to any one of our Parliamentarian or  assistants, show them the language. They can't give an obligatory  ruling, and they generally tell us when they advise us: This is what I  think, how the rule would apply there, and you may want to tweak this  or that.   They always have the caveat: But remember, I am the Parliamentarian.  I don't rule on anything. All I would do, if I am allowed, or it is  requested, I will whisper in the ear of the presiding--which, in the  Senate, hopefully, would be Vice President Pence.   And, gee, the Byrd Rule is not that complicated. When you are under  reconciliation, it needs to be about the budget. So, if anything that  is amended or added to or part of the bill will materially affect the  budget, it survives the Byrd Rule and it stays in. That is it.   The word in the Byrd Rule is ``incidental.'' It can't be just  incidental or have an incidental effect on the budget. It has got to  have a material effect; otherwise, it is considered extraneous.   Well, I would hope, knowing my friend, a former Member of the House  here, former Conference chair, now Vice President, I would hope and  certainly imagine if our friend, the Vice President, is in the  presiding officer's chair in the Senate and a Democratic Senator stands  up and says, ``I make a point of order because I believe this violates  the Byrd Rule, where the House inserted a provision, you have to show  that you are you lawfully in the U.S. in order to get the tax credit,''  well, there may be people that are so used to massive numbers here in  Washington that they would say, well, those millions or tens or  hundreds of millions, that may not be material, that may be only  incidental.                                time  1945    I hope my friend, my Vice President, would understand that, to  Americans, the kind of money we would be talking about is hard-earned  and it is material to the budget. So what happens if the Vice President  then rules--who is the President of the Senate--well, your point of  order is overruled, it is not appropriate, it doesn't violate the Byrd  rule. Well, then that same Democrat or another could jump up and say: I  appeal the ruling of the char.   Then what happens?   Normally, a Republican would stand and move to table the appeal of  the ruling of the Chair. And then there are far more than enough  Republicans to vote to table the appeal of the ruling of the Chair,  which means the ruling stands, nothing is fatal, and we get closer to a  repeal of ObamaCare. Even more important than that, we get closer to  giving our constituents the help they really need.   So it has been a long few weeks. It was a very long conference, but I  am encouraged, Mr. Speaker. I hope that Americans end up encouraged. I  am glad the bill didn't pass on Friday just as I was 3 years ago when  the original de facto amnesty bill that Speaker Boehner tried to shove  through. I think we can get to a good bill. I am looking forward to  seeing that happen and working with my friends here to get it done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 47 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, March 29, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
