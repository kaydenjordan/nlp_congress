 Madam Speaker, it is with deep sadness that I stand  before you to share the passing of one of Hawaii's most beloved  individuals, my friend and mentor, Dr. Noa Emmett Aluli.   Uncle Emmett, as many affectionately called him, dedicated his life  to the health and well-being of Native Hawaiians.   He graduated from the University of Hawaii and later opened and  practiced at Molokai Family Health Center and Clinic. He helped draft  the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act that was signed into  law in 1988 to improve the health status of Native Hawaiians and  cofounded Na Pu'uwai, the Native Hawaiian Health Care System that  serves the island of Molokai.   Dr. Aluli also served as a member of the Second Congressional  District's Native Hawaiian Health Task Force, helping set Federal  policies to advance Native Hawaiian healthcare.   Uncle Emmett leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of the people of  Hawaii, and his contributions will be felt for generations. He will be  greatly missed by his family and his beloved people of Molokai.                            ____________________
