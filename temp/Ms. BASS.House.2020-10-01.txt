SEC. 14. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I worked with Representatives Katherine Clark and Brenda  Lawrence, along with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Guy  Reschenthaler and Debbie Lesko, to introduce the bipartisan H.R. 7718,  Protecting the Health and Wellness of Babies and Pregnant Women in  Custody Act, which will improve the prenatal and postpartum care women  receive while in BOP custody and provides additional funding for States  to do the same.   Since the early 1980s, the number of women in Federal and State  custody has increased by 700 percent. Women are the fastest growing  segment of the incarcerated population, and women are incarcerated  mainly for nonviolent offenses. Over 60 percent of women in prison are  mothers with children under the age of 18.   The purpose of this bill is to take a comprehensive look at how women  are cared for while in custody. This bill addresses a series of health- related concerns raised by women in custody as well as the American  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.   This bill would require that once a determination that a woman is  pregnant is made, that her doctor devise a plan that would allow for  reasonable accommodations for her care while in custody. This plan  would be provided to the warden of each prison.   The plan would take into account a woman's individual healthcare  needs during pregnancy and postpartum, which includes access to  healthcare professionals, such as OB/GYNs, nurses, doulas, and  midwives, to address the conditions in prison that, if modified, would  significantly improve her chances of having a healthy pregnancy.   Reasonable accommodations include food and nutrition and access to  nutritious food. According to healthcare professionals, good maternal  nutrition can contribute positively to the delivery of a healthy  newborn of an appropriate weight.   We have heard stories of women who are incarcerated given an  additional peanut butter and jelly sandwich to address their  nutritional needs. This is obviously not adequate for a woman who is  pregnant.   Another accommodation is transferring a woman from a top bunk to a  lower bunk, as pregnant women are at high risk for falls, and falls are  dangerous for pregnancies. In addition, women who are pregnant need  access to bathrooms and water for the duration of their pregnancy. I  know it sounds strange, but in some prisons, this is actually an issue.   Meeting the healthcare needs of women has a positive impact on the  pregnancy and allowing women access to OB/GYNs as their primary  caregiver is vital.   Birth by caesarean section, on average, can cost $7,000 to $10,000  more than a natural birth, and dealing with women appropriately during  pregnancy reduces the number of caesarean sections.   For women who are determined to have pregnancies that are considered  at high risk by their doctor, it might be appropriate to say  incarceration in a prison is not the best way and maybe women could be  housed closer to home in halfway houses.   After a baby is born, birth mothers will be provided with postpartum  care and also will receive information regarding family preservation  and their parental rights.   So this is a comprehensive bill, and I advise all of my colleagues to  support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. To  date, the United States incarcerates more women than any other country  in the world. However, Federal, State, and local facilities have not  fully met the needs of pregnant women in their care. I would like to  share a few stories with you.    Last Congress, Pamela Winn, while she sat in the Chamber during the  passage of the FIRST STEP Act, was a registered nurse who specialized  in obstetrics. She knew her pregnancy was in distress after she fell  while her wrists and ankles were shackled in her 20th week of  pregnancy.   For weeks after the fall, Ms. Winn asked for medical help, which she  did not receive. She began bleeding in her cell and was brought to the  hospital in shackles. While still in the hospital, Ms. Winn asked the  guard what happened to her baby, and he told her that her baby was  thrown in the trash. That is how Ms. Winn discovered she miscarried.   No one should experience what she had to endure.   Andrea Circle Bear is the first woman to die in custody as a result  of COVID-19. Ms. Circle Bear entered custody while pregnant and  contracted COVID-19 while in BOP's care. She later gave birth on a  ventilator by caesarean and died without meeting her child.   Ms. Circle Bear, the mother of five children, was a high-risk  pregnancy and could have easily been released. She was in on a drug  charge. Instead, she now leaves behind six children.   Recently, I spoke with Nicole Bennett, who lives in Los Angeles.  Nicole is the mother of four and shared her experience being pregnant  with her second child while in custody. Ms. Bennett did not receive  proper prenatal care or nutrition. She was shackled during labor and  immediately after.   Ms. Bennett, like most women in custody, was not a violent offender.  Yet, she was not allowed to hold her infant daughter when she was born.  It would be 6 months before Ms. Bennett saw her daughter again.   Today, her daughter is 8 years old, and Ms. Bennett still carries a  lot of guilt and pain for being shackled, not having access to proper  prenatal care, and having her child in custody without friends or  family. Ms. Bennett firmly believes this impacted her ability to bond  with her child.   Tammy Jackson is a woman struggling with mental illness. She was  brought into custody while in her final trimester. Ms. Jackson informed  the officers that she was in labor, and it took 6 hours for her to  receive medical help. Ms. Jackson gave birth to her child in her cell,  alone.   Diana Sanchez could not pay for her bond for a traffic violation  while in her final trimester of pregnancy. Ms. Sanchez requested  medical help after she began experiencing severe cramps. She informed  the on-duty nurse, as well as the officers on duty, yet Ms. Sanchez was  left alone in her cell for 5 hours and gave birth alone in her cell.  The entire nightmare was caught on video. You can see Ms. Sanchez  screaming. She should not have been left alone in her cell in her third  trimester, and she should have received medical care from an  obstetrician.   This is a comprehensive and strong bipartisan bill, and I urge all of  my colleagues to support H.R. 7718. Support pregnant women in custody.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, one day I hope that these mothers mentioned here earlier  are the last to have experienced not receiving appropriate care while  in custody and pregnant.   As we begin to institute criminal justice reform to stem the increase  of people entering the system, we must improve the resources provided  to those who are currently in custody. Support H.R. 7718. Support  pregnant women in custody.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 8225) to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit certain  types of fraud in the provision of immigration services, and for other  purposes, as amended.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8225, the Fight Notario Fraud Act of 2020, would  address notario fraud, the practice of the provision of unauthorized  immigration legal services, which has not been effectively curbed by  existing Federal, State, and local efforts.   The practice continues to cause irreparable harm to immigrant  communities. Notario fraud proliferates all over the United States  because there is an overwhelming need for representation in immigration  proceedings.   In any given year, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  receives approximately 6 million applications from individuals and  businesses seeking an immigration benefit, humanitarian relief, or  naturalization. Immigration proceedings are notoriously and unusually  complex, as one editorial described them, dizzyingly Byzantine. The  high demand for assistance with this complex set of laws attracts  charlatans who prey on unsuspecting victims.   Unfortunately, efforts to curb notario fraud for the past several  decades have fallen short. Education campaigns by local governments,  bar associations, and grassroots organizations have raised public  awareness and have stemmed notario fraud somewhat.   While 34 States and the District of Columbia have some type of  statute outlawing the unauthorized practice of immigration law, only a  handful have more comprehensive laws, like California, Illinois, New  York, and Washington. Most jurisdictions address the issue by limiting  the activities of licensed notaries public. But this is rarely  effective, and even where laws have been enacted at the State level,  these efforts have done little to meaningfully rein in notario fraud.   Leadership from the Department of Justice is needed. The Federal  Government plays a singular role in immigration proceedings, so it must  also undertake efforts to protect the integrity of the immigration  process and to protect vulnerable victims from fraud and illegal  deceit.   We must strengthen the ability of Federal prosecutors to hold  notarios accountable for their malfeasance.   Congress must act carefully when creating new crimes. There must be  strong need and justification for them, but this is one instance where  State and local efforts have fallen short, and Federal enforcement has  been almost nonexistent.   This bill's comprehensive approach would not only criminalize notario  fraud at the Federal level and in 16 States that have yet to enact such  legislation, but it would also establish an enforcement apparatus  within the Department of Justice to combat fraudulent notario schemes  nationwide.   Importantly, this bill requires the Department of Justice to post  information on the internet aimed at protecting consumers from fraud,  including maintaining a public list of individuals who have been  convicted of unlawful conduct under this bill or have been found by the  State or Federal agency to have unlawfully provided immigration  services.   The Fight Notario Fraud Act will help prevent fraud and protect  vulnerable victims. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the harms brought by notario schemes can be devastating.  This bill's combination of enforcement and public education is  critically needed to protect some of the most unsuspecting and  vulnerable victims of fraud.   The Department of Justice must refocus its efforts to target notario  fraud, and we are enabling them to do so with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Mucarsel-Powell for championing  this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 2330) to amend the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act to  provide for congressional oversight of the board of directors of the  United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and to protect amateur  athletes from emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2330         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering Olympic,       Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The courageous voice of survivors is a call to action       to end emotional, physical, and sexual abuse in the Olympic       and Paralympic movement.        (2) Larry Nassar, the former national team doctor for USA       Gymnastics, sexually abused over 300 athletes for over two       decades because of ineffective oversight by USA Gymnastics       and the United States Olympic Committee.        (3) While the case of Larry Nassar is unprecedented in       scale, the case is hardly the only recent incident of sexual       abuse in amateur sports.        (4) Survivors of Larry Nassar's abuse and all survivors of       abuse in the Olympic and Paralympic movement deserve justice       and redress for the wrongs the survivors have suffered.        (5) After a comprehensive congressional investigation,       including interviews and statements from survivors, former       and current organization officials, law enforcement, and       advocates, Congress found that the United States Olympic       Committee and USA Gymnastics fundamentally failed to uphold       their existing statutory purposes and duty to protect amateur       athletes from sexual, emotional, or physical abuse.        (6) USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee       knowingly concealed abuse by Larry Nassar, leading to the       abuse of dozens of additional amateur athletes during the       period beginning in the summer of 2015 and ending in       September 2016.        (7) Ending abuse in the Olympic and Paralympic movement       requires enhanced oversight to ensure that the Olympic and       Paralympic movement does more to serve athletes and protect       their voice and safety.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2330, the Empowering  Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020, a bipartisan  bill that restores integrity to the Olympic movement and provides much- needed protections to our country's amateur athletes in the wake of the  Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal.   S. 2330 was introduced after bipartisan investigations, launched in  both the House and the Senate, revealed systemic failures within the  Olympic community that contributed to widespread instances of sexual  abuse of athletes, including minors.                                time  1430    These include a lack of effective oversight of the U.S. Olympic and  Paralympic Committee and amateur sports national governing bodies, the  failure of these organizations to uphold their duty to protect athletes  from abuse by failing to report allegations of wrongdoings to  appropriate law enforcement authorities, and concealing these failures  and neglecting to enact serious reforms.   S. 2330 addresses these issues through a series of governance and  oversight reforms, including increasing the liability of the USOPC and  NGB for failing to take appropriate action in response to allegations  of abuse, providing congressional authority to dissolve the USOPC board  and decertified NGBs, increasing the level of amateur athletes'  representations on the USOPC board and NGB governing structures, and  requiring the USOPC to establish clear procedures and reporting  requirements to protect athletes.   Importantly, the bill also strengthens the work and independence of  the Center for SafeSport, the nonprofit organization that is  responsible for investigating allegations of sexual abuse against  athletes. The bill requires USOPC to provide the Center for SafeSport  $20 million in funding each year to cover its operating costs.   The bill also prevents potential conflicts of interest by prohibiting  individuals who are employed by the USOPC or an NGB from serving the  Center for SafeSport and limiting the ability of former employers and  board members from serving.   S. 2330 is supported by the USOPC, the Center for SafeSport, and a  coalition of hundreds of Olympic and  [[Page H5160]]  Paralympic athletes, coaches, sports leaders, and sexual abuse  survivors.   The bill passed by the Senate by unanimous consent on August 4, 2020,  and its companion bill, H.R. 7881, has bipartisan support here in the  House as well.   I commend the work of Senators Blumenthal and Moran, as well as  Representatives Ted Lieu,   John Curtis, Diana DeGette, Susan Brooks,  Ann Kuster, and   Michael Burgess for their tireless work on this bill.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I again acknowledge the leadership and  commitment of so many of my colleagues who worked in a bipartisan  fashion on this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2330, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 46) to correct  the enrollment of S. 2330, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6813) to amend the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act to  improve the prevention of elder abuse and exploitation of individuals  with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6813         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Alzheimer's       Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act''.       SEC. 2. ADDRESSING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN BEST PRACTICES.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6813, the Promoting  Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act. This bill requires  the Justice Department's training materials to address treating,  protecting, and caring for people living with Alzheimer's and related  dementias.   More than 5 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's  or dementia. One study estimates that over 50 percent of these  individuals may experience some type of elder abuse. Neglect is the  most often reported type of abuse, followed by financial exploitation.   Building upon the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act of 2017,  H.R. 6813 addresses the need for better training of law enforcement  officers, first responders, social workers, prosecutors, and judges.  This legislation would strengthen the best practices and training  materials available to medical professionals and financial services  personnel who interact with this special population.   Significantly, the bill would also establish a new requirement to  address situations in which individuals living with Alzheimer's or  dementia may be involved in a criminal case as a victim or a witness.   In addition, the bill requires greater collaboration and consultation  between government agencies at the Federal, State, and local levels, as  well as with nationally recognized nonprofit associations with relevant  expertise.   According to one recent report, deaths attributed to Alzheimer's  disease and dementia rose to more than 20 percent above normal this  summer. In June alone, there were more than 61,000 dementia-related  deaths, 10,000 more than the same period last year. Increased  isolation, stress, and staff shortages at nursing homes are all likely  contributing factors to the higher-than-normal death toll.   Our seniors living in long-term care facilities are particularly  vulnerable and isolated given current physical distancing measures that  limit contact with family members and other visits. Most of these  residents have some form of cognitive impairment and are at an even  greater risk of mistreatment or exploitation. This legislation would  expand the quality and scope of dementia-specific training materials,  leading to improved practices and processes to combat elder abuse and  exploitation.   As this public health crisis continues, our senior citizens face even  greater risk. This legislation addresses an important and timely need  for this uniquely vulnerable population.   I thank Representative Deutch for introducing this legislation that  has strong bipartisan support and for his leadership in expanding  protections for our vulnerable citizens living with Alzheimer's and  dementia.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this issue touches millions of families across America  who have a loved one living with Alzheimer's or dementia.   For this vulnerable population, there is far too great a risk of  elder abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation, and the current  pandemic has taken a tremendous toll. Across the country, residents of  long-term care facilities are facing increased risk around COVID-19, as  well as greater mortality rates.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting  passage of H.R. 6813 today, and I yield back the balance of my time.
