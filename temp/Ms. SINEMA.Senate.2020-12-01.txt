 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent, but had I been  present I would have voted yes on rollcall vote No. 240, motion to  invoke cloture on the nomination of Taylor B. McNeel, of Mississippi,  to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of  Mississippi                            ____________________
