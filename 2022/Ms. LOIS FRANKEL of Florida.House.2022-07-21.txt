 Madam Speaker, my, my. Mark my words.  The Supreme Court's decision to dismantle abortion was just the start  of extreme unnecessary intrusion of our personal lives by Republicans.   Next on their list? Limit the right to buy and use the birth control  that give women the ability to plan their families.   Listen to this: This is not imaginary. This is happening right now.  Madam Speaker, I was in the room during committee debate when  Republicans tried to go back to the horse-and-buggy days of birth  control.   On birth control counseling, condoms only, they said, say no to even  the mention of medically approved contraception like implants and IUDs.  Really? That is crazy, and that is why we need to pass this bill right  now, the Right to Contraception Act.
