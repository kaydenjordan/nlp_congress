 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor U.S. Air Force  veteran and Marion police officer, Corporal Ron Slagle for his 25 years  spent protecting our Iowa communities.   Last month, Corporal Slagle signed off on his last shift with the  Marion Police Department, my hometown, with a final 10-42 alongside his  family and friends.   From his time in the Air Force to his dedication to the Marion Police  Department, and his advocacy to ensure that law enforcement officers,  first responders, and veterans have access to mental health care  resources, Corporal Slagle embodies what it means to be a public  servant.   It is no surprise that he has instilled the value of service in his  children, who have also embraced careers to help others.   He has a true servant's heart, and I wish him all the best in his  retirement. I congratulate Ron.                            ____________________
