 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for having this Special  Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on the 47th anniversary of the  Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision which has had a devastating effect  on protecting the sanctity of life and advancing the rights of the  unborn.   This ill-fated decision has had drastic, negative consequences and  has expanded the abhorrent practice of abortion across this country.   But despite the devastating effects Roe v. Wade has had on the  sanctity of life, I am inspired to see so many of my fellow Members of  Congress join me in continuing the fight for the unborn. Whether it be  by signing the discharge petition to bring the Born-Alive Abortion  Survivors Protection Act to the floor for a vote, or by cosponsoring  legislation to prohibit the use of taxpayer funding in abortions, my  House colleagues and I will continue to fight to protect life.   Just a couple of weeks ago, I was proud to join 206 of my  congressional colleagues in signing an amicus brief filed with the U.S.  Supreme Court concerning the Louisiana case of June Medical Services v.  Gee.   I look forward to seeing the court review this case and others in  hopes that they may issue a decision that reflects the will of the  majority of Americans to protect the unborn.
