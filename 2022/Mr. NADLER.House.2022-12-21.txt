Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 2333.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 2333, the Equal Pay for Team USA Act of 2022, is  bipartisan legislation that would help ensure that all amateur athletes  representing the United States in global athletic competitions,  including the Olympics and Paralympics, are treated equally.   Specifically, the bill requires all such athletes, regardless of  gender, to receive equal compensation, medical care, travel  arrangements, expense reimbursements, and other benefits.   The bill also requires the United States Olympic and Paralympic  Committee, as well as national sports governing bodies, to report  annually to Congress on compliance and, in collaboration with affected  athletes, to advocate before international sports federations to ensure  equal prizes and other support for male and female athletes.   While helping to ensure gender equality, the bill also carefully  preserves the ability of athletes to accept outside sponsorships and  endorsement deals and prizes such as Olympic or Paralympic medals.   It also clarifies that certain team members, such as team captains,  may earn more than their teammates, and it allows the U.S. Olympic and  Paralympic Committee and national sports governing bodies to provide  more beneficial terms, to the extent necessary, to account for existing  gender-based disparities.   Female athletes competing on the world stage have suffered unequal  treatment for far too long. Despite training and working just as  tirelessly as their male counterparts, they often receive unequal  benefits and compensation. This is unacceptable.   Congress must not only be on record stating clearly that we, as a  Nation, value all members of Team USA, both women and men alike, but we  must also take action to ensure just and equal treatment for all of our  athletes who repeatedly do our Nation proud before the eyes of the  world.   I thank our colleagues, Senators Maria Cantwell, Shelley Moore  Capito, Amy Klobuchar, and Cynthia Lummis, for shepherding this long- overdue bill through the Senate, where it passed by voice vote.  [[Page H9925]]    I appreciate the leadership of Representatives Mikie Sherrill and  Nancy Mace for bringing this measure forward in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Equal Pay for Team USA Act of 2022 is a targeted approach to  addressing the disparities in treatment among women and men who  represent the United States in global amateur athletic competitions.  For this reason, the bill has the support of many organizations,  including the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, U.S. Soccer, U.S.  Squash, USA Curling, USA Volleyball, the Women's Basketball Coaches  Association, the Women's Sports Foundation, the National  Interscholastic Athletic Association, the National Women's Law Center,  and the National Organization for Women.   The way we treat our amateur women athletes is a reflection of our  Nation's values. Through their talents and hard work, these athletes  showcase all that is best about America to the world.   All too often, they receive unequal pay or less favorable terms of  employment merely because of their gender. It is time to correct this  mistake and ensure that all American athletes competing on the world  stage are treated fairly.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass the Equal Pay for Team USA Act,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 5168) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to include  aliens passing in transit through the United States to board a vessel  on which the alien will perform ship-to-ship liquid cargo transfer  operations within a class of nonimmigrant aliens, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 5168         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Security and       Lightering Independence Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. CHANGES IN NONIMMIGRANT CATEGORIES.         (a) Transit Through United States.--Section 101(a)(15)(C)       of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1101(a)(15)(C)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(C)(i) an alien in immediate and continuous transit       through the United States, for a period not to exceed 29       days;        ``(ii) an alien who qualifies as a person entitled to pass       in transit to and from the United Nations Headquarters       District (as defined in section 209A(e) of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C.       4309a(e))) and foreign countries, under the provisions of       paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of section 11 of the Agreement       regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations, done at       Lake Success June 26, 1947 (61 Stat. 758); or        ``(iii) an alien passing in transit through the United       States to board a vessel on which the alien will perform, or       to disembark from a vessel on which the alien performed,       ship-to-ship liquid cargo transfer operations to or from       another vessel engaged in foreign trade, for a period not to       exceed 180 days;''.        (b) Alien Crewmen.--Section 101(a)(15)(D) of such Act (8       U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(D)) is amended--        (1) in clause (ii), by adding ``or'' at the end; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(iii) an alien crewman performing ship-to-ship liquid       cargo transfer operations to or from another vessel engaged       in foreign trade, who intends to land temporarily solely in       pursuit of the alien's responsibilities as a crewman and to       depart from the United States on the vessel on which the       alien arrived or on another vessel or aircraft, for a period       not to exceed 180 days;''.       SEC. 3. CONDITIONAL PERMITS TO LAND TEMPORARILY.         Section 252(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1282(a)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (2), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; or''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(3) 180 days, if the immigration officer determines that       the crewman--        ``(A) intends to depart, within the period for which the       crewman is permitted to land, on the same vessel or on a       vessel or aircraft other than the vessel on which the crewman       arrived; and        ``(B) will perform ship-to-ship liquid cargo transfer       operations to or from any other vessel engaged in foreign       trade during such period.''.       SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         For purposes of this Act, and the amendments made by this       Act, the performance by a crewman of ship-to-ship liquid       cargo transfer operations to or from any other vessel engaged       in foreign trade shall not be considered, for immigration       purposes, to be services, work, labor or employment by the       crewman within the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 5168.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 5168, the Energy Security and Lightering Independence  Act of 2022, will make a small but important technical fix to our  immigration laws to ensure that the visas for certain crewmembers  engaged in a process known as lightering are functional.   Lightering is the ship-to-ship transfer of crude oil or liquid  natural gas from a smaller vessel onto a larger vessel, or vice versa,  for import and export. Approximately 74 percent of all U.S. exports and  44 percent of U.S. imports are conducted by lightering.   Lightering vessel crewmembers are issued combination C-1/D visas by  the U.S. State Department. A crewmember or D visa is a nonimmigrant  visa for persons working aboard vessels at sea or airplanes on  international flights, providing services required for the normal  operation of those vessels, and intending to depart the United States  on the same vessel or any other vessel within 29 days.   A transit or C-1 visa allows the crewmember to travel or transit  through the United States as a passenger to join a ship or aircraft on  which that crewmember will work.   Because the work aboard lightering vessels typically lasts 3 to 6  months,  [[Page H9926]]  the 29-day limit on the combination C-1/D visa by itself is not  adequate. Therefore, for decades, Customs and Border Protection has  granted parole to lightering vessel crewmembers upon arrival in the  United States, allowing them to remain on board the vessel and then to  depart after their services aboard the vessel are completed up to 6  months later.   This legislation simply modifies the maximum period of stay for  lightering crewmembers under the C-1/D visa from 29 days to 180 days.  The simple change makes the C-1/D visa functional for lightering  crewmembers, thus eliminating the need for CBP to continue granting  parole on a case-by-case basis.   The legislation makes clear that this is a narrow change that only  applies to lightering crewmembers who are transiting through or landing  temporarily in the United States and that these crewmembers are  explicitly not eligible to work in the United States on the C-1/D visa.   This technical fix is also expected to save CBP $250,000 and 6,000  man-hours per year.   I thank Representative Sylvia Garcia for her leadership and for  introducing this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia), the sponsor of the bill and a member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, this legislation makes a modest but  important technical change to the immigration laws that would improve  the efficiency of our agencies and of a critical domestic industry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4926) to amend chapter 33 of title 28, United States Code, to  require appropriate use of multidisciplinary teams for investigations  of child sexual exploitation or abuse, the production of child sexual  abuse material, or child trafficking conducted by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4926         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Respect for Child Survivors       Act''.       SEC. 2. MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 4926.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, how many people are necessary to stand up to  get a roll call vote?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 4926, the Respect for Child Survivors Act is  bipartisan legislation that responds to the testimony of Olympian  McKayla Maroney, who bravely shared her story with Congress, alongside  her fellow gymnasts, Simone Biles, Maggie Nichols, and Aly Raisman.  They told Congress about the abuse they faced at the hands of Larry  Nassar, and the failures of so many people to stop that abuse sooner.   Maroney testified that she was interviewed by an FBI agent in 2015.  She testified that she spoke to the agent over the phone for nearly 3  hours, recounting numerous molestations and answering every question,  trusting that sharing this information would lead to action and to  protecting other young women.   ``I began crying at the memory over the phone, and there was just  dead silence,'' Maroney testified. She said, ``I was so shocked at the  agent's silence and disregard for my trauma.'' Unfortunately, it was  not until 17 months later that the agent even documented the interview.  Unsurprisingly, it did not accurately describe Maroney's account of the  abuse that she experienced.   The Respect for Child Survivors Act seeks to ensure that no one will  experience what McKayla Maroney experienced when she trusted the FBI  with her most personal traumatic memories.   This legislation requires the FBI to use multidisciplinary teams of  experts when investigating cases of child sexual abuse, the production  of child sexual abuse material, and child trafficking. These experts  must receive training on special victims' crimes, including child  sexual abuse, and they must provide trauma-informed care. The use of  these multidisciplinary teams would prevent the re-traumatization of  victims who come forward seeking justice.   The bill also requires the director of the FBI to annually report to  the Attorney General about any interview of a victim reporting child  sexual abuse material or child trafficking that took place without the  use of a multidisciplinary approach or a trained forensic interviewer.   The bill also encourages the FBI to work with multidisciplinary teams  at existing Children's Advocacy Centers, as established by the Victims  of Child Abuse Act. The bill ensures that the FBI gives Children's  Advocacy Center personnel access to critical case information so  victims can get the medical, mental health, and advocacy services they  need.   Finally, the bill requires that child sexual abuse and child  trafficking cases are reviewed by a multidisciplinary team at regularly  scheduled times so that the team can share information about case  progress, address any investigative or prosecutorial barriers, and  ensure that victims receive support and needed treatment.   This provision would ensure that none of these serious cases is  neglected and that children are not endangered by a failure to  investigate.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senators Cornyn, Coons, Grassley, and Klobuchar  for introducing this important legislation in the Senate. I thank  Congressmen Costa and Gonzales for championing it in the House. I hope  my colleagues will join me in supporting this bipartisan, bicameral  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, this legislation is endorsed by the Rape,  Abuse & Incest National Network; the National District Attorneys  Association; Army of Survivors; and the National Children's Alliance.   We must do better in helping survivors seek justice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H9931]]
