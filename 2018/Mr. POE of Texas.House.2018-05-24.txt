 Mr. Speaker, recently, Officer Rogelio Santander of  the Dallas, Texas, police department was responding to an ordinary  call: a thief at a Home Depot. As Officer Santander and his colleagues  attempted to arrest the outlaw, the crook pulled out a pistol and  started blasting away at the officers.   All three officers responding to the call were critically wounded,  the criminal's bullets hitting their mark as he cowardly ran away from  his crimes. Police Officer Crystal Almeida and a civilian Home Depot  employee were shot and are now recovering from their wounds.   At just 28 years of age, Officer Santander was murdered in the youth  of his life. Another member of the thin blue line killed simply because  he wore the badge to protect and serve the rest of us.   A man of many hats, the 3-year veteran of the force was a member of  the rare breed, the American breed. His fellow officers, friends, and  family members remember this Texas law man, Santander, as a person who  always went the extra mile to protect and serve his community. Without  fail, he encouraged his friends and family to be the best version of  themselves during their life.   Peace officers like Santander are the last strand of wire in the  fence between the law and the lawless. We mourn his sacrifice, but we  thank the good Lord that a remarkable man such as he has ever lived.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
