 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution  on the floor.   We are here today because of the rule of law. This resolution, the  inquiry, is Congress upholding the oath we pledged to the Constitution.   We are here because of the President, his actions, his jeopardizing  our national security for his own political gain.   We are here because we know the White House and the President  admitted that President Trump used the power of the Presidency to  pressure and strong-arm the President of a foreign country for his  political gain. He called it ``a favor.'' ``Do us a favor,'' he said.  But it wasn't a favor. It was a coordinated attempt to undermine the  rule of law.   Because of those actions, Congress is compelled to be here to uphold  the rule of law; to make sure Americans hear the truth; to say that no  one, not even a President, can abuse the system without fair and just  consequences.
