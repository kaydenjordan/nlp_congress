 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of Stephen P. Counihan, and  I rise with my colleagues all around the greater Boston area, as we  seek to raise the spirits of Stephen, who is currently battling cancer.  ``Couhni,'' as he is affectionately known, is currently the tennis  coach at Suffolk University, where he has led four championship teams  to great renown in the greater Boston area. But it was in the 1970s, as  a standout defenseman at Bowdoin College where Counihan got the name  ``Couhni-Orr'' because of his remarkable presence on the ice and his  cool capacity under pressure.   Now, Stephen is facing one of the great challenges of his life, as he  deals not only with the chemotherapy, but the potential surgery that we  are looking at in the month of April ahead.   Couhni, I want you to know that all of your colleagues from Beta  Theta Pi, from Bowdoin College hockey team, from the greater Bowdoin  community, in fact, the entire Boston area, stand with you today. Win  one more championship for us, Couhni, so we can all celebrate together  when we have you back collectively.                            ____________________
