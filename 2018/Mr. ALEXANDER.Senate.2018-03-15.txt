 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about  something that is on the minds of anybody in this country who is making  $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 too much to have a subsidy to pay  for your healthcare insurance and maybe are paying $15,000, $20,000,  $25,000 of that salary for your insurance this year and who has heard  from a lot of people that on October 1, the insurance companies are  going to announce that your premium is going up. That is whom I would  like to talk with today.   Specifically, let me use the example of a woman named Marty in  Tennessee. She came up to me before Christmas at the Chick-fil-A on  Charlotte Road in Nashville, and she stopped me while I was getting my  mac and cheese at Chick-fil-A, and she said: My name is Marty. I am a  self-employed farmer. A few years ago, my health insurance was $300 a  month, today it is $1,300 a month, and I cannot afford that.   Well, in Tennessee, prices for health insurance for people who work  and don't get any subsidy to help them buy their insurance and don't  get insurance on the job, they don't get it from Medicare or Medicaid,  people who work, the self-employed farmer, the contractor, the plumber,  the songwriter, somebody who might be making $60,000, say--they are  like Marty. They are paying $20,000 for their health insurance, and  they cannot afford that.   I told Marty: I think we have a Christmas present for you. I think  Congress, when we pass the omnibus spending bill, is going to include  in it a set of policies we have that is going to lower your rates when  they are announced on October 1 of next year, which is 2018.   Well, unfortunately, we had a continuing resolution at the end of the  year, and Marty didn't get her Christmas present. Then I thought she  might get a Valentine's present, and we went by Valentine's Day and did  another CR, a continuing resolution.   Now we have until the end of next week to fund the government for the  year we are halfway through. I am on the floor today, and I can say to  Marty and to every plumber, songwriter, self-employed person in this  country, someone who might be between jobs, that if the Congress will  act, we can lower their rates next year for up to as much as 40  percent--40 percent. That is according to Oliver Wyman, one of the  leading healthcare consulting firms in this country, which announced on  Monday that a set of policies which we call Alexander-Murray-Collins-Nelson, which President Trump supports,  which Congressman Walden, who is the chairman of the House committee in  this area, supports, which Senator McConnell supports, which I  support--we have broad support for this. This policy we have been  working on for months, according to Oliver Wyman, over the next 3  years, assuming States take full advantage of all the options we are  giving them, could lower rates by 40 percent.    What does that mean? That means that if you are paying $20,000 for  your health insurance--you are that $60,000-a-year plumber--that is 40  percent of $20,000, which, by my math, is $8,000. So that would cut  your insurance to $12,000, and you get down toward something you might  be able to afford. Can you imagine anything more frightening than  approaching next year knowing that you might not be able to afford  health insurance for your family? You are thinking: Well, look, I am  doing everything I am supposed to. The government has not gotten me on  any kind of subsidy to buy health insurance. I am out here working. I  am paying my taxes. Maybe I got a little tax cut that the Republicans  put through last year, but the thing that is really a problem for me is  my health insurance. If I am making $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 a year, I  cannot afford $15,000, $20,000, or $25,000 a year.   If you are a farmer in Iowa or a miner in Alaska or a songwriter in  Nashville, you can't afford that, and you shouldn't have to, and you  won't have to if Congress will act next week to accept the set of  policies that I am about to briefly describe.   There are three things we propose to do. The most important is 3  years of reinsurance or the invisible risk pool. This is an idea that  House Republicans have strongly supported and that Senator Collins and  Senator Nelson have strongly supported here. It would allow more States  to do what the State of Alaska has done. The Presiding Officer is from  Alaska. Alaska took the very sickest people in Alaska and put them in  one pool and called that the reinsurance pool and paid for their health  insurance. When they did that, it so reduced the cost for everybody  else that it lowered the rates for everybody else by 20 percent. What  we are talking about is lowering the rate for everybody else by 40  percent if States take full advantage of what we are proposing next  week. So reinsurance is the first thing--3 years of reinsurance at $10  billion a year.   The second thing is 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies. You have to  stop and think about it a minute, but the cost-sharing subsidies pay  for the reinsurance. Cost-sharing subsidies are payments that are made  to insurance companies to pay for the copays and the deductibles for  low-income people, and that allows the companies to reduce the  premiums. When you reduce the premiums, you reduce the ObamaCare  subsidies.   According to conversations we have had with the Congressional Budget  Office, if we do 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies and 3 years of  reinsurance at $10 billion, the cost-sharing subsidies more than pay  for the reinsurance, if you base it on reality, which is, if Congress  passes a law that costs $30 billion over 3 years for reinsurance and 3  years of cost-sharing subsidies, the cost-sharing subsidies pay for the  reinsurance and leave $2 billion over to reduce the Federal debt.   The third part is a set of proposals that would give States more  flexibility. This streamlines the section 1332 waiver in the Affordable  Care Act. It makes some changes that permit the agency we call CMS to  approve waivers from States, like the State of Alaska or Nebraska or  Tennessee, which may say: We would like to spend our ObamaCare subsidy  money in a different way, and we would like to add some of this  reinsurance money to it. By doing that, that is how you achieve the 40- percent savings for the Nebraska self-employed farmer or the Nashville  songwriter in their insurance policies.   So that is the set of proposals, plus within there is a provision for  what we call a catastrophic policy, which is a policy that has somewhat  higher deductibles but lower premiums, which people may choose to buy.   All of that policy has broad bipartisan support. I think the  reinsurance provision--in the Republican discussions we have had in the  Senate, almost everybody seems to agree that the only way we can have  an individual market, which is the market for people who buy insurance  on their own--people who don't get it from Medicare, people who don't  get it from Medicaid, people who don't get it on the job--let's say you  are between jobs or you are self-employed. You are the songwriter. You  are the plumber. Those are the people whom we are focused on here.  There are about 11 million in the United States, but there could be a  lot more because all of us know what it is like to think, well, I might  lose my job, or, I might change jobs, and what do I do for insurance in  the interim? I have the so-called COBRA available, but it is very  expensive. If I suddenly find I am losing my job or if I am changing  jobs and I am worrying about insurance--that is the person we are  talking about.    Where did these ideas come from? Did we just write them on the back  of an envelope and give them to Congress? No. We went through a very  serious process here in the Senate. Senator Murray, the ranking  Democrat on the Senate HELP Committee--I am the  [[Page S1752]]  chairman--and I held four hearings last fall after Republicans failed  to repeal and replace the ObamaCare law. We invited all Senators to  participate. We had more than half the Senate come to our hearings and  to our meetings with the witnesses. Out of that came the proposals to  streamline the 1332 waiver--that is flexibility for States--and the  need to pay for the cost-sharing subsidies temporarily, because people  began to understand that they don't cost money, but they save taxpayer  money because they reduce the need for Federal taxpayer subsidies. So  that is where that came from.   The single most important idea that was not a part of the original  Alexander-Murray proposal was reinsurance. In the House, they call it  the invisible risk pool. Senators Collins and Nelson have championed it  here. Representative Costello, Representative Meadows, and other people  championed it over there. It was part of the Republican repeal-and- replace legislation in the House of Representatives. So the idea of 3  years of reinsurance really has come from both bodies and from both  sides of the aisle. It is the most essential part of any long-term  policy to create an individual market where people can buy insurance if  they don't get it on the job or from the government.   This would give States half a billion dollars in the current year,  2018, to plan for their reinsurance pools. It would then create $10  billion over 3 years that States could use to help pay for their  reinsurance pools, and they would use their 1332 streamlined waiver in  the second and third year. So they could have a combination of State  money, reinsurance Federal money, and ObamaCare subsidy money and  hopefully, in that process, create their own way of helping to pay for  the needs of the very sickest people in the State and, by taking them  out of the insurance pool, lower the rates for everybody else over that  4-year period, according to the Oliver Wyman consulting firm, by as  much as 40 percent.   The Congressional Budget Office has also reviewed the set of  proposals I have just described. My staff has been working closely with  them because we want to know what it costs if we are going to put it in  the omnibus bill, and the preliminary feedback from the Congressional  Budget Office is more conservative than the Oliver Wyman estimate. The  Congressional Budget Office says that it would reduce premiums by an  average of 10 percent in 2019 and 20 percent in 2020 and 2021 if States  take full advantage of the 1332 waiver they have.   As you can imagine, State Governors and State insurance commissioners  are delighted with this package. First, they like to see us do  something in a bipartisan way to stabilize the health insurance market  so people aren't scared to death that they may not be able to buy a  policy next year, but second, they think it is sound policy. It is  sound policy.   Much of this started when the President called me last August and  said: Between now and the time we make a final decision on what to do  about the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, I want to make sure that  people aren't hurt. So he asked me if I would work with Senator Murray  and see if we could come up with a bipartisan set of proposals that  would stabilize the individual market. He called me several times about  that, and we have worked together since then. That is when we came  together with the original Alexander-Murray proposal.   Then we had a big disagreement here within the Senate, and we had our  tax bill wherein we repealed the individual mandate in the Affordable  Care Act. Republicans thought that was a good idea. It made people buy  insurance they didn't want, and it was a tax on low-income people, so  we got rid of it. Democrats didn't like that at all.   It is true that taking the individual mandate out, even though States  could add it back if they want to, does increase the cost of insurance  in the individual market. Despite that, this set of policies that I  have described--State flexibility, the 3 years of cost-sharing  subsidies, and the 3 years of reinsurance/invisible risk pools--those  three policies, according to Oliver Wyman consulting, which is one of  the leading health consulting firms in America, could lower rates to 40  percent lower than they otherwise would be. According to the  Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency that looks at things  for us, it will lower them 10 percent in 2019 and as much as 20 percent  in the next 2 years after that. Even if it is only 20 and not 40, 20  percent of $20,000 is $4,000 for Marty, the self-employed farmer in  Nashville who stopped me at Chick-fil-A and said her insurance had gone  from $300 to $1,300, $1,400 a month.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the report of  the Oliver Wyman consulting company that says that the combination of  policies I just described--reinsurance, cost-sharing subsidies, and the  section 1332 waiver, which is the State flexibility--that those three  policies will reduce rates by up to 40 percent.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Oliver Wyman Report: A Proposal To Lower ACA Premiums by More Than 40%                         and Cover 3.2 Million More    (By Tammy Tomczyk, FSA, FCA, MAAA, Partner, Oliver Wyman Actuarial   Consulting, and Kurt Giesa, FSA, MAAA, Practice Leader, Oliver Wyman                           Actuarial Consulting)         In our December 9, 2017 article, we analyzed the effects of       a proposal the US Senate was considering to fund cost-sharing       reduction (CSR) payments and appropriate $5 billion in 2019       and 2020 for states to establish reinsurance programs to       stabilize their individual insurance markets. We discussed       how pass-through savings could provide reinsurance coverage       equal to roughly $15 billion in protection for high-cost       claimants, and how this protection, combined with CSR       funding, would bring more people into the individual market       and lower premiums by over 20 percent.        More recent congressional attention is focusing on a       proposal that includes an extension of CSRs and a reinsurance       program in 2019, 2020, and 2021, funded with a $10 billion       appropriation in each year, with federal fallback option       available to states in 2019. The federal fallback option       would likely be based on--and use the federal infrastructure       built to administer--the Transitional Reinsurance Program in       place from 2014 through 2016.        Our healthcare microsimulation model, used to understand       this package's likely effects on the market, assumed states       would use federal pass-through savings under Section 1332 of       the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to supplement and leverage the       $10 billion the considered legislation would authorize and       appropriate each year. Pass-through savings result from the       fact that the premium subsidies available under the ACA cover       the difference between the second lowest cost silver plan       available in a rating area and a fixed percentage of a       household's income, varying only by federal poverty level       (FPL). Lower premiums result directly in lower premium       subsidies, and under a Section 1332 waiver, these savings       from lower premiums may be used to provide additional       reinsurance.        In our modeling, we are presuming that states will take       advantage of these pass-through savings in 2019. In reality,       states that have not already begun working on a waiver will       be challenged to get a 1332 waiver filed and approved under       the current regulatory regime in time to impact 2019       premiums. The current regulatory regime includes a       requirement that a state enact enabling legislation, develop       an application, hold public hearings during a 30-day public       comment period, and submit the application to the US Health       and Human Services (HHS). HHS then undertakes a two-step       review process that can span up to 225 days--up to 45 days       for a completeness determination followed by up to 180 days       for review. But even those states unable to get a waiver in       place for 2019 would still benefit from that year's federal       fallback program.        Therefore, we estimate, under the assumptions described       above, that an additional 3.2 million people will be covered       in the non-group market, and the proposal would result in       premiums that are at least 40 percent lower than they would       have been without the proposal in place, across all metal       levels. In those states that are not able to obtain a 1332       waiver and take advantage of pass-through savings for 2019,       we estimate that premium would decline by more than 20       percent across all metal levels. Those estimates include an       average 10 percent reduction due to the funding of CSRs, with       the remaining reduction coming from the reinsurance program.        As a note, our modeling reflects elimination of the mandate       penalty, but does not consider the proposed regulation's       likely effects on association health plans or on short-term,       limited duration coverage.                                   ____       Report: Individual Insurance Premiums Next Year 40% Lower Under       Alexander-Murray, Collins-Nelson Than if Congress Doesn't Act         Washington, March 12.--Health care experts at Oliver Wyman       released an analysis today showing that the passage of a       proposal based on the Alexander-Murray Bipartisan Health Care       Stabilization Act and the Collins-Nelson Lower Premiums       Through Reinsurance Act will lower premiums, compared to what       people in the individual market will pay if Congress doesn't       act, by more than 40  [[Page S1753]]       percent in the individual market and provide insurance       coverage to an additional 3.2 million individuals.        Oliver Wyman based its analysis on a proposal that would       fund CSRs--temporary payments to reduce out-of-pocket costs       for low-income Americans in the individual market--and       provide $10 billion annually for invisible risk pool/      reinsurance funding in 2019, 2020, and 2021. It also factored       in increased flexibility for states that seek to use waivers       under Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act. The analysis       applies to ACA-compliant plans in the individual market, both       on and off the exchange.        ``This analysis from the experts at Oliver Wyman further       demonstrates that our bipartisan proposals will help drive       down premiums in the individual market and make health       insurance more affordable for millions of Americans,'' said       Senators Lamar Alexander, the Chairman of the HELP Committee,       and Susan Collins.        From the experts at Oliver Wyman:        ``Therefore, we estimate . . . that an additional 3.2       million people will be covered in the non-group market, and       the proposal would result in remiums that are at least 40       percent lower than they would have been without the proposal       in place . . .''        The analysis found that the lower rates would benefit all       plan levels on the exchanges.        The analysis was performed by consulting firm Oliver Wyman.       On its website, Oliver Wyman describes itself as ``a global       leader in management consulting. With offices in 50+ cities       across nearly 30 countries, Oliver Wyman combines deep       industry knowledge with specialized expertise in strategy,       operations, risk management, and organization transformation.       The firm has more than 4,700 professionals around the world       who help clients optimize their business, improve their       operations and risk profile, and accelerate their       organizational performance to seize the most attractive       opportunities.''     Finally, I would ask the question, What if we don't do  this? I am generally a very optimistic person. I am results-oriented,  and you don't get results if you don't work across party lines and if  you don't think you are going to succeed. So I always think we will  succeed. This has been more difficult to do than it should have been.   I would like to suggest to my colleagues and to the American people  that we should focus on October 1 of this year because that is the date  when insurance rates for next year, 2019, will be announced all across  the country. Insurance companies are working with insurance  commissioners in every State to try to figure out what is going to  happen, what the rates will be. They will be announcing rates on  October 1, which is about a month before the next election.   There a lot of people who are going to be looking at that because, in  my State of Tennessee, rates were up 58 percent this year, and that is  for the plumber who makes $60,000 a year; the songwriter; Marty, the  farmer; and the people I have been describing. There was a 58-percent  increase. So they are going to be looking on October 1 to see whether  they can even afford any insurance in 2019.   If we do what we are proposing here in the Alexander-Murray-Collins- Nelson set of policies, which has broad bipartisan support in the House  and the Senate and the support of the President, if we do that next  week, Marty, the self-employed farmer in Tennessee, will be able to see  on October 1 that her rates will go down and that, if Oliver Wyman is  correct, instead of her rates going up 58 percent the way they did this  year, they will go down 40 percent over the next 2 or 3 years. That  means she could afford insurance.   If we don't do it, rates will go up, and the individual market will  probably collapse. It was near collapse a year ago. By collapsing, I  mean there will be counties where people can't buy insurance at all.  There will be 11 million people who are between jobs, who are self- employed, or who are working who literally cannot afford insurance, and  they are not going to be very happy campers. They are going to blame  every one of us, and they should. They are going to blame the  President, they are going to blame Republicans, they are going to blame  Democrats, and they are going to blame insurance companies because we  have an opportunity next week to solve that problem in a bipartisan  way, developed through a bipartisan process, incorporating ideas that  virtually everyone who looks at them says make very good policy sense.   We have a couple of things to work through on ancillary issues, but  those shouldn't cloud the fact that we can reduce rates by up to 40  percent for the working Americans who can't afford insurance--the  insurance companies will announce that on October 1--or we can do  nothing, and we can let the markets falter.   There will be some counties where you can't buy insurance at all,  some counties where you can't afford insurance at all, and we will have  people look at us and say: My goodness, why did we send them up there  to do nothing about that?   I am optimistic. I think we can do it. I appreciate the hard work on  both sides of the aisle. In many respects, it has been a very difficult  negotiation. I appreciate the President's consistency over the past  couple of months in supporting this and the Vice President's work.  Senator McConnell has been very supportive of this, which makes it very  helpful in terms of getting it into the bipartisan agreement next week.   I look forward to being able to say to my songwriters, self-employed  business men and women, plumbers, and Marty, the farmer, that if they  are making $60,000 or $70,000 in Tennessee, we put in place something  that will lower their rates by 40 percent over the next 3 years.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
