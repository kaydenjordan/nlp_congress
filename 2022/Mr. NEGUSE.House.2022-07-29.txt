 Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 5118.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 5118, the Wildfire Response  and Drought Resiliency Act. This legislation represents another major  effort to act on climate by responding to record-setting wildfires and  drought that are impacting communities across our country.   I represent Colorado's Second Congressional District, and it was  barely over 6 months ago, in December, when the Marshall Fire burned  through Boulder County and became the most destructive fire in Colorado  history. The fire destroyed a 30-acre subdivision in a matter of hours;  nearly 200 homes burned to the ground and caused over $1 billion in  damages.   This comes on the heels of my district experiencing the first and  second largest wildfires in the history of Colorado in Larimer and  Grand Counties in 2020, and as parts of the western United States is  currently experiencing their driest drought conditions in over 1,000  years.   Fires have become the primary occupation of so many of our offices.  Countless constituents come to us, grieving the loss of their homes,  but also seeking the resources that they deserve from the Federal  Government. We have a duty to provide our constituents with the support  that they need to rebuild and to recover.   The reality is that we are living with a new normal as climate change  results in a hotter, drier, planet where historic drought and record- setting wildfires are not merely a possibility, but an inevitability.  Wildfires no longer occur in a season, but throughout the entire year.   I am grateful to my colleagues, to Chairman Grijalva, Chairman Scott,  Chairwoman Maloney, Chairwoman Johnson, Chairman DeFazio, Chairman  Pallone, Chairman Nadler, Chairwoman Velazquez, Chairwoman Waters,  Chairwoman Lofgren, and House leadership for helping bring this package  to the floor. This is exactly the kind of response that our  constituents desperately want to see from Congress.   H.R. 5118 provides a whole-of-government response to the droughts and  the wildfires impacting American communities across the country, and it  combines more than 50 standalone pieces of legislation originating from  nine different House committees, including Republican and Democratic  bills.   We began this important work last year, as my colleagues know,  working with President Biden to pass the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act, which included historic investments to reduce wildfire risks,  improve ecosystem resilience, and ensure reliable water supplies.   The Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act builds on those  investments. It provides an increased starting wage for our brave and  courageous Federal wildland firefighters. It invests in water security  and in drought resilience and advancing wildfire science.   As climate-change-induced drought means long-term reductions in rain,  snow, and necessary water supplies, this legislation invests in  drought-proof water projects like water recycling, modern desalination,  advancing water data management and technology, protecting and  restoring ecosystems.  [[Page H7420]]    The bill also advances projects to deliver reliable water across  Indian Country, including by incorporating key provisions from my bill,  the Tribal Access to Clean Water Act. And it provides significant  resources to prevent key Colorado River reservoirs from declining to  critically low water levels, protecting the supplies of a river that 40  million Americans, 40 million, rely on.   H.R. 5118 also includes several other important pieces of legislation  introduced by many Members in the body today. Provisions from Tim's  Act, named after a heroic smoke jumper, Tim Hart, who tragically lost  his life fighting a wildfire in New Mexico, would increase pay and  benefits for Federal wildland firefighters, and that provision is part  of this bill.   Finally, the bill includes provisions that would provide flexibility  in Federal FEMA cost shares to support our local communities and to  protect watersheds impacted by wildfire.   Madam Chair, this bill is a good bill, and it meets the moment for  the American West. And for that reason, I will encourage my colleagues  today to support it. I look forward to hearing from many of my  colleagues who will speak on the bill.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just say this: The gentleman is entitled to his own opinion  but not to his own facts, and I take great umbrage at his reference to  the word ``disgrace.''   He knows and my colleagues know just as well as anyone in this  Chamber that the pay increase that was authorized by the bipartisan  infrastructure law, which, by the way, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle voted against, all but 13 of them, that pay increase  expires a year from now.   Every wildland firefighter in the United States will receive a pay  diminution if this bill isn't passed, if we don't authorize the pay  increases that are in this bill. It is a disgrace to suggest anything  otherwise.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would, again, simply say the irony is rich. My colleagues will vote  against the authorization for more wildland firefighter pay, and then  when we fight for the appropriation, they will vote against it, too.  So, it is a bit difficult to hear them make those claims.   I also would say that the 10-year Forest Service management plan is  something we support, I support. I am glad to hear my colleagues  support it because they all voted against it.   Literally, a year ago, when we passed a bill in this Chamber to  authorize the Forest Service to spend $20 million to invest in forest  management in Idaho, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada, where were  they? They voted against it. Now, they claim to support it, yet they  will vote against a bill that authorizes more projects along those same  lines.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pallone).    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have just a few key points.   First, I understand why there is some confusion on the other side  regarding the firefighter pay provision because, again, my colleagues  voted against increasing firefighter pay a year ago when the bipartisan  infrastructure bill was before this body, so I understand that they are  prepared to vote against it again.    I would just simply say with respect to the provisions of this bill,  and whether they are bipartisan, partisan or not, I suspect that  Representative LaMalfa, whose H.R. 4505 is in this bill, would  disagree. I suspect H.R. 5345, a bill introduced by Mr. Moore which is  also in this bill, I think tends to refute that fact.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Stanton).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Chair, I say thank you to my Republican colleague  and neighbor from Utah and that we are glad we can get his bill into  this important bipartisan Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act  package.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  O'Halleran).    Madam Chair, I have great respect for my colleague from  Washington, and we have worked together closely in the past.    I would just say that we are considering a number of amendments  today, including an amendment from the Republican leader, Mr. McCarthy,  who spent a great deal of time on the floor just a few moments ago  talking about his particular amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico  (Ms. Stansbury).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Madam Chair, I would say first, we are glad that we got  Mr. LaMalfa's H.R. 4505 into this bill, and I am looking forward to  supporting it today. I have to, again, respond to this argument that  has been made about the 10-year plan.   I would hope that my colleagues and I could agree to argue the merits  of the bill based on the text of the bill. The bill makes clear that  the activities that the Forest Service is mandated to implement include  the Wildfire Crisis Landscape Investments plan titled: ``Confronting  the Wildfire Crisis: Initial Landscape Investments to Protect  Communities and Improve Resilience in American's Forests'' dated April  2002. What is that document? That is  [[Page H7426]]  the 10-year plan that the Forest Service authorized that we voted for  back last November. So this codifies that and builds upon it by giving  the Forest Service more resources to do even more landscape restoration  and forest management across the country.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ruiz).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta), who has become a real leader  here in our caucus and in the Congress on forestry and forest  management.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Madam Chair, might I inquire how much time is remaining  for the respective sides.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I heard with great interest my colleague from  California's remarks. I have to say I did take umbrage with his  characterization of the bills within this omnibus package, as I think  he put it, as ``political messaging bills.''   I don't think that Mr. LaMalfa, a Republican from California, would  characterize his bill, the Tribal Biochar Promotion Act, as a political  messaging bill. His bill is in this bill.   I don't think that Mr. Moore, a Republican of Utah, would  characterize his bill, the Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin  States Program Act, as a political messaging bill. His bill is in this  bill.   I don't think that Ms. Lofgren would characterize her bill, the  Wildland Firefighter Fair Pay Act, as a political messaging bill. That  bill is before the House today.   That is probably the best place for me to begin to close.   We have heard a lot from the other side about various  mischaracterization's of firefighter pay and wildland firefighter pay  and what this bill does and does not do. For the benefit of every  American watching, I would encourage you to read the bill.   This body approved a pay increase for wildland firefighters a year  ago. All but 13 of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted  against it. You can check the Record. That pay increase expires a year  from now. This bill seeks to make that pay increase permanent.   One could only hope that my colleagues who have made much about  appropriating language will join me. I look forward to asking the  ranking member after this vote to join me on  [[Page H7431]]  the bill to appropriate the firefighter pay increase that this bill  will authorize.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I have great respect for the ranking member. We work  together and have had rigorous and robust debates about forest  management. We have partnered on some bills, and we have opposed each  other's respective positions on others. But the signs that the other  side have been using during this debate about firefighter pay and the  like are simply not true.   I understand if my colleagues on the other side believe that the  firefighter pay increase that is authorized by this bill and that makes  the pay increases that were authorized last year permanent, I  understand if they believe that it is too expensive. They are welcome  to make that argument. I disagree.   But I hope that every Member of this Chamber can, again, adhere to  substantive debate on the text of the bill that is before the House,  and the text of this bill authorizes an increase for wildland  firefighters who are bravely sacrificing so much for our country. It  authorizes additional dollars for the Forest Service to do incredibly  important forest management work to prevent the next fire in Colorado,  in Utah, in New Mexico, and in Arizona. The bill authorizes significant  investments to ensure that the drought we are experiencing at record  levels in the West can be addressed.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, even though I am not necessarily opposed.    I would simply say, Madam Chair, in the spirit of  bipartisanship--which I think has been reflective of so many of the  bills that are included within this important and critical package that  has been brought to the floor today--that I appreciate the arguments  that were made with respect to this particular amendment. I imagine  that Members are going to consider it thoughtfully and make a judgment  that is in the best interests of their constituents and their  respective States on this particular amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I certainly appreciate the gentlewoman's  support, her attention, and her description about the need for funding  to help rural communities recover from natural disasters and  emergencies. I certainly share the desire to ensure that rural  communities have access to clean and reliable drinking water.   I am looking forward to the House considering Mr. McCarthy's  amendment as well as the many Republican bills and bipartisan bills  that are included within this Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency  Act.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1808.   As the Chair, my fellow Coloradan, knows, just last year, we mourned  the loss of 10 individuals who were shot, murdered, at a grocery store  in Boulder, Colorado, in my district. Last week, we honored the 10-year  anniversary of the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting.   The people in our communities fear whether they are even safe to walk  into their local grocery store and buy food for their families without  the threat of gun violence.   Since the Federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, the scourge of  gun violence has only grown more pervasive across our country.   We have come together in the past to protect our communities. In  1994, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle  [[Page H7517]]  joined together to pass a similar piece of legislation to that that we  are voting on today.   I humbly ask my colleagues that we do the same this evening. Let's  pass this bill for our children and for safer communities.     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This will be a 5-minute vote.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 218,  nays 199, not voting 14, as follows:                               [Roll No. 414]                                 YEAS--218       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Auchincloss      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.
