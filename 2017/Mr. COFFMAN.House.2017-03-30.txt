 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Grandview  High School girls basketball team from Aurora, Colorado. The Wolves  triumphed in their 61-32 victory over Lakewood High School in the  Colorado 5A State Championship.   Grandview finished the season with an impressive 27-1 record and  celebrated the culmination of their season with the first girls  basketball State championship win for their school.   Senior Michaela Onyenwere walked off the court with a game-high of 25  points and 8 rebounds.   During the championship game, the Grandview Wolves proved that with  hard work, dedication, and perseverance anything is possible. The team  was led to the championship title through the committed leadership of  their coach, Josh Ulitzky, and his commendable staff.   Again, congratulations to the Grandview High School girls basketball  team on their continued success and for their victory in the Colorado  5A State Championship.                            ____________________
