 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my colleagues for  their unanimous support of H. Res. 793, which passed the House this  week.   I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution, calling  on Hamas to immediately release the 240 hostages taken during the  horrific and inexcusable attack on Israel on October 7.   In the 55 days since the attack, I have met with family members of  many of the hostages. They have experienced unimaginable pain and loss  but still have hope, and so do I.   I am deeply grateful to President Biden and his administration for  their leadership in negotiating the vitally important deal to release  many of the hostages. I am relieved that 110 of them have been reunited  with their loved ones, but we won't rest until every single one is home  safely.                            ____________________
