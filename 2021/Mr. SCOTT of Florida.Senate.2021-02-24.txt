 Mr. President, I first want to thank my  colleague from West Virginia and my colleague from Iowa for their focus  on getting our kids back in school.   I agree with the three r's: respect the science, reopen our schools  safely, and return our teachers and our children to our classrooms.   It has been almost a year since schools first shuttered due to COVID- 19. In many States across the Nation, unfortunately, schools remain  closed. The consequences are devastating. Being forced to stay at home  is taking a significant social and emotional toll, and it also directly  impacts our children's future.   Continuing to subject kids to this unnecessary virtual-learning  system is not backed by science or facts. I applaud my State of Florida  for getting schools reopened quickly and safely.   The science is overwhelming and clear about reopening our Nation's  schools. It is safe, and it is necessary for the well-being and the  future of students. The CDC confirmed last month that in-person  instruction does not pose an increased risk of community transmission.  Schools can and should be open, and they can do so safely.   We need to be honest about why we are even having this conversation  today. The only reason schools across the Nation remain closed is  because my Democratic colleagues and the Biden administration are  standing with teachers unions instead of standing up for our children.   For months, we have heard Democrats preach about following the  science, but now Democrats don't want to acknowledge the scientific  evidence that school reopenings are safe. They are blindly following  the teachers unions because they are afraid of losing campaign  contributions, and they are pushing a lie that schools can't reopen  without more taxpayer money.   Here is the truth: The funding they claim is absolutely necessary for  schools to reopen would not even be allocated for 2 or 3 years.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, Biden's COVID spending  bill would distribute only $6.4 billion to K-12 schools this year. The  remaining $122 billion would be spent between the years 2022 and 2028.   Here is another fact: Congress has already provided $68 billion for  K-12 schools, but so far States have spent just $4 billion of that  money. Schools don't need more money to open safely. Yet the Biden  administration keeps clinging to this lie and doing everything possible  to keep schools closed.   Last week, Speaker Pelosi said:         We want as many kids to be back in school as possible. For       that to happen, it takes some money.    Also last week, Vice President Harris would not directly answer  whether it is safe for teachers to go back to school if they are not  vaccinated, despite clear CDC guidelines that it is not a prerequisite  if other safety measures are in place.   And earlier this month, all 50 Senate Democrats voted against  students safely returning to classrooms even after teachers have been  vaccinated. We all agree that teachers should be able to receive  vaccinations. I will work with any of my colleagues on a way to get  vaccines to teachers more quickly.   We all agree that schools should have additional resources to ensure  our students and teachers have safe, clean, and healthy classrooms, and  we have allocated $68 billion to do just that right now. But keeping  schools closed doesn't make sense. It is hurting our children and  America's poorest families the most.   I grew up in a poor family that struggled to make ends meet, and  education was life-changing for me, just as it is for families across  our great country. Every student in this Nation deserves the option of  in-person learning.   It is time for the Biden administration to acknowledge that the best  place for children to learn is in the classroom, and it is time for my  Democratic colleagues and the President to stop putting union bosses  ahead of America's students and families.   Let's get our schools open now.   I yield the floor.
