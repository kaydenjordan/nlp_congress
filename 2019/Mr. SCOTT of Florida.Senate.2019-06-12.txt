 Mr. President, on June 12, 2016, our State was  attacked. Forty-nine innocent and beautiful lives were senselessly  lost, and the lives of countless families and loved ones were forever  changed.   The attack--an attack on America, our State, the city of Orlando, our  Hispanic and gay communities--was a terrorist attack. This act of  terrorism was an attempt to rip at the seams of our society, to divide  us, to instill fear in our hearts. But Floridians are strong.  Floridians are selfless. Floridians are fighters.   The days I spent in Orlando following the shooting will always be  with me. I talked to many parents who lost their children. I went to  funerals and wakes, and I sat in hospitals. It was one of the hardest  things I have ever done as Governor and as a parent.   Through our State's most challenging times, we also saw incredible  bravery and heroism. We saw it in the brave members of law enforcement  who selflessly ran into danger to help those in need; we saw it in the  doctors and nurses who tirelessly worked to save lives; and we saw in  the community that came together after this horrific tragedy to repair  and rebuild.   Three years removed from this unimaginable loss, our State is changed  forever. Every year on this day, the State of Florida stands united  with heavy hearts to honor the victims.   I vow to never forget that evil exists in this world, and we must  always stand up against those who wish to harm us. And we vow to always  remember the beautiful lives taken far too soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 246, submitted earlier  today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, Judge Rodney Smith has an  impressive record of honorably serving the State of Florida, and I am  proud to support his confirmation as a district judge for the Southern  District of Florida. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Florida  Agricultural and Mechanical University and a law degree from Michigan  State University, Judge Smith worked as a personal injury attorney. He  then pursued a career in public service as a senior assistant city  attorney for the city of Miami Beach, before his appointment to the  Miami-Dade County Court in 2008. In my role as Governor of Florida, I  had the honor of appointing Judge Smith to the Eleventh Judicial  Circuit Court in 2012. Judge Smith will continue to serve our State and  Nation well on the Federal bench.                        nomination of thomas p. barber    Madam President, I am honored to support Judge Thomas Barber to serve  as a district judge in the Middle District of Florida. Judge Barber  graduated from the University of Florida in 1985 and received a law  degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1992. Since  then, Judge Barber has served as an Assistant State Attorney, an  assistant Statewide prosecutor, and a circuit judge for the Thirteenth  Judicial Circuit of Florida. Our citizens deserves judges like Judge  Barber that are committed to enforcing our law, not legislating from  the bench. With his long and distinguished history of public service, I  have no doubt Judge Barber will serve Americans honorably as a Federal  judge.
