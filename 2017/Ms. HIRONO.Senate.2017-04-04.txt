 Mr. President, over the next hour, a number of my  colleagues and I will join together to speak in opposition to the  nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the U.S.  Supreme Court. We are joining together today because this nomination is  not just about the future of the Supreme Court. It is about the future  of our country.   There is no question about Judge Gorsuch's credentials or about his  intellect. He is a graduate of Columbia and Harvard and has been a  judge on the Tenth Circuit Court for more than a decade. In fact, his  credentials are in stark contrast to so many of the dangerously  unqualified individuals President Trump appointed to his Cabinet.   Judge Gorsuch should not get a pass simply because we are relieved  that President Trump didn't nominate a member of his family or a  reality television personality for this job. Credentials cannot and  should not be the only points we consider when evaluating a lifetime  appointment to the Supreme Court. In fact, we should expect that anyone  nominated to the Supreme Court will at least have impressive  credentials.   By many accounts, Judge Gorsuch would be the most conservative  Justice on the Court--even more conservative than Justice Thomas or  Justice Scalia. Rightwing advocacy groups cheered his nomination and  have spent over $10 million to support his nomination. They spent this  money because they have high confidence that he will rule in their  favor on so many of the tough cases that will come before the Supreme  Court. These groups, including the Heritage Foundation and the  Federalist Society, selected Judge Gorsuch because he meets their  litmus test for how they think a Justice should rule. They selected him  because they understood Judge Gorsuch clearly met the litmus test the  President outlined during his campaign.   To paraphrase, Donald Trump wanted a judge who would prioritize the  religious freedom of a corporation over the rights of its employees,  uphold an expansive view of the Second Amendment, making it much  tougher to enact sensible gun legislation to protect our communities,  and who would overturn Roe v. Wade--as Donald Trump put it-- automatically.   Judge Gorsuch's credentials are just a starting point. For the people  who need justice most urgently, Judge Gorsuch's view of the law and his  judicial philosophy will make a world of difference. The working  families, women, differently abled, people of color, the LGBTQ  community, immigrants, students, seniors, and our Native peoples are  the people who will be impacted by the decisions a Justice Gorsuch  would make.   Today, April 4, is Equal Pay Day, which means that it took women  until today to make the same amount that men made in 2016. Women have  had to work more than 3 months longer to catch up, on average, to men.   This significant pay disparity has existed for centuries, but it has  been illegal in the United States since the passage of the Equal Pay  Act in 1963. Proving illegal pay disparity under this law has been  challenging, as we all know.   Nationally, women are paid only 79 cents for every dollar a man is  paid. In Hawaii, women are paid only 82 cents for every dollar a man  makes. That is a little better than the rest of the country, but it is  in no way good enough.   At the median salary, that 82 cents translates into about $8,000 less  per year in wages for a woman in Hawaii. That is a lot of money in my  State, where the high cost of living makes it even more difficult for  working families to get ahead--not to mention that many working  families in Hawaii, as well as in other States, are headed by women. My  immigrant family was headed by my mother.   As we mark Equal Pay Day, I am well aware of the tremendous impact a  single Justice can have on the lives and rights of millions of  Americans.   Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court has issued  numerous 5-to-4 decisions that have favored corporate interests over  the rights of individuals--cases like Shelby County, Citizens United,  and Hobby Lobby.   One of the most deeply flawed of these 5-to-4 decisions was in a 2007  case called Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. That decision had  the effect of denying justice to a woman who had suffered pay  discrimination for more than a decade. The Court said, in effect, that  because Lilly Ledbetter didn't learn of the pay discrimination until it  was too late, our justice system could not help her.   Put another way, under the ruling, employers could discriminate  against women so long as the employers made sure the women didn't find  out about it.   This will not be hard to do, as employers are not likely to announce  that they are providing discriminatory pay to their female employees.  This is what happened to Lilly Ledbetter. She didn't know.   This decision was deeply wrong and surprised many Court watchers. It  undid years of judicial precedent.   I remember learning of this decision in Hawaii. I was serving on the  House Education and Labor Committee of the U.S. House of  Representatives at that time.   The Supreme Court decision interpreted a Federal law that fell within  the jurisdiction of the committee on which I sat. George Miller, then  chair of the committee, immediately announced that we would change the  law to be interpreted the way it had been before the Court applied  their own narrow and wrong interpretation.   We passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act with a Democratic Congress  in 2009. Frankly, I doubt a Republican-controlled House and Senate  would have done the same. It was the first bill President Obama signed  into law. I was there for that bill signing.   Though we could not retroactively help Mrs. Ledbetter, this law  reversed the Supreme Court's decision and assured that the injustice  she endured did not happen to other women or to anyone else. Clearly,  the composition of the Court and the identity of the fifth Justice  matters a great deal in the real world--the real world of 5-to-4  decisions.   Yet, during this hearing, Judge Gorsuch refused to even acknowledge  the role that judicial philosophy plays in the role of a Justice, and  he downplayed the impact the law could have on people's lives,  repeatedly saying he merely applied the law.   If Justices merely applied the law and the law was so clear, we  wouldn't have so many 5-to-4 decisions in the most critical cases.   Judge Gorsuch told me during our meeting in February that the purpose  of title III courts--these are the Federal courts--is to protect  minority rights. But I found through examining his writings and  decisions that Judge Gorsuch's view of the law lacks an understanding  of people, their lives, and how the courts' decisions would impact  them.   This was particularly true in examining his ruling in the Hobby Lobby  decision, where Judge Gorsuch demonstrated a cavalier attitude about  how his decision would impact the thousands of women working at the  Hobby Lobby company.   In that case, Judge Gorsuch decided that a corporation with tens of  thousands of employees--many of them women--has rights to the exercise  of religion protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and  that it could use those rights to deny to the thousands of women in its  employ access to contraceptive coverage.   During the hearing, I pressed Judge Gorsuch on whether he considered  what would happen to the thousands of women who worked at Hobby Lobby,  many of them working paycheck to paycheck who would now be denied  access to contraceptive coverage. He responded by saying: ``I gave  every aspect of that case very close consideration.''   I fail to see what consideration Judge Gorsuch gave to those female  employees. It is certainly not evident in the record.   Justice Ginsburg's dissent, when this case reached the Supreme Court  in Hobby Lobby, which Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Breyer joined, did  assess the real world impact this decision would have on women. Justice  Ginsburg wrote: ``The exemption sought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga  would . . . deny legions of women who do not hold their employers'  beliefs access to contraceptive coverage.''   In the Tenth Circuit's opinion, which Judge Gorsuch joined, and in  his own  [[Page S2195]]  concurrence, Judge Gorsuch showed grave concern with the potential  ``complicity'' of the Hobby Lobby's owners--these are the corporate  owners--in violating their beliefs, but he gave little or no  consideration to the compelling interest of these women and the  thousands of female employees in having access to contraceptive care.   Judge Gorsuch failed to address our concerns during this hearing.  Rather than recognizing the impact of his decision on thousands of  women who work at Hobby Lobby and millions more who work at companies  all across the country, Judge Gorsuch repeatedly said that if we didn't  like what the Court was doing, or what he was doing, then Congress  could change the law--as though that is such a simple thing.   This is not an academic exercise. This is about the real world  impact, not just of the Hobby Lobby decision but of decisions a Justice  Gorsuch would make for the next 25 years, from which there is no  appeal.   Judge Gorsuch's nomination raises so many serious concerns for women  across the country that I look forward to addressing over the next  hour.   During his hearing, Judge Gorsuch told us time and again to focus on  his whole record as a judge and not on certain cases or things he wrote  in books, articles, or emails.   In fact, my Republican colleagues have suggested that we are being  unfair when we try to look at the things he has said and written in  order to discern how Judge Gorsuch would approach cases if confirmed.  We wanted to get at his heart. We wanted to get at his judicial  philosophy.   Some of my colleagues have even gone so far as to suggest that by  raising legitimate questions about Judge Gorsuch's record as part of  our advice and consent responsibility, we are attacking judges in the  same way President Trump has done during his 2\1/2\ months in office.  This is fundamentally wrong and deeply misleading. It is like comparing  apples and oranges. That comparison doesn't begin to describe the  difference.   Two weeks ago, in the middle of Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearing,  President Trump renewed his vicious and unwarranted attack on Judge  Watson of Hawaii for blocking the President's unconstitutional Muslim  ban.   Although I wasn't then in the Senate, I recall that during Justice  Sotomayor's confirmation hearing, Republican after Republican ignored  almost the entirety of her 25 years on the Federal bench. Instead, they  focused, in question after question at her confirmation hearing, on a  gross misreading of one speech--one speech--she gave to a group of  young women about the value of diversity on the bench.   Republicans on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate twisted her  phrase ``wise Latina.'' That is a term she used in her speech. They  twisted her use of the phrase ``wise Latina'' well beyond meaning.   Looking at that speech, it is clear she meant to instill confidence  in young women and a sense that they, too, needed to participate in a  life of the law; that the law was not--is not--a place that excludes  them. Senate Republicans turned these words into a baseless attack to  undermine Justice Sotomayor's well-earned reputation of fairly applying  the law in thousands of cases that had appeared before her. She had  been on the bench for 25 years, but they focused on two words in one  speech she gave during that time. Many Republicans then cited that  speech to justify their opposition to her nomination.   So when I hear my Republican colleagues touting their fairness toward  President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, I recall not just their  omitting any mention of Justice Merrick Garland--the well-credentialed,  well-respected moderate whom they blocked from even having a hearing--I  also remember Justice Sotomayor. I remember my Republican colleagues  ignored her unanimously ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar  Association, her long record, and the tremendous chorus from the right  and the left supporting her historic nomination.   If confirmed, Judge Gorsuch's decisions will have a profound impact  on the country, not just during his time on the Court but for  generations to come. This is particularly true for women whose  constitutional right to an abortion will be threatened by a Justice  Gorsuch. During the Presidential campaign, Donald Trump laid out his  litmus test for nominating a Justice. He said, for example, that  overturning Roe v. Wade ``will happen automatically, in my opinion,  because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.'' That was  Candidate Trump's well-articulated litmus test, which he followed  through on in his nomination of Judge Gorsuch.   During his hearing, my colleagues and I tried to get a better sense  of how and whether Judge Gorsuch would follow the President and uphold  this constitutionally protected right. Based on his lack of response, I  am skeptical that a Justice Gorsuch would uphold this critical right  that generations of women fought to preserve.   In 1992, in Casey, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the core holding of  Roe that the right to an abortion is constitutionally protected. The  Court held that these decisions are protected because they are among  ``the most intimate and personal choices a person makes in a  lifetime.''   In his 2006 book on the future of assisted suicide, Judge Gorsuch  argued that Casey should be read more as a decision based merely on  respect for precedent rather than based on the recognition of  constitutional protections for ``personal autonomy'' or for ``intimate  or personal'' decisions. When I asked Judge Gorsuch about this,  although he recognized that Roe and Casey are precedents of the Supreme  Court, he did not go further and acknowledge that the Constitution  itself protects the right to make intimate and personal decisions.   In the time since Casey, the Court has relied on the protection for  intimate and personal choices to decide many nonabortion cases, such as  the Obergefell case, which recognized the right to marriage equality.  We need a Justice who understands and respects the importance of this  right--that it is the Constitution that provides protections for  intimate and personal decisions. Otherwise, I am concerned he will join  the Court and chip away at those protections.   Judge Gorsuch said that the judicial robe changes a person. This was  another way of telling us to ignore his own strongly held and  frequently expressed personal views and, indeed, his judicial  philosophy, which he continued to not discuss. Of course, if judicial  philosophy didn't matter, Senate Republicans would not have engaged in  the unprecedented act of blocking President Obama's nominee Merrick  Garland, a well-credentialed, well-respected, moderate nominee, from  even having a hearing. They held the seat open to be filled by the next  President, preferably, a Republican one.   In Neil Gorsuch, the Republicans got a nominee selected by rightwing  organizations that are counting on Judge Gorsuch to rule in accordance  with their very conservative views, which put corporate interests over  individual rights. That is why, to put it simply, who wears the  judicial robe matters.   Just as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation want Judge  Gorsuch to wear the robe, the people who come before the bench--the  millions of hard-working Americans whose lives will be affected by the  Court's decisions--want a Justice who will protect their rights. They  want a Justice who will wear the robe that protects their rights.   I note that I am joined by Senator Duckworth of Illinois, and I yield  time to her.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts  for her impassioned, well-reasoned, persuasive remarks.   All too often, Judge Gorsuch fixates on what we call the plain  meaning of a word in the law and decides on his own meaning that he  would give to that word. Sometimes he will resort to the Dictionary Act  or Webster's dictionary to ascertain what he would consider the plain  meaning of the law, but what he doesn't do time and again in very  important cases that impact lots of lives is that he doesn't look to  the context or the purpose of the law, to the point where sometimes his  decisions are just bizarre and lack common sense.   There was a reference made to the TransAm Trucking case where the  truckdriver was in freezing weather. The brakes on his truck were not  working properly, so he faced the choice of freezing to death or doing  something about it but then risking being fired. So he did something  about it. He got fired.   Judge Gorsuch, in his reading--a very, very narrow reading of a word  in the applicable provisions--deemed that his firing was correct. He  was asked by Senator Franken at the hearing: What would you have done  if you had been in that situation? There you are, you are about to  freeze to death, and you have a truck that is not operable in a safe  way unless you unhook the attachment to it. What would you have done?   Judge Gorsuch basically said: I don't know what I would have done. I  was not in his shoes.   What any of us would have said--of course we would have done what the  truck driver did. But in his very narrow reading of the words of the  applicable provision, he came to the decision he did. That is why he  could not respond to Senator Franken.   It is particularly important that Judge Gorsuch explain to us how he  would approach these kinds of cases. It is particularly important in  what I would describe as remedial legislation, such as the Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act, better known as IDEA. This is remedial  legislation that protects the educational rights of special needs  children. That is the population for which this law was enacted.   Judge Gorsuch had a case before him, and it was referred to by my  colleague from California. A young boy was not getting the kind of  educational opportunities that he should have gotten under IDEA, but  Judge Gorsuch read that remedial legislation, which should be broadly  interpreted to protect the class and the group that the law was passed  to help--he read it very, very narrowly.   He said that the school needed only to provide ``merely de minimus''  education for this child. He put in the words ``merely de minimus''  effort on the part of the school to provide this young boy with  educational opportunities. That was bad enough, but Judge Gorsuch added  the word ``merely.'' So during the time of his hearing, the Supreme  Court, in a related--basically the same law, IDEA, was at issue--and  the Supreme Court, while we were having the hearing on Judge Gorsuch's  nomination, unanimously overturned Judge Gorsuch's standard of ``merely  de minimus.'' Even the Roberts Court found Judge Gorsuch's standard of  review too limiting and too narrow.   So the young boy in question--his father testified at the  confirmation hearing. I asked him what he was thinking as the decision  of Judge Gorsuch came down. He said he knew that this decision would  negatively affect hundreds and hundreds of special needs children all  across our country.   This is why I sought assurance from Judge Gorsuch that he would be  the kind of Justice who understands, as he told me when I met with him,  that the purpose of title III, which are the Federal courts, is to  protect the rights of minorities. So I wanted reassurance from Judge  Gorsuch during his hearing. I tried time and again to get a sense of  his heart, what his judicial philosophy was. I was looking for the  reassurance that he was the kind of judge who understands the  importance of assuring that victims of discrimination cannot only ask  for but can also receive protections from the courts and who  demonstrates a commitment to the Constitutional principles that protect  the rights of women to make the intimate and personal decisions of what  to do with their own bodies.   Mr. President, I note that I am joined by my colleague from  Washington State, Senator Murray. I yield to her.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Murray, our  assistant Democratic leader, for her continuing, longstanding  leadership on behalf of women and families in our country.   Over the past hour, my colleagues and I have laid out a fair case  against confirming Judge Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. As we  approach a vote on his confirmation, I encourage my colleagues to  scrutinize Judge Gorsuch's judicial philosophy, even as he refused to  outline for us or describe for us what that philosophy is. But we have  come to certain conclusions based on 4 days of hearings. During his  hearing, Judge Gorsuch refused, as they say, time and again to answer  our questions on his judicial philosophy or his approach to the law. He  insisted that he was merely a judge, as if the use of the word ended  any discussion or scrutiny of his record.   Judge Gorsuch painted a picture for us of the Court that is really  straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting. He said during his hearing:  ``One of the beautiful things about our system of justice is that any  person can file a lawsuit about anything against anyone at any time . .  . and a judge, a neutral and fair judge, will hear it.''   Norman Rockwell painting--it is a wonderful idea that anybody can  file a claim to protect their rights or interests. It is also a  wonderful idea to assume that those claims will be heard and ruled upon  by neutral judges, apparently uninfluenced by their own strongly held  and frequently expressed personal views and judicial philosophy.   Many of my Republican colleagues have echoed this view and argued  that Judge Gorsuch's credentials should be enough--Columbia, Harvard.  They argue that it is wrong or even unfair to question how Judge  Gorsuch might approach the kinds of difficult issues that come before  the Supreme Court.   Of course, if judicial philosophy did not matter, then the  Republicans would not have engaged in the unprecedented act of blocking  President Obama's nominee--as I mentioned, Merrick Garland, a well- credentialed, well-respected moderate nominee--from even having a  hearing. In fact, many of the Republican Senators did not even extend  the courtesy of meeting with Judge Garland. They would not have held  the seat open to be filled by the appointee of a Republican President,  one selected for him by rightwing organizations.   When my colleagues and I asked Judge Gorsuch about his judicial  philosophy, he said that his words, his views, his writings, and his  clearly expressed personal views had no relevance to what he would do  as a Justice. He told us to look at his whole record, so I examined his  whole record. I saw in that record too little regard for the real-world  impact of his decisions. I saw a refusal to look beyond the words to  the meaning and intent of the law, even when his decisions lacked  common sense, as in the frozen truck driver case, and far too often, to  the benefit of big corporations and against the side of the little guy.   The decisions of judges have real-world impacts for millions of  people beyond the parties in a particular case. This is especially true  of the Supreme Court, which issues decisions that don't just reach  those in the case in front of them--the frozen trucker, the women who  work at Hobby Lobby faced with a lack of critical healthcare, the  special needs child entitled to educational opportunities under the  IDEA. The Supreme Court does not just interpret laws; the Supreme Court  shapes our society.    Will we be just? Will we be fair? Will America be a land of  exclusivity for the few or land of opportunity for the many? Will we be  the compassionate and tolerant America that embraced my mother, my  brothers, and me so many decades ago when we immigrated to this  country? These values seem too often absent from Judge Gorsuch's record  and from his view of the law and the Court.   The central question for me in looking at Judge Gorsuch and his  record and listening carefully through 4 days of hearings was whether  he would be a Justice for all of us, not just one for some of us. I  came to the conclusion that he would not be a Justice for all of us, so  I oppose his nomination.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Under the previous order, the  time until 5:30 p.m. will be controlled by the majority.   The Senator from Iowa.    Mr. President, when Senate Republicans executed their  unprecedented block of President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland, the  well-credentialed, well-respected, moderate chief judge of the DC  Circuit, they knew what they were doing. They were willing to set aside  the history and practice of the Senate to make sure no nominee of  President Obama's would fill the vacancy created by Justice Scalia's  death.   As fate would have it, a Republican won the Presidency and then, the  majority leader's path was clear. This is exactly what happened:  President Trump selected Neil Gorsuch from a list put together for him  by the ultraconservative Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society.  These organizations selected Judge Gorsuch because they want to  preserve the conservative 5-to-4 majority of the Roberts Court.   This majority has done terrible damage to many laws Congress has  passed to protect ordinary Americans, and has made it more difficult  for us to pass new laws. My colleagues and I have shined a spotlight on  these rightwing organizations and the $10 million campaign they have  run on Judge Gorsuch's behalf because they believe his view of the law  matches theirs. And therein lies our concern.   These organizations have spent so much money and worked so hard on  Judge Gorsuch's behalf because they could trust, perhaps not 100  percent of the time, but enough of the time, that Judge Gorsuch would  decide cases in ways they would agree with and support.   Judge Gorsuch is an Ivy League educated lawyer with 10 years on the  Federal bench. He is not naive. Even if he refused to acknowledge the  fact that these groups are supporting him, Judge Gorsuch knows as well  as we all do that politics have a real impact on the kinds of nominees  selected to serve on the Supreme Court.   We know he understands this because he said so in his 2005 National  Review Online article, which was entitled ``Liberals'N'Lawsuits.'' In  that article, he wrote that because Republicans had won elections for  the Presidency and for control of the Senate, the Republicans were in  charge of the judicial appointment process. As a result, he said, ``the  level of sympathy liberals pushing constitutional litigation can expect  in the courts may wither over time, leaving the Left truly out in the  cold.''    This article demonstrates that Judge Gorsuch understands that judges  appointed and confirmed by Republicans will have less sympathy for, as  he put it, ``liberals pushing constitutional litigation.'' Clearly,  judges do not make decisions divorced from their personal and  philosophical leanings. However often or however loudly they might  protest, conservatives understand that their arguments about the narrow  role of judges--their claims that Justices are there only to modestly  apply the law and adhere to the Constitution--are bunk. And Judge  Gorsuch must know this too.   Nowhere is this brand of conservative judicial activism clearer than  in the actions of the Roberts Court to reach into our elections to tilt  the political landscape--with a significant impact on whose votes are  heard in our political process and who is able to take part in our  elections.   Based on his writings, Judge Gorsuch clearly understands the  relationship between politics and the courts. I am convinced that  adding Judge Gorsuch to the Roberts Court will only continue the  Court's intervention into politics.   The actions of the Roberts Court are clear. This Court has issued a  series of decisions that have made it easier for conservative  organizations to spend unlimited and unregulated dark money on  elections, and that may have made it harder for people to vote, harder  for people to participate and have those voices heard in the political  process. These decisions have changed who is able to participate in the  democratic process, who gets elected, and, in turn, who gets nominated  to the Supreme Court.   Justice Felix Frankfurter's famous admonition that ``Courts ought not  to enter this political thicket'' captures the challenges for courts  treading into politics. Of course there are times when the courts must  do so--to ensure one person, one vote, for example. But courts must  also be careful when wading into politics because the legitimacy of the  court is itself put at risk.   The most memorable example, of course, came when the Court  effectively decided the 2000 Presidential election in Bush v. Gore.   In the Citizens United and Shelby County decisions, we have seen the  tremendous damage the Court can do to democracy when it tilts the  electoral process so heavily against ordinary Americans.   In the 2010 Citizens United decision, the Roberts Court struck down  bipartisan laws limiting campaign contributions that went back more  than a century. This decision opened an unrestrained flow of money and  potential corruption that has dominated our politics and drowned out  the voices of ordinary Americans ever since.   The Court's decision in this case was not an accident. Chief Justice  Roberts engineered the decision in that case by steering it away from  the narrow question before the Court about how to apply a particular  law and into a broad constitutional question. His efforts  [[Page S2380]]  demonstrate that the Supreme Court has broad power and latitude to push  and shape the law.   This kind of conservative judicial activism directly contradicts what  Justice Roberts famously said during his confirmation hearing. He said  the job of a Justice is to simply call balls and strikes.   Jeffrey Toobin, in a 2012 article in the New Yorker entitled, ``Money  Unlimited: How Chief Justice John Roberts orchestrated the Citizens  United decision,'' and in his recent book, ``The Oath,'' recounts very  clearly how Chief Justice Roberts engineered this campaign spending  decision.   The question originally presented to the Supreme Court in Citizens  United, according to Toobin's account, was a narrow one. It involved  whether one of the provisions of the bipartisan McCain-Feingold  campaign finance law applied to a documentary criticizing a candidate  and not just to television commercials. In fact, Ted Olson, the well- known conservative lawyer representing Citizens United, the  organization that wanted to run the documentary, made a narrow argument  that the McCain-Feingold law was not meant to apply to that kind of  documentary. This was an argument based not on the Constitution, but on  deciding the case before the Court in the narrowest possible way. Such  a decision would have been restrained.   It became clear during oral arguments that the conservatives on the  Court had the opportunity not just to apply the law, but to change it  entirely. Chief Justice Roberts and the other conservative Justices on  the Court began to do this by aggressively questioning the government's  lawyer on issues not then directly before the Court. As Toobin  describes, ``Through artful questioning, Alito, Kennedy, and Roberts  had turned a fairly obscure case about campaign-finance reform into a  battle over governmental censorship.''   Now that it was clear to Chief Justice Roberts that there was a  majority on the court for making a broader constitutional decision, he  ordered that the case be reargued, rather than simply deciding the  narrow question argued by both Olsen and the government's attorney.  Chief Justice Roberts wanted the Court to take head-on a question that  was not in fact before it and which the Court had decided the opposite  way only 6 years before. When the Roberts Court decided Citizens United  the following year, after reargument, it did so on the broadest  possible ground--unconstitutional grounds--and found that corporations,  like people, have First Amendment rights. It found that these rights  could be violated by limits on campaign contributions.    Again, this outcome did not happen by accident; Chief Justice Roberts  engineered the result. According to Toobin's account, Chief Justice  Roberts chose to assign the opinion for the majority to Justice  Kennedy, who was known to be very skeptical of campaign finance laws  and believed that limits on campaign spending violate free speech. By  doing so, Chief Justice Roberts ensured that the Citizens United  decision would be a broad one, and it was.   The way the Court chose to reach out and change the law was wholly  unnecessary to decide the case at hand. And it certainly was not  judicial restraint; it was judicial activism. The Court in Citizens  United reached out to overturn precedent and upend laws dating back  more than a century to find new rights for corporations to funnel  untold millions into our political system.   This decision also severely limited the ways in which Congress could  take action to continue to pursue the aims of campaign finance laws to  limit political corruption.   In his article, Mr. Toobin said:         [Citizens United] reflects the aggressive conservative       judicial activism of the Roberts Court. It was once liberals       who are associated with using the courts to overturn the work       of the democratically elected branches of government, but the       current Court has matched contempt for Congress with a       disdain for many of the Court's own precedents.        When the Court announced its final ruling on Citizens       United, on January 21, 2010, the vote was five to four and       the majority opinion was written by Anthony Kennedy. Above       all, though, the result represented a triumph for Chief       Justice Roberts. Even without writing the opinion, Roberts,       more than anyone, shaped what the Court did.    But the Roberts Court was not done with its activism to radically  change the landscape of our elections. In another narrow 5-to-4  decision in Shelby County in 2013, the Court substituted its  conclusions for that of Congress and gutted core protections of the  Voting Rights Act--protections which were essential for the right to  vote for millions of Americans. Again, this was not a decision the  Court needed to or should have reached. And again, it was a decision  engineered by Chief Justice John Roberts and the conservative majority  on the Supreme Court.   Back in 1982, Chief Justice Roberts--then a special assistant to the  Attorney General--was the point person for the Reagan administration's  opposition to strengthening the Voting Rights Act. At that time,  Congress acted to fix a hole in the Voting Rights Act that the Supreme  Court had opened in a 1980 decision. John Roberts was opposed to these  efforts to make clear that election practices or procedures that result  in discrimination, not only those with the intent to discriminate,  violate the Voting Rights Act.   In 1982, Congress successfully passed their fix over the objections  of John Roberts and the Reagan administration. If you look at John  Roberts' memos and articles from that period of time--in which he was a  strong advocate within the administration for the position it took--his  view of the Voting Rights Act was clear. It was a view he would apply  years later as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when he led a 5-to-4  majority to gut section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.   The preclearance provisions of section 5 mandated that any changes to  voting laws in States with a long history of discrimination have to be  approved in advance--or precleared--by the Justice Department or by the  DC district court. These provisions, passed a century after the  conclusion of the Civil War, for the first time effectively guaranteed  the rights protected by the 14th and 15th Amendments in many parts of  the country. Section 5 changed the landscape of our democracy and  opened the door for millions of people to exercise their right to vote.   These provisions of the Voting Rights Act were reauthorized nearly  unanimously by Congress in 2006. Before reauthorizing the Voting Rights  Act, the Senate Judiciary Committee alone held nine hearings on it. The  thousands of pages of material the Senate reviewed, together with the  record developed in a dozen hearings in the House, clearly established  why it was so important to maintain preclearance in order to protect  the right to vote in jurisdictions with a long history of voting  discrimination.   Yet, in Shelby County, the Roberts Court ignored this evidence and  the Court's long precedent. The Court made its own determination about  the value of the extensive evidence reviewed by Congress and struck  down these core provisions. The Court refused to defer to the extensive  findings and determination of Congress even though Congress is  expressly charged by the 14th and 15th Amendments to enforce the  guarantees of those Amendments--the guarantee of the right to vote. The  Court did what John Roberts fought to do years before and weakened the  Voting Rights Act. So much for judicial restraint. So much for just  calling balls and strikes.   A Justice and a Court devoted to judicial restraint, with an  understanding of the separation of powers, never would have ignored  Congress acting at the height of its constitutional powers and its  factfinding capacity. Yet Chief Justice Roberts and the narrow  conservative majority on the Court chose to act--to reach out and to  gut one of the core protections of the fundamental right to vote.   We now know that Congress got it right and the Supreme Court got it  wrong in its judgment about the continuing need for section 5 of the  Voting Rights Act. Immediately after the Shelby County decision,  numerous States previously covered by section 5 immediately passed  onerous voter ID laws and other barriers that affected the right to  vote of millions of people. Some of these laws were even enacted with  discriminatory intent, not just discriminatory effect--in other words,  they were blatantly meant to discriminate in voting.    These newly raised barriers had a clear impact in last year's  elections.  [[Page S2381]]  For the first time in two generations, thanks to the actions of the  Roberts Court, we risk unraveling the progress my friend John Lewis  fought for alongside so many others during the civil rights movement.   During his confirmation hearing, I asked Judge Gorsuch about the  Shelby County decision, since he often explained the constraints on his  approach to judicial decision making in terms of the separation of  powers. He said several times that judges make terrible legislators,  that courts lack the staff, capacity, and training to do the kind of  factfinding that is an essential part of the legislative process. Yet,  when I asked him whether the Court's decision in Shelby County raised  the kinds of concerns he had noted about the limits of judges as  policymakers and legislators, he declined to answer.   But this is about more than Judge Gorsuch's refusal to answer. It is  about more than the narrow view he expressed of the role of a judge or,  particularly, a Justice--a narrow view that is not a reflection of the  real world. Both the process and the outcome in Shelby County and in  Citizens United raised exactly the kinds of concerns that make it so  important for the Senate to understand Judge Gorsuch's judicial  philosophy before putting him on the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch would  become part of a newly empowered 5-to-4 conservative majority on the  Roberts Court, which has been anything but restrained in moving the law  for the benefit of corporations and against individual rights.   Taken together, these two decisions, Citizens United and Shelby  County, have made it harder for millions of Americans to have their  voices heard in our election process and their votes counted at the  ballot box. Since Citizens United, the floodgates have opened to  unfettered corporate money in our elections. Since Shelby County, 13  States have enacted laws placing limitations on voting. Many of these  are in States that would have been prevented from doing so in the first  place before the Court gutted section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. After  Shelby County, these States could pass such laws, and they did,  disenfranchising tens of thousands of voters in the process.   My Democratic colleagues and I asked Judge Gorsuch many questions to  try to understand his pattern of narrowly interpreting laws meant to  protect individual rights or worker safety in ways at odds with the  law's purpose. For example, the narrow interpretation Judge Gorsuch  took on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, would  have left Luke Perkins and thousands of special needs children like  Luke without a chance to make educational progress. His interpretation  was so at odds with the purpose of the IDEA law that the Supreme Court  unanimously rejected and criticized Judge Gorsuch's narrow standard in  a case they decided just a few weeks ago.   Time and again, Judge Gorsuch threw up his hands and told us that if  we disagreed with this narrow reading of the relevant law, that  Congress should do better. In his view, the problem was not the Court-- which he seemed to cast as an innocent bystander--but, rather, the way  Congress had written the law.   By tilting the political playing field so heavily toward corporations  and unfettered dark money and against individuals, the Roberts Court  has impacted the composition of who is in Congress. The Court has made  it even harder for Congress to take meaningful action to, say, pass  laws to protect workers' safety or the access of students with special  needs to an education. In turn, these decisions have had a real-world  impact by changing who gets to participate in the political process and  therefore who gets elected and who has input on the kinds of laws that  are passed--and, of course, who gets nominated to the U.S. Supreme  Court.   The actions of the Roberts Court in Citizens United and Shelby County  make clear the stakes of the Gorsuch nomination. They make clear what  the Senate Republicans had in mind in their unprecedented and arrogant  refusal to consider President Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to  the Supreme Court. They wanted, instead, a Justice like Judge Gorsuch  who would continue the rightward march of the 5-to-4 conservative  majority on the Roberts Court. And the United States Senate should not  allow this brazen gambit to succeed.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this nomination.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
