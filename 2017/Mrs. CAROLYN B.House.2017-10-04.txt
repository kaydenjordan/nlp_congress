 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this budget.   Ultimately, a national budget is like a deal between the American  taxpayers and Congress about how this country will spend their money.  Anyone who looks at the fine print in this budget plan can tell, with a  glance, that the American people want, need, and deserve a better deal.   In the Republican tax plan that goes with this budget, 80 percent of  the Republican tax cuts go to the top 1 percent. The top 1 percent gets  an average of $200,000 in tax cuts.   A better deal would drop plans to slash Medicare and Medicaid to pay  for massive tax cuts for the wealthiest few--a deal that instead would  be a bipartisan effort to bring middle class tax relief, badly needed  investments, and greater opportunity.   But what we have instead is a budget that cuts $5.4 trillion in  spending over 10 years, including $4.4 trillion in cuts to the  mandatory programs that help average Americans get and stay ahead.  [[Page H7794]]    These aren't just paper cuts. These are huge cuts--cuts that would  cause enormous damage in the lives of children, students, veterans, and  other Americans. About half of these cuts in nondefense spending are in  programs that help people who need the help the most--cuts in programs  that provide food to those in need, programs that help students from  low-income families afford a college education. They even have cuts in  the badly needed disaster relief that is helping so many in our  country.   In fact, by 2027, more than one-third of the resources for low- and  middle-income people would be gone. Struggling Americans deserve a  better deal than that. And who pays under the Republican tax plan?  Seniors, single parents, and middle class families, it goes up.   Nondefense discretionary is already at its lowest level since the  category has been tracked. Republicans want to cut even more, and so  they target senior citizens and healthcare.   This budget cuts half a trillion dollars from Medicare, replacing  Medicare's guaranteed benefits with a voucher-like system and  increasing its eligibility age to 67.                                time  1630    The CBO estimates that these cuts would cause part B premiums to  increase 25 percent by 2020. And this budget claims that it ``saves''  $1.5 trillion by repealing the Affordable Care Act, even though they  have already tried to repeal it about 60 times on this floor, without  success, thank God, and the American people have made it clear that  they don't want it repealed.   They still have no replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act. So  that means that they would just be leaving millions without health  insurance and threatening the coverage of all those with preexisting  conditions and chronic illnesses, and would leave millions facing huge  premium increases.   Their plan also cuts $114 billion from Medicaid, ripping away  coverage from low-income families and the disabled. This is just plain  wrong. Our seniors deserve a much better deal than that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, 80 percent of the  Republican tax cuts go to the top 1 percent, and the top 1 percent gets  an average of $200,000 in tax cuts. And what we see in this budget is a  slashing of investments in the future strength of our country.   Instead of slashing infrastructure spending, as this budget does, we  should be increasing our spending to fill the giant infrastructure  pothole that Republican policies have left us with.   We have airports that feel Third World. We have bridges that are  crumbling, tunnels that need replacing, roads that need fixing. Failing  to do so costs all of us in time, money, and economic development.   This budget totally fails to recognize the value of infrastructure  investment. It cuts $254 billion from transportation over 10 years.  Funding would drop from $92 billion next year to just $65 billion in  2022.   It eliminates the Transportation Investment Generating Economic  Recovery grant program used for infrastructure development and repair  projects for interstate highways, bridge improvements, and ports. This  is incredibly shortsighted.    According to a study by the American Society of Civil Engineers,  failing to close the infrastructure investment gap brings serious  economic consequences: $3.9 trillion in losses to the U.S. GDP by 2025;  $7 trillion in lost business sales in 2025; and 2.5 million lost  American jobs in 2025.   I have seen with my own eyes what infrastructure development can mean  to business development and the quality of life in the city that I  serve. The Second Avenue Subway, built with the help of Federal funds,  opened in January and has already had a huge economic impact. Stores  say their business is up 20 to 30 percent along that line and it has  cut overcrowding and reduced traveling times.   New York's old Kosciuszko Bridge, which was first opened in 1939, was  originally designed for 10,000 vehicles a day. It was carrying 18 times  that and had become an accident choke point.   Thanks to Federal funding, it has been replaced, and the biggest city  in the country will have a brand-new, 21st century bridge soon because  these kinds of investments boost productivity and bolster our economy,  with each $1 in infrastructure investment  [[Page H7795]]  generating up to $1.80 in additional economic activity.   The American Society of Civil Engineers gives our national  infrastructure an overall grade of D-plus and our transit system a D- minus. It is just plain irresponsible to slash spending on our  crumbling highways and bridges now, because if we don't make needed  investments today, we will jeopardize our competitiveness tomorrow.   Let's be clear: we are already significantly underinvesting in  infrastructure. As you can see from this chart, public investments in  infrastructure and other public fixed assets have fallen over the last  few years, dropping to a low of $274 billion in 2014, from more than  $357 billion in 2009.   We have created a giant infrastructure spending pothole that you see  right here. All told, it costs our Nation more than half a trillion  dollars in lost investment over 5 years.   The people of this country deserve modern infrastructure. They  deserve a better deal.   This budget also cuts $154 billion from nutrition, from the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, ignoring the more than 40  million low-income families, including children, the working poor, the  elderly, and the disabled, to say nothing of the 8 million people,  including 4 million children it lifts out of poverty. The hungry  children of America deserve a better deal than that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, in 2001, some of  our colleagues across the aisle said many of the same things we are  hearing today about the miracle of tax cuts: that huge tax cuts for the  most fortunate would pay for themselves, and that they would help grow  our economy by trickling down through the miracle of so-called dynamic  scoring.   But as we know from history, that was not the case. One year after  the Bush tax cuts in 2002, here is what Brookings Institute said was  happening in real life:         Our findings suggest that Bush tax cuts will reduce the       size of the future economy, raise interest rates, make taxes       more aggressive, increase tax complexity, and prove fiscally       unsustainable.    A year after that, in 2003, the Brookings Institute said: ``Over the  past 2 years our country has experienced a dramatic deterioration in  the Federal budget outlook.''   In January 2001, when President George Bush took office, the  Congressional Budget Office projected surpluses of $5.6 trillion--as in  ``T,'' trillion--from 2000 to 2011.   But in 2011, nearly a decade after the GOP promised their budget  would unleash the economy through tax cuts for the wealthy and budgets  that cut services to the vulnerable, this is what we found, from  National Public Radio: ``Conservatives often promote tax cuts as a way  to stimulate economic growth, but the years after 2001 were marked by  the slowest growth since World War II.''   All of us remember when President Obama came to office that this  country was shedding 800,000 jobs a month and it was a long time to dig  ourselves out of that big Republican hole and get us moving in the  right direction with job growth.   So let's not go down that road again. I call upon my colleagues to  remember history.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to  [[Page H7796]]  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my distinguished colleague.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional  2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, just to remind my colleagues, the nonpartisan Tax Policy  Center points out that 80 percent of the Republican tax cuts go to the  top 1 percent.   But in this budget resolution that we are discussing, it slashes  education funding, putting the drain of a college education for average  Americans even further out of reach. It asks the American people who  already experience crippling student loan debt to reach even deeper  into their pockets for their education by cutting $211 billion from  student financial aid programs.                                time  1700    It freezes the maximum level awarded by a Pell grant at $5,900,  covering just 23 percent of an education by 2026, compared to the 30  percent it covers today or the 77 percent it covered in 1980. In  addition, it also cuts $3.3 billion from the Pell grant surplus, which  provides a much-needed reserve to cover the cost of future education.   If that is not enough, after students graduate, this budget makes it  increasingly difficult to pay off student loans and steers graduates  away from public service and teaching jobs by eliminating the Public  Service Loan Forgiveness and Teacher Loan Forgiveness programs. Our  students and our teachers deserve a better deal than that.   I must say that we are suffering from three hurricanes, devastating  hurricanes, yet this budget eliminates three programs that play very  key roles in disaster relief. The Community Development Block Grant  program, AmeriCorps, and the Legal Services Corporation are all  eliminated. This budget abolishes these programs that are literally  supporting our relief efforts from Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   Our Nation's veterans--our Nation's veterans--our bravest, are not  spared the carnage of this heartless proposal. The GOP budget proposes  $50 billion in cuts to mandatory spending on veterans programs over 10  years, including education benefits and loan guarantees. So after we  have already asked so much of our men and women in uniform, this budget  refuses to give them the tools they need to transition to civilian  life. Our veterans deserve a better deal than that from the country  that they have served so honorably.   Cuts to research, where research is the future of our country, and  this budget would also cut investments that are directly tied to our  country's future prosperity by slashing basic research funding.   I want to point out how important research funding is to our country.  In 1996, two Stanford graduate students took a $4.5 million research  grant from the National Science Foundation and developed a new  algorithm called PageRank. Two years later, these same students took  PageRank and launched a new internet search engine we now call Google.  Today Google is worth over $600 billion and employs over 72,000  Americans, and it all began with a Federal basic research grant of $4.5  million.   Google is just one example on a long list of technological  advancement companies and, most importantly, jobs that trace their  roots to basic research investment. It is what has kept this country on  top.   According to the Brookings Institution, two-thirds of the most  influential technologies over the past 50 years were supported by  Federal research grants. It has brought us lifesaving vaccines, the  laser, touchscreen, GPS, and even the internet, technology that has  served as a launching pad for cutting-edge medical treatment.   Sadly, the chart behind me reflects a sharp decline in the Federal  share of funding of basic research dropping from 72 percent in 1967 to  44 percent in 2015. This GOP budget proposal follows that same trend  with instructions to cut $41 billion from science, space, and  technology precisely at a time when we should be increasing investments  in these sectors.   It is important to the future prosperity of America. Cuts now mean  fewer jobs and economic growth in the future; they mean less innovation  and less prosperity. So if my colleagues across the aisle want to grow  the economy, turning this trend around is an important way to do it.   Now, I have heard all day from my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle how very, very concerned they are about the deficit, but the GOP  tax plan makes it worse. The tax framework released last week by the  White House and Republican leaders would add $2.4 trillion to the  deficit in the first 10 years and another $3.2 trillion in the next 10  years.   So the Republican budget is just totally unacceptable. This budget  flat-out ignores the reality. So if Republicans are concerned about the  deficit, then they should really rewrite their budget proposal.   In conclusion, look at the fine print of this proposed deal and  imagine the harm it would cause to millions of American families, to  our children, to our seniors, to our sick and suffering, to our  disabled and our destitute, to our economy, to our research, and to our  infrastructure. It is clear--clear--beyond any and all doubt that  Americans deserve a better deal.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I request the amount  of time that is remaining.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, in closing, I believe that this proposal that is before us  is an absolute disaster. We should be charting a fundamentally  different course.   When you listen to people around their dinner table in America  tonight, they would be talking about their concerns in education,  infrastructure, jobs, healthcare, security, environment, and disaster  relief. But this plan delivers, instead, deep and sometimes disabling  cuts to badly needed programs for millions in order to give away  benefits to a fortunate few. This is just plain wrong. Budgets are  about values and priorities, and the people of this country deserve  better.   We should not be cutting our education spending. Failing to train the  world's most highly educated workforce is irresponsible and puts our  entire economy at a disadvantage. We should be investing more in  education at every level--early education and high schools--motivating  students to become engaged in science, technology, math, and  engineering. We should be leading the way in developing new and  improved technical and trade training programs for those who would  prefer it. We should be doing more, not less, to make college and  postgrad study affordable once again. To do anything less is to fail in  our obligation to the rising generation.   We already trail much of the economically advanced world when it  comes to healthcare. We get sicker, die sooner, and pay more for our  care than most developed nations. Millions are just one serious illness  away from financial ruin. But this budget plan would cut spending for  healthcare, and this budget would weaken the pillars of financial  security for our seniors. The proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid  will come at the expense of seniors, the disabled, and the middle  class.   Mr. Chairman, we cannot afford this budget. I urge my colleagues to  reject it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
