 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, after 2 weeks of delay, we have now  seen the revised Republican TrumpCare bill. It appears that little has  changed to the core of the bill.   The Republican TrumpCare bill still slashes Medicaid. The cuts are  every bit as draconian as they were in the previous version--a  devastating blow to rural hospitals, to Americans in nursing homes, to  those struggling with opioid addiction, and so many more. The  Republican TrumpCare bill still allows insurers to charge older  Americans five times or more than they charge younger Americans.  Premiums for so many people aged 55 to 64 will go way up. Americans in  their sixties could be paying tens of thousands of dollars more than  they do today. The Republican TrumpCare bill still blocks funding to  Planned Parenthood, limiting access to affordable healthcare for  millions of women.  [[Page S3967]]    So what is new in the bill? Well, it appears that Republicans have  included a new $60 billion tax break on health savings accounts, which  only benefits those wealthy enough to afford putting money into them.  For Americans who are struggling to pay for insurance coverage, for the  average family who sits down on a Friday evening and says: How are we  going to pay our existing bills, and for middle-income families who  struggle to make ends meet, a tax break on health savings accounts will  not help. It will only help wealthier Americans, who sometimes use  these accounts as tax shelters.   It appears the Republican TrumpCare bill includes something like the  Cruz amendment, which makes the overall bill even worse than before.  The Cruz amendment causes costs to go up by letting insurers sell  cutrate insurance policies with lower premiums but huge, huge  deductibles and copays, so that out-of-pocket costs would actually go  up, not down, even if premiums are lower.   The Cruz amendment drives Americans with preexisting conditions into  markets with unaffordable coverage. They virtually would have no  coverage at all. Even Senator Chuck Grassley said the amendment would  likely ``annihilate the pre-existing condition requirement.'' The Cruz  amendment will likely cause death spirals in the insurance markets for  Americans who need coverage the most. Even the conservative American  Action Forum said the Cruz amendment is ``the definition of a death  spiral.''   From what we are seeing, the new Republican TrumpCare bill is every  bit as mean as the old one, and, in one big way, it is even meaner,  with the addition of something like the Cruz amendment.   Moderate Republicans looking at this bill should be able to see that  the incredibly modest changes to the tax provisions--the small pot of  funding for opioid abuse treatment and these other tweaks around the  edges--are like a drop in the bucket compared to what the bill does to  Medicaid, to seniors, and to Americans with preexisting conditions. It  is clear that the core of this bill will remain until the bitter end.   So a vote on the motion to proceed will be a vote on the core of this  bill. It is a vote on the idea that middle-class Americans and seniors  should pay more for less healthcare. It is a vote on the idea that it  should be harder for the neediest Americans to afford healthcare. It is  a vote on the idea that corporations and special interests deserve  another tax break.   If you are for that idea, vote yes on the motion to proceed. But my  Republican friends should not be tempted by the promise of amendments  to fix this bill. It is clear that the Republican leadership wants and  needs to keep the core of this bill--a dagger to the heart of Medicaid  and tax giveaways for corporations and special interests--to the bitter  end.   Republicans keep talking about needing to change the status quo on  healthcare, but you don't change the status quo to make it worse. That  is what this bill would do. This is far, far worse than the status quo.  We, Republicans and Democrats, can work together to actually improve  our healthcare system, to stabilize the marketplaces, and to reduce the  costs that average Americans pay for their healthcare, particularly for  prescription drugs.   We can do it, but my Republican friends need to abandon this  wrongheaded, partisan, behind-closed-doors approach, and they ought to  do it on the motion to proceed next week.                            ____________________     Madam President, we Democrats sent a letter to our  Republican colleagues laying out our principles on appropriations so  that Republicans would know exactly where we stand and we could avoid  the possibility of their shutting down the government. We have three  principles: relief from damaging sequestration cuts, parity between  defense and jobs and economic growth funding, and no poison pill  riders, like the ineffective border wall. These are the same principles  we laid out during the last budget negotiation, which resulted in a  strong and bipartisan package.   But on Tuesday--which is why I am on the floor speaking--the House  Appropriations Committee released a draft of its Homeland Security  bill, which includes funding for an unnecessary, ineffective, and  expensive border wall with Mexico, paid for by American taxpayers,  breaking the President's promise, repeatedly given, that Mexico would  pay for it. The bill also funds an unacceptable deportation force and  unnecessary detention beds.   The President's budget calls for funding a new eminent domain strike  force--a team of Trump lawyers that the administration wants to send to  the border to take private land away from the American people to build  this wall. This proposal has met with stiff resistance from homeowners  living in border communities. Republicans and Democrats on both sides  of the aisle have rightfully come out against this proposal. Not a  single border State Republican supports the idea. The Senate should  reject it outright.   If House Republicans keep on this path--the path of these poison pill  amendments and dramatic cuts in programs that help working Americans--I  fear they are steering us toward a train wreck.   Remember, the President said he wanted a shutdown. He tweeted earlier  this year: ``Our country needs a good `shutdown' in September to fix  mess!'' He wants one. His budget director, Mick Mulvaney, has always  been for a shutdown. By including border wall funding in their proposal  and dramatically cutting domestic spending, House Republicans,  unfortunately, are playing right into their game.   I urge my Republican colleagues, please, let cooler heads prevail. To  my Republican friends in the Senate, I would say persuade your  colleagues in the House to abandon this dangerous, irresponsible path  they put us on, which can only lead to a government shutdown. I guess  they want it.   We should be working together on a responsible way forward on  appropriations, in line with the principles we laid out which produced  a successful bipartisan deal on the last budget.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.                            ____________________     Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first,  there is no one I have more respect for on either side of the aisle  than the Senator from Arizona. He said some nice words about me, and I  extend them back to him five times over. He is a fine man. He has great  integrity, great courage, great service to our country, and no one has  helped defend America more--both when he was in the Armed Forces and  here on the Senate floor--than the gentleman. I respect that.   I respect that you always try to put yourself in the other person's  moccasins. That was one of the great Indian proverbs.   I know he is doing that, as he mentioned in his remarks.   I would like to make a couple of quick points.   First, our Republican leader has chosen this week to proceed with  three nominees under regular order. He could have advanced this nominee  and a few others from the DOD but instead chose a district court judge  in Idaho, a nominee to OMB, Ambassador to Japan. So I say to my good  friend from Arizona, given the frustration he remarked on that our side  has on healthcare, which is so important to so many--as is keeping a  strong and fully staffed Defense Department--I would say to the  gentleman that we would be happy to consider the nominee in the regular  order. And maybe once things change a little bit on healthcare, with  the consent of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, we can move a  lot of things quickly. But at this point, despite my great respect for  my dear friend, I must object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   Mr. McCAIN. Before the Democratic leader leaves, may I ask one more?   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. on Monday, July  17, the Senate proceed to executive session for consideration of  Executive Calendar No. 157. I further ask that there be 30 minutes of  debate on the nomination equally divided in the usual form and that  following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on  confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or debate,  and that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.   Before I ask for a ruling on that, may I just say that the Senator  from New York has a legitimate comment. Why in the world we would be  wasting time on the Ambassador to Japan when we have the Department of  Defense nominees in line is something I can neither account for, nor  can I condone. So I understand the frustration of the Senator from New  York.   Maybe sometime after our 2 weeks in August, perhaps some of us ought  to sit down and talk and work out an agenda. We have a train wreck  coming, as the Senator from New York knows. We have the debt limit. We  have appropriations bills to pass. We have all these things piling up,  we have about 30 days to do it in, and so far, I have seen no plan to  address these challenges.   The only way we are going to address some of these challenges, I say  to my colleagues, with their partisanship and anger and dislike of  anybody who lives over there, the fact is that we need to work together  to work these things out, and we can do it without betraying principle,  but we can also do it by understanding the priorities and the  dedication and patriotism of those on the other side of the aisle.   So I understand the Senator from New York. I don't agree with the  Senator from New York, but I understand his frustration. So I renew my  consent request.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?    Reluctantly, again, I must object. But I would say to my  colleague from Arizona, I would like very much to sit down and work out  these other problems. I think that if he and I sat in a room together,  we could figure these things out ourselves pretty well, and it would be  our job to persuade our colleagues to try to do the same. I understand.  I used the same words--``train wreck''--earlier this morning. If we  don't come to a good agreement, for instance, on appropriations and the  budget, the defense forces that he so dearly holds and so many of the  issues on our side would be hurt dramatically--the country would. So I  promise him, I will endeavor to work with him in the most good-faith  way.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   Mr. McCAIN. May I ask one more question of the Democratic leader?  When would Mr. Shanahan's nomination be in order?    Reluctantly, again, I must object. But I would say to my  colleague from Arizona, I would like very much to sit down and work out  these other problems.

When would Mr. Shanahan's nomination be in order?    I think if it is filed--it will be up to the Republican  leader. If it is filed tonight, the cloture motion would be voted on  Monday night, and then maybe we could talk about--with the permission  of my colleagues from the other side--speeding it up after that.   Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.
