 Mr. Speaker, the opioid crisis touches  nearly every family in West Virginia, with too many lives lost to the  disease of addiction. It is an issue I hear about every day.   As the opioid epidemic forces increasing numbers of children into  foster care, we see more and more grandparents being left to raise  their grandchildren. These grandparents face the task of caring for  young children while navigating a complex child welfare system.                                time  1030    Many have little support and are also coping even with their adult  child's addiction.   We must make it easier for grandparents who love and care for their  grandchildren to navigate the system. Bills like the Assisting States'  Implementation of Plans of Safe Care Act aim to make it easier for  families to gain custody of kids who have been removed from their  parents' care due to drug abuse. Allowing these family members to  provide critical emotional support and stability to kids who have had  their worlds turned upside down seems like common sense.   Once in a stable home, support is still needed. Many of these  grandparents never thought they would be raising another young child.  The Supporting Grandparents Raising Grandchildren Act would provide  them with information and resources to help them meet the needs of the  children that they are caring for.   The opioid crisis cannot be solved overnight, but we must keep  fighting. We must enable families to come together to do what families  do best, and that is help one another. We need to support those who are  unexpectedly caring for young children and provide them with the  support they need to raise healthy and happy kids.                            ____________________
