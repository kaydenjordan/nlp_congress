 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about Senate Amendment  to H.R. 244, ``Making Consolidated Appropriations for Fiscal Year  2017.''   The legislation before us is an imperfect vehicle for appropriations  for FY 2017, but this Omnibus Appropriations package contains new  funding for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2017 for federal agencies  under the eleven remaining Appropriations subcommittees.   The Omnibus Budget Agreement appropriates $1.070 trillion in base  discretionary budget authority, allocating $551 billion for defense and  $519 billion for nondefense in line with the Budget Control Act's  statutory discretionary spending caps, as well as $93.5 billion in  additional funding designated for Overseas Contingency Operations(OCO).   Mr. Speaker, this budget agreement is far from perfect, but it is a  positive step since it ensures that funding for appropriated  entitlements will continue at a rate maintaining program levels under  current law and prevents congressional Republicans from shutting down  the government again and manufacturing a crisis that only harms our  economy, destroys jobs, and weakens our middle class.   The government shutdown of 2013, which was manufactured by the  Republican majority lasted 16 days and cost taxpayers $24 billion.   The enormous harm and disruption of the lives of federal employees  and the people they serve, however, was irreparable.   As I stated, Mr. Speaker, this Omnibus Budget Agreement is a product  of goodwill and realism, and averts a shutdown of government operations  and the disruption a shutdown causes to the lives of millions of  Americans who depend upon federal programs to do their jobs, educate  their kids, care for their parents, and contribute to their  communities.   Our constituents look to the Congress and the President to make  responsible choices and decisions to keep the nation safe, the economy  prosperous, and to make necessary and prudent investments in education,  healthcare and research, transportation and infrastructure, economic  development, science, the arts and humanities, and the environment.   This is, after all, just another way of saying that the American  people expect their leaders in Washington be guided by the  Constitution's Preamble and pursue policies and provide the resources  that will:   ``establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings  of liberty.''   The funding priorities that have been floated by the Trump  Administration fail this essential test of leadership because they are  irresponsible, impracticable, unrealistic, and, in many respects,  insensitive or indifferent to the deleterious impact they will have on  the lives of real people living in the real world.   They do not command majority support in the Congress or of the public  and have been rejected in this budget.   Instead, in a stinging defeat for the Trump, the Omnibus Budget  Agreement does not fund the immoral and unwise border wall or create a  cruel new deportation force.   Also eliminated are more than 160 Republican poison pill riders,  ranging from undermining a woman's right to reproductive health to  dismantling Dodd-Frank's vital Wall Street consumer protections.   Mr. Speaker, I am also pleased that we succeeded in securing  Democratic policy priorities and funding increases for critical  nondefense items.   This will save lives and create jobs.   Mr. Speaker, let me identify some of the important policy and funding  priorities included in this budget agreement:   Fully funds community development block grants and low income housing  programs in urban and rural communities.   $2 billion for Medical Research: the budget rejects President Trump's  dangerous plans to steal billions from lifesaving medical research;   $221 million overall for Community Oriented Policing (COPS) and $137  million for the COPS hiring program;   $1 billion for Coal Miners' Health: Democrats secured funding to  deliver permanent health benefits for the thousands of coal miners and  their families who stood to lose their health benefits this month;   $600 million to combat and respond to the Opioid Epidemic;   Provides level funding for the Environmental Protection Agency  despite Republicans' hopes to gut it;   Year-Round Pell Grants: Democrats insisted on, and won an increase of  $105 in the maximum Pell Grant award and succeeded in restoring access  to year-round Pell Grants which will make a huge difference in the  lives of hard-working students;   Science Funding: the omnibus budget increases funding for Energy  Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Department of Energy Office of  Science and ARPA-E, all initiatives President Trump wanted cut;   Puerto Rico's Medicaid: the omnibus budget includes vital funds to  stabilize Puerto Rico's underfunded Medicaid program, which threatened  so many of our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico;   $1 billion for Emergency Famine Relief to alleviate famine resulting  from war, drought and displacement in Africa and the Middle East,  saving countless lives around the world;   Mr. Speaker, I support the omnibus budget agreement before us because  it achieves the following goals and objectives that I laid out last  week:   ``To establish justice'' and ``To promote the general welfare'':   1. Funding for the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division  and the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights so that they  have funds needed to enforce laws protecting civil rights, voting  rights, and prosecuting hate crimes.   2. Fully funds community development block grants and low income  housing programs in urban and rural communities.   3. Fully funds the Legal Services Corporation so that working and  low-income persons who lack an army of lobbyists to represent them in  Washington will at least have the assistance of counsel to defend their  legal rights in courts of law.   4. Fully funds programs providing food assistance to housebound  seniors, such as Meals on Wheels.   5. Fully funds programs that provide students from low and moderate- income families access to affordable access to higher education and  provides students with special needs the support needed to receive the  free appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive  environment (LRE) guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA Act).   6. Funds before and after school programs and other student  enrichment programs that help students succeed.   7. Fully funds programs that make federal housing safer through  energy efficient healing and cooling systems.   8. Preserves tax credit programs that help revitalize low income  communities.   9. Fully funds the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of  Energy programs developing the next generation of clean energy and  transportation technologies.   ``Provide for the common defense'':   1. Provides robust funding for the Department of State and USAID to  advance national security interests in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  and to end violent conflicts in trouble spots which could threaten the  security interests of the United States.   2. Provides adequate funding for United Nations peacekeeping missions  throughout the world and distribution of food aid to people in  developing and famine stricken countries, such as South Sudan, Somalia,  Yemen, and Nigeria.   ``To ensure domestic tranquility'':   1. Fully funds cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs, to  compensate insurers for reducing deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums  for low-income customers on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.   2. Protects the adequacy, solvency, and integrity of the Medicare and  Medicaid programs, which provide health sustaining support for 70  million Americans.   3. Fully funds the National Institutes of Health research programs so  that patient access to lifesaving treatments is not delayed.   4. Does not convert funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention into block grants which would hindering the nation's ability  to respond swiftly and effectively to public health crises like Ebola,  Zika, and HIV/AIDS.   Mr. Speaker, working together the House and Senate has reached an  agreement on an appropriate budget framework that invests in the  American people, preserves our national security, and keeps faith with  the values that have served our nation well and made the United States  the leading nation on earth.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the continued  appropriations for 2017 and to say: Say it isn't so.   When the Trump budget was presented--the skinny budget--$600 billion  was cut out of NIH, which would impact a major research in diseases  that impact Americans. Thank goodness that we worked for a $2 billion  increase for the NIH in this appropriations bill.   And, equally so, how important it is that we can announce in Houston  that the Houston Housing Authority will be able to reissue vouchers for  homeless families because $654 million-plus was put in the section 8  vouchers, $40 million-plus was put in for veterans who are homeless,  and $10 million was put in for the disabled.   In addition, we added to the Cops on the Beat program and, as well,  provided additional dollars to enhance the Civil Rights Division some  $897.5 million.   The budget or the appropriations should be a road map for serving  Americans, not a nickel-and-dime approach to undermine. I am glad the  resistance remains strong, and that is why we have a budget or an  appropriation that listens to the people and the healthcare subsidies  are being paid for, so that people can have that health insurance.                            ____________________
