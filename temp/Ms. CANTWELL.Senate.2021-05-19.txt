 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1527.    Mr. President, we come to the floor today after a lot  of hard work by the Commerce Committee to pass out the Endless Frontier  bill last week--24 to 4. I know my colleagues from the committee will  be out here to speak on this important legislation, as will the  majority leader, Senator Schumer, who authored this important  legislation, and our colleague from Indiana, Senator Young. We thank  them for kick-starting what is a very important national discussion  about how much we should be investing in research and development or  what I would say is American ingenuity or, to put it a little more  simply, I just say American know-how, because we are a nation of people  who know how to innovate, who know how to use science to transform our  economy, and we have done it over and over and over again.   I don't know. Maybe it came with, in getting in a boat and coming all  the  [[Page S2753]]  way across the ocean, you had to be an adventurer to begin with. If you  had to settle the frontier, you had to be innovative in your own right.  If you had to continue to expand our country, you had to have a great  ability to take risks in order to calculate and move forward.   Yet, somehow, in the United States of America, we are blessed with  ingenuity in our DNA. We as a nation are a nation that has figured out  that if we continue to partner together with those great, creative  minds, that the investment by both the public sector and the private  sector and through our universities and now our community colleges and  now research centers--that we can grow our economy, compete on an  international level, and protect opportunity for future Americans.   So it has been many eras of innovation. When I think about it, I  think about Thomas Edison and the light bulb, I obviously think about  Henry Ford and automobiles, and in my part of the world, we think about  Bill Boeing and aviation. Innovation is so much part of our DNA that I  don't think we sometimes absorb the littler things that we might not  know about.   People probably don't know about Nathan Stone Stubblefield, a  Kentucky inventor who in 1902 demonstrated the first wireless  transmission of communication using magnets. I know we have a big  wireless industry today, but people probably don't know that, in 1902,  a Kentucky inventor basically helped to turn the page on a new  generation of technology. People probably don't know that a Louisiana  professor, J. Lawrence Smith, in 1850, invented the microscope. Think  about how much that led to the important discussions of science and  healthcare for us as a nation. People probably don't know that, in  Indiana, a State police officer invented the breathalyzer test, a  gentleman named Robert Borkenstein, who basically just said, ``We don't  know what is happening here,'' and he introduced and created the  breathalyzer test.   That is what America is. America is the spirit of know-how and  getting things done.   In fact, a report read:         Americans prioritize being a world leader in scientific       achievements more than other global [communities].    That is from the Pew Research Center report by Cary Funk and several  other authors last September.   The report goes on to read:         [S]even in ten Americans believe it is very important for       the United States to be a leader in scientific achievements.    Clearly, what makes us different than other nations is that we are  willing to put significant American tax dollars on the table to ensure  that the national investment, the research in science, and the  development of our ecosystem take place. That investment is matched  with a good education system, capital formation, and, as I said,  private sector investments in research and development. All of that has  continued to make us the world leader in science and technology  innovation. It also helps us create job growth here at home.   The question before us today is, How much research and development  should our government be doing given how important th practical  sciences and engineering are to the next generation of Americans?    We are here to discuss this proposal by Senators Schumer and Young,  who, as I said, have been working on this concept for years because, no  doubt, we have fallen off the pace--that is to say, the pace of  scientific research investment at least as a percentage of the GDP.   Even though President Bush, in his second term, tried to signal the  importance of this investment, he issued a report basically calling the  American Competitiveness Initiative the leading world innovation  agenda. That was in February of 2006.   In fact, at that time, President Bush said:         [T]he role of government is not to create wealth; the role       of our government is to create an environment in which the       entrepreneur can flourish, in which minds can expand, in       which technologies can reach new frontiers.    George Bush had it right. He knew that this competitiveness issue was  starting to challenge us from a competitive perspective, and he knew  that we needed to make a bigger investment.   Unfortunately, with the two attempts that we had--the America  COMPETES Act in 2007 and the America COMPETES Act in 2010--it really  was a goal by us to basically double the NSF budget within a 7-year  window. While we started out in the right direction, we had a huge  economic downturn, and these goals were not met. If we had kept our  promises to these science agencies, we would have invested $80 billion  more in innovation investments over the last 14 years than we have done  today.   The challenge that we face now is that, after decades of not living  up to what had been outlined for America COMPETES, we now know that it  is an environment in which we are facing much more aggressive  competition. We have to think about the lack of investment that we did  not realize in the context of how long it takes to do technology  breakthroughs.   Look at just one example, the internet as we know it today.  Literally, in the 1960s, the ARPANET was first talked about. It took us  to the 1990s to really, with the University of Illinois and Marc  Andreessen, to affect what we would later know as hypertext links and a  browser. Today, what it means to us is more than $2 trillion annually  to our economy.   When you think about the investments we are asking our colleagues to  make today, we have to consider that, in fact, Federal dollars for R&D  is near its lowest point in 60 years as a percentage of the GDP. I  can't say that we are going to discover the next internet, but I can  say that, if we continue to underinvest in this, we will be  shortchanging generations of innovation.   There is no doubt that key investments in research and development in  other parts of the world are certainly getting attention. Since 2000,  research and development in China has grown by 1,600 percent; in Taiwan  and Korea by 400 percent; while, in the United States, just by 150  percent. That is in a 20-year window of looking at this issue.   Americans believe that competition is good, and we believe that  competition helps to drive innovation. So you won't find me as one on  the floor who is obsessed about other nations as much as giving a  perspective here about what the world market opportunity represents. If  we are not making the investments here in science and technology and  innovation, not only are we missing opportunities in our own country,  we are missing opportunities around the globe. The rest of the Nation,  in an information age, is not going to sit by idly, so we have to think  about how we move ahead on critical technology that helps us in all  sectors of our economy--how it helps us with supply chains and,  certainly, how it helps us with national security.   What we are talking about here, with this bill proposed by our  colleague Leader Schumer and Senator Young, is more than a doubling of  NSF's budget in 5 years; it is the start of trying to catch up. It is  also a $17 billion investment in energy innovation--a key sector of our  economy in which we need to make continued transformation. That  represents a 28-percent increase in some of the projects from the  Office of Science and things like ARPA-E that could see investment.   What we are also investing in, which our colleagues were very adamant  about and very convincing, is a new tech directorate--that is to say  that our research is very good with basic and very good with applied  but that we actually have to get better with the user implementation of  our science and spur more innovation in a more rapid fashion. So we are  investing, between this new tech directorate and tech hubs, nearly $39  billion to help stimulate the faster translation of our advancements  into real innovation. This is something the committee thought long and  hard about, and we took testimony from experts who have worked on  innovation issues for many years.   In this bill, we also increase the protection of intellectual  property from our universities.   We are helping our universities do better tech transfer but also  protect their intellectual property. In an information age, when so  much is published online, if other nations, hungry for development, can  read our research and act an effect on it because we haven't patented  it, then we need to do a better job of patenting our innovations and  helping our universities.  [[Page S2754]]    Our universities are unbelievable research institutions, and helping  them spend more time on tech transfer is something that we have done in  the Pacific Northwest. A new program ushered in there literally led to  20 startups from research that had been done but just hadn't been  translated into new areas.   We also are trying to help get more regional diversity to our  research and investment dollars. There are about 25 States in our  Nation that previously qualified for a program that says they should  get a share of research dollars. This legislation says all the money  being spent here, 20 percent of it should go to that, what is called  EPSCoR efforts, which is expanding research and development into those  States.   And for the first time, we will have over at NSF an office of  diversity--an office to focus on the lack of women and minorities in  science and to make real progress on this issue.   People see the chart behind me, and, yes, it is no mistake, the  picture we picked.   The point here is that we know from NSF's own research that we can't  be passive about this. Literally, the University of Washington got an  NSF grant that helped them study why we are not making more progress  with women and minorities in science and innovation, and they came back  with: It can't be passive. You can't just put dollars on the table for  STEM. You can't just put a few programs in place. It has to be an  active approach to changing many aspects to the way we educate in  science.   I am very proud of the University of Washington on this point because  they made changes, and now of those who are teaching in what are  considered STEM sciences at the University of Washington, 70 percent of  them are women or people of color. So we have changed what the face of  teaching science looks like at the University of Washington, and now we  have to change some of the criteria and curriculum so that we can  continue to attract more people. This bill is a very good step in that  direction.   So what are we trying to achieve? We are trying to achieve what NSF  Director Panchanathan is saying. He is saying that we need, in this  next decade and in decades to come, innovation everywhere, tied to  opportunity everywhere, tied to our universities. That is what we are  trying to do in advancing this legislation.   We processed over 100 amendments in committee and a broad range of  input from our colleagues. We will, I am sure, here in regular order  process many more, but, hopefully, these amendments and more of the  substance of this underlying bill we will go into in detail. We have to  remember what our goals are with this investment--to stay competitive,  to create future jobs, to help our economy by unleashing innovation, to  protect our national security, and do what Americans know how to do  best--that is, use that ingenuity to help create a better future.   I will see if my colleagues want to speak, but we will be coming back  to expand on many other layers of this legislation. We will be back to  talk about semiconductors. We will be back to talk about the new tech  directorate. We will be back to talk about NASA funding. We will be  back.   And that reminds me. If anybody at home is saying, ``Well, you know,  OK, that was interesting; I don't really know about this; what is  American innovation?'' just go and Google two things. You can either  look at SpaceX rocket return, which they did in 2015, or Blue Origin.  In both of those--the New Shepherd and the Falcon, two different  approaches--there are literally engineers who said: If we are going to  go to space, if we are going to go to the Moon, if we are going back to  the Moon and go to Mars, we need to figure out how to have returnable  rockets.   Just go Google those two clips, and you will see alive and well the  spirit of American ingenuity when those engineers see that rocket  returning from outer space and reland because they have pulled off an  incredible achievement. You will see jubilant joy and excitement over  that accomplishment.   I guarantee you, we will not see everything that this bill will  unleash, but I guarantee you it will unleash things that will deliver  that kind of excitement for Americans in the future, and we will have  to be very thankful that this Congress set the record straight on the  level of investment we need to achieve to keep us competitive.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon  receipt from the House, if the text is identical to the text of S. 593  that passed the Senate, the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.R. 1318, the bill be considered read a third time  and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S2755, May 19, 2021, third column, the following  appears: Without objection, it is so ordered. There being no  objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill. The bill was  ordered to a third reading and was read the third time. The bill  (H.R. 1318) was passed.  Thank you, Mr. President. I  yield the floor.      The online Record has been corrected to read: Without objection,  it is so ordered.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield  the floor.    ========================= END NOTE =========================                                ____________________     Madam President, if I could just say something, for a  second, while the Senator from Mississippi is here. It has been one of  the great joys to collaborate with Senator Wicker on so many important  policies last year, working on everything from aviation to maritime and  foreign issues, and now working on this legislation and infrastructure  and on many things that we want to do for the future. I thank him for  his collaborative work on this process.   No one probably relished the speed at which we moved through on this  bill from our committee perspective, but, nonetheless, I think the  committee actually had a lot of joy in the fact that we were at regular  order and could process so many amendments and have that diverse of a  conversation. The subject matter, in and of itself, is so important--it  really is--to get this right.   When I think about our attempts at America COMPETES in 2007 and 2010,  we were enthusiastic, but we didn't convince the rest of everybody to  put the money behind it. It makes me think that I am glad we are  creating more of a robust debate about why this competitive issue is so  important.                         Amendment Nos. 1517 and 1547    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  amendments be called up and reported by number: the Tillis-Hirono  amendment No. 1517 and the Scott-Johnson amendment No. 1547; further,  that at 4 p.m. today the Senate vote in relation to the amendments in  the order listed, with no amendments in order prior to those votes in  relation to the amendments, with 60 affirmative votes required for  adoption, and 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, between the two  votes.    Mr. President, I enjoy working with my colleague from  Florida on many issues, but on this particular issue, I disagree.   This amendment harms both my State and our Nation. It literally is  saying: Take the money that went to local governments in the rescue  plan and repeal it to pay for the Endless Frontier Act.   It said by the date of the enactment of this, if that money is  repealed, it can go and take other money that was part of the recovery  plan that isn't spent and start taking money from it.   I think this is the wrong way to do that. This would take money  immediately away from Tribes. It would take money away from healthcare.  It would take money away from broadband and, eventually, it could take  money away from things like aerospace, manufacturing, and money that is  there for the people who have been impacted by the downturn who no  longer have jobs and need to be retrained and skilled.   I think we should pay for the Endless Frontier Act as our  appropriator colleagues will get the chance. Please don't ruin this  bill by basically trying to pay for it with repealing State dollars.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1547     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate resumes consideration of S. 1260 tomorrow, the following  amendments be called up and reported by number: Inhofe-Shelby 1523 and  Johnson 1518; further, at 12 noon tomorrow, the Senate vote in relation  to the Inhofe amendment and at 1:30 p.m. in relation to the Johnson  amendment, with no amendments in order to these amendments prior to a  vote in relation to the amendment, with 60 affirmative votes required  for adoption.    Mr. President, just for the notice of our colleagues, I  should say we are still trying to work out other amendments, including  the Coons amendment and others, so we will be working on that this  evening.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 25, S. Res. 97.    I ask unanimous consent the committee-reported  substitute amendment to the resolution be agreed to; the resolution, as  amended, be agreed to; the committee-reported amendment to the preamble  be agreed to; the preamble, as amended, be agreed to; the committee- reported amendment to the title be agreed to; the title, as amended, be  agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Thursday, May 20; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that upon the conclusion  of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No.  58, S. 1260, as provided under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:10 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, May 20, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.
