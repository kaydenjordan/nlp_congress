 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, to my friend on the other side of the aisle, the  gentlewoman from Tennessee, the reality is that the truth hurts. This  budget resolution totally abandons America's most cherished values and  betrays its highest ideals.   This extreme budget not only threatens programs for our veterans and  hungry children, it makes drastic cuts to the Medicare and Medicaid  programs that our seniors count on for survival.   As it doles out that budgetary cruelty, this resolution hands massive  tax cuts to millionaires and powerful corporations all while adding  $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.   It also fails to protect our environment, neglects our children's  education, and once more targets women's healthcare for severe cuts.   In short, the wealthy win, the middle class is ignored, and we all  get saddled with more debt. Those are not values that this House should  stand for. It is certainly not what veterans, children, seniors, or  hardworking Americans deserve. This irresponsible budget rewards the  rich and powerful and punishes everyone else, and that is the best  thing that I can say about it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
