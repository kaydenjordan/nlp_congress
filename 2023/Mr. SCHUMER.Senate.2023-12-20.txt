 Mr. President, yesterday, 10 months of delay finally  ends on a positive note. The Senate confirmed the last of the military  nominees held up by Senator Tuberville. Military leaders and their  families who have had their lives put on hold for months can finally  breathe a sigh of relief because the wait is over.   It was a very good outcome, one that should not have been necessary.  But now that the holds have been lifted and these nominees confirmed, I  hope this never happens again. Let the experience of the past 10 months  be a warning: No Senator--no Senator--should use our military officers  and their families as political pawns to push a political agenda no  matter how strongly they believe in that agenda.   This was a long and painful ordeal for our Armed Forces, but it ended  on a positive note for them and for our country because Senator  Tuberville didn't get one bit of what he asked for, only a lot of pain  to military families.   Let's make sure this never happens again no matter how strongly any 1  of the 100 Senators feels on any one issue. Don't hold the military  families hostage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there will be no more rollcall votes this  year. But make no mistake, the winter recess will be a busy and  important few weeks for the U.S. Senate. Negotiations will continue  around the clock, reaching an agreement on a critical national security  supplemental.  [[Page S6072]]    As I speak right now, the negotiators are in a room down the hall  trying to make more progress. I came by a few minutes ago to thank all  of them for their hard work and encourage them to continue. The future  not only of Ukraine but of our country and the Western World depends on  it. Challenging issues remain, but we in this caucus are committed to  addressing needs at the southern border and to helping our partners and  allies confront and deter serious threats in Israel, Ukraine, and the  Indo-Pacific. The Senate will not let these national security  challenges go unanswered.   When we return in the new year, we hope to take swift action on the  national security supplemental. Passing a national security  supplemental is not going to be easy. It is one of the hardest things  this Senate has undertaken in a very long time. It will take  compromise, good faith, and recognition from both sides that nobody is  going to get everything they want.   Democrats will continue to work in good faith with our Republican  counterparts to get things done. We will not abandon our principles on  border, but we will work to find common ground wherever we can. Let me  be clear: It will take cooperation from serious-minded Republicans to  get this done. Again, it will take cooperation from serious-minded  Republicans to pass a national security supplemental.   I know there are some on the other side who will never vote for it,  but there are many who understand the need to both give Ukraine and  Israel humanitarian aid for the civilians in Gaza and the Indo-Pacific  the help it needs and to help fix our border--doing it in ways that are  consistent with our principles.   Democrats will continue to take these negotiations seriously, and we  urge the majority of Republicans on the Senate side who understand that  this is real and very important to join with us in helping get this  done. Doing it together, Leader McConnell and I issued a statement last  night that showed we both hope to get this done.   If we fail in this moment, if the United States abandons our friends  in Ukraine to Vladimir Putin, history will cast a shameful and  permanent shadow upon all of us. It is a matter of the highest urgency  that we get this right, and that is precisely what we will work toward  in the new year as soon as we return.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the first year of the 118th Congress has  come to a close. It is time to look ahead to the many challenges we  face in the year ahead. But never in recent memory has the contrast  between the two parties been more obvious than in the past 3 years.   Under Democratic majority leaders, we saw the most productive  Congress in modern history, but under a Republican House majority this  year, we saw a year marked by chaos, extremism, and paralysis. There is  no question that divided government and MAGA extremism made legislating  in 2023 very difficult. For much of the year, it was as if Donald Trump  himself were running the show over in the House, making it exceedingly  hard to get anything done.   But in a difficult year, Democrats did not abandon our promise to  work to make life better for the American people. This year, Democrats  protected the historic wins we have gotten done in the 117th Congress:  climate change, prescription drug reform, CHIPS and Science, and so  much more.   And I would remind the country that all but one of these major bills  we passed and led in the Senate was done with bipartisan support. You  need bipartisanship to get so much done, but we protected those  historic wins.   Second, we worked all year to implement those wins effectively: new  infrastructure projects, new factories, new good-paying jobs. Across  the country, manufacturing and job creation is surging; communities  long overlooked are getting a second chance; seniors will be paying  less for healthcare and prescription drugs; rural people will be able  to get broadband--internet service--for the first time. After years of  high costs, inflation has dramatically slowed down in the year since we  passed the Inflation Reduction Act. We have protected; we have  implemented; and the third word is ``prevented.''   Even with the MAGA Republican rightwing majority running so much of  the House, we prevented the worst things from happening. We prevented  the country from defaulting, which would have been a disaster. We  prevented, in both September and November, the government from shutting  down. In each case, the keyword was ``bipartisanship.'' We can't do any  of these things without both parties cooperating. I urge Speaker  Johnson to understand that as we approach the January 19 deadline.  Without bipartisanship, we will not get anything done, and embracing  the hard-right philosophy is a path to nowhere for not only the  Republican Party but for the House and the country.   Finally, in a difficult year, Democrats persevered. We protected, we  implemented, we prevented, and we persevered. We persevered at every  turn to work, to get things done. We began our critical work on  artificial intelligence. We pushed to outcompete the Chinese Government  even as we added more historic and diverse judges to the Federal bench.   This work will continue next year. There will be no easing into 2024;  we will hit the ground running. There is a lot we must do. We must not  only pass the supplemental and finish the job of properly funding our  Federal Government, but we have made large progress in a bipartisan way  on new parts of our agenda: insulin reform, getting everybody to pay no  more than $35 a month; artificial intelligence, where the bipartisan  Gang of 4 held some very, very elucidating insight forums, and now we  are ready to start looking at legislation; outcompeting the Chinese  Government; passing SAFE Banking and cannabis reform; getting something  done on railway safety, on online child privacy, and so much more.   In each of these, we have laid some groundwork with bipartisan  support. It won't be easy, but we want to get these things done in  2024. The only way, though, we will get them done--just like with the  supplemental, just like with the government shutdown--is through  bipartisan cooperation. It was the very first thing I said at the  beginning of this Congress. Bipartisanship is essential in divided  government. We saw that play out all year long. Only through  bipartisanship were we able to avoid a catastrophic default, avoid a  shutdown, and make any progress on appropriations or anything of  import.   We also saw what happens when one party--particularly in the House;  not so much in the Senate--refuses to embrace bipartisanship. The  unproductive and dysfunctional House majority is the most unproductive  and dysfunctional in modern history. What happened in the House because  of that dysfunctional majority can be boiled down to three words:  chaos, extremism, paralysis.   Donald Trump may not be in office, but his influence drove  practically every major decision for the House Republicans, at great  cost to our country. We saw MAGA extremists take the debt ceiling  hostage to push an agenda that would have crashed the economy, raised  costs, and killed millions of jobs. We saw MAGA extremists hijack the  appropriations process by adding poison pills, restricting a woman's  right to choose, and so much else. We even saw MAGA extremists bring  all of Congress to a grinding halt for more than a month by expelling  their own Speaker even as crises raged in Europe and Middle East-- shameful.   Unfortunately, the dark cloud of Donald Trump hovers, looms over  Senate and House Republicans, and it is something I hope they will  resist because he is no good for the country, no good for their party.   MAGA Republicans are incapable of governing, plain and simple.  Americans will not forget that when they head to the polls next year.   In conclusion, as we look to a new year, I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to work together. I urge my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle to resist MAGA extremism that led their side to so  much catastrophe. I urge Speaker Johnson not to let the 30 or so hard- right extremists keep running the show in the House, as they did for  too much of this year.   It is not going to get any easier. The challenges we face remain  great. But it is my hope--my earnest and fervent hope because I love  this country; I love  [[Page S6073]]  this country--that the experience of this year shows our colleagues on  the other side that embracing MAGA is a recipe for failure.   There will be a lot at stake when we return in 2024. If we embrace  bipartisanship, I am confident we will succeed.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
