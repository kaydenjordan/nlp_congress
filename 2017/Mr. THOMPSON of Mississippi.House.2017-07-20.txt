 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.

The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.

The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers.

This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.

Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.

Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.

For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.

When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.

Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL.

Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.

Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.

The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.

The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers.

This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.

Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.

Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.

For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.

When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.

Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2825, the Department of  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL.

Mr. Speaker, most Americans give little thought to the range of  activities that the Department of Homeland Security undertakes every  day to safeguard our Nation. Consideration of this legislation today  provides us with the opportunity to take a moment to not only  acknowledge the contributions of the 240,000 men and women who serve at  the Department but to consider what DHS does on a daily basis.   On any given day, the Transportation Security Administration screens  2 million air passengers and 1 million bags. The Federal Protective  Service protects 1.4 million people who visit and work in Federal  buildings. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection screens 282,000  vehicles, 72,000 truck, rail, and maritime containers. The U.S. Coast  Guard seizes and removes over 1,000 pounds of drugs and saves more than  10 lives in search and rescue operations daily.   The Secret Service provides physical protection to the Nation's  highest elected leaders, visiting foreign dignitaries, facilities, and  major events. And the National Cybersecurity and Communications  Integration Center issues 50 cyber warnings and blocks nearly 2,000  intrusions.   This list of activities is not, by any means, exhaustive, but I think  it is important for Members to keep in mind what DHS does every day, as  we consider H.R. 2825.   A central focus of this legislation is improving operations within  the DHS by, among other things, bolstering acquisition management,  employee engagement, policymaking, stakeholder engagement, and civil  rights and civil liberties.   Additionally, H.R. 2825 seeks to enhance DHS' counterterrorism and  intelligence efforts and the sharing of threat information with State,  local, and regional fusion centers.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2825 rejects the Trump  administration's proposed cuts to assistance to State and local  jurisdictions. Not only does H.R. 2825 authorize homeland security  first responder grants, training, and exercises, but it also restores  funding for two critical TSA programs: the Law Enforcement Grant  Program and the program to fund security staffing at airport exit  lanes.   With respect to the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program, it  authorizes funding at $800 million, which is $350 million above  President Donald Trump's request. For the State Homeland Security Grant  Program, it authorizes $600 million, which is $250 million above  President Donald Trump's request.   Additionally, the Transit Security, Port Security, Nonprofit  Security, and  [[Page H6112]]  Stonegarden Grant Programs are authorized at levels well above  President Donald Trump's request.   When it comes to securing our Nation, the American public expects DHS  to make smart investments. H.R. 2825 seeks to ensure that the policies  and protections are in place to do just that.   It has been almost 15 years since 22 agencies were thrust together to  create the third largest Federal department. Since that time, DHS has  never been reauthorized.   Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure,  which gives DHS the direction and support it needs to safeguard our  Nation.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and I want to thank him  for working with me in getting to this day.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member  of the committee for doing a historic reauthorization of this historic  Department that came in the backdrop of the most heinous and singular  terrorist act in terms of the beginning part of the 21st century to  come together with this important statement about securing the  homeland.   This year will mark the 15th year of the Department of Homeland  Security. Homeland security is defined as ``the national effort to  ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism  and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of  life can thrive . . . .''   This is what I hope this bill will do.   I want to take special note of two of the subagencies in this bill in  particular, taking note of the killing of Gerardo Hernandez, the first  TSA officer in the line of duty to be killed, in Los Angeles, and the  machete attack on Carol Richel at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans  International Airport. We owe a great deal of appreciation and thanks  to the Transportation Security Administration and the TSOs. I  personally thank them for the work that they do to be front line in  securing America.   I also want to express my appreciation for the Secret Service, who,  of course, through challenges, have continued to work to protect  America's most important leadership, the President in particular. I  thank them for their service.   I also want to make mention of the fact that I was very appreciative  of the number of amendments that I was able to get in. The Jackson Lee  amendments included mandates that the Department of Homeland Security  add a new provision to the duties of the Office for Civil Rights and  Civil Liberties, which directs that the Department recognize as part of  their mission to preserve individual liberty, fairness, and equality  under the law.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi,  the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, my second amendment deals with the multiyear acquisition  strategy, keeps pace with changes in technology. This amendment makes  sure that the agency's purchases are most up-to-date.   My third amendment deals with the fusion centers and will develop,  keep up-to-date, and make available information on Federal resources  intended to support fusion centers across America.   My fourth amendment would add to the list of DHS components,  including the chief medical officer, to allow them to enter into MOUs  so that they can be most helpful across the country.   My other amendment deals with preparedness, ensuring that the  National Domestic Preparedness Consortium includes a special directive  regarding preparedness in urban areas.   Finally, let me say that we have oversight over ICE and the  immigration services. I think it is important to note that ICE has to  be responsible, not seeking to raid and deport individuals who have  been in this country, who are paying their taxes, and who have options  to be able to stay in this country. I hope this reauthorization  recognizes that we need comprehensive immigration reform and that ICE  is important, but it must restrain its reckless way of deporting  individuals.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in speak in strong support of H.R. 2825, the  Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017, which is the first  authorization bill for the Department of Homeland Security since its  creation.   I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for working  diligently to bring before the House of Representatives the  authorization legislation.   As a Senior member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and former  Chair of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, now known as the  Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, as well as the  former Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime  Security, I am very much aware of the importance of the work performed  by the men and women who protect us from terrorism.   Homeland Security is defined as: ``the national effort to ensure a  homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and  other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life  can thrive to the national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within  the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism,  and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.''   This year will mark the 15th year the Department of Homeland Security  has been in existence and we owe the men and women who serve on the  front line of defending our people of the United States against  terrorist acts at home.   DHS's mission is to secure the nation from the many threats we face.   DHS is securing our nation through the dedication and hard work of  the more than 229,000 employees to serve the nation in jobs that range  from aviation and border security to emergency response, from  cybersecurity analyst to chemical facility inspector.   The Department of Homeland Security has many challenges--the greatest  of which is overcoming serious morale problems.   This authorization will accomplish a great deal, but the underlying  central problem for the Department of Homeland Security is morale.   The employees of the Department of Homeland Security are on the front  lines of our nation's defense against terrorism.   I recall the shooting incident at LAX that killed Gerardo Hernandez,  who became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty; and the  machete attack at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport  that resulted in injuries to Senior Transportation Security Officer  Carol Richel.   Their sacrifice and heroism reminds me of what we saw on September  11, 2001.   I will never forget that day, which made the creation of the  Department of Homeland Security necessary.   September 11, 2017 will mark the 16th Anniversary of the attacks that  killed 2,977 men, women and children.   On September 11, 2001, I stood on the East Front steps of the Capitol  along with 150 Members of the House of Representatives and sang ``God  Bless America.''   I will forever recall the Members of this House who stood with each  other not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans.   I want to thank and commend the work of our first responders across  the nation for their efforts to protect and serve their communities and  our nation.   Our duty as Members of Congress is to support the Department of  Homeland Security in meeting its core mission of keeping Americans  safe.   I am in support of H.R. 2825 for the following three reasons:   Terrorists have evolved their means and methods for perpetrating acts  of terror that were not envisioned at the time the agency was created;   The role of the Internet as a tool for terrorists to recruit and  train people around the world who may be drawn to their messages of  hate must be calculated into the work to defend the nation; and   The Department of Homeland Security has evolved since its initial  authorization bill became law on November 25, 2002, and this bill is a  necessary step to make sure the agency can benefit from that  experience.  [[Page H6116]]    I appreciate and thank the Committee on Homeland Security Members for  the inclusion of my bill, the ``Federal Information Resource to  Strengthen Ties with State and Local Law Enforcement Act of 2017'' also  known as the ``FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement Act'' in the  Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute for H.R. 2824, the Homeland  Security Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, the FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement Act, supports  transparency and oversight of the work of the DHS Office of State and  Local Law Enforcement by requiring that an annual report of its  activities be provided to Congress.   This office is the primary coordinator, liaison, and advocate for  state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement agencies.   This office was created based on recommendations from the 9/11  Commission and serves as the primary liaison between DHS and non- Federal law enforcement agencies across the country.   The office also leads the coordination of DHS' policies related to  state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement's role in  preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding to  natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other man-made disasters.   Because this DHS office plays a significant role in the required  outreach to state and local law enforcement entities it is important  that the Committee be kept apprised of its work.   The ``FIRST State and Local Law Enforcement Act'' will include data  about the coordination and information with State and locals,  establishing and reporting performance and metrics feedback received  from State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies about the  Office.   I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security  Committee for also including Several Jackson Lee amendments in the  final bill:   The First Jackson Lee Amendment adds to the list of the Bill's  mandates for the Department of Homeland Security, which the Secretary  of DHS shall implement as part of the overall mission of the agency.   This Jackson Lee Amendment adds a new provision to the duties of the  Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which directs that the  Department recognizes as part of its mission to preserve individual  liberty, fairness, and equality under the law;''.   The Second Jackson Lee Amendment adds an assurance that the DHS  Multiyear Acquisition Strategy keeps ``pace with changes in technology  that could impact deliverables.'' This amendment makes sure that the  agency's purchases are the most up to date technology available.   The Third Jackson Lee Amendment would amend the Department of  Homeland Security Fusion Center Partnership Initiative section of the  bill to make sure that the Department will ``develop, keep up to date,  and make available information on federal resources intended to support  fusion center access to agency data.''   The unique and well established relationship between the National  Network of Fusion Centers and the Department of Homeland Security is  codified in this authorization bill, and important transparency  measure.   This amendment creates an ongoing mission by the Homeland Security  Fusion Center Partnership Initiative to support local and state fusion  participation.   The Fourth Jackson Lee Amendment adds to the list of DHS components  which can enter into Memorandums of Understanding to include the Chief  Medical Officer.   A memorandum of understanding or MOU is a formal agreement between  Department of Homeland Security components and two or more parties  regarding a matter of mutual benefit or interest where each party will  provide to the other something of consequence.   In the case of this Jackson Lee amendment, the Office of Chief  Medical Officer will be able to enter into MOUs, which are not legally  binding agreements, for the purpose of carrying out its mission.   The fifth Jackson Lee Amendment assures that the Department of  Homeland Security's National Domestic Preparedness Consortium includes  a special directive regarding preparedness training for urban areas.   The Amendment establishes that ``to the extent practicable,'' the  Department of Homeland Security will ``provide training in settings  that simulate real response environments, such as urban areas.''   Urban preparedness planning will include drills, and my amendment  allows each urban area to determine the settings and scenarios that  will best approximate the challenges that may need to be overcome.   Few of us will forget the impact of Hurricane Katrina or what we saw  following Hurricane Sandy.   None of us will forget the attack on New York City or the months of  difficult excavation and recovery at the site of the attacks.   Urban centers come with a host of challenges that require adjustments  in how preparedness drills are conducted to ensure that lessons learned  can be applied to real world conditions.   I thank the Committee for adoption of these legislative improvements,  which added them to the bill being debated by the House of  Representatives.   I ask that the members of the House to support H.R. 2825, the  ``Department of Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017.''   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Hunter), chairman of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard  and Maritime Transportation of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), chairman of the Task Force on  Denying Terrorist Entry into the United States of the Homeland Security  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), chairman of the Subcommittee on  Transportation and Protective Security of the Homeland Security  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), a member of the Homeland  Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett), a member of the Homeland  Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2825 was unanimously  approved by the Committee on Homeland Security on June 14, 2017, after  39 Democratic amendments focused on strengthening the underlying  bipartisan bill were accepted.   To make this legislative package more complete, subsequent to  committee consideration, text that was approved by the Transportation  and Infrastructure and Judiciary Committees was added.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join me in supporting passage of this  important homeland security legislation that includes provisions that  have the support of groups as diverse as the International Association  of Fire Chiefs, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Fusion Center  Association, the Jewish Federations of North America, the American  Federation of Government Employees, and the American Public  Transportation Association.   Mr. Speaker, let me compliment the chairman for a job well done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me give my heartfelt thanks to the ranking member  for his work on this important legislation, first ever. It was a real  team effort on both sides of the aisle. I want to thank all of the  staff on both sides of the aisle, Rosaline Cohen and Jennifer Gorski,  who worked tirelessly.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a January 11, 2017, memorandum  of understanding, signed by myself and seven other committee chairmen.     Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of Homeland                                  Security         We, the chairs of the committees with jurisdiction over the       Department of Homeland Security or its components, are hereby       recording our agreement on the following principles for the       115th Congress:        1. The Department of Homeland Security (``the Department'')       and its components should be authorized on a regular basis to       ensure robust oversight and improve its operation.        2. Committees with jurisdiction over the Department and its       components will prioritize the authorization of the       Department and any unauthorized or expiring component in that       committee's authorization and oversight plan.        3. To the maximum extent practicable, the committees with       jurisdiction over unauthorized or expiring components of the       Department shall coordinate with the Committee on Homeland       Security to produce a comprehensive authorization bill for       the Department.        4. The Committee on Homeland Security shall coordinate with       the committees with jurisdiction over unauthorized or       expiring components of the Department in the development of       any comprehensive authorization bill for the Department.        5. The Committee on Homeland Security and the committees       with jurisdiction over components of the Department shall       jointly develop a process for the vetting and pre-clearing of       base text and amendments offered at subcommittee and full       committee  [[Page H6118]]       markups of a DHS authorization bill in the Committee on       Homeland Security that fall within the jurisdiction of a       committee other than or in addition to the Committee on       Homeland Security.        6. The committees will expedite consideration of any       comprehensive authorization bill for the Department,       including timely resolution of any matters subject to a       sequential or additional referral.        7. To the extent that there are policy differences between       the committees regarding a provision of the comprehensive       authorization bill for the Department, the committees will       make best efforts to resolve any such dispute.        8. The Committee on Homeland Security shall not include any       provision in a comprehensive authorization bill that the       chair of the Committee on Ways and Means has determined to be       a revenue provision or a provision affecting revenue. If the       chair of the Committee on Ways and Means makes such a       determination, nothing in this agreement shall be construed       to preclude that chair from exercising an additional or       sequential referral over the measure, or a point of order       under clause 5(a) of Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of       Representatives.        9. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as altering       any committee's jurisdiction under rule X of the Rules of the       House of Representatives or the referral of any measure       thereunder.        10. Further, nothing in this memorandum precludes a further       agreement between the committees with regard to the       implementation of a process to ensure regular comprehensive       authorizations of the Department.            Signed,          Gregg Walden, Chair, Committee on Energy and Commerce;             Michael T. McCaul, Chair, Committee on Homeland             Security; Devin Nunes, Chair, Permanent Select             Committee on Intelligence; Bob Goodlatte, Chair,             Committee on the Judiciary; Jason Chaffetz, Chair,             Committee on Oversight and Government Reform; Lamar             Smith, Chair, Committee on Science, Space and             Technology; Bill Shuster, Chair, Committee on             Transportation and Infrastructure; Kevin Brady, Chair,             Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion of this debate, it is very  important to remember that a comprehensive reauthorization of the  Department of Homeland Security has never been done before. While  various reauthorization efforts have been tried in the past, we finally  have a chance to get it across the finish line and have it signed into  law. So let's stand together as Republicans and Democrats and show the  people we represent both parties and that both parties can work with  one another by putting our national security above politics.   This legislation is not just about good governance or bureaucratic  reforms. It is absolutely essential to making sure we are able to  defeat the grave and growing threats facing the United States.   Once again, I want to thank the ranking member and all of his staff;  leadership, as well, and their staff; and, also, all of the members of  the Office of the Legislative Counsel, who got us to this point here  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, July 18, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your follow up letter       regarding H.R. 2825 dated June 27, 2017. I appreciate your       continued willingness to work with me to bring H.R. 2825 to       the House Floor.        As I stated in my June 22, 2017 letter, the Committee on       Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that       by foregoing seeking a sequential referral at this time, the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence does not       waive any jurisdictional interest it may have over provisions       in the bill.        Regarding the provisions referenced in your recent letter,       each of the sections listed were introduced as stand alone       bills, as well as included in H.R. 2825, and the Committee on       Homeland Security was granted the primary referral on such       provisions. As discussed between our staff and in the       exchange of letters, I recognize that your Committee could       request a sequential referral on those provisions. I       reiterate my continued appreciation for the cooperation of       you and your staff in moving H.R. 2825 through the       legislative process.        Per your request, I will include your letters, my response       letters, the ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security'' and accompanying January       11, 2017 exchange of letters in the Congressional Record when       H.R. 2825 is considered on the Floor.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                                     June 27, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for your letter dated June       22, 2017, regarding H.R. 2825, the ``Department of Homeland       Security Authorization Act of 2017.'' I appreciate your       recognition of the jurisdictional interest of the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) in legislation       relating to the National Intelligence Program (NIP), as well       as the importance of the ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization       of the Department of Homeland Security'' and our accompanying       January 11, 2017 exchange of letters.        As you note, your letter of January 11 permits the       Committee on Homeland Security to report legislation       including ``Department-wide provisions that could affect       Department elements that happen to receive funding through       the NIP.'' H.R. 2825, however, contains several provisions       that are not ``Department-wide,'' but instead direct the NIP-      funded Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence       and Analysis (I&A) to take specific actions and/or provide       Congress with reports--and are therefore within the exclusive       jurisdiction of HPSCI. Those provisions include:        Section 113--``Intelligence Rotational Assignment Program''        Section 301--``Homeland Intelligence Doctrine''        Section 302--``Analysts For The Chief Intelligence       Officer.''        Section 303--``Annual Homeland Terrorist Threat       Assessments''        Section 311--``Department of Homeland Security Fusion       Center Partnership Initiative''        Per my letter of June 21, HPSCI will continue to forego an       official request for sequential referral. However, I request       that you include a copy of this letter in the Congressional       Record along with the other letters and attachments we       exchanged last week. Thank you again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2825, the ``Department of Homeland Security       Authorization Act of 2017,'' I appreciate your support in       bringing this very important legislation reauthorizing the       Department of Homeland Security before the House of       Representatives, and appreciate the willingness of the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to forego seeking       a sequential referral.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral on this       bill at this time, the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the       future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence represented for provisions       within your jurisdiction on the conference committee.        Additionally, the Committee on Homeland Security recognizes       and appreciates the importance of the Memorandum Regarding       Authorization of the Department of Homeland Security and the       letter exchange on January 11, 2017. The Committee on       Homeland Security contends that per such agreement the bill       reported by the Committee ``does not intend to authorize any       elements of the Department that are funded through the       National Intelligence Program (NIP) . . . . but may include       Department-wide provisions that could affect Department       elements that happen to receive funding through the NIP.''        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                              Michael T. McCaul,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Homeland Security.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                     Washington, DC, June 21, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: H.R. 2825, a bill ``to amend the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make certain improvements in       the laws administered by the Secretary of Homeland Security,       and for other purposes,'' was recently marked up and reported       by your Committee. Given that several provisions of H.R. 2825       implicate National Intelligence Program (NIP)-funded       activities, I am confident that upon request the bill will be       sequentially referred to the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (the Committee).        As you know, we signed a Memorandum Regarding Authorization       of the Department of Homeland Security and exchanged letters       on January 11, 2017 (January 2017 Exchange of Letter), to       clarify the Committee's exclusive jurisdiction over NIP-      funded elements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).       The January 2017 Exchange of Letters  [[Page H6119]]       affirmed that, consistent with the Rules of the House of       Representatives, the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) is       the vehicle that through which Congress authorizes annual       appropriations for the NIP, including NIP-funded elements of       the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Moreover, those       letters made explicit that the Committee on Homeland Security       would not report to the House any bill that authorizes any       elements of DHS funded through the NIP, and that if any such       bill is reported by the Committee on Homeland Security, this       Committee will request a sequential referral of the bill.        In order to expedite the House's consideration of the H.R.       2825, and in recognition of the unique importance of       authorizing legislation for DHS, the Committee will forego an       official request for sequential referral or consideration of       the measure. This courtesy, is however, conditioned on our       mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no way       diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with       respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matter contained in the bill or any similar measure. It is       also conditioned on the Committee on Homeland Security's       adherence to the agreement embodied in the January 2017       Exchange of Letters. In the future, the Committee will not       hesitate to take up non-conforming legislation on sequential       referral.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding and would request that you include in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 2825       a copy of this letter, your response, and the January 2017       Exchange of Letters, including the Memorandum. Thank you in       advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                                  January 11, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: In accordance with paragraph 10 of       the January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' I write to confirm our       mutual understanding of the procedure through which the House       will authorize the elements of the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) funded through the National Intelligence       Program (NIP).        I appreciate your dedication to producing a comprehensive       reauthorization of DHS that will improve congressional       oversight of the Department. As you know, Rule X(11)(b)(1) of       the House of Representatives grants the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence sole jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation . . . relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act;'' and       Rule X(j)(3) of the House of Representatives grants the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over the       ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information.''        As you also know, the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA)       is the annual vehicle through which Congress authorizes       appropriations for the NIP, including for elements of DHS       that receive funding through the NIP. The IAA includes a       classified schedule of authorizations, incorporated into the       statute by reference, and direction and recommendations in a       classified annex to the report of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence. Nothing in the January 2017       ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of       Homeland Security,'' shall be construed to grant the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over proposed       legislation relating to the NIP or authorizations for       appropriations for the NIP.        In keeping with these principles, the Committee on Homeland       Security will not report to the House any bill that       authorizes any elements of DHS funded through the NIP. If any       such bill is reported by the Committee on Homeland Security,       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will request a       sequential referral of the bill. Understanding, however, that       both of our committees have a jurisdictional interest in the       Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to       work together to ensure that the Office receives the most       effective congressional guidance.        We further agree that if the Committee on Homeland Security       reports a DHS-wide authorization bill to the House, I may       offer an amendment during consideration of the bill in the       full House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, I will not offer an amendment,       and the DHS-wide authorization bill will not contain any       provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS. We       further agree that you will oppose as nongermane all       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS in       markup in the Committee on Homeland Security. If any       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS are       subsequently offered during consideration by the full House,       you agree to consult with me before taking action.        Finally, we agree that you will support the appointment of       the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence to any committee of conference on a       DHS-wide authorization bill that includes any provisions       related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS.        In accordance with Rule X(11)(b)(2) this understanding does       not preclude either the Committee on Homeland Security or the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from authorizing       other intelligence and intelligence-related activities of       DHS, including, but not limited to, the Homeland Security       Intelligence Program. In keeping with paragraph 5 of the       January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' our committees will work       jointly to vet and clear any provisions of a DHS       authorization bill related to these other intelligence and       intelligence-related activities of DHS. Furthermore, I hope       the staff of our committees can continue to closely and       expeditiously to conduct rigorous oversight of intelligence       activities throughout DHS.        The understanding detailed by this letter is limited to the       115th Congress. It shall not constitute an understanding       between our committees in any subsequent congress.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding. I look forward to working with you to       continue congressional oversight of DHS intelligence       activities, and I thank you in advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,      United States Capitol, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter supporting       the Committee on Homeland Security's plans to conduct a       comprehensive reauthorization of the Department of Homeland       Security (``the Department'') in the 115th Congress, as       expressed in the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of       the Department of Homeland Security.''        I appreciate your willingness to help ensure the Department       is fully authorized, and recognize that there may be areas of       jurisdictional interest to the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (``Intelligence Committee'') in such an       authorization. Rule X(j)(3) of the House of Representatives       grants the Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over       the ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information,'' while Rule X(11)(b)(1) grants the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act.''        The Committee on Homeland Security does not intend to       authorize any elements of the Department that are funded       through the National Intelligence Program (``NIP'') as part       of the Department authorization bill it reports to the House       this Congress, although we both agree that the reported bill       may include Department-wide provisions that could affect       Department elements that happen to receive funding through       the NIP. Accordingly, I will oppose as nongermaine any       amendments which may be offered in my committee's markup       related to the NIP-funded elements of the Department. I       further agree to consult you before taking any action on       similar amendments which may be offered during consideration       of the bill by the full House.        In the interest of ensuring the most robust Department       authorization possible, we further agree that you may offer       an amendment during consideration of the bill in the full.       House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, you will not offer an amendment.       Understanding, however, that both of our committees have a       jurisdictional interest in the Department's Office of       Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to work together to       ensure that the Office receives the most effective       congressional guidance.        Finally, I reiterate my intention that nothing included in       the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security'' alters the jurisdiction of       either the Committee on Homeland Security or the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence. The Committee on Homeland       Security appreciates the past success we have enjoyed working       with the Intelligence Committee. I am grateful for your       support and look forward to continuing to  [[Page H6120]]       work together toward our mutual goal of ensuring that the       Department and its components arc authorized on a regular       basis.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,                                                          Chairman.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 2825, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
