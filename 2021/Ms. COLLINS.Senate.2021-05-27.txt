 Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation  with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Ben Cardin, to increase access  to preventive bone density screenings and to improve osteoporosis  diagnosis and treatment in the process.   May is National Osteoporosis month. Approximately 54 million  Americans have osteoporosis or low bone mass. Women are  disproportionally affected, accounting for 71 percent of osteoporotic  fractures and 75 percent of health costs related to osteoporosis.   Osteoporosis is often called ``the silent disease'' because bone loss  usually occurs gradually over the years without symptoms. As the NIH  Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases National Resource Center  observes, falls are especially dangerous for people who are unaware  that they have low bone density. If the patient and the doctor fail to  identify the link between the broken bone and osteoporosis, the chance  to make a diagnosis with a bone density test and begin a treatment  program may be lost.   Our legislation, the Increasing Access to Osteoporosis Testing for  Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2021, tackles a proven barrier to proper  screening by creating a floor reimbursement rate under Medicare for the  dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) test, the ``gold standard'' for  osteoporosis diagnosis.   Congress has twice recognized the importance of reversing Medicare  cuts to DXA reimbursement in order to maintain patient access to this  test, yet the Medicare reimbursement rate for DXA tests administered in  a doctor's office has declined from $140 in 2006 to only $42 in 2018--a  dramatic 70 percent decline. It is not surprising that this inadequate  reimbursement has led to a decline in screenings.   The National Osteoporosis Foundation has found that declining  reimbursement rates have created a 26 percent decline in physicians  performing DXA tests since 2008, resulting in a corresponding 22  percent decline in diagnoses since 2009.   Regrettably, the result of reduced screenings due to declining  reimbursements produces real harm. It is estimated that more than  40,000 additional hip fractures occur each year, resulting in nearly  10,000 additional hip fracture-related deaths. Keep in mind that these  painful and costly fractures, and even deaths, are all occurring at a  time when early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis are proven to  reduce fracture rates dramatically.   With osteoporosis already an under-diagnosed condition in the  Medicare population, it is clear that we must change this trajectory I  thank Senator Cardin for joining me in this effort to increase patient  access to osteoporosis screening and diagnosis, while lowering cost and  consequences resulting from a lack of diagnosis. I encourage my  colleagues to support its adoption. Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Tester):   S. 1944. A bill to improve Vet Centers of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
