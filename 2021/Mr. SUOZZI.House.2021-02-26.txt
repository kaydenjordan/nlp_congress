 Madam Speaker, this pandemic has been cruelly uneven.  Some people remain unscathed. Wall Street is booming, online retailers  are surging, some work remotely with their incomes intact, and some  families remain healthy. Yet 17 percent of Americans go to food banks  every week. One in six people can't pay their rent. Some people are  enduring a long winter in sub-zero temperatures, unable to pay their  heating bill. Twenty-five percent of the people who make under $40,000  a year are now unemployed. State and local governments crippled,  businesses and restaurants closed. Worst of all, we all know people who  have gotten sick and died.   This legislation is not a blue State bailout or liberal handout, it  is how we address the suffering that has crippled our country, it is  how we move forward and beat this pandemic.   We have this great and awesome responsibility, this great and awesome  honor to try to help people facing some of the most desperate times  they have ever faced. Let's pass this comprehensive plan. Let's move  our country forward, and let's do it together.
