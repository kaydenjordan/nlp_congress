I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), and the  Senator from California (Mr. Padilla) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Jeffrey Cummings to the U.S. District Court for the Northern  District of Illinois.   Judge Cummings received his bachelor's degree from Michigan State  University and his J.D. from the Northwestern University School of Law.  Following law school, he clerked for Judge Ann Claire Williams on the  Northern District of Illinois.   Judge Cummings then entered private practice in Chicago, where he  developed expertise in various civil rights issues, including  employment discrimination, voting rights, and housing discrimination.   He has spent nearly his entire practice litigating in Federal courts  and has tried eight cases to verdict. Notably, he worked on the largest  ever hospice-related recovery for the United States in the history of  the False Claims Act.   While in private practice, Judge Cummings also served as an  administrative hearing officer for the city of Chicago Commission on  Human Relations and as a hearing officer for the city of Chicago Police  Board, where he was responsible for conducting contested disciplinary  hearings in cases involving allegations of misconduct against Chicago  police officers.   In 2019, Judge Cummings was selected by the district judges of the  Northern District to serve as a magistrate judge. Since joining the  bench, he has handled both civil and criminal matters and has presided  over three jury trials.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Cummings ``well  qualified,'' and he has the strong support of Senator Duckworth and  myself. Given his vast litigation background and experience on the  bench, he will be a tremendous addition to the court. I am honored to  vote for his confirmation, and I urge my colleagues join me.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator  from California (Mr. Padilla), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders) are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, this is indeed a historic moment in the  U.S. Senate.   As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee for more than two  decades, I can remember a time when, in fact, 12 different  appropriations bills came to the floor of the Senate for consideration.  It has been at least 5 years--maybe longer--since we have done that.  Instead, we bundled all of the appropriations in one big omnibus bill  and handed it over to leadership to decide. We waited for that  desperate vote where they said: You have to vote for this; it is take  it or leave it.  [[Page S4369]]    Well, we are back in the stage of due deliberation on appropriations,  and I want to commend those who have brought us to this moment.   If you asked me at the beginning of this session to pick two  Senators--one a Democrat and one a Republican--who could achieve this  goal, I would have chosen the two who are here on the floor today,  Senator Patty Murray and Senator Susan Collins. They are extraordinary  legislators, some of the hardest working people in the U.S. Senate, and  they truly have dedication to a national purpose beyond anything that  partisan politics might generate.   I have seen them at work for years and worked with them together. I  can't think of a better team, and I am more than happy to work with  them to achieve their goal for 12 appropriation bills considered and  passed on the floor of the Senate. It will be historic, and it will  serve the American people better than most of them could imagine today  because it will mean we will take the time to do each of these bills in  a thoughtful, careful way. So let me start by commending them for being  here today and for the work that has brought us to this moment.                       United Auto Workers Negotiations    Mr. President, on July 12, the United Auto Workers and the Big Three  automakers--General Motors, Ford and Stellantis--began contract  negotiations to determine their next 4-year labor deal. Since it was  founded nearly 90 years ago, the United Auto Workers have fought for  and won victories that have helped strengthen America's working  families. The UAW has won better pay for its members, safer working  conditions, employer-funded pensions, health insurance, education  benefits, and much more. UAW helped to allow autoworkers and their  families to buy homes, take vacations, send their children to college,  and retire with dignity. Autoworkers work hard; they deserve their  opportunity to enjoy the American dream.   But the legacy that I have just described is in danger. Over the last  20 years, autoworkers have faced dozens of plant closures, lost jobs,  wage cuts, and contract concessions. In 2009, the UAW made major  concessions in its contracts to help these same automakers receive  government assistance. This included job security provisions, cost-of- living adjustments, and financing for retiree healthcare. They made  sacrifices so that their employer companies survived during that  terrible situation in our economy.   How have they done? The automakers have reaped billions of dollars in  profit since. But these benefits have not been passed down to the  workers, and UAW members have seen their wages and standards of living  suffer. Over the past 4 years, the CEOs of the Big Three that I have  listed have seen 40-percent wage hikes on average, while autoworkers  have seen 6.1 percent.   Decades ago, the ratio between CEO and median worker pay was around  20 to 1, which meant the big shots in the boardrooms were making 20  times what the fellow was making on the assembly line. Today it has  changed. No longer 20 to 1; it is 300 to 1. Should CEOs be earning 300  times more than autoworkers? I don't think so.   Stellantis, General Motors, and Ford have reported collective profits  of nearly--get ready--$250 billion between 2013 and 2022 and a combined  profit of $21 billion alone in the first 6 months of this year--$21  billion.   The salaries of their CEOs--listen to these--$29 million for the CEO  of General Motors, $21 million for Ford's CEO, $24 million for  Stellantis--further evidence of this notion of corporate royalty. In  2007, the average wage for workers at Chrysler, Ford, and General  Motors was $28 an hour--in 2007--while the starting wage was $19.36 an  hour. In today's dollars, that is $28.50. Today, the starting wage for  autoworkers at the Big Three is $18.04 an hour--more than $10 lower  than what starting wages would be if they had kept up with inflation  since 2007. Eighteen dollars an hour.   In Springfield, IL, coming back from picking up some hardware at  Lowe's, I passed a Taco Bell. The sign out front said starting pay $17  an hour at Taco Bell. Autoworkers--professional men and women who work  hard--are being offered $18; Taco Bell, $17.   Meanwhile, these same workers who are making $18 an hour for the  automobile manufacturers are asked to work 10- to 12-hour days, 6 to 7  days a week. And 61 GM, Ford, and Stellantis plants have been idle or  closed since 2003. Thousands of jobs have been lost. And I can tell  that story personally because one of the idled plants was a Belvidere  assembly plant in Belvidere, IL, owned by Stellantis. That plant opened  58 years ago. They once had 4,500 union workers. In February, they laid  off 1,350 workers who were blindsided at the time by that announcement.  This was devastating, not just to the families of the workers but to  the community.   I begged Stellantis: Reconsider this decision. And I have spoken to  the president of the United Autoworkers who tells me it is one of his  highest priorities. Workers are fed up. Earlier this year, autoworkers  struggled to breathe in factories across Illinois and other States due  to unprecedented wildfire smoke in Canada. Now they are saying, in this  negotiation: Enough.   At the same time, Congress and the Biden Administration have made  major investments in clean energy--including the production of electric  vehicles.   Corporations cannot impose the cost of transitioning to electric  vehicles on the shoulders of today's workers. We can and should invest  in these vehicles while making sure they continue to be produced with  union labor. These corporations that I talked about--the Big Three-- have benefited from billions of dollars in profits in recent years. Why  haven't the workers benefited as much?   In just two days on September 14, contracts covering 150,000 UAW  workers at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis will expire. At the  same time, Stellantis put plants on critical status for 90 days.   What does that mean for the current workers before the contract would  be announced? It would mean that they would work 7 days a week, 12-hour  shifts. Why are they doing this? They are trying to pile up inventory.   Under critical status, workers can only receive 1 day off every 30  days, unless they use family medical leave. Meanwhile, Stellantis  complains that it is behind thousands of units, while it continues to  lay off workers. It just doesn't add up.   I urge the Big Three and the UAW to negotiate in good faith, reach an  agreement before September 14--just 2 days away--and prevent a strike  that will cost billions of dollars and impact 150,000 hard-working  autoworkers.   This agreement must be fair to workers, include a restoration of the  benefits that autoworkers sacrificed more than a decade ago, to keep  these families afloat. And Stellantis must reconsider the closure of  Belvidere assembly plant and welcome back the workers it laid off in  February.   There is a lot at stake. The automobile industry is a major part of  our economy. Autoworkers have done their best; they have sacrificed  right and left to make sure that this industry stays as strong as it  is--and even stronger--in America. The CEOs need to show a spirit of  cooperation and teamwork to make sure that when they reopen this with a  new contract, we are going to have many more years of prosperity for  American automakers.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, for nearly three decades, the crack of the  bat, the smell of fresh cut grass, the greening of the ivy, and the  sound of Pat Hughes' voice reporting from the ``beautiful and historic  Wrigley Field'' has let Cubs fans far and wide know, it is time for  baseball. This July, Pat Hughes--the voice of Cubs baseball and a  Chicago legend--was awarded the 2023 Ford C. Frick Award by the  National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, NY--the highest honor in  broadcasting.   Born in Tucson, AZ, Pat was raised in San Jose, CA. His father worked  in the education department at San Jose State University, where Pat  would later enroll. Pat would frequent the university's sporting events  with his father and brother, smitten by the cadre of future greats that  took the field for the Spartans. At around 17 years old, he realized he  wasn't quite good enough to make a career playing, but his passion for  sports fueled his determination to find a sports career.   Just hours before Pat's acceptance speech at Cooperstown, he  recounted that, ``It kind of feels a little bit surreal. As if it's  almost happening to someone else, and I'm just kind of watching.''  Ironically, watching on sidelines was where Pat's broadcasting career  began.   At San Jose State University, while sitting on the bench for his  college basketball team, he started to announce the game unfolding in  front of him before his first listening audience: the other  benchwarmers on the team. One of his teammates complimented Pat's knack  for play-by-play. Once basketball season was over, Pat called his first  baseball game, San Jose State versus the University of California Santa  Barbara.   In 1978, Pat graduated from San Jose State University with a degree  in radio/TV journalism and began his baseball broadcasting career for a  minor league team: the San Jose Missions. After a season with the  Columbus Clippers, he joined the Minnesota Twins broadcast team in 1983  before moving to Milwaukee just a year later, where he called Brewers  games on radio with Milwaukee legend Bob Uecker.   I first heard Pat when my son Paul enrolled at Marquette University.  Back then, Pat was calling basketball games for Marquette, and even  then, Pat had the distinct style that we all have come to appreciate.  Pat would go on to call basketball games for Marquette for 16 seasons,  including years spent alongside local legend, Coach Al McGuire.   Since 1996, Pat has been the radio play-by-play announcer for the  Chicago Cubs. The 2022 season marked the 40th consecutive year that  Hughes served as a Major League Baseball announcer. With nearly three  decades in Chicago, Pat is a Cubs institution. And, not only has he  been a fixture in Wrigley since 1996, he almost never misses work. For  nearly 11 years, he called nearly every inning of every Cubs game  before he finally took a day off.   A student of the game and a master of his craft, Pat regularly  studied broadcasters he admired. He would listen to recordings of games  that he called, analyze the modulation of his voice, eliminate filler,  and perfect his catchphrases, setting the standard of meticulous  preparation that he carries with him today. And just like the  benchwarmer back in the 70s that called the basketball game, Pat seizes  every moment.   Never one to rest on his laurels, when Pat learned that he would be  the just the third broadcaster to be inducted into the Cubs Hall of  Fame, he went right back to calling the play, completely awestruck, but  like the true professional he is, he never missed a beat. And little  did he know that just a few months later, he would be getting the call  from Cooperstown. Pat lives his life play-by-play--staying in the  moment, constantly improving, and transporting Cubs fans everywhere to  Wrigley Field with his distinctive voice. During Pat's acceptance  speech in Cooperstown, he thanked Cubs fans for making him part of the  Cubs family, inviting him to graduations, bar mitzvahs, and birthdays.  And he was quick to give credit to the line-up of broadcasters that he  deeply admired.   Many remember Pat's time in the booth with Cubs Hall of Famer, the  late Ron Santo, his broadcasting partner from 1996 until 2010. The  ``Pat and Ron'' show was a favorite for the fans as Hughes worked well  with the former third baseman, who wasn't shy to hide his love for the  Cubs. A nine-time winner of the Illinois Sportscaster of the Year  Award, Pat also won three straight Wisconsin Sportscaster of the Year  Awards from 1990-92. He has called more than 6,000 MLB games, including  eight no-hitters, the 25-inning White Sox v. Brewers contest in 1984  that was the longest game in American League history, and Kerry Wood's  20-strikeout game in 1998.   On November 2, 2016, when the Chicago Cubs ended a 108-year drought  by winning game seven of the World Series, it was Pat who called the  final out. He will forever be a part of Chicago Cubs history, and just  as Pat studied other broadcasters, his legacy will be one to learn  from.   I congratulate Pat; his wife Trish; their daughters Janell and Amber;  and his entire family on this achievement. Cubs fans everywhere are  flying the W for you. And, as Pat would say, ``Get out the tape  measure, Long Gone!''--all the way to Cooperstown.                            ____________________
