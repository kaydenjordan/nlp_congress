 Mr. President, today, the Senate will have an  opportunity to advance another COVID-19 relief package for American  families. For more than 7 months now, the American people have been  facing what one writer described as a ``health crisis with an economic  crisis strapped to its back.''   The Senate has stepped up repeatedly, on a bipartisan basis, to help  our Nation through this challenge. Today, we have an opportunity to do  it once again.   The legislation before us is neither Republicans' nor Democrats' idea  of a perfect bill. I think we are all clear on that. But it would move  us past Speaker Pelosi's all-or-nothing obstruction and deliver huge  support right now for the most pressing needs of our country.   Republicans want to conquer this disease through testing, treatments,  and vaccines. Democrats say they agree with us.   Republicans want to pour money into safe schools and make sure an  entire  [[Page S6338]]  generation of kids don't fall any further behind, and Democrats say  they agree with that.   Republicans want to reopen the Paycheck Protection Program so that  Main Streets across America don't turn into COVID-19 ghost towns, so  that millions of workers can keep their jobs and keep getting paid.  Democrats say they agree with that.   For workers who have been laid off, Republicans want to renew the  Federal supplement to unemployment insurance. Democrats say they agree  with that.   Republicans want to cement health protections for Americans with  preexisting conditions, including COVID-19 itself. Democrats claim they  are all over this issue.   And Republicans want to take our Nation's college presidents,  nonprofit leaders, and employers at their word when they say they need  commonsense protections so that legal uncertainty does not block their  reopening.   The bill on the floor would do every one of those things and much  more. The overwhelming bulk of it are programs that Democrats claim  they support. It turns out there is a special perk to being a Senator.  When you actually support something, you get to vote for it. When you  actually support something, you get to vote for it. When you actually  want an outcome, you vote for it.   Strangely enough, that is not what seems to be happening. Our  Democratic colleagues have been happy to talk about further relief as  long as it remained a hypothetical concept. But every time the Senate  has had a chance to actually do something, they said no.   In July, Republicans tried to continue the Federal plus-up to  unemployment insurance before it expired. Senator Schumer blocked it.  In August, Senator McSally fought again to restart those benefits for  laid-off Americans. Once again, Democrats stopped it cold.   In September, Republicans wrote a sweeping proposal to deliver  hundreds of billions of dollars for safe schools, unemployment  benefits, paycheck protection, and the healthcare fight. Every single  Senate Democrat voted to kill it all, except the junior Senator from  California, who didn't vote.   This has been the dynamic for months now: Republicans trying to pass  commonsense policies that the Democrats say they support and Democrats  replying that working people can't get a dime unless Speaker Pelosi  gets everything she wants.   We are talking about silly stuff: massive tax cuts for rich people in  blue States, stimulus checks for people in our country illegally,  wheelbarrows of cash--out of any proportion to COVID-19 needs--for  State and city governments that Democrats have mismanaged for decades,  and removing longstanding bipartisan Hyde protections that protect  taxpayers from funding abortions.   Now I hear they don't want to renew the PPP unless it sends money to  Planned Parenthood and criminals who are, literally, currently in  prison. Let me say that again. They don't want to renew PPP unless it  sends money to Planned Parenthood and criminals who are, literally,  currently in prison.   These are the kinds of far-left fringe demands over which Democrats  have blocked kitchen-table assistance for American families and  healthcare support to crush the virus.   During this historic crisis, the Democratic leaders have elected to  deny struggling people the help they need unless President Trump signs  the entire Democratic Party platform into law.   Today, we are providing another chance to right the ship. In a few  minutes, Senators will vote to either advance or filibuster a broad  package that would deliver on all kinds of urgent needs: testing,  treatments, vaccines, safe schools for our kids, a second round of the  job-saving PPP, more Federal unemployment benefits, the legal  protections that university presidents and charities say they need,  protections for preexisting conditions. There is almost nothing in  this proposal that Democrats even claim to oppose.    Just last week, the entire country watched our colleagues on the  Justice Committee complain over and over about having to fulfill those  responsibilities when they supposedly wanted to be working on a  coronavirus relief package. We will see who walks the walk.   I am confident the Democratic leader will repeat the same tired  attacks he has been recycling since the summertime. He will say we  shouldn't do anything unless we do everything. He will argue this  multi-hundred-billion-dollar bill is paltry--$500 billion is paltry or  meager or emaciated, a half trillion dollars? I am not kidding. This is  seriously their claim--that a half trillion dollars for working people  is chump change. It is not worth their time. Hundreds of billions of  dollars targeted directly to struggling people doesn't even get  Democrats out of bed in the morning.   Well, perhaps, to the blue-State billionaires, who seem to be the  Democrats' top priority, these historic sums of money do look like  chump change. Maybe coastal elites who can practically find a million  dollars in their couch cushions are indifferent about whether we get an  outcome here.   Well, believe me, working families like the Kentuckians I represent  don't see it that way. Millions of workers have been able to keep their  jobs and support their families because of the Paycheck Protection  Program. Republicans want to fund a whole second round of that. Today,  Democrats will either vote to advance it or vote to kill it.   Students, teachers, and parents need to know their K-12 schools are  as safe as possible. Republicans want to send a historic sum of money  to those schools. Today, Democrats will either vote to advance it or  vote to kill it.   For the historic numbers of Americans who have been laid off,  additional Federal unemployment benefits have been a lifeline.  Republicans want to restore them. Today, Democrats will either vote to  advance it or vote to kill it.   Colleges, universities, charities, and small business need  commonsense legal protections, and with cases spiking, our whole  country needs further investment in testing, tracing, and vaccines.  Today, the Democrats will either vote to advance all that or vote to  kill it.   Struggling people don't need more endless arguments. They don't need  to keep waking up and listening to reporters speculate on whether the  Speaker of the House is in a good mood that day, because their very  livelihood may depend on it. The country needs an outcome. The country  needs an outcome.   Let's put aside our differences, agree where we can, and move  forward. Why not get the country in a better place while Washington  continues to argue over all the rest? If the sun sets today with no  progress, if the Senate turns to Judge Barrett's nomination without  having advanced another historic rescue package, it will only be  because Senate Democrats used the filibuster to kill this aid.   If this relief does not pass, it will be because Senate Democrats  chose to do Speaker Pelosi's political dirty work rather than stand up  for struggling people. Let's not go there. Let's find our common sense,  agree where we can, and advance this legislation while we debate the  rest. The American people deserve action.                     Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 178    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  with respect to the cloture motion on the motion to concur with  amendment No. 2652 be waived.
