 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for  yielding.   This bill is a Band-Aid, and it doesn't even cover the wound. It is  better than no bandage, but it won't stop the bleeding in our economy,  and it won't stop this virus.   In light of COVID-19 and the reaction to it, Congress urgently needs  to lead by example and get into full session safely, but fully  functional, laser focused, 24/7, in full compliance with the House  rules for debate, amendment, and voting.   Every one of us has a duty to balance and consider public health and  our economy, but every single one of us swore an oath to support and  defend our Constitution, to defend freedom and represent our  constituents.   It is time to support and defend it. It is time for us to occupy this  House and man our duty station and win.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman).
