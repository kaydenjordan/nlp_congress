 Mr. Speaker, last night, the President went on  television in an attempt to justify his decision to shut down our  government and plunge our country into chaos. He claims that we are in  the middle of an emergency, and I actually agree with him on that. I  just don't agree on what the emergency is.   It is an emergency that more than 5,200 Federal workers in Michigan  are working without pay, or are furloughed.   It is an emergency that the Environmental Protection Agency has  halted inspections of our drinking water systems.   And it is an emergency that our President is ready to spend, in his  words, ``years'' prolonging this shutdown and hurting American families  for the sake of an ineffective and expensive border wall.   On day 1, House Democrats took the first steps to clean up this mess  by passing a complete funding package to reopen our government. Now we  are preparing further action to reopen all government agencies, one by  one, and remove any doubt that hardworking Americans will receive their  tax refunds and the services they depend on.   Enough is enough. Michiganders can't afford one more day of the Trump  shutdown.                            ____________________
