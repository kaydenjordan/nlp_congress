 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H. Res. 76,  removing Congresswoman Ilhan Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.   Instead of focusing on real issues impacting American families,  Republican leadership is attempting to exact political revenge.   The effort to remove Representative Omar is inconsistent with  previous actions taken by the House to remove Members from committees.  In the past, this has only been used for Members who incited violence  against other Members, and those removals received bipartisan support.   This bill is partisan, hypocritical legislation that ignores  Republicans' constant refusal to address the violent rhetoric, election  denialism, and extreme ideology among their own Conference.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to oppose this bill.                            ____________________
