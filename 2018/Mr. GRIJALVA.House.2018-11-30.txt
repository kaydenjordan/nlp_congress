 Mr. Speaker, it is with much regret that I and my  colleagues from Arizona ask for a moment of silence for our dearly  departed former colleague, Ed Pastor, who retired after more than two  decades of service to this House.   Our sincere condolences to his beloved wife, Verma; his daughters,  Yvonne and Laura; his grandkids; and his mom, whom he cherished and  spoke about often.   A Member's Member is how Ed was described. He respected this  institution. He treated his colleagues with good humor and with  honesty.   His advice and calmness will be missed, but in Arizona, as elsewhere,  he will be memorialized as a giant in the history of our State.   Ed Pastor will be missed. He contributed much, he gave much, and he  respected the people whom he worked with and this institution that he  loved.   With much regret, a moment of silence for our departed colleague, Ed  Pastor.                            ____________________
