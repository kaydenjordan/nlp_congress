 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for putting this  together.   The loss of Billy Graham to this country, to this world, is more  profound than any lips can ever express.   As Ted mentioned, he was born in 1918, and married Ruth in 1943. What  a dynamic couple they were. How devoted they were to each other. They  had five children. I have come to know and dearly love Anne. I have met  and come to know Franklin to a lesser extent.   But he knew, he believed, he preached that you don't go to Heaven by  being a grandchild of someone. You have to have that personal  relationship with the Lord as an individual child of God. It is not  something you can inherit.   He has been called home.   He spent his life trying to persuade people that he loved to accept  Jesus with the words that Jesus uttered:         I am the way, the truth, the light. No one gets to the       Father, but by me.    He believed with all his heart that, unless someone professed Jesus  Christ as Savior, they had no chance of getting to Heaven.   We know from Jesus that greater love hath no one than a man that lay  down his life for his friends. We have paid tribute to people who have  laid down their life in one great moment of saving others. We have  heard of those type of heroic actions at the school in Parkland in  trying to save others.   Yet, this man, for 99 years, or at least after he accepted Christ,  laid down his life day after day after day for others, trying to help  them come to a personal relationship with Jesus so that he could share  eternity with Him in Heaven. That is his belief. That is my belief.   Yet, several years ago, we passed what is called a hate crimes bill.  I said at some point it would be used to prosecute a preacher for  simply reading Scripture from the Bible, so I can't help but wonder if  he has been called home so he can never be charged with a hate crime.   We live in a time when things have gotten so perverse that there are  actually people who say that these evangelical Christians are so  hateful, so mean, they actually believe that if you don't think exactly  like they do, you go to hell.    Well, that is a perversion of the one religion that is 100 percent  based on love. God so loved the world, He sent His son. His son so  loved the world, He laid down His life for others.   Billy Graham has laid down his life. He has put a marker down. In his  memory, we can give no greater memorial than that we persevere and we  perpetuate that love in bringing others to eternal life with us.
