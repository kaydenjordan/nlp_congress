 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to make it clear that  Biden's border policies are anything but compassionate.   Nearly 300 suspected terrorists have been caught trying to cross our  border this year, and those are just the ones we caught. How many  actually made it through?   As we speak, American border towns are being flooded with unvetted  migrants that have nowhere to go. City streets are becoming homeless  encampments. Farm land is being trampled.  [[Page H2260]]    Migrants from over 100 countries, including China and Russia, are  paying up to $15,000 a piece to be smuggled across our border by  criminal cartels. If they can't pay, migrants are forced to work off  their debt. The administration is creating a program of either  drug mules or indentured servants.    Many of these migrant children are brought here by false  advertisements of free passage in their countries. The Biden  administration has lost 85,000 children. This is unacceptable. These  are the things that should keep Americans awake at night.   Our border is dangerous, not only for the American people whose  communities are being pumped full of drugs and crime, but also those  seeking to cross illegally who turn into slaves or drug mules.   The numbers are clear: 85,000 children have been lost; 1,000 migrant  bodies found along the southern border; 120,000 fentanyl deaths in our  country, and the numbers continue to rise. Where is the compassion in  that?   President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas must answer for the fentanyl  deaths, the illegal encounters, and the unaccompanied children we have  lost.   A closed border is a compassionate border, and this week, Republicans  have brought a real solution to the table by introducing H.R. 2. I urge  all my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.
