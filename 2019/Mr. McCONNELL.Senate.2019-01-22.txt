 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, here is what happened this weekend with  respect to the continuing disagreement over funding the government. Two  things happened over the weekend.   On Saturday, the Senate was in session, and Members of both parties  came to the floor to speak about the urgent need for a bipartisan  compromise to reopen the Federal Government for the sake of Federal  workers who need certainty, and for the sake of the American people who  need their Nation's government fully online.   Also on Saturday, President Trump rolled out a bold, comprehensive  offer to do just that. It would break through this stalemate and would  reopen government swiftly and deliver on a number of other policy  priorities that are seen as important on both sides of the aisle.   That is where we are on day 32 of this partial government shutdown.  That is where we are as this new week begins. We have heard Members of  Congress on all sides demanding a resolution to the impasse and a plan  to quickly restore full funding to the Federal Government. We now have  a plan from the President that would do exactly that, and quickly,  while incorporating both the bipartisan work of the Appropriations  Committee and bipartisan proposals on current immigration issues.   The opportunity to end all of this is staring us right in the face.  That is why we will vote on this legislation on the Senate floor this  week. All that needs to happen is for our Democratic friends to agree  that it is time to put the country ahead of politics, take ``yes'' for  an answer, and vote to put this standoff behind us.   To be clear, the proposal outlined by President Trump that we will  consider in the Senate is the only proposal before us that can be  signed by the President and immediately reopen the government.   First and foremost, it is the only proposal that would reopen the  government fully and immediately. But it is not merely a continuing  resolution. It wouldn't kick the can down the road. Instead, it would  fulfill Congress's responsibilities--without footnotes, without  caveats, without hitting the snooze button. This measure would wrap up  last year's historic progress on appropriations. It would pass all  seven remaining regular-order funding bills and deliver supplemental  funding for disaster recovery.   Importantly, it is also the only proposal that would deliver a  comprehensive investment in our Nation's border  [[Page S318]]  security. To be clear, that is comprehensive by the standards of Border  Patrol experts themselves--the men and women actually on the ground.   The bill would provide funding for each of the CBP's top 10 priority  investments for border security, including a substantial investment in  enhanced surveillance technologies, funding for the recruitment and  training of 750 new Border Patrol agents, and $5.7 billion for the  construction of the physical barrier along the highest priority areas  of the southern border.   In addition to these measures--similar to the ones that earned strong  bipartisan support in the past--the legislation would take significant  steps to modify certain areas of immigration policy. For example, it  would grant 3-year lawful status for certain currently enrolled DACA  recipients and individuals under TPS. These are areas where  congressional Democrats have expressed vocal interest. Now they are  included in a comprehensive proposal to open the government, fulfill  our promise to the Federal employees, and address the humanitarian and  security crisis at our southern border.   It is a proposal that the President will support. As I have stated  consistently over the past month, that fact will earn it consideration  in the Senate. A fully reopened Federal Government. Certainty and  stability for Federal employees once again. The bipartisan  appropriations legislation this body worked out together. The full  investment in border security that the experts on the ground say they  need. Changes to our immigration policies that are similar to the ones  Democrats themselves have been fighting for in the past.   To reject this proposal, Democrats would have to prioritize political  combat with the President ahead of Federal workers, ahead of DACA  recipients, ahead of border security, and ahead of stable and  predictable funding. Is that really a price Democrats want to pay to  prolong this episode, which they say they want to be over and done  with?   Is their plan truly to send Federal workers, DACA recipients, Customs  and Border Patrol, and all Americans under the bus just to extend this  run of political theater so they can look like champions of the so- called resistance? That is what some leading Democrats tried to assert  right out of the gate, before they had even studied the President's new  proposal. Speaker Pelosi came out right away and tried to rally her  troops. She immediately described the President's proposals as  ``unacceptable.'' That is not exactly surprising, considering that just  a few weeks ago, the Speaker went out on a limb and declared that  physical border security is on its face ``an immorality.''   Not every Democrat seems to see it that way. And how could they? One  Democrat from the State of Washington admitted that ``the wall is not  in itself a bad idea . . . it's been done.''   Another from Illinois asserted: ``If we have a partial wall, if we  have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our border safe, all  of that is fine.''   One of the Speaker's fellow Members of the California delegation  said: ``We will support border security . . . all of its elements,  including fences.''   This is just a small sampling of House Democrats' actual views about  the merits of border security.   These quotations don't even begin to touch all of the Democrats'  demands that we reopen the government right away and their past calls  to bring more certainty to individuals affected by DACA and TPS.   On one side of the scale, we have all of my Democratic colleagues'  declarations that we must reopen the rest of the Federal Government and  get Federal workers their paychecks. We have their statements and past  votes that show they believe securing our border with some physical  barriers is a good thing. And we have their stated desire to help out a  number of individuals with a more certain immigration status. That is  one side of the scale. All that is on the other side is the far-left  political animus for the current occupant of the White House.   It seems to me it is about time to get serious. Even the Washington  Post's editorial board, which is no fan of the President's and does not  support every piece of this compromise proposal, had this to say about  Democrats' outright refusal to negotiate. This is the Washington Post:         To refuse even to talk until the government reopens does no       favors to sidelined federal workers and contractors. . . . A       measure of statesmanship for a member of Congress now is the       ability to accept some disappointments, and shrug off the       inevitable attacks from purists, if it means rescuing the       lives of thousands of deserving people living among us.    The Washington Post.   If even the Post believes my friends the Democratic leaders' total  refusal to negotiate has grown very stale, you have to believe many of  their own Members must be starting to feel the same way.   The President has made a comprehensive and bipartisan offer that  would accomplish everything Democrats have said needs to be  accomplished right now, immediately. It is a strong proposal. It is the  only thing on the table, and later this week, we will vote on it.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I object.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 11 a.m.,  Wednesday, January 23, 2019, and that following the prayer and pledge,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day.     Mr. President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in  recess, under the previous order, following the remarks of the  Democratic leader.
