 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the 2023 National  Defense Authorization Act. I want to talk about essentially three big  issues: the importance of the bill, what is in the bill, and the cost  of the bill.   The first question is--and when I used to appear before the Maine  Legislature, the first question always was: Why are you here? What is  the problem?   Why is this bill so important? It is important because the essence of  our defense policy since World War II has been deterrence, and  deterrence means maintaining the capacity to inflict unacceptable costs  on any potential adversary and the will to impose those costs if  necessary.   What we are really talking about in the Defense Authorization Act is  the capacity; that is, what is it that we have at our disposal that can  impose costs on our potential adversaries such that they will refrain  from aggression and initiating a conflict--a conflict which, in this  day and age, would be catastrophic.   Why do we have a defense bill? Why do we have a defense  establishment? Why do we have ships and airplanes and space capability?  In order to deter possible aggression.   Why is this important?   I am just finishing a book by William L. Shirer called ``The Collapse  of the Third Republic.'' Everyone knows Shirer's great book ``The Rise  and Fall of the Third Reich.'' This is a subsequent book that he wrote  in the late sixties about the French Republic and the relationship  between France and England to Germany in the early days leading up to  World War II. The central message or rather one of the central messages  of the book was that the failure of France and Germany to deter and  meet the aggression of Hitler early in the period leading up to World  War II, as early as 1936, led to the conflagration of World War II.   I would urge anyone who questions this assumption to Google:  Rhineland, 1936; Sudetenland, 1938. Those were places where Hitler  could have been stopped, and not with an enormous expenditure or  investment of troops or materiel, but by an almost token resistance  from the Western European powers, which they utterly failed to do. Then  we had the rearmament of the Rhineland; the takeover of the  Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia; and, of  [[Page S6680]]  course, in September of 1939, the invasion of Poland, leading to World  War II, where 55 million people were lost.   Shirer makes the point and most historians make the point that this  was avoidable. Had Hitler been confronted early, before he completely  rebuilt the Nazi war machine, World War II could have been avoided, and  all of those tremendous losses in this country and around the world  would have never happened.   Deterrence is also a key to nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons haven't  been used in a confrontation or a conflict since 1945. Why? Because of  the concept of deterrence. That those other countries--and there are  other countries that have nuclear weapons--realize that if nuclear  weapons are used, they will pay an enormous and unacceptable price.  That has been the policy of this country for over 70 years, and it has  worked. It has worked. But it only works as long as the adversary  believes that we do, in fact, have the capacity to inflict that kind of  punishment.   Deterrence is a matter of credibility. You have to have a credible  deterrent in terms of the actual capacity, and you also have to be  credible in terms of your will to use it. Indeed, at this point in our  history, we are talking about deterring the potential use of nuclear  weapons in regard to the Ukraine conflict by Vladimir Putin.   Deterrence means that capacity has to be credible. And the problem  is, here in this country, we have allowed our nuclear deterrent to  deteriorate and age to the point where we are having to, in effect,  rebuild it, not from scratch but rebuild it substantially. And all at  the same time, the triad: bombers, missiles, and submarines. We have to  rebuild them, and it is happening at the same time, and it is  expensive. It is because this work was deferred for the prior 25 or 30  years that we are now having to do all three legs of the triad at one  time, which adds substantially to the defense budget, but it is  necessary in order to maintain the deterrent that keeps the peace.   I have many friends in Maine who come up to me and say: ``Why are we  spending so much? Why are we building nuclear weapons? Let's get rid of  them.''   The problem is, aggression and evil exist in the world--always have,  as far as we can see; always will. The best war is the one that doesn't  happen, and the most likely way to prevent war is for the potential  adversary to know that the costs imposed upon them will be  unacceptable.   People also come up to me and say: Why are we providing this money to  Ukraine?   I don't get a lot of this, but occasionally people say: Why send  money to Ukraine? We need that money here at home.   That is when I always say: Google Rhineland, 1936; Sudetenland, 1938.  Because Putin has told us who he is. He has told us that he feels the  greatest tragedy of the 20th century was the dissolution of the Soviet  Union. He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union. Ukraine is the first  piece. I don't think there is any doubt that, if he was allowed to just  march in and take over Ukraine in a matter of weeks without any  significant resistance, the next irritant for him would be the Baltics  and then Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, and Poland.   Maya Angelou said if someone tells you who they are, you should  believe them. Putin has told us who he is. He wants to rebuild the  Soviet Union. That is why Ukraine is so important. That is why what we  have done, what we have provided, and the leadership this  administration and our country has provided to other countries in the  world in order to resist that aggression is so important and critical-- critical to avoiding a much worse conflagration involving all of our  countries down the road. That is why it is so important. When a  dictator takes property, they are going to keep going, and that is why  what we have done in Ukraine has been so critical and important.   Well, Putin has told us what he wants to do, and we have joined with  the rest of the world and the incredibly brave and resourceful people  of Ukraine to stop it. That has to be continued.   I am going to talk about cost in a few minutes, but one quick note on  cost is that the only thing more expensive than maintaining a credible  deterrent is war. Occasionally, you see a bumper sticker that says: You  cannot prepare for war and avoid war at the same time. I believe that  is actually wrong. The only way to avoid war is to be prepared. History  is full of examples that that is the case, that aggressors look for  weakness. They look for an opening. If they find none, they are going  to pull back. That is the entire theory of our defense posture and the  expenditures that we are making on behalf of the defense of this  country and the free world.   So what is in the bill? It is a long bill. There is a lot in it, but  a couple of highlights. First, there is a raise for the troops. There  is more money for the people who are defending our country, which they  deserve. In a time of inflation, they deserve a significant raise, and  that is in the bill.   Another piece that is in the bill that I think is very important in  terms of our veterans--and, of course, we are just coming out of the  Veterans Day observance last weekend--is funding and attention in the  Defense Department to the transition from Active-Duty service to  veteran status. I believe that we should be spending as much or the  Defense Department should be spending as much time, money, and effort  on the transition out of the service as they spend on recruiting to  bring people into the service.   The data is that the tragedy of suicide among our veterans is most  acute in the first 2 or 3 years after separation, and that tells me  that is where we should focus some additional attention. In fact, that  is in this bill.   There is an enormous commitment to technology in this bill, to  artificial intelligence, to quantum computing, to hypersonics, to  cyber, which is the sort of frontline of the potential for aggression  that is going on right now. There is a low-level cyber war going on  right now. Just ask any business in America. I talked to a utility  executive recently whose company is being attacked 3 million times a  day, sometimes by State actors, sometimes by ordinary criminals or  ransomware. But cyber is one of the most serious challenges we face,  and, again, that is addressed in this bill.   Another thing that is addressed, as I mentioned, is upgrading the  nuclear triad, not because we like building submarines or missiles but  because we must have a credible deterrent, so that, particularly so  those dictators in North Korea or other countries that have nuclear  weapons will not be tempted to use them. They have to know that the  price to be paid is unacceptable. There is also counter drug policy in  the bill. All of those things are an important part of what this bill  does for the country.   I want to digress for a moment on process. This bill is a prime  example of the bipartisan process that ought to govern all of our  proceedings here in this body and in the other body of government. And,  indeed, over the last year, that has been the norm. Five of the six  major bills passed in the last year in this body have been bipartisan,  and that is the way it ought to be. And that is the way it is in the  Armed Services Committee. This bill was reported out of the Armed  Services Committee with a 23 to 3 bipartisan vote.   I keep a little running tally in the Armed Services Committee when it  comes to amendments. And this year we had 433 amendments proposed going  into the markup of the Defense Authorization Act. They were negotiated.  They were withdrawn. They were modified. But we ended up with 44  amendment votes. Six were on a party-line basis--6 out of 44 were on a  party-line basis. All the rest were bipartisan, either voice votes or  rollcall votes that were bipartisan. That is the way this process  works, and that is the way this bill has come to this body.   Now, let me talk a minute about cost. You often hear--and I hear it  sometimes at home, sometimes down here--that we spend more on defense  than the next 10 countries in the world combined. Yes, but no other  country in the world has the global responsibility that we have. No  other country in the world has the global role that we have; that has  to look in all directions, not just one direction to one neighbor but  in all directions. We have an enormous responsibility, whether we like  it or not, as the most powerful country in the free world. And that  means we have to support and defend freedom, democracy, the values that  we have based  [[Page S6681]]  this country on. We have to be the first line of defense.   So the fact that we spend more than other countries, I don't think  that is really the question. I think the real question should be: How  much are we spending with regard to our overall economy and our Federal  budget? I think that is a fair question. And the answer is pretty  surprising to many people.   This is the percentage of national defense of Federal spending, in  relation to total Federal spending, going back to 1952, 70 years ago.  In 1952, during the Korean war--and by the way, it was as even higher  during World War II, but in 1952, about 70 percent of the Federal  budget was for defense.   As you can see, it trends down through the fifties and sixties and  seventies. In 1987, it was 28 percent of the Federal budget. Today, it  is 13 percent. It is at the lowest level it has been in 70 years as a  percentage of the Federal budget.   I think that surprises most people. They think all we are doing is  spending money on defense. As a percentage of the Federal budget, it is  actually the lowest it has been in 70 years.   The other way to look at this, that I think is perhaps even more  important, is the percentage of national defense spending of GDP, of  our gross domestic product. That is really a fair measure. In other  words, what part of our economy is devoted to defense spending?   Again, going back to 1952, it was around 14 percent--14 percent of  our gross national product was spent on defense; 1987, 6 percent;  today, 3 percent.   So people who argue that we are spending way too much on defense and  why do you spend--they are looking at the raw dollars, but they really  ought to be looking at how big a part of our economy are we devoting to  defending this country and the freedom and values of the rest of the  free world: 3 percent.   Now, should other countries be paying a reasonable share? Absolutely.  And many of them are stepping up. We are seeing significant increases  in defense expenditures on behalf of many of our NATO allies and other  countries around the world because they realize they have a  responsibility too. But I think this is really an enlightening way to  look at this in terms of what does this bill really mean? How expensive  is it? The answer to that question is, it is half as expensive as it  was 35 years ago. And it is about 20 percent of where it was 70 years  ago. Is it a lot of money? Absolutely. The question is, What is it for?  What it is for is, preventing war.   As I think I said earlier, the only thing more expensive than  maintaining an adequate deterrence is war itself. And that is what this  bill is all about.   We have passed the National Defense Authorization Act every year for  the past 62 years. I deeply hope and believe in the interest of this  country, of our citizens, and of the entire free world we are going to  do so again in the next month.   There is no more solemn responsibility we have. To go back to some of  the first words of the Constitution, in order to ``provide for the  common defense'' is one of the major functions--that is in the  preamble, that is the overarching--``insure domestic tranquility,  provide for the common defense.'' Those are part of the essential  function of any government. It is our responsibility. I deeply hope in  the next several weeks in this body we will meet that responsibility.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to recognize the  outstanding career of Jaci Holmes and congratulate her on a well- deserved retirement from the Maine Department of Education. For nearly  35 years, Jaci dedicated herself to advocating for Maine children and  ensuring that their educational needs are not only met, but surpassed.   Jaci started her career in education as a kindergarten and first  grade teacher where she quickly saw the importance of providing strong  educations from the beginning of childhood. This passion and  understanding brought her to Westbrook College in Portland, ME, where  she chaired the early childhood education department for 7 years and  used her experience in the classroom to help others to become educators  themselves. Her passion for education, particularly early childhood  education, only grew as she joined the Maine Department of Education-- DOE--in 1989.   At the DOE, Jaci has served under five Governors and 13 Maine DOE  commissioners--a remarkable feat that is a testament to her dedication  to education and Maine's children. Her time at the department included  tenures in several senior roles, including 12 years as the director of  the child development services system and most recently as the Federal  and State legislative liaison since 2000.   In these positions, Jaci played an instrumental role in shaping two  decades of State and Federal education legislation. Her guiding hand  can be seen throughout many of the most meaningful modernizations of  the way students learn and are supported. This legacy of extraordinary  impact was epitomized by the key testimony she provided Congress on the  reauthorization of the Federal Individuals with Disabilities Education  Act--IDEA. Thanks to her feedback, the IDEA was able to better meet the  needs of Maine's children with disabilities.   During the pandemic, Jaci did what she has done throughout her entire  career and stepped up to serve Maine's children. In the height of the  COVID-19 crisis, she served on the elementary and secondary school  emergency relief team and helped to oversee the distribution of the  CARES Act funding to Maine schools.   Jaci's lifetime of public service is truly admirable, and I know that  others will be inspired to carry on her work supporting Maine's next  generation.   Jaci, your dedication and presence at the Maine DOE will be dearly  missed and not soon forgotten. Thank you for all that you have done,  and I hope that you will enjoy your retirement and some more time out  on Casco Bay.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my defense  fellow, Dustin Mondloch, be granted floor privileges for the remainder  of the 117th Congress.    I also ask unanimous consent that the following interns  from my office be granted floor privileges for today's session: Mateus  Voltolini, Timothy Ryan, Hayley Smith, and Colter Adams.
