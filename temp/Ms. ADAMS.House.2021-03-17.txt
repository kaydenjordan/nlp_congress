 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Michigan  and all of the chairs and the co-chairs of this committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the women of the United States House of  Representatives for Women's History Month. This Women's History Month  marks the 101st year of women's suffrage in the United States.   Despite the fact that women have had the right to vote for 101 years,  we still don't have equal justice under the law. That is why earlier  today, we passed a resolution to remove the arbitrary deadline for the  ratification of the equal rights amendment, because there is no  expiration date on equality.   Yet, to this day, women are still paid less for our work, face  workplace harassment, and are discriminated against, simply because of  who we are.   Women who work full-time, year-round, still make 82 cents on the  dollar for men's earnings. Fighting against these disparities and  ensuring our Federal Government and policies are reflective of the  whole country is why having women at every level of government is so  important, in our House, State houses, and, yes, even in the White  House.   So this month, in particular, we draw strength and inspiration from  those  [[Page H1487]]  who came before us and those remarkable women working among us today,  from Shirley Chisolm, the first Black woman to serve in Congress; to  Nancy Pelosi, the first and only woman Speaker of the House; to Kamala  Harris, the first female, first African American, and first South Asian  American Vice President in United States history. She was sworn in by  the first Latina Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor.   A hundred years ago, only one woman, Alice Mary Robertson, was  elected to serve in Congress. Currently, a record 144 women were  elected to this Congress, with 120 women in the House of  Representatives alone.                                time  2015    I am proud to say that when I was elected and sworn in in 2013, I  became the 100th woman. However, there is still a lot of work to be  done; 144 out of 535 Members is just 25 percent. That is just not what  our country looks like. Women make up over 50 percent of this Nation.   Women's History Month is a reminder of the importance and the urgency  of that work and the need for us to continue breaking those glass  ceilings.
