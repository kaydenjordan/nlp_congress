 Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to  Fort Sill in Oklahoma in preparation of this great military  installation's 150th anniversary on January 8, 2019. For 150 years,  Fort Sill has played a critical role in our national defense, from an  outpost to prevent border raids, to today as the home of the Fires  Center of Excellence and Basic Combat Training site. The history of  Fort Sill can be traced back to January 8, 1869, when Major General  Philip H. Sheridan staked out the site of Fort Sill in a campaign into  Indian Territory to prevent border settlements from being raided in  Texas and Kansas. The garrison was initially named Camp Wichita and was  later renamed after Brigadier General Joshua W. Sill, in honor of  General Sheridan's West Point classmate and friend who was killed  during the American Civil War.   The first post commander was Brevet Major General Benjamin Grierson,  and the first Indian agent was Colonel Albert Gallatin Boone, grandson  of Daniel Boone. The last Indian lands in Oklahoma opened for  settlement in 1901, and 29,000 homesteaders registered at Fort Sill  during July for the land lottery. On August 6, 1901, the town of Lawton  was established and quickly grew to become the third largest city in  Oklahoma and was later renamed Lawton-Fort Sill.   With the disappearance of the frontier, the mission of Fort Sill  gradually changed from cavalry to field artillery as the first  artillery battery arrived at Fort Sill in 1902, and the last cavalry  regiment departed in May 1907. In 1917, the Henry Post Army Airfield  was constructed for artillery observation and spotting. The School of  Fire for the Field Artillery was founded at Fort Sill in 1911 and  continues to operate today as the world-renowned U.S. Army Field  Artillery School. At various historic times, Fort Sill has also served  as home to the Infantry School of Musketry, the School for Aerial  Observers, the Artillery Officers Candidate School--Robinson Barracks-- the Air Service Flying School, and the Army Aviation School. Fort Sill  is the birthplace of military combat aviation, 1st Aero Squadron. It is  home to Henry Post Army Airfield, the oldest airfield in the Army. In  August 1917, Captain H.R. Eyrich surveyed a new airfield location at  Fort Sill and established the airfield, which is named after Second  Lieutenant Henry D. Post.   Fort Sill remains the only Active Army installation of all the forts  on the South Plains built during the Indian Wars and was designated as  a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Fort Sill serves as home of the  U.S. Army Field Artillery School; the U.S. Army Air Defense Artillery  School; the 428th Field Artillery Training Brigade; the 30th Air  Defense Artillery Training Brigade; the 434th Field Artillery Basic  Combat Training Brigade; the Marine Corps Field Artillery Military  Occupational Specialty school, the 75th (Forces Command) Fires Brigade;  and the 31st (Forces Command) Air Defense Artillery Brigade.   Thousands of soldiers and marines have been trained for service in  the field artillery at Fort Sill. Notable alumni include President  Harry S. Truman, who during World War I became the commander of Company  D, 129th Field Artillery, entering combat in the last few months of the  war, moving his horse-drawn battery to engage the enemy and supporting  the infantry, firing his last shot on the day of the armistice.   It is also important to recognize the positive impact and  connectivity of the Lawton-Fort Sill relationship. The connection  between the community and the military installation is what makes Fort  Sill so unique and successful. The community members and  representatives are equally responsible for the rich history and  successes of Fort Sill. Based on exemplary community support and  vision, Fort Sill has actually benefited from five rounds of Base  Realignment and Closure. Through these five rounds, the mission and  importance of Fort Sill has increased. This highlights the fact that  Fort Sill is more than just a military installation, for 150 years Fort  Sill has been a part of the community.   As Fort Sill turns 150, the senior leadership at the installation  represent the long history of high-caliber military personnel who have  set foot at Fort Sill. I would like to recognize the following  personnel: the Fires Center of Excellence and Fort Sill commanding  general MG Wilson Shoffner, Jr.; Fires Center of Excellence CSM John W.  Folley; Fort Sill garrison commander COL Don A. King, Jr.; Fires Center  of Excellence Field Artillery School commandant BG Stephen G. Smith;  and Fires Center of Excellence Air Defense Artillery School commandant  BG Brian W. Gibson.   On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I want to  congratulate Fort Sill on 150 successful years and thank the men and  women who have served their nation while assigned to Fort Sill for  their continued commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to this great  Nation.                            ____________________
