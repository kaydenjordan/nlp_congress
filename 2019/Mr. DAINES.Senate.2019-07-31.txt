 Mr. President, as we are getting ready for a busy August  work period, I am very much looking forward to spending time in Big Sky  Country back home in Montana, away from the swamp, enjoying the  beautiful State that I am so lucky to call home.   In between meetings, I am taking a few days to enjoy Montana's great  outdoors, including spending 3 days backpacking in the Beartooth  Wilderness with my sweet wife Cindy and a couple of our dogs. As an  avid outdoorsman, I was raised to appreciate our public lands, and I  can assure you, nothing beats going off the grid for a bit, where there  is no cell phone coverage on top of the peaks, with my sweetheart and a  couple of our pups and enjoying Montana's beauty, the fly rod with an  elk hair caddis and chasing cut and sometimes even goldens in Montana's  highest lakes.   I will also be spending a lot of time on the road traveling all over  Montana. I get to each of Montana's 56 counties every congressional  period, to every corner of our State, from West Butte down to Ekalaka,  even Alzada, over in Monida, up to the northwest corner of our State to  places like Libby, Troy, and even Yaak.   I will also work to get to one of my favorite places in Montana, the  famous Jersey Lilly in Ingomar. This place is not well known. It is off  the beaten path. But the Jersey Lilly in Ingomar, MT, is home to the  best bean soup in Big Sky Country. If you ever find yourself in east  central Montana, Rosebud County, you have to get off of Highway 12 and  stop in. I have known the owners of that restaurant for many years-- Boots and June. There is a Montana name for you--``Boots.'' They not  only serve up great food and even better conversation, they are also  yet another example of a local family business--the bedrock of our  small towns and counties across Montana. The fine folks over at the  Jersey Lilly are what Montana is all about. It is about hard work,  family values, passion for their community, and passion for our great  country. I am a proud and frequent customer of the Jersey Lilly, and I  can't wait for the next bowl of bean soup.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Father Thomas Tobin, of Carter County, for his leadership  in the church and devotion to serving the faithful of Montana.   Father Tobin was ordained in a small church in Tipperary, Ireland, in  June of 1959, shortly after, he made the trek to Montana in September  of 1959. During his 38 years of service, he ministered across Big Sky  Country, including in Billings, Hilger, Livingston, Big Sandy, Baker,  and Ekalaka.   As a member of the Knights of Columbus, Father Tobin has been active  in promoting Christian values from his local parish to the broader  community.   Father Tobin has been a strong defender of the pro-life movement-- regularly defending the rights of the unborn from the pulpit. He has  participated in a handful of right-to-life marches and has routinely  promoted pro-life activities.   During the days leading up to the  9/11 attacks, Father Tobin was in New York City visiting parishes. When  the attacks unfolded, Father Tobin delayed his return home to Montana/ to pray and minister to the people of New York City.   In addition to his devout faith and commitment to others, Father  Tobin has a profound love for our great outdoors. Those who know him  best say he can often be found at a local dam or lake with a fishing  pole. He also enjoys long drives in the country and taking long walks  and hikes.   I am proud to honor Father Tobin as this week's Montanan of the Week.  His devotion to his Catholic faith and his community is exemplary of  the Montana spirit.                            ____________________
