 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to control the time  on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 482, the Newborn  Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2021.   Newborn screening is critical in the early detection and intervention  of health conditions, some life-threatening, for our Nation's infants.  They are for serious but rare conditions that families and doctors may  otherwise be unable to detect at birth. Newborns are screened in the  hospital when they are 1 or 2 days old by blood tests, in addition to  hearing and heart screenings.   About 1 in 300 newborns has a condition that can be detected via  newborn screening. However, if not detected and left untreated, these  conditions can impact a child for the rest of their life by causing  disabilities, developmental delays, illness, or even death.   Prior to the passage of the first Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act  in 2008, which helped better standardize screening programs, States had  varying standards for newborn screening, and they were not screening  for many of the core conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening  Panel.   This bill authorizes funding for the Health Resources and Services  Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the  National Institutes of Health to ensure that our newborn screening  remains comprehensive and that our Nation's healthcare providers are  adequately equipped to conduct the screenings.   Specifically, H.R. 482 reauthorizes grants through the Health  Resources and Services Administration to expand State screening  programs and improve follow-up care after a detection, in addition to  allowing for the National Institutes of Health Hunter Kelly Newborn  Screening program to continue to identify new treatments for conditions  detected by newborn screening.   The importance of newborn screenings can't be overstated. Screening  provides physicians and families with critical information regarding  infant health, allowing for early intervention and treatment,  if necessary.    I urge my fellow Members to support H.R. 482, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill and encourage others to do  so. When I first was elected to the State Senate, the General Assembly  of Kentucky, one of the biggest public policy efforts I got involved in  was Governor Patton--our governor at the time--who was proposing a big  0-3 kind of overall for Kentucky's babies and children, and a big part  of it was newborn screenings.   And that was a section I was kind of assigned to look into and I  spent a lot of time doing research--even going down to see a lady who  does this kind of research at Vanderbilt University and walked away  convinced that it is the right public policy to do. It is money well- spent. It really changes people's ability. If you can't get your  language at an early time, you can never get it back.   So this absolutely prevents--if you want to look at the cost of this  system, this system going forward, but more importantly, it really  enhances people to have the opportunity to live a full life if we catch  it at the youngest level.   So I am convinced of this. I support this bill, and I encourage my  colleagues to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3752, the  Pandemic Effects on Home Safety and Tourism Act.   I first thank Representatives Cardenas and Davis for their efforts on  this bill to protect consumers. I also thank Representatives Upton and  Castor for including provisions to promote and assist our tourism  industry, an essential component of our Nation's economy, and something  I care deeply about as cochair of the Congressional Tourism Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3752 directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission  to report on trends of injuries and deaths from consumer products  during the COVID-19 pandemic. As more Americans have spent time in  their homes, it is important the CPSC continues to inform consumers  with information about potentially hazardous products.   Additionally, H.R. 3752 requires the Department of Commerce to study  and report on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our travel and  tourism industry. This industry plays a significant role in many local  communities and supports over 50 million jobs across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.  [[Page H2944]]         Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote for this  bill. I think it is a good bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
