 Mr. Speaker, I rise in this Chamber today in support of  H.R. 8.   Americans have been waiting for Congress to catch up to them. It  isn't often that we hear that 70, 80, or 90 percent of Americans agree  on something, but when it comes to universal background checks, 97  percent of Americans think it is a good idea.   In my own district, I have seen that unity. After Parkland, we had  13,000 people in Morristown, New Jersey, at the student-led March for  Our Lives demanding gun safety legislation. After the horrific shooting  at the Tree of Life synagogue, members of the community came together  to denounce gun violence.   The 11th District of New Jersey understands that universal background  checks are a responsible way to address the gun violence epidemic in  this country. It is a way to keep our communities safe.   Here in New Jersey, we know that successful, responsible gun  ownership looks a lot like the legislation we have on the books. We  have good gun safety laws, but they are constantly undermined by States  with weak gun safety laws.   As a Federal prosecutor, I worked on cases where we traced illegal  guns to neighboring States with weak gun safety laws. That is why it is  so important that we have stronger Federal gun safety laws. Gun  violence is a national problem, and it deserves a national response.   Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a culture of gun safety. My father is a  hunter, and he taught me how to shoot. I went on to serve in the United  States Navy, and I was qualified as an expert shot in the M16, the Colt  45, and the 9-millimeter Beretta.   I am joined today by a fellow freshman veteran, the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania, and we have been trained and know the power of these  weapons and the damage that they can do. Universal background checks  are an easy step that we can take to improve gun safety in this  country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Houlahan).
