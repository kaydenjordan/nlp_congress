 Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor today  with my colleagues, both the Senator from Iowa behind me and the  Senator from California, because I want to thank them publicly for  their leadership as they work to address these issues of domestic  violence. They have been leaders in this arena for years, and I  appreciate that.   I am pleased to have worked with them on this framework that has been  discussed by both Senators and to acknowledge the work of Senator  Durbin as part of this initiative as well.   I think as both of them have spoken, it is recognized that this is a  matter of urgency. This is a matter for all of us, on a bipartisan  basis. Domestic violence, unfortunately, knows no political bounds, and  our response to those who are truly among the most vulnerable of us-- that response--should also be bipartisan.   So I want to commend Senator Ernst, Senator Feinstein, Senator Durbin  for their work in really coming to find common ground on this very  important matter. It has been years----     Please.    Well, thank you.   Again, it takes a lot of people, and the years that Senator Ernst has  been working this initiative on this side of the aisle is something  that, again, we want to build on, and we need to build on it together.   It has been years in the making. The last time we had a VAWA  reauthorization was VAWA 2013, and so we are high past time to be  addressing this very significant matter.   No compromise is perfect. I think everyone recognizes that. But what  has been developed through this framework is a proposal that will  really help to prevent violence, to support our survivors, and to hold  perpetrators to account.   The effort to be here where we are today on the floor, speaking to  this, is one thing, but we all want to get to that next step, which is  filing the legislation so we can get it moving through this process,  and I look forward to doing that in the new year.  [[Page S9233]]    I can tell you, as a Senator from Alaska, this is an extraordinarily  pressing issue in my State. As the vice chairman of the Indian Affairs  Committee, I can affirm that this is a very real need across Native  lands, and it is the disproportionate victimization of Native people  that I want to focus my comments on today.   By now, I would hope that every Senator understands the crisis of  missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. We refer to this as  MMIW. That is why we passed Savanna's Act and the Not Invisible Act.   I want to acknowledge my colleague, who has been working this issue  with us for so long, Senator Cortez Masto.   I think we recognize that we have made good progress there, but to  fully address the root causes of this crisis--the high rates of  domestic violence, sexual assault, and trafficking, the violent crime  in Native communities--we have an awful lot more to do.   The rates of violence experienced by Alaska Natives are particularly  horrific, and the statistics should shock us all. I repeat them a lot,  and they still shock me. According to a report prepared by the Indian  Law and Order Commission, Alaska Native women are overrepresented by  nearly 250 percent among female domestic violence victims around our  country.   Putting it in context here, a couple years ago, there was an  investigation that was conducted by Anchorage Daily News that  determined that one in three Native communities in rural Alaska has no  local law enforcement that is physically present, leaving Native women  and children at greater risk of violence. Think about what that means  for just a minute, to live in a community where there is no one to turn  to, no law enforcement presence to turn to. Maybe you are able to share  your story with a local health aide there, but that is about as far as  you can go.   Beyond that, you have many Alaskan Tribes that lack the tools they  need to address violence in their communities.   A couple years ago, the Attorney General at the time, William Barr,  was invited to the State and came up, and we said: We need to get you  out to one of these remote villages.   He saw firsthand, and he was so dramatically impacted after his just  multiple hours on the ground there, he declared a law enforcement  emergency--a law enforcement emergency--after hearing directly from  those who had suffered due to lack of public safety. He said at the  time that it was harder for him to imagine a more vulnerable population  than the women and children he saw in rural Alaska. He took that back  to DC with him and acted on it. His declaration was based on the fact  that Alaska has the highest per capita crime rate in this country, and,  of course, we face very unique geographic and jurisdictional  landscapes.   Then comes COVID-19, and you have a pandemic where you have to be in  your social bubbles, you have to be inside, and you have to be where it  is safe to be away from the virus, but that safe place was not a safe  place for far too many people.   Last summer, rural Alaska saw five domestic violence homicides in 10  days. Again, these are small, rural communities--five homicides in a  matter of 10 days; domestic violence. In the 5 weeks after the State of  Alaska declared a public health disaster due to the coronavirus  pandemic, calls to our domestic violence shelter increased by 52  percent.   You cannot let this go unaddressed. We have an opportunity here in  this Congress to build on our previous work with VAWA 2013, where we  have taken steps to resolve jurisdictional complexity when it imperils  the safety of people. The jurisdiction issues should not deny justice.  It just should not.    In the 2013 reauthorization of VAWA, Congress recognized the inherent  authority of Tribes to prosecute and punish certain domestic violence  crimes committed by non-Indians against Indian people.   At the time, that was described as unprecedented, and some Members of  Congress and the media as well pushed a narrative that Tribal  governments somehow were not going to be fair, that they would not  safeguard the rights of non-Indian defendants. We knew that was going  to be far from the truth, and nearly 8 years later, despite all of the  horror stories that were predicted, the record shows that non-Indian  defendants experienced a Tribal justice system that treats them fairly  and in some ways with more attention than State or Federal systems.   So I think now what we need to focus on, folks, we need to focus on  the real horror story, and that horror story is the acts of violence  being perpetrated against Native women and children. So I have set out  to do that through the Tribal title that will be included in this  larger VAWA reauthorization once it is introduced.   Chairman Schatz, on the Indian Affairs Committee, and I have worked  on this together. We posted our text to the committee website last  week. Our title closes loopholes and builds upon the success of the  2013 reauthorization, and we include specific solutions to protect  Alaska Native people.   The Tribal title will further restore and improve the implementation  of the special Tribal criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit  violent crimes in Native communities, and it will do so by allowing  Tribes that exercise this special jurisdiction to charge defendants  with crimes that are adjacent to domestic violence, such as violence  against children or assault on law enforcement.   I think it is important to know that children were involved in 58  percent of all incidents of domestic violence in these VAWA 2013 cases.  This is according to a report by the Federal Government a couple years  ago, in 2019. By empowering Tribal courts this way, we can help combat  this major public safety issue.   American Indians and Alaska Natives are the victims of rape, sexual  assault, and domestic violence in numbers far out of proportion to the  level these crimes are committed outside of Native communities. This is  a moral imperative. It is a wrong that we must make right, and we also  need to do it in a way that recognizes the unique situation we have in  the State of Alaska.   You are going to hear later discussion about ANCSA. Two days from now  is the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.  ANCSA created a new approach to Tribal land tenure that is very, very  different from the lower 48 reservation system. While Alaska is home to  almost 40 percent of the Tribes in the country, we have only one Indian  reservation in the State.   After the Supreme Court decision in the Venetie case in which the  Court held that ANCSA lands are not ``Indian Country,'' it became the  State's duty, largely alone, to provide for public safety and justice  for Alaska Natives.   The Tribal title that we have developed includes an Alaska solution  to a complex jurisdictional situation. It includes an Alaska pilot  program which builds on previous legislation that I have introduced and  will empower a limited number of Alaskan Tribes to exercise special  criminal jurisdiction over certain crimes that occur in villages in  Alaska.   Similar to how the pilot rolled out for the lower 48 Tribes, Alaskan  Tribes will have to meet certain criteria, including having a Tribal  justice system that can adequately and appropriately safeguard the  rights of defendants.   In addition to the provisions essential to bringing justice and  safety to Alaska Native people, our critical legislation will ensure  that VAWA's tools and resources will better serve the needs of  survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and  stalking.   I am proud to have authored text that will help to address this  ongoing epidemic that Alaska faces with violence, which has left long- lasting trauma for too many of our women, our children, and our  families. Congressman Young on the House side has introduced similar  language to help in this. We simply cannot allow survivors and the  needs of the most vulnerable to go unmet.   Very quickly, I want to just outline a couple different provisions  that are contained in this bipartisan framework that recognize some of  the matters we have been working on in Alaska.   There is a provision named in memory of an Alaskan, Breanna Moore.  Bree's Law is what we call it. In 2014, Cindy and Butch Moore  experienced a tragedy that no parents should ever have to experience.  They received a call that their 20-year-old daughter had been shot by  her boyfriend in Anchorage. In the wake of that devastation,   [[Page S9234]]  they turned their energy to and they put their hearts and their passion  into working around the State and now at the Federal level to ensure  that education is provided to teens to prevent future tragedies. So  Bree's Law drives education initiatives to enable youth, parents, and  advocates to recognize, prevent, and mitigate teen dating violence.    Another provision addresses support services for victims. We know it  is difficult to access the necessary medical forensic services in  Alaska. These allow for evidence collection and aid in a survivor's  journey to justice.   While we have very troubling statistics on sexual assault and  domestic violence, Alaskans have also been on the frontlines of  innovation, offering solutions. The Alaska Comprehensive Training  Forensic Academy, which is a pilot program run through the University  of Alaska Anchorage, is making a difference in the lives of Alaskans  who have experienced interpersonal violence.   Built on the belief that all victims of violence deserve evaluation  and care from forensically trained healthcare providers, I have been  able to secure some provisions in our VAWA proposal that will allow  other universities and States to model the successful program and  expand access to trauma-informed care.   There is clearly a public safety crisis that we are dealing with in  rural Alaska and across Indian Country, but we have an opportunity in  this Congress to work together across the aisle to find solutions and  to restore justice. I look forward to building strong, bipartisan  support for VAWA reauthorization that will make a positive difference  in the safety of Native communities and for victims of domestic  violence and entire communities in Alaska and, of course, across the  country.   We must let our women, children, and families who have been affected  by devastating violence know that you are heard and that we stand with  you.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I have come to this floor to speak on  a matter that is very local to Alaska, very important to Alaska. But  before I begin my comments, I want to acknowledge a few of the comments  of my friend from Minnesota.   Clearly, we share some of the same passions about the protections of  our democracy, and I would absolutely agree that key and most  fundamental is that right to vote. And I have clearly expressed that  we, as lawmakers, need to be there to ensure that our elections are  free, fair, and accessible to all, that barriers to voting need to be  addressed.   She has noted that I have joined with others to try to address what I  believe are some of those impediments to voting through a measure that  has been proposed to the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. It is not  perfect by any stretch of the imagination, in my view, but I do think  that it is something that is worthy of the debate. I was going to call  it grand debate on the floor, but as she appropriately points out,  there is not a lot of grand debate that goes on. More often than not,  it is individuals who are speaking to those who are taking the time out  of their day to tune in to C-SPAN.   But these are important discussions for us to have. But I also  recognize that enduring legislation comes about not because one party  is able to make that happen on their own. Enduring legislation, whether  it is the Civil Rights Act or whether it was the Voting Rights Act--the  enduring legislation that stays with us for generations and decades--is  that that is achieved when we have come together.   We will never--it is very, very difficult to get entire consent of  the body. But when we can achieve that bipartisan support and a  recognition that this is good for both parties, good for all areas of  America, this is when we do our best, when we come together to address  these.   And I hear the clear frustration that she has expressed, but I also  recognize that how we do what we do is important. And if we peel away  the last vestiges of protection for minority rights in the Senate, the  Senate becomes a smaller version of the House, where you are able to  effectively move things through just by the raw numbers.   And so these are hard, these are challenging, these are worthy of our  further and additional efforts. But I would remind us that as we are  seeking to make these generational differences, as we are seeking to  provide for these enduring protections for democracy, that how we get  there is also a matter of importance to this body.   (The remarks of Ms. Murkowski pertaining to the submission of S. Res.  482 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    Madam President, I mentioned that I came to the floor  to speak about a significant matter for Alaska. It is a significant  milestone for my State. Just 2 days from now, on December 18, we will  mark the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act  being signed into law by President Nixon back in 1971.   For those who are not familiar with Alaska's history, ANCSA, as we  call it, is one of the foundational laws for my State. It settled  aboriginal land names. It chartered hundreds of Alaska Native  corporations to own lands and to empower their Alaska Native  shareholders.   Now, this structure is very unique. I think most of us think about a  corporation and you think about an IBM or a General Electric, but an  Alaska Native corporation and the shareholders who are part of them are  very, very different from the corporate structure that most know.   This approach that was arrived at with the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act was new. It was a clear, clear departure from the  reservation model in the lower 48. It ushered in a new level of  economic self-determination through private land ownership.   Alaska Native leaders took a look at the reservation system that was  throughout other parts of America, and in most of them--not all, but  most of them--decided on another path, saying: That is not the route  that we would take.   They wanted to manage their lands, manage their resources on their  own terms, and to have greater economic prosperity and independence.   So in Alaska, we have 229 Tribes in the State, and, as someone who  comes from a State where you do have many Tribes, I think it always  gets people's attention when I say we have about 40 percent of the  Tribes in the Nation that are located in Alaska.   ANCSA established more than 200 village corporations along with  regional and urban corporations. And under this settlement, Congress  transferred some 44 million acres of land in Alaska to the private  ownership of these newly created corporations. They also appropriated  $962 million in compensation. So there was the transfer of ownership,  as well as the conveyance of dollars.   So as shareholders, the Alaska Native people would then be able to  decide for themselves how to use, how to protect, and how to guide  development of their lands and their resources. As Marlene Johnson put  it, ANCSA meant that Alaska Natives ``were able to surround and put  their arms around the land that belonged to their forefathers and will  belong to their grandkids,'' and she said, ``That is really  important.'' It really is.   Today the economic success of ANCSA is as self-evident as it is self- determined. ANCSA has positively impacted not just Alaska Native people  but Alaska as a whole. ANCs, as we call them, have become key economic  drivers, creating jobs and industry in Alaska but also across the  country and even around the globe.   ANCs consistently rank as the top 10 Alaska-owned businesses by gross  revenue, and many of the largest office buildings and employers in  Anchorage and Fairbanks and Juneau are home to ANCs.   They also provide important services for their people, like  scholarships and cultural stewardship, often through their nonprofit  foundations. Because of ANCSA, significant investments have been made  in real estate, construction, tourism, workforce development,  professional services, and so much more.    We have also seen the very clear benefit of resource development. We  see this up in the NANA region with the Red Dog Mine. We are hoping  that can be replicated at prospects like Donlin Gold in the Calista  region. Revenue sharing--very, very unique within ANCSA--revenue  sharing with village corporations and leadership in the area of  cultural resource protection--we see that down in the southeast region.  These are just a few of the examples of where ANCSA really got it  right.   As we look back at ANCSA, we recognize that there were many, many  people who helped to make it happen--not just President Nixon, as I  mentioned, the congressional delegation, of course, but more  importantly, the many strong Alaska Native leaders, like Emil Notti,  Etok Edwardsen, and John Borbridge, among many, many others.   We are fortunate that some of the key ANCSA advocates are still with  us today, but, sadly, many of the visionary leaders who were so  instrumental in the negotiations have passed on, and there are far too  many to mention here, but I will share the story of one of them.   Don Wright, this individual right here, was born in Nenana back in  1929. He is shown here with Ted Stevens, over to the right. This is  Don's wife Carol, and this is the Senator from Vermont, Senator  Stafford.   Don was known for his charisma and his skill as a negotiator and a  political leader. Many Alaska Natives at the time were just very, very  personally invested in this effort, and he was one who really led in  this. He personally contributed to the advocacy effort, both in time  and money. Don led that, along with others.   He and others spent nights sleeping on the streets here in  Washington, DC, or in the Halls of Congress. They maxed out credit  cards to pay for the long trips all the way from Alaska to come here to  DC to the Capitol. Don once paid the way for 20 Alaskans to travel with  him to lobby for the legislation. He was really all in. He fought  tirelessly to secure Native land rights.   He was president of the Alaska Federation of Natives when ANCSA  actually became law. He was able to meet with President Nixon in 1971  to encourage passage of the bill and was truly a driving force behind  the effort.   He framed it well by saying that year:         The President and the Congress must decide whether this       last chapter is to be written in dignity or dishonor.    I think, thanks to Don Wright and many other Native leaders, it was  written in dignity.   I am really very, very humbled by all of the incredible people who  helped  [[Page S9267]]  shape ANCSA, many of whom I am fortunate to know and to call my  friends. It is a privilege to be able to honor and thank them here on  the Senate floor for their fortitude, their determination, and their  perseverance.   I remain unwavering in my commitment to help today's leaders as we  continue to improve ANCSA and ensure that the Federal Government  upholds its promise to Alaska Native people.   Now, we say around here all the time that there is no law that we  have written and passed that is perfect, and ANCSA is certainly no  exception. It is really a living document, if you will, still changing,  still evolving. There are gaps; we recognize that. There are  shortcomings, and we still have unfinished business, important issues  that we have to resolve. One of these is recent, unfortunately, and it  does not involve amending ANCSA, but, instead, it calls for flexibility  for the unique corporations it created.   After the COVID pandemic struck our country, those of us in Congress  came together. We were seeking to pass the CARES Act to provide relief  across the spectrum. As part of that--and I was really very pleased to  be able to be part of that effort that was able to dedicate significant  funding for Tribes and Tribal entities. It was $8 billion that was  dedicated for Tribes, Tribal entities, including ANCs.   But ANCs' eligibility for that funding was quickly challenged despite  the very clear intention here in Congress. The case ultimately went to  the Supreme Court. It wasn't decided until June 25 of this year, when  they ultimately prevailed.   As a result of that litigation, ANCs received their allocations under  that CARES funding, but they only recently received this. So they got  the litigation through, and they received their allocation but very  late. But now we have a new problem. The new problem is, that CARES Act  money needs to be spent by December 31--a matter of a couple weeks.  That is just not right. That is not fair here. It is clearly not long  enough to be able to responsibly utilize these very important funds,  and it is really not fair as a result of the litigation they faced.   So the congressional delegation--Senator Sullivan, Congressman Young,  and I--is seeking to extend the deadline through the end of next year.  We are basically saying: Look, fair is fair. ANCs should have the time  that they need and that others had.   While the Senate has agreed to pass a broader bill that includes this  extension, it is stalled over on the House side and really has left us  with no clear path forward, even at this very late hour. So that is  something I am asking my colleagues and the administration for their  support on in gaining this flexibility.   Another top priority for me is something that was left out of ANCSA  all those years ago. Five communities in Southeast Alaska were missing  from its text and therefore unable to create what we call urban  corporations. Today, this is a 50-year injustice for these five Alaska  Native communities of Haines, Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, and  Tenakee. I have had the privilege to live in Wrangell and to be born in  Ketchikan, so these are communities that are pretty close to my heart.   The situation in terms of being left out was challenging enough. It  is not made easier by their location in the Tongass National Forest.  But I would remind the Senate that they and their ancestors lived in  this area. They took care of these lands long before the Federal  Government came along and made the designation of a national forest.   That nearly all of their region has since been taken and classified  as a Federal forest is no reason to refuse to acknowledge and work with  us on this. So I have recently reintroduced legislation to allow those  five southeast communities to receive their rightful land entitlements  under ANCSA.   I would urge my colleagues, take a look at this. Recognize that this  is a matter of the Federal Government making good on its promise to  thousands of Alaska Natives. I would ask that you would join me and  Senator Sullivan and Congressman Young as we work to advance this bill  into law, as we, again, continue to address unfulfilled promises within  ANCSA.   A third matter is a provision in ANCSA that, quite honestly, is just  outdated, no longer needed.   Congress, in trying to do the right thing, required village  corporations to take a portion of the lands they received under ANCSA  and give them to the State of Alaska to hold in trust for future  community needs.   Fast-forward some 50 years, and many of these lands are simply being  held in trust now even though they are not needed for municipal  purposes and quite likely will never be. It is just time to end that  requirement and enable the village corporations to receive these lands  back if they so choose.   We also have to remember that this is a land settlement, but it is  not fully implemented. Keep in mind--it has been 50 years now. It is a  land settlement that hasn't been implemented fully after 50 years. A  total of 5.5 million acres are still under interim conveyance, and  another 1.5 million acres remain unconveyed from the original  entitlement.   We have to provide the resources to the Department of the Interior to  complete this very important work.   There are at least four more issues that we need to help resolve as  well that I will mention.   The first here on this list is really concerning to me, and it is  actually really very devastating when you think about it. This is the  matter of contaminated lands. This problem is not only not going away,  it is getting worse.   It really pains me to say, but significant lands in Alaska, including  formerly used defense sites, were contaminated. The Federal Government  knew they were contaminated, but they were still conveyed to the ANCs  as contaminated lands, and the government is saying: OK. This is part  of your land settlement. We are going to give you these lands, but you  can't use these lands because they are contaminated.   There are horrible consequences that we are seeing to this. We have  clusters of illnesses, cancer. I just had a report that was presented  to the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention just this past week.  This is causing real suffering, true consequences, death in these  communities.   It is no fault of the people who live there and received these lands  in settlement from the Federal Government. It is a Federal  responsibility for us to take care of this, so we have a plan we have-- we have a plan in the sense that we have identified where these  contaminated lands are, but what we need is a comprehensive plan in  terms of the action, what we are actually going to do to clean up the  land and make it right and make it right as soon as possible.   Another issue that we need to resolve is the issue of ``afterborns.''   The day that ANCSA became law, December 18, 1971, was kind of an  arbitrary deadline, if you will, for Alaska Native people to be  included in its benefits. So if a Native person was alive on the date  of enactment, December 18, 1971, they were included as an eligible  shareholder in the ANCSA corporation that aligned with their  traditional Tribal homelands. But if a Native person, even from the  same family--same area, same family--if they were born after December  18, 1971, they were not included, and they did not receive shares in  any Native corporation. So what you had, you created two distinct  classes of Native people. You had original shareholders and  nonshareholder descendants--they call them afterborns--who were  effectively disenfranchised from the benefits that Congress intended  for them.   There was a past amendment to ANCSA that dealt directly with this  issue but didn't sufficiently solve this problem. This was an effort  that we advanced several years ago, a decade or so. Congress has  allowed ANCSA corporations to open enrollment to descendants through an  affirmative vote of their current shareholders. As a result, what we  have seen is that about 5 regional corporations have opened enrollment,  and about 5 of the more than 200 village corporations have done the  same. Unfortunately, so many of these small village corporations that  want to open enrollment simply can't afford this process. It is a  relatively complicated process.   This is a problem that we are probably going to have to address  legislatively--not by directing Alaska Natives on what to do but by  providing some support and resources so that  [[Page S9268]]  they can make that choice at their discretion.   One of the more significant promises made to Alaska Native people  dealt with the issue of subsistence.   In Alaska, subsistence is hunting, it is fishing, and it is  gathering. It is inextricably tied to Native culture. It is food  security for places where grocery stores simply don't exist, or if they  do exist, the food is so expensive that the average family can't afford  it. So this is, again, something where we need to find fair solutions  for Alaska Native subsistence rights.   The last issue I will bring up today is something too significant not  to acknowledge. ANCSA was meant to be a fair and just settlement,  accomplished rapidly, with certainty and in conformity with the real  economic and social needs of Native people without litigation. Congress  wrote that into ANCSA itself. Yet, in reality, ANCSA severed Alaska  Tribes from the Tribal land base.    While many Alaska Native people are owners in Native corporations  that manage Native traditional homelands, Alaska Tribal governments  were not a consideration in the law. Alaska Tribes, whose collective  aboriginal land rights led to the creation of ANCSA, were left without  a viable resource stream to effectively govern. They, too, need tools  and resources to create opportunities, and that is also an issue that  we must consider in going forward.   But all of this--all of this--requires education and understanding.  That is going to be key, and that has been, unfortunately, lacking-- severely lacking--as we have seen, repeatedly, misguided attacks from  Members here in Congress against ANCSA and its corporations. I will  tell you, it is hard to express how frustrating that is, how  infuriating these attacks truly are. But one additional benefit of this  50th anniversary is the opportunity that it provides us to help  Congress, to help the administration, to help, really, the American  public understand ANCSA and the promises that were made within that  settlement act.   Alaska Pacific University and the Wilson Center's Polar Institute  have held a series of events that are free for anyone who wants to  learn and understand more about ANCSA. The Ted Stevens Foundation is  developing a documentary on this. Indian Country Today, First Alaskans  magazine, Alaska Public Media, and the Anchorage Daily News, among  others, have all published long-form articles, exploring ANCSA's  history, its meaning, its impacts, and its future. So I would encourage  folks to take a look at that.   I think it is also important to remember that, while ANCSA's passage  ushered in a period of self-determination and self-governance for  Alaska Native communities, it provided opportunities for these  communities to really look to the future. In short, ANCSA was designed  to address the past by looking to the future.   At the annual meeting of the Alaska Federation of Natives, which, I  mentioned, just took place earlier this week, I reflected and  recognized the generation of Alaska Native leaders who fought for the  passage of ANCSA. It was their efforts that helped pave the way for the  many Alaska Native youth who may be watching back in Alaska, across the  country, and maybe even around the world. I want them to know about the  work that was done to pass this historic law and how it is appreciated.  As I reflect here today on the passage of this important law, I am  hopeful about what ANCSA will represent for our Alaska Native youth in  the future.   My colleague Senator Sullivan and I have introduced a resolution to  ensure that the U.S. Senate recognizes the 50th anniversary of ANCSA.  Our resolution acknowledges the incredible accomplishments that Alaska  Native people have made through their ANCs over these past 50 years.  There are many successes to acknowledge and to celebrate, but in its  text, we also reflect on the work that is left ahead and the promises  left unfilled--the promises the Federal Government has made to Alaska  Native people that must be honored.   So I thank Senator Sullivan for standing with me to submit this  important resolution, which acknowledges the tenacity of the Alaska  Native people and the success of ANCs over the past 50 years. I know  that the dean of the House, Congressman Young, joins with us in  acknowledging this golden anniversary.   I would certainly encourage all of those who have had an opportunity  to hear my comments--I know my colleague Senator Sullivan is going to  speak later as well--to just take a bit of time to better understand  this foundational law for Alaska Natives' self-determination.
