 Mr. Speaker, the Trump administration is the most  corrupt in our country's long history. They are enriching themselves  and rewarding special interests and campaign donors like nothing we  have ever seen. If you need proof, look no further than our polluter in  chief, Scott Pruitt.   Every day brings another Pruitt bombshell. Just today, news broke  that, last year, he enlisted a top EPA aide to ask big Republican  donors to help his wife find a job, eventually securing her a position  with a conservative political group, Judicial Crisis Network. We have  learned about similar efforts involving Pruitt's attempt to secure a  Chick-fil-A franchise for his wife using EPA resources.   He raised millions of dollars as attorney general of Oklahoma from  oil, gas, and coal companies for his campaign. He chaired a dark-money  group that organized State challenges to clean water and clean air  protections. He sued the EPA 14 times as Oklahoma AG to block public  health protections while raking in campaign contributions from his  polluter co-litigants.   He is facing more than 12 Federal investigations into his corruption,  influence peddling, and waste of millions in taxpayer dollars on his  lavish lifestyle.   Mr. Speaker, in any other administration, at any other time, he would  have been fired long ago. It is time for Pruitt to go, and it is time  for Congress to do something about the toxic corruption in the Trump  administration.                            ____________________
