 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in the course of America's immigration  history, there have emerged leaders whose names are synonymous with the  struggle and triumph of these immigrants. Stanley Balzekas was that  leader for Lithuanian Americans, especially in the city of Chicago.   Stanley was my friend. His devotion to Lithuania, to America, and to  the cause of human freedom and dignity was legendary. Whether you  bumped into him on the streets of Vilnius or Pulaski Road, he always  had a smile and story to share. He was as gracious and as comfortable  with the Chicago hotdog salesmen as he was with heads of state.   He died last week, passing peacefully at his home at the age of 95.  As his family said in his obituary: ``His failing heart could no longer  keep up with his zest for life.''   What a heroic heart he had. Stanley Balzekas was a decorated war hero  in World War II, one of the thinning ranks of the Greatest Generation.  He joined the U.S. Army in 1943 and served in the infantry. He fought  in key battles, including the Battle of the Bulge and the Battle of  Huertgen Forest, for which he was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple  Heart for rescuing 12 wounded soldiers.   He landed at Normandy and marched with other U.S. soldiers under the  Arc de Triomphe and along the Champs-Elysees to celebrate the  liberation of  [[Page S3982]]  Paris from Nazi occupation. He was captured by a Waffen SS unit in  France in February 1945 and spent four months as a POW at a camp in  Germany. There, he was brutally mistreated, starved, and lost half of  his body weight.   After the war, he returned to Chicago and earned a bachelor's degree  and master's degree from DePaul University and joined his father  running the family business, Balzekas Motor Sales, which was run  continuously by the family from 1919 until 2009.   Stanley's father emigrated from Lithuania to the United States in  1912. He grew up in Marquette Park, in Beverly, the heart of Chicago's  Lithuanian community. His father made the leap from a butcher shop to  start an auto dealership in 1919. Over the years they sold many models  of cars, from Hupmobiles to Chryslers. The Balzekas name became  synonymous with Lithuanian entrepreneurship. Young Stanley was at his  father's side during the formative years and after he returned from  World War II.   Next to his success in business, Stanley Balzekas' most lasting gift  to Chicago is the Balzekas Museum of Lithuanian Culture, which he and  his wife Irene founded in 1956 in a building next to the family car  dealership. The mid-1960s, when Stanley opened the Balzekas Museum,  were some of the darkest days in the Cold War. Lithuania, once a  massive medieval empire that stretched from the Black Sea to the Baltic  Sea, was then an occupied state within the old Soviet Union, and the  USSR did all it could to erase the Lithuanians' sense of their own  history and culture. Stanley and Irene Balzekas founded the museum to  help preserve that history and culture and, equally important, to  advance the cause of Lithuanian independence.    Chicago was the perfect city for their cultural jewel. It is the most  Lithuanian city outside of Lithuania, and a sister city to the  Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. Nearly one in eight Lithuanian  Americans, including this Senator, calls Illinois home. In fact, Valdas  Adamkus, the third person to serve as President of a free and  democratic Lithuania after it won its independence from the USSR, lived  for many years in the city of Chicago.   The Balzekas Museum's collection started with Baltic amber jewelry  and Stanley's own considerable collection of East European military  antiques. Over the years, it became a trove of Lithuanian and Eastern  European books, maps, and artifacts, and one of the most respected  ethnic museums in Chicago, if not the Nation. One of its prized  possessions was a map from 1430 which showed the Lithuanian Empire  stretching across Eastern Europe.   Stanley spent hours and hours reading letters and examining every  artifact anyone would send to him at the museum. When someone else  might view something as just an old handkerchief, Stanley would  recognize the family's last treasured link to an ancestral homeland--a  treasure worth saving.   But Stanley Balzekas and the museum did not just catalog and preserve  history. They helped to make history. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania  declared its independence--the first Soviet republic to do so. Nine  months later, in January 1991, Soviet troops and tanks rolled into  Vilnius to crush the uprising. People from all over Lithuania rushed to  Vilnius to defend the Seimas, their Parliament. Hoping to keep the  defenders of a Lithuanian democracy and the world in the dark, the  Soviet Government blocked all TV transmissions from and within  Lithuania. But nearly 4,700 miles away, there was a fax machine in the  Balzekas Museum humming a lifeline for the Lithuanian's resistance,  allowing freedom's defenders in Vilnius to tell their story to the  world and, in return, to learn that the world stood by their side in  defense of their cause. That vital connection to the outside world may  have influenced the Soviet Union's surprise decision to withdraw its  tanks from the small democracy in the Baltics.   In January 2011, I had the great honor of addressing the Lithuanian  Seimas, or Parliament, on the 20th anniversary as a free and democratic  republic. I turned to Stanley Balzekas and his daughter-in-law to help  translate parts of my speech into Lithuanian. He wasn't just a friend;  Stanley was my teacher.   In the mid-1980s, the Balzekas Museum moved from its original home to  the West Lawn neighborhood, on the Southwest Side of Chicago. It  expanded its vision to become a place where Chicago's many ethnic  communities are celebrated.   Stanley Balzekas never stopped thinking about how to create goodwill  and understanding. One of his last projects was to turn a small vacant  lot near the museum into a park, which he christened ``Love and Respect  Park.'' The centerpiece of that park is a young tree, grown from a  cutting taken from the nearly 1,500-year-old oak tree, the oldest in  Lithuania. He hoped its shade would provide comfort to all who call  Chicago home for generations to come.   Stanley Balzekas was honored in life by many civic organizations. He  received the highest honors offered by the State of Illinois and the  Republic of Lithuania. His passing was mourned by the President of  Lithuania and by friends too numerous to count.   Irene, the love of his life, died many years ago, but Loretta and I  wish to extend our deep condolences to Stan's children: Stanley III,  Robert, Carole, and their spouses, to Stanley's six grandchildren, and  to his friends in Chicago and around the globe.   I will close with one last story about my friend. Over the years,  Stanley Balzekas must have been photographed thousands of times with  famous leaders or with family friends. He used to tell people jokingly  that the key to taking a good photo was to ``always stand in the  center, that way an editor can't crop you out.''   Stanley, my friend, from your days as a young GI to your final days  on Earth, you were never afraid to stand in the center of life itself.  Your place in history will not be erased. And thanks in part to your  efforts, Lithuania's proud history and culture were made an inspiring  part of the world's story.   Aciu, my friend. May you rest in peace.                            Remembering Art Berman     Madam President, I would like to take a moment to say  farewell to a good man who taught me a great deal about what it means  to be a public servant.   Art Berman was a respected attorney, a community leader and the  longest serving Democratic State legislator in my State. He represented  the North Side of Chicago in the Illinois General Assembly for 31  years, until his retirement in 2000.   He was known as ``the education senator'' for his decades-long  commitment to see that every child in Illinois could attend a good  school and make the most of his or her God-given abilities.   He died earlier this month, June 6, at his home in Chicago. He was  85.   I first came to know Art Berman in Springfield, our State capitol,  when he was serving in the Illinois House of Representatives and I was  a young committee staffer, just starting out.   He was thoughtful, fair, and kind. I never heard him say a bad word  about anyone. He regarded public service as a high honor and a joy. He  seemed to radiate happiness.   He was a patient man, but you would be wrong to mistake his patience  for passivity. He was tenacious in the pursuit of justice and the  common good.   He entered politics as a Chicago precinct captain when he was just 20  years old. He was elected to the Illinois House in 1969, and in 1977,  he moved to the State Senate, where he served until he stepped down in  2000.   All told, he won 22 elections for public office and never lost once.   He was a skilled legislator and a persuasive speaker who chose to use  those gifts to help, more than anyone, the public school children of  Chicago and Illinois. In both the Illinois House and Senate, he rose to  chair the education committees.   He didn't champion trivial matters. Over three decades in  Springfield, he sought to correct one of the toughest, most intractable  problems in all of public education: unequal funding of public schools.   The problem was this: Illinois, like all States, relies heavily on  local property taxes to fund public schools. Districts with higher  property values bring in more tax revenues, which enables them to  provide higher funding for public schools.   As a result, the wealthiest districts in many States spend twice as  or much  [[Page S3983]]  or more to educate each pupil than do the poorest districts.   Art Berman worked to end this inequity. Our State's landmark 2017  school funding reform bill, the Invest in Kids Act, owes much to his  long years of advocacy.   When State funding for special education was imperiled, Art Berman  rallied support to save it.   He helped make Chicago public schools more effective and more  democratic through the creation of local school councils.   In 1990, he sponsored a bill that made Illinois the first State in  the Nation to mandate teaching about the Holocaust as part of World War  II history.   Every member of the Illinois General Assembly is allowed to nominate  two worthy students each year to receive college tuition scholarships.   After Art's passing, his children were touched to hear from so many  now accomplished men and women who told them, ``I could never have gone  to college without your father's support.''   At the core of his commitment to public school students was a deep  appreciation for the difference that Chicago public schools had made in  his own life.   He was the eldest of three boys born to a mother who was raised on  the West Side of Chicago and a father who immigrated to Chicago, alone,  at the age of 17 from a land that was then known as Palestine. Today,  it is Israel.   His father found work with a Chicago bookbinding company. Some years  later, when the owner retired, Art's father and a partner bought the  company.   Art and his two brothers all attended Chicago public schools. He  graduated from Senn High School and went on to earn degrees from the  University of Illinois and Northwestern University School of Law.   Like a true Chicagoan, Art Berman loved the ``Da Bears.'' He also  loved playing tennis. Up until about 2 years ago, if you asked how his  tennis game was, he would smile and say proudly, ``Still playing  singles,'' and it was the truth.   More than anything, Art Berman loved his family. Loretta and I send  our condolences to Barbara, Art's beloved wife; to his two children,  Adman Berman and Marcy Berman Padorr and their spouses; and to Art's  five grandchildren.   May they find comfort in this sad time, and may his memory always be  a blessing.                                The Heroes Act    Madam President, I listened to the statements made this morning by  the Republican and Democratic Senate leaders about the job ahead.   I think it goes without saying that we are still in the midst of a  health crisis and an economic crisis in this country. We did respond.  We responded on March 26 in the Senate with the CARES Act. It was a  bipartisan measure, a measure that engaged the leaders of the House and  the Senate, Democrats, Republicans, Mr. Mnuchin, and the White House.   In 8 days, we crafted a measure that may be one of the costliest  individual measures ever passed by the Senate--some $3 trillion. It was  an enormous investment in America, but it was desperately needed. It  was, of course, crafted in a way to provide help for research and  medical care, but also to invest in the people of America.   We understood then, and I hope we still do, that small businesses  struggling to reopen and struggling to survive need a helping hand, and  we provided it with the Paycheck Protection Program. Hundreds of  billions of dollars were loaned to these businesses, which can be  forgiven if, in fact, they invest in their employees and in coming back  to life after the end of this crisis.   An equally important, if not more important, investment was  unemployment benefits. There are now some 30 million unemployed  Americans, one of the highest numbers in modern history. We know that  unemployment brings with it hardship, sacrifice, and challenge.   That is why we included in the original bill, the CARES Act, a  Federal supplement to unemployment benefits of $600 a week. Some came  to the floor and argued that it was too much money, that we would be  giving people so much money that they would never want to return to  work. I disagreed with that conclusion. I believe most people in  America are proud and determined to get back on their feet and don't  want to find themselves dependent on others. They want to be  independent. I believe that, ultimately, they will be.   For the time being, we need to stand with these families to make sure  they can pay their mortgages and keep their homes and not lose their  lifetime investment, to make certain that they can pay the basics in  life, food and utility bills, the needs for clothing and education for  their children.   On July 31, in just a few days, that unemployment program will  expire. Speaker Nancy Pelosi passed a bill 4 weeks ago called the  Heroes Act--a $3 trillion bill--and it has languished here in the  Senate. When Senator McConnell was asked if he would call up this bill,  he said that he didn't feel there was any urgent need to do so. I hope  that Senator McConnell now feels a sense of urgency.   He came to the floor this morning and characterized the House effort  of a month ago, the Heroes Act, as unserious, a political wish list,  and that people were laughing at how unrealistic it was. Many people  may have laughed at our original effort at $3 trillion, but it was  desperately needed, as is a second effort as soon as possible.   Senator McConnell said this morning that when we return in 2 weeks,  his priorities will be to focus on kids, jobs, and healthcare. I  couldn't agree with him more. Many of the aspects of the Heroes Act  that passed the House addressed those very subjects. If you want to  take care of the kids of America, take care of their parents who are  unemployed and make certain that they have unemployment assistance.  Make certain their COBRA benefits are paid for by the government so  they can maintain their health insurance at this time of health crisis.  If you want to make sure that the kids of America have a fighting  chance and that we create jobs, provide money to State and local  governments.   I am reminded this morning of how many people we call healthcare  heroes are actually employees of State and local governments who are  risking their lives to fight this pandemic every single day. When the  bill that passed the House of Representatives dedicated money for that  purpose, it was money to invest in kids, in jobs, and in healthcare-- the three priorities announced by Senator McConnell. His notion that we  owe nothing to these State and local units of government is to ignore  the obvious. Their alternative will be to lay off teachers, nurses,  healthcare professionals--people who are desperately needed for us to  resume the normal activities of this American economy.    I also hope that Senator McConnell will be open to the suggestion of  providing additional funds to our hospitals across America. I know what  is going on in Illinois, and I have read what is going on in his State  of Kentucky. Hospitals, which are the major employers in many small  communities, are laying off dozens--if not hundreds--of employees  because of the state of the economy and because of the healthcare  challenge. Hospitals in downstate Illinois constantly have ads on the  radio and TV, saying it is safe to go back to your hospital for  elective surgery and outpatient care, and because people are still  reluctant to do so in my part of the world, they are withholding the  funds that could be paid to those hospitals for the care that people  need. We have to see that change. We have to restore confidence not  only in our economy but, first, in the state of healthcare in America.  We need to move on this.   Senator McConnell has said the House of Representatives doesn't meet  as frequently as the U.S. Senate, and that may have been true over the  last several months. Let me remind him that we are in a period of time  when we are all discouraged from travel that is unnecessary and when we  are all told to be careful where we are going, when we are going, and  not to gather in groups that might be a danger with the pandemic that  we face.   The House of Representatives has produced dramatically more  legislation than the U.S. Senate over the last year and few months in  so many different areas, which we will highlight during the remainder  of this week. The House of Representatives has sent legislation  [[Page S3984]]  to the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, which he has ignored.   For you to come to the floor and then criticize the House for not  being in session enough, what is the point, Senator McConnell? They  have passed legislation that you have put in the legislative graveyard  in the U.S. Senate. You will not even take it up to debate it.   We are on this inexorable path to fill every judicial vacancy with  people who are thinly qualified, if qualified at all, for lifetime  appointments so long as they meet the Republicans' political ideology  test. That is what we spend our days and weeks doing here in the U.S.  Senate instead of addressing issues of substance like this pandemic and  the economic crisis our Nation faces.   I want to address the issue of liability, too, because Senator  McConnell brought it up again this morning. He basically said that he  wants to protect those who are engaged in dealing with the public from  liability for their actions. He said that, if they live up to what he  called the best available guidelines, they should be spared any  liability for their actions.   Let me just tell you that I don't know what the best available  guidelines might be, but the best available guidelines should be a  pronouncement by our healthcare experts as to what makes for a safe  workplace and what makes for a safe retail establishment. If the owner  is living up to those standards, yes, I agree with him that it should  be a valid defense for anyone who suggests wrongdoing. Yet, at this  moment, the Republicans cannot have it both ways. They cannot argue  that we should give immunity to businesses if they live up to some  guidelines and not tell us where those guidelines originate and whether  they are based on science and public health standards. If they are,  they can be taken seriously. If they are not, then this is an empty  promise--a promise at the expense of customers and employees who still  show up for work.   We have a lot of work to do. We will finish up this week and be gone  for 2 weeks. Then, in the 3 weeks or 4 weeks when we return before the  August recess, we will have a responsibility to not only deal with the  economic crisis facing America but to take this healthcare crisis  seriously. The other day, Dr. Fauci said we were not in a second peak  in terms of infection. He believed we were still reaching the first  peak, which means there are many challenges ahead.   It is time for us all to get serious. It is time for the President to  slap on a mask and to stop with this colossal ego of his that will not  let him be seen with a mask. If he would do this today--put on a mask-- it would be a message to his loyalists that defying this basic  protection of the people around you is simply not smart but arrogant in  its approach. We need to have some humility here. This virus is on the  attack and doesn't care what political party you belong to. So I  encourage the President to put on a mask once and for all.   Don't be the last American to ignore the obvious   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. No one should have to risk  their life to cast a vote. That is why it is so important to have safe  opportunities to allow Americans to participate in a democracy and to  fulfill their right in November.   Thankfully, in Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker recently signed  legislation expanding safe voting opportunities for all Illinois  voters. Under the new law, about 5 million voters with active  registrations will automatically receive an application to vote by mail  for the 2020 election.   Voting by mail and voting safely at home is a necessary option in the  midst of a global pandemic that has already killed more than 126,000  Americans and a total of more than half a million around the world.  Despite the deceptive and sometimes deceitful narrative being pushed by  some, voting by mail is a secure option.   As the Brennan Center for Justice explained in a recent analysis,  ``Since [the year] 2000 more than 250 million votes have been cast  through mailed-out ballots, in all 50 States, according to the Vote at  Home Institute. . . . Despite this dramatic increase in mail voting  over time, fraud rates remain infinitesimally small.''   However, some voters still prefer to vote in person. That is why it  is important that States offer that option, with safety procedures to  protect them. Under the new law in our State, Illinoisans can vote in  person if they wish. They can vote early as well. To protect voters and  poll workers, the law requires all election authorities to comply with  guidance from the Illinois Department of Public Health on early voting.  Election authorities in Illinois also may establish curbside voting  options. Election day will be designated a State holiday in 2020 to  ensure more safe polling places will be available.   Why is it so hard for those who are legally entitled to vote in  America--what does it say about a democracy when the key to that  democracy of voting by those legally entitled is such a burden and  hardship?   These upgrades I have talked about are expensive. That is why the  Federal Government needs to help. The CARES Act took a first step. I  thank Senator Klobuchar for her role in including provisions that  provided $400 million to help States prepare for the 2020 election  cycle. Illinois received about $14 million. Another $3.6 billion is  needed  [[Page S4005]]  in the next package to help all States increase the ability to vote by  mail, expand early voting and online registration, and increase the  safety of voting in person. The President of the United States votes by  mail. What does that tell us? Is he participating in a questionable  political procedure? I don't think so.   The House-passed Heroes Act, a few weeks ago, included that money,  and I am committed to working with my colleagues to ensure those  critical funds are included in any COVID-19 relief package that we may  consider.   I am also proud to sponsor Senator Klobuchar's Natural Disaster and  Emergency Ballot Act, which would also provide necessary funding and  safeguards to protect voters. I was disappointed to see my Republican  friends block this important legislation on the floor this afternoon.  In the middle of this global health crisis, Americans need to know what  the Federal Government is doing, and they need to know that we are  doing everything we can to ensure that voters will be able to have  their voices heard at the ballot box in November.   If you start with the premise that both political parties don't want  anyone who is unentitled or cannot legally cast a vote to do so, you  have to ask the basic question, Why does one major political party look  for ways to delay, limit, and put hardships on voters and the other  believes that an expanded electorate reflects America? It should be  encouraged.   Federal funding and guidance is clearly needed. Look at the chaos we  have seen in the last few weeks. Is this America when, in Georgia,  voters waited more than 6 hours to cast a ballot due to long lines and  voting machine failures? Is this America in the State of Wisconsin when  thousands of voters didn't receive their requested absentee ballots,  leading voters to decide between casting a ballot and protecting their  health? Last month, a State official said that 71 people--71--people  were exposed and infected by COVID-19 after voting in person and  working at the polls in Wisconsin during the primary election. In  Kentucky, we saw images of voters banging on the windows of  Louisville's only polling location when the doors were locked after  traffic at the site prevented a significant number from being able to  get in line in time.   These situations are appalling, unacceptable, and downright  embarrassing in a democracy. It is time for us to come together and  protect the fundamental right to vote, as well as the health and safety  of all eligible Americans who seek to exercise it   I yield the floor.
