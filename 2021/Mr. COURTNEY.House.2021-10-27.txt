 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Protecting  America's First Responders Act. This is an important bill that includes  a provision that I have worked on for the last three Congresses to  extend the PSOB program to fire police officers.   A dozen States have officers designated by law as fire police, who  provide critical support at the scenes of fires, explosions, and  serious accidents. They secure the perimeter so that other first  responders can do their work safely.   However, because there is no uniform national designation for fire  police, the current PSOB program doesn't cover these officers, even if  they are killed or seriously injured on the job, which sadly has  occurred.   It is only right that they receive the same protection as other  public safety officers. This bill eliminates this exclusion and ensures  that fire police and their families get the same benefits others do who  provide first responder work.   I want to acknowledge the Gales Ferry Fire Department and Ledyard,  Connecticut, Fire Chief Anthony Saccone, who has tirelessly advocated  for fire police over the last few years. Thanks to their advocacy and  engagement and Mr. Pascrell's great support, we will finally send this  fix to the President's desk for signature.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.                                time  1345
