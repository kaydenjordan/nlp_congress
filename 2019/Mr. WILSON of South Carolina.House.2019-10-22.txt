 Madam Speaker, this month, a bronze  statue was dedicated at Johnson Hagood Stadium at The Citadel in  Charleston, South Carolina, in memory of Lieutenant Joe Missar and  Lieutenant Skip Murphy, who died for freedom in Vietnam.   First Lieutenant Frank M. ``Skip'' Murphy was from Florham Park, New  Jersey, graduating from The Citadel in 1965, achieving the dean's list,  and  [[Page H8306]]  going from football walk-on to team captain, being an honorable mention  in the All-Southern Conference.   On December 7, 1966, Lieutenant Murphy courageously rescued his  fellow members of the 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Rescue Platoon,  cited by Sergeant Ken Eising. Sadly, a command-detonated mine exploded  under his vehicle, killing him and two of his men.   He was survived by his wife, Molly.   I am grateful Lieutenant Murphy was a student teacher with Ms. Sara  Bookhart DeLapp's civic class at the High School of Charleston. I  learned firsthand of his inspiring young people to be the best they can  be, to promote freedom and democracy.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
