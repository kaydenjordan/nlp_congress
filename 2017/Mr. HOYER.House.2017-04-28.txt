 Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to be here in the House. I am  not pleased that we are considering a continuing resolution. To that  extent, I presume that I share the opinion of the chairman of the  committee, Mr. Frelinghuysen. I presume, as she has just articulated,  that I share the opinion of the ranking member from New York.   Mr. Speaker, we are now 7 months into fiscal year 2017. We have 5  months remaining, and the majority party has been unable to fund  government for the balance of the fiscal year. They have over 218 votes  in this body, and they have over 50 votes in the Senate. Now, you need  60 votes in the Senate, so it is more complicated. I understand that.  But they now have a Republican President.   As we did for the 2016 budget, which we passed in December of 2015 to  the balance for September 30, 2016--I know all those dates run  together--it was my desire and my advice, Mr. Speaker, that we do the  same thing last December: pass an omnibus, take all the bills that the  Committee on Appropriations has spent literally hundreds of hours  hearing and making decisions on, make the compromises necessary in a  democratic body so that 218 votes would be available.   Now, the American public, if they have been watching closely, will  see that not a single major appropriation bill has passed this House  without Democratic help, so that everybody in this body knows that  whatever is done in a major fiscal bill has to be done in a bipartisan  way. The good news for this House is Mr. Frelinghuysen understands that  well, based upon his experience and his observations, and, in my view,  is willing to work together. I know that that also applies to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).   I had the opportunity to be on the Committee on Appropriations for 23  years. I am still a member of that committee on leave because I am a  whip at this point in time. I am going to vote for this continuing  resolution, but I want to put my colleagues and the American people on  notice, Mr. Speaker, that I will not vote for another one. I said to  the press a month ago that I would vote for a continuing resolution  today only if we had an agreement and the continuing resolution was for  the purpose of allowing sufficient time to memorialize that agreement;  in other words, put it down on paper and pass it through the House and  the Senate. We are, unfortunately, not in that position today.   It is my understanding from Mrs. Lowey, with whom I talked this  morning, that there are still significant items that are not resolved.  Mr. Speaker, I talked to the Speaker, Mr. Ryan, and to the majority  leader standing right there on the floor just hours ago yesterday. It  is my understanding that the Speaker's intention is that we have a bill  filed Monday night so, in the Speaker's words, we can give 72 hours to  review that bill and then pass it on Thursday.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Speaker's intention is  carried out, which will require, over the next 72 hours, hard work by  Members and by staff and a willingness to understand that each side has  some things it must have and each side has some things it cannot do.  That is the nature of the legislative process.   If we exercise the responsibility that our constituents hoped that we  would exercise when they sent us to this body, surely we can do that. I  want to tell my friend, the chairman, for whom I have great respect--I  hope that doesn't hurt him too much on his side of the aisle--that I  want you to be able to say that Mr. Hoyer said he was going to urge his  colleagues not to vote for another CR, and that, therefore, unless you  have 218 votes on your side for whatever the product that you produce,  that if we are going to fund government, as we surely should do, that  we come to an agreement.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on Appropriations for 23  years, I was very proud, it was the most bipartisan committee in the  Congress, and we understood our responsibility that the appropriation  bills are the one bill that must pass if we are to continue to serve  our public and keep America strong and vibrant and economically growing  jobs. This is a serious matter. Continuing to kick the can down the  road ought to be an unacceptable alternative.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.    Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues--there are  not a lot of people on the floor, Mr. Speaker, but I hope they are  watching on television--to understand that the basic responsibility  that we have of ensuring the functioning of the government of the  people of the United States is one that we ought to perform in a  responsible, effective, and timely fashion.   Mr. Chairman, I will work with you, and I will work with Mrs. Lowey  over the next few days to ensure that next week we have a product that  can pass this House because it has bipartisan support and is in the  best interests of our country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring of the  schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour  and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until  6:30.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  today.   One suspension worth highlighting is H.R. 1644, the Korean  Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act, sponsored by Chairman  Ed Royce. Mr. Speaker, last year, North Korea conducted two nuclear  weapons tests and 26 ballistic missile flight tests.   Congress has long led the charge to impose strict sanctions against  the Kim Jong-un regime. This bill would continue that effort by  specifically sanctioning North Korea's shipping industry, as well as  targeting those who employ North Korean slave labor abroad. It is  critical we send a clear and bipartisan message that North Korea's  reckless provocations cannot continue.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 1180, the  Working Families Flexibility Act, sponsored by Representative Martha  Roby. This bill would give employees the option to convert the overtime  hours worked into paid time off. Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans in  the private sector deserve the same flexibility that public sector  workers have enjoyed for decades. By passing this bill, we will give  American families greater choice in how they spend their most important  resource, their time.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider legislation providing  further appropriations for the 2017 fiscal year. I am encouraged by the  reports I have received from our Appropriations Committee regarding  these negotiations, and I look forward to a strong vote on this  agreement next week.   Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible. If any items  are added, I will relay scheduling information to Members as soon as  possible.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for the  information on the schedule for next week.   I would ask him, with respect to Korea, that being on the floor-- also, as I understand it, the committee has been working on a Syria  sanctions bill. Obviously both of those areas are critically important.   Does the gentleman have any information when we might anticipate the  Syria resolution coming forward as well?   I yield to the gentleman.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct. This is a  critical area and one that we do want to make sure we speak with one  voice and a bipartisan voice.   I have spoken to the committee chairman. He is continuing to work on  this. And I anticipate, not next week but in the future, that coming to  the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his focus on that  issue because we agree, of course, that that is a serious and volatile  matter with which we need to deal in a hopefully effective way.   Two items, one that the gentleman mentioned. We just passed a  continuing resolution, as the gentleman noted. And pursuant to our  discussions, Democrats and Republicans both overwhelmingly voted for  that, and it passed handily.   I don't know whether the gentleman heard my remarks on the floor, but  what I had indicated is--and I have indicated to him privately--that we  Democrats are in a position of not supporting an additional continuing  resolution.   In my discussions with Mrs. Lowey, our ranking member on the  Appropriations Committee, she believes that there is a possibility to  get an agreement between the two parties, but it appears that the  committees themselves have reached a point where they think they will  need additional assistance from leadership, I presume, on  [[Page H2959]]  both sides of the aisle to resolve some of the thorniest issues that  are still outstanding.   I want to thank the majority leader and the Speaker. In our  discussions yesterday on the floor in private--they weren't, I don't  think, private discussions because there were other people around. Both  the Speaker and yourself are desirous of getting this done before the  end of the weekend, posting something either as early perhaps as Sunday  night or as late as Monday night on an omnibus, which would fund  government between next week and the end of the fiscal year September  30.    So the first question would be: We share that objective in common, I  presume; is that accurate?   I yield to the gentleman.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for  yielding.   That is true. I want to thank the gentleman even for his comments  earlier in the week. I know they might not have been the same comments  as the rest on the other side of the aisle. It was our anticipation  that we would not have to do a continuing resolution.   I do believe that the committee is very close. It is the intention of  the committee to get to an agreement. I hoped to get to an agreement as  early as today, knowing that we do want to provide to the Members the 3  days so they can read through the entire bill and that we can vote on  this before the end of this short-term CR.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that, and I would  urge the Speaker and the majority leader to engage with others because  I think that would be useful in facilitating the reaching of an  agreement. I know that Leader Pelosi and I will also be available to  the extent that we could facilitate that.   I know there are some thorny, tough issues still outstanding, but I  know the majority leader agrees with me that the funding of government  on a sporadic basis on a continuing resolution is very bad for morale  of the Federal service, very bad for anybody who wants to plan on how  to execute their obligations and responsibilities, and frankly very  disconcerting not only to the American people but to people around the  world who contemplate the shutdown of the Government of the United  States of America on which so much of the world relies for some degree  of stability. It is simply not a thing that we ought to be doing. So I  would urge the leader and myself to be as engaged as we need to be to  get us to that objective next week.   Secondly, Mr. Majority Leader, I know we had some discussion about a  healthcare bill. The Affordable Care Act, as you know, we think is  working. We think, working together, we can make it better. I know the  majority leader and his party disagree with that and want to see it  repealed and that there is legislation to do that.   The majority leader did not mention it in his comments, but does he  anticipate the American Health Care Act, with or without amendments,  being considered next week?   I yield to the gentleman.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know  we have had many discussions in regards to this, and we have a very  strong difference of opinion.   I would believe those individuals that have lost their doctors and  that have lost their health care entirely, that they do not have  someone providing it. If you look within Tennessee and one-third of the  entire country, they only have one provider. There are challenges. We  cannot continue to sit back and just watch ObamaCare fail. We have to  do something about it.   We had committees work through a bill. We have made great progress  over the Easter break. Members have been talking to one another.  Members have seen a new amendment to add to the bill. They have been  looking at it this week, and I anticipate as soon as Members have  looked through that that we will bring that bill to the floor.   I don't have anything scheduled for next week. But as soon as a bill  is scheduled, we will notify you. I anticipate the Members reading  through it this weekend, and, as soon as possible, we will bring that  bill to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that comment. The  gentleman is certainly correct, we have very substantial disagreements.  We believe the Affordable Care Act is working.   I was pleased to see the administration, at least in the short-term,  indicate that they will not take actions to undermine it or sabotage it  without passing a replacement, without having the ability to give to  the American people an option. I think the administration did the right  thing. I hope they will continue to do the right thing in making  payments consistent with the law.   We will have a very significant debate on that bill. Therefore, I  would urge the majority leader if, in fact, the majority leader is  going to bring that bill to the floor at some point in time, that  significant notice be given so that not only Members of Congress, but  that the American people can have the opportunity to assess the  ramifications--in our perspective, the very serious adverse  ramifications--that the passage of the American Health Care Act would  have on the health care and the cost to every American of health  insurance.   The President, as you know, has indicated that he wants to make  sure--and he said he would support a program where every American has  insurance, not access to insurance. He has made comments numerous times  during the course of the campaign and since he has been President of  the United States that his program would provide for every American to  have health insurance at a lower cost with better quality.   I have told the people that, if he sends such a bill down, I would be  inclined to support such a bill. He has not, of course, sent such a  bill down.   So, Mr. Leader, the bottom line is I am simply saying that this will  be a very controversial item and deserving of very significant debate,  discussion. Hopefully, we will get significant notice as to when the  majority leader expects to bring it to the floor so that we could be  prepared for that debate.   I yield to the gentleman.                                time  1145    Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.   And yes, we have had a lot, ample debate already, through committee  and part of the floor, but it is our anticipation that we will give you  plenty of notification.   We have already posted the amendment to make sure everybody has the  ability to read it, and it has already been there 3 days. It is just 8  pages long, and we have provided the 3 days already. But we will give  you, as soon as it is scheduled for the floor, notice of it coming.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
