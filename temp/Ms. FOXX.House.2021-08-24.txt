 Madam Speaker, President Biden has barely been in office  for 8 months, and he has already done irreparable damage to the United  States' standing within the international community, not to mention our  national security.   Rather than enacting a calculated and comprehensive plan to protect  and evacuate the remaining Americans stuck in Afghanistan, he continues  to point fingers and push falsehoods that have been refuted by his own  administration.   President Biden is destroying this great country's credibility on the  world stage with this inept planning, failed executions, and inability  to calibrate in this crisis.   After listening to administration top officials, it is clear that  there was never a plan to evacuate Americans safely from Afghanistan.  Any explanations of efforts that are underway are insufficient.   The arbitrary deadline to leave by August 31 is ridiculous. The  evacuation will be complete only when every American has exited  Afghanistan.
