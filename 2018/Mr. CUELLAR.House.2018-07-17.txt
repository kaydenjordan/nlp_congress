 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Sherman for yielding  and for the leadership that he has provided on this issue. Certainly, I  want to thank the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from  California, Mr. Ed Royce, who has been working on this issue for so  many years. I want to thank him and the ranking member of the  committee, Mr. Engel, for all of the work that they have done.   In particular, I want to thank my co-chair, Mr. Fortenberry, for his  leadership. I remember talking about this particular bill at the very  beginning, and here we are about to pass very important legislation.  Certainly, I want  [[Page H6315]]  to join Mr. Fortenberry, Mr. Ed Royce, Mr. Engel, myself, Ms. McCollum,  and the rest of the cosponsors on this bipartisan bill that promotes  sustainable economic development, combats wildlife trafficking in  Africa's critical Okavango River Basin, which supports more than a  million people in Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and which is home to  several threatened wildlife species, including the largest remaining  elephant population in the world.                                time  1630    Today, that region is at a near breaking point due to the not very  well thought of development activities, and we have got to make sure  that we act together.   Specifically, this bill will protect the vital Okavango River Basin  by strengthening coordination between the United States, Angola,  Botswana, and Namibia, and leveraging partnerships with the private  sector, nongovernmental organizations, and regional bodies;  prioritizing wildlife trafficking to make sure that we stop these  poaching programs that have really affected this particular area;  promoting sustainable economic growth for local communities through  responsible natural resource management; and, more importantly, helping  to stop the extinction of these majestic animals, these elephants and  other endangered species.   So it is important that we all work together as lawmakers in a  bipartisan way and also partner with nations to build international  political support for sustainable development while protecting the  world's most sensitive ecosystems. In today's global community, it is  crucial that we assist our international partners and make sure that we  find a better way to protect our world.   In conclusion, I would say that we only have one world to live in. It  is up to us to ensure that we promote sustainable development so our  children and grandchildren have a better world to live in.   I want to thank the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, my  colleagues, our co-chairs, and all of the Members on both sides that  have worked so hard for this bipartisan support of this particular  bill. So I thank my Members and colleagues for bringing this important  matter to the U.S. Congress' attention, and I urge the support of this  bill.
