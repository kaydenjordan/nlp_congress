 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of  Charles ``Charlie'' E. White, an outstanding American and decorated  Vietnam War veteran.   While Charlie is no longer with us, his legacy lives on. On behalf of  my fellow Americans, I would like extend our deepest gratitude for his  service to this Nation.   Charlie was born on May 21, 1944, in Kansas City, MO, to Owlen and  Lucille White. His parents raised him alongside his brothers Bobby and  Jerry and sister Judy in Independence, MO.   Charlie never shied away from service or sacrifice, and when the  Vietnam war broke out, he quickly answered the call to duty and  enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served our country heroically as a member  of the U.S. Army Special Forces, the Green Berets.   As a sergeant in the Green Berets, he engaged in many perilous combat  missions in Vietnam, including one where he was wounded by an enemy  soldier's bayonet. He donned a scar across his face for the rest of his  life from this encounter and was awarded for his exemplary valor with  multiple service medals.   After the war, Charlie returned to Kansas and settled into his life  as a loving husband and devoted father. Known by many for his hard work  ethic and determination, he led a long career working for BNFS Railway  and provided a great life for his family.   He is survived by his wife Diane, sons Jack and Steve, daughter  Tambra, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandson. His memory lives on  through each of them and through his enduring legacy.   I now have the profound honor of recognizing Charlie White with the  following honors for his bravery in the line of duty: Bronze Star  Medal, Purple Heart Medal, and Silver Star Medal.   These medals represent a small token of our country's appreciation  for Charlie's incredible service and sacrifice.   He is an American hero who has made our country proud, and we owe him  a great debt of gratitude.                            ____________________
