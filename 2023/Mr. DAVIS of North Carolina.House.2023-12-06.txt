 Mr. Speaker, there she is: Miss Eastern  [[Page H6156]]  North Carolina Teen, Ms. Alyson Sharp.   Alyson's platform promotes agriculture and, more specifically, the  advancement of women in agriculture--girls farm, too.   Her love for agriculture has been inspired by one of eastern North  Carolina's legendary farmers, Pender Sharp of Sharp Farms in Wilson,  North Carolina. Pender is Alyson's grandfather. She refers to him as  her ``Big.''   As Miss Eastern North Carolina Teen, Alyson remains dedicated to  community service. She collected and donated food for a food drive to  ensure homeless individuals had a good Thanksgiving Day meal.   Currently, she is working with the Wilson Police Department to make  Christmas special and to fulfill the wishes of kids across the city.  During her pastime, she enjoys hunting and fishing.   Miss Eastern North Carolina Teen is a crown most special to me as  Alyson brings hope for a brighter future.                            ____________________
