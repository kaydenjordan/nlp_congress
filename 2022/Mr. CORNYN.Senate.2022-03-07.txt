 Mr. President, Russia's brutal and unprovoked attack on  Ukraine intensified over this last weekend, bringing even more death  and destruction to the Ukrainian people and more uncertainty to the  rest of the world. It appears that Russia is now targeting noncombatant  evacuation routes--the latest blatant war crime and a clear escalation  following targeted attacks on civilians.   Russian forces fired on civilians as they fled for their lives,  killing a mother, her two children, and a family friend. Over the last  couple of weeks, hundreds of Ukrainians have been killed, and countless  others have been wounded. More than 1\1/2\ million people have fled the  country, making it the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since  World War II.   Through the immense suffering Russia has inflicted, the bravery and  resolve of the Ukrainian people has shown bright. The world has been  awestruck at the courage of teachers, architects, grandmothers,  Ukrainians from all walks of life who have taken up arms in defense of  their democracy.   We have all been moved by the leadership of President Zelenskyy, who  is fighting alongside of his fellow Ukrainians while pleading with the  rest of the world to take action. We have admired the strength of those  who were forced to say goodbye to loved ones, abandon their homes, and  search for safety beyond Ukraine's borders.   People around the world have rallied around Ukraine, offering support  in ways big and small. Families across Europe are welcoming refugees  into their homes. People around the world have organized fundraisers  and donation drives to get food, blankets, first-aid kits, and other  critical supplies into the hands of the Ukrainians.   People all over the free world have cheered on and generously  supported Ukraine at this critical moment, but now it is time for  Congress to act. Since Ukraine is not a member of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization, we have no legal obligation to support its fight  against Russia, but we do have a moral obligation to help them defend  themselves.   Russia has waged an unmistakable war on a sovereign democracy. It has  targeted civilian areas and brought immeasurable destruction to  Ukraine, and it continues to threaten further death and destruction  outside and beyond Ukraine, even rattling its nuclear saber at the  heart of Europe.   Yes, we have a moral duty to support the Ukrainian people as they  defend their sovereignty in their beloved country. So far, the United  States has provided military, humanitarian, and economic assistance for  Ukraine. These resources have been critical in the fight so far.   The United States and our allies have also imposed harsh sanctions on  Russia's economy, sending its currency into a downward spiral. This  has, no doubt, made life harder for the Russian people, with whom we  have no quarrel, but we should continue to use every tool at our  disposal to impose costs on Vladimir Putin for his aggression in the  hope that his own people will eventually rise up and say ``enough.''   Many businesses have suspended operations in Russia, inflicting even  more economic pain on the Kremlin. I am encouraged by the global  response so far, but we need to do more.   This is a seminal moment in American history and in human history,  reminiscent of events most Americans today only know about from their  history books and wars fought by our parents and grandparents. After  this extended holiday from history, the United States must now take  every possible step to stop this war by all available means.   This week, I expect the Senate to vote on an emergency funding bill  to send even more resources to the fight in Ukraine. The White House  has requested $10 billion in military and humanitarian assistance, and  there is strong bipartisan understanding that we need to move that  quickly, as we just heard from the majority leader. The traditionally  slow pace of legislation won't cut it.   This is a reminder of the importance of not only preserving but  growing our military strength. Authoritarian leaders like Putin, Kim  Jong Un, President Xi, and Iran's Supreme Leader are watching this test  of the free world's resolve.   Our Democratic colleagues have consistently fought to shift funds  from our national defense to domestic programs. When the case of  inflation is accounted for, President Biden's first budget proposed an  actual decrease in defense spending. We need to turn that around,  especially in light of recent developments.   The war in Ukraine has proven that a well-funded and well-prepared  military isn't a luxury; it is a necessity. Germany's dramatic reversal  on defense spending illustrates how clear this point has now become.  Our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee are still working  through the details of an omnibus appropriations bill, and I hope they  are able to reach an agreement before the funding deadline this Friday.    While short-term bills are better than government shutdowns, they  only hamper our ability to plan for the future. Our military leadership  needs a predictable budget in order to prepare for the many threats we  are experiencing now and those that are on the horizon. That was true  before Russia invaded Ukraine, and it is absolutely critical now.   In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Defense Secretary and CIA  Director Robert Gates wrote about the need for ``a new American  strategy'' to safeguard security interests. That includes predictable  funding, strong alliances, new technologies, and reforms within the  Pentagon. Bureaucracy and redtape come with a lot of overhead, and  those dollars would better be spent on advanced technologies and  equipment. As former Secretary Gates said, ``Our executive and  legislative branches must understand the new world we live in, set  aside business as usual and embrace dramatic change to ensure that we  and our democratic allies prevail in that contest.''   Investments and reforms in our national defense will be critical to  America's security for years to come, but there are immediate steps we  should take to increase the cost of this unprovoked war by Russia.   The United States and our allies have imposed crippling sanctions on  Russian banks and oligarchs, but the country's lucrative oil and gas  industry remains virtually untouched. Russia continues to export energy  to the rest of the world. In fact, many parts of Europe are completely  dependent on Russian energy exports, and Putin is happy to use the  revenue that he generates from those sales to sustain the attack on  Ukrainian civilians.   The embarrassing truth is that the United States is one of Russia's  customers. We cannot continue to supply Russia with the blood money  they get from their exports to the United States. That is why there is  strong bipartisan support for a ban on Russian oil imports.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation that was introduced by  our friend from Kansas, Senator Marshall, to ban the purchase of  Russian oil in the United States.   We have the great fortune of living in a resource-rich country, and  there is no reason why we should rely on anyone else--let alone a  power-hungry dictator--for our basic energy needs.   Putin's aggression has lit a fire under the United States and our  allies, and we need to take concrete steps to end our reliance on  foreign oil and continue our pursuit of energy independence, at the  same time making sure that our friends and allies around the world have  access to more than just one choice when it comes to their energy  needs. Again, we need to take that noose out of the hand of Vladimir  [[Page S1008]]  Putin when it comes to dissuading these countries that are dependent on  Russia. We need to give them more choices and the freedom to make those  choices.   Strangely, there are media reports today the administration is  considering easing sanctions on Venezuelan oil to compensate for what  nations import from Russia. But I have to ask, why on Earth would we  trade one oil-rich dictator for another?   Instead, here is a novel concept perhaps the administration would  consider: Why don't we boost our own production from here in the United  States and sell it across the globe?   It is truly shocking that this administration is so against and so  opposed to American oil and gas that they would rather make it easier  to buy oil from the Maduro regime than from here at home in America. It  is simply unfathomable and inexcusable. Energy security is something we  have taken for granted here in the United States--so has Germany and so  has Europe. But now they are learning that there are bitter lessons to  be learned from that dependency on imports from a country like the  Russian Federation. We simply cannot ignore the fact that energy  security is national security, and we can't ignore the grave risks that  accompany our reliance on foreign oil for our most basic needs or those  of our allies.   Over the last couple of weeks, people around the world have rallied  in support of the people of Ukraine. In ways big and small, the global  community has sent an unmistakable message that Russia's attack on the  sovereignty of Ukraine will not be tolerated. It is time for Congress  to step up to the plate and provide even more support to our friends in  that country.   As I said, we may not have a legal obligation, but we do have a moral  obligation to supply Ukrainian forces and civilians with the resources  they need in order to resist Russian aggression. That is the task  before us this week, and I hope we can take strong bipartisan action  that sends an unmistakable message to the world.   I hope we will also consider other more harsh actions against Russia.  For example, I support our colleagues on the Finance Committee to strip  Russia of its permanent normal trading relations status. This will  place Russia in the same pariah category as North Korea and Cuba.   The Wall Street Journal made the point this last week that nothing  can be the same after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. There are few  seminal points in our life where we remember that everything changed  thereafter, whether it is September 11, 2001, the assassination of a  President, and now, after this post-Cold War holiday from history, the  invasion of another democracy in Europe.   This is a watershed moment, and the United States must take every  possible step to stop this war before the cost grows even higher and  spreads to other countries outside of Ukraine.   I yield the floor.   I would suggest the absence of a quorum.    President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill for  introduction in the Congressional Record.
