AAA reported Saturday that the average price for gas in Pennsylvania  had reached $4.08 a gallon, an all-time high. Gas in Pennsylvania was  $3.75 just a week ago and $3.60 a month ago.   The most recent spike could be attributed to the Russian invasion of  Ukraine, but we know the cost of gas has continued to increase since  President Biden's inauguration.   From day one, President Biden has stifled domestic energy production.  His policies established new regulations governing methane emissions,  overturned resolutions to reform EPA oil and gas rules, and halted new  oil and gas leases on Federal lands and waters. These actions have  resulted in energy poverty for many Americans across the United States.   When this administration chose to shut down domestic energy  production, it opened the United States and our allies to energy  instability and insecurity. Instead of reversing course, President  Biden is emboldening dictators around the world by relying on their  energy reserves.    A ban on Russian oil is a step in the right direction, but it is  incomplete if we do not reopen the United States for domestic energy  production.                            ____________________
