 Mr. President, we all recognize that a postsecondary  education is required for most family-sustaining, middle-class jobs,  and that an educated workforce is essential to a modern, productive  economy. A report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and  the Workforce found that college-level intensive business services have  replaced manufacturing as the largest sector in the U.S. economy, and  that while college-educated workers make up only 32 percent of the  workforce, they now produce more than 50 percent of the Nation's  economic output, up from 13 percent in 1967. A college degree also pays  off, with one recent analysis estimating that the typical college  graduate will earn $900,000 more of their lifetime than the typical  high school graduate.   Yet just as there is growing recognition that postsecondary education  is indispensable in the modern economy, families are being required to  shoulder growing debt burdens that threaten access to college and their  financial health. According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve,  student loan debt per capita doubled between 2005 and 2014, rising from  $5,000 to $10,000. This is a growing drag on our economy. As student  loan debt has grown, young adults have put off buying homes or cars,  starting a family, saving for retirement, or launching new businesses.  They have literally mortgaged their economic future.   We know that student loan borrowers are struggling. The Secretary of  Education just testified before the Senate Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee that 43 percent of  the student loans in the nearly $1.5 trillion Federal student loan  portfolio are in default, more than 30 days delinquent, or negatively  amortized. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that the  balance of defaulted loans now exceeds $120 billion. More than 8  million borrowers currently have a loan in default.   Default is catastrophic for student loan borrowers. Only in rare  instances can the debt be discharged in bankruptcy. The Federal  government has the power to withhold tax refunds, garnish wages, and  even garnish Social Security benefits to collect defaulted student  loans.   We have seen the costs to students and taxpayers when institutions  are not held accountable. Corinthian Colleges and ITT are two examples  of institutions that failed their students while benefitting from  Federal student aid. Their fraudulent business practices eventually led  to their demise, but not before leaving their students and taxpayers on  the hook for millions of dollars in student loan debt. More recently,  we have seen the closure of Argosy University, South University, and  the Art Institutes, all operated by the Dream Center, leave roughly  26,000 students in the lurch.   We cannot wait until an institution is catastrophically failing its  students before taking action. Institutions need greater financial  incentives to act before default rates rise. Simply put, we cannot  tackle the student loan debt crisis without States and institutions  stepping up and taking greater responsibility for college costs and  student borrowing.   That is why I am pleased to reintroduce the Protect Student Borrowers  Act with Senators Durbin, Warren, and Murphy. Our legislation seeks to  ensure there is more skin in the game when it comes to student loan  debt by setting stronger market incentives for colleges and  universities to provide better and more affordable education to  students, which should in turn help put the brakes on rising student  loan defaults.   The Protect Student Borrowers Act would hold colleges and  universities accountable for student loan defaults by requiring them to  repay a percentage of defaulted loans. Only institutions that have one- third or more of their students borrow would be included in the bill's  risk-sharing requirements based on their cohort default rate. Risk- sharing requirements would kick in when the default rate exceeds 15  percent. As the institution's default rate rises, so too will the  institution's risk-share payment.   The Protect Student Borrowers Act also provides incentives for  institutions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt burdens  and reduce default rates. Colleges and universities can reduce or  eliminate their payments if they implement a comprehensive student loan  management plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce the payments for  institutions whose mission is to serve low-income and minority  students, such as community colleges, Historically Black Institutions,  or Hispanic-Serving Institutions--if they are making progress in their  student loan management plans.   The risk-sharing payments would be invested in helping struggling  borrowers, preventing future default and delinquency, and increasing  Pell Grants at institutions that enroll a high percentage of Pell Grant  recipients and have low default rates.   With the stakes so high for students and taxpayers, it is only fair  that institutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program.   We need to tackle student loan debt and college affordability from  multiple angles. All stakeholders in the system must do their part.  With the Protect Student Borrowers Act, we are providing the incentives  and resources for  [[Page S2121]]  institutions to take more responsibility to address college  affordability and student loan debt and improve student outcomes. I  urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and look forward to working  with them to include it and other key reforms in the upcoming  reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Coons):   S. 969. A bill to improve quality and accountability for educator  preparation programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.    Mr. President, we know that the quality of teachers and  principals are two of the most important in-school factors related to  student achievement. Yet the pipeline into the profession is in  disrepair. A report from the American Association of Colleges of  Teacher Education showed that the number of education degrees awarded  peaked at 200,000 per year in the 1970s and has dwindled to fewer than  100,000 today. This is at a time when all fifty States have reported  experiencing statewide teacher shortages in at least one teaching area  for the 2016-17 or 2017-18 school year. If we want to improve our  schools, it is essential that we invest in the professional preparation  of teachers, principals, and other educators. As such, today, I am  reintroducing the Educator Preparation Reform Act with my colleagues  Senators Casey and Coons to ensure that the Federal government  continues to be a partner in addressing this critical national need.   The impact of educator shortages falls the hardest on our most  vulnerable students in our highest need communities. Rhode Island is no  exception, with Providence, the largest school district, facing an  acute shortage of teachers certified to teach English language  learners. My home State has also reported shortages in special  education, science, math, world languages, and school nurses.   We cannot solve this problem without improving both teacher and  principal preparation. We need to make sure that our educator  preparation programs are worthy of the professionals entering the field  and the students they will serve. The Educator Preparation Reform Act  is a key part of the solution.   Our legislation builds on the successful Teacher Quality Partnership  Program, which I helped author in the 1998 reauthorization of the  Higher Education Act. It continues the partnership between high-need  school districts, institutions of higher education, and educator  preparation programs to reform pre-service programs based on the unique  needs of the partners. Among the key changes are specific attention and  emphasis on principals and the addition of a residency program for new  principals. Improving instruction is a team effort, with principals at  the helm. This bill better connects teacher preparation with principal  preparation. The Educator Preparation Reform Act will also allow  partnerships to develop preparation programs for other areas of  instructional need, such as for school librarians, counselors, or other  academic support professionals.   The bill streamlines the accountability and reporting requirements  for teacher preparation programs to provide greater transparency on key  quality measures such as admissions standards, requirements for  clinical practice, placement of graduates, retention in the field of  teaching, and teacher performance, including student-learning outcomes.  All programs--whether traditional or alternative routes to  certification--will report on the same measures.   Under our legislation, States will be required to identify at-risk  and low-performing programs and provide them with technical assistance  and a timeline for improvement. States would be encouraged to close  programs that do not improve.   Our legislation also makes important improvements to the TEACH  Grants. It focuses the grants on the later years of teacher  preparation, reducing the potential of the grants being converted to  loans if a student decides to change majors. Additionally, it allows  prorating the amount of grants converted to loans, giving teachers  credit for partially completing the service requirement. Finally, it  requires the Department of Education to establish an appeals process  for grants wrongly converted to loans and to report to Congress  annually on the number of conversions and appeals.   We have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders on this  legislation. Organizations that have endorsed the Educator Preparation  Reform Act include: the American Association of Colleges for Teacher  Education, American Federation of Teachers, Higher Education Consortium  for Special Education, Hispanic Association of Colleges and  Universities, National Association of Elementary School Principals,  National Association of Secondary School Principals, National  Association of State Directors of Special Education, National Education  Association, Public Advocacy for Kids, and the Teacher Education  Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.   I look forward to working to incorporate this legislation into the  upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I urge my  colleagues to join us in this effort and support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we all recognize that a postsecondary  education is required for most family-sustaining, middle-class jobs,  and that an educated workforce is essential to a modern, productive  economy.
