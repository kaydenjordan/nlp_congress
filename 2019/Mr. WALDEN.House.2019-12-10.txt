 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 5035, the Television  Viewer Protection Act, and I commend my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle for the bipartisan work we have done on this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
