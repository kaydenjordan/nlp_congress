 Mr. Speaker, today I announce that I am  writing an appropriations rider to defund Jack Smith, Special Counsel,  his office, and the investigation.   This is a weaponized government attempt to take down the top  political enemy and leading Presidential candidate of the United  States, Donald J. Trump. We cannot allow the government to be  weaponized for political purposes.   I would also ask all of my colleagues to join me in this effort. We  have to use the power of appropriations to stop the weaponization of  government, especially in light that we know that there are others who  are guilty of true crimes. Never forget that former Secretary of State  and Senator Hillary Clinton had classified documents on Anthony  Weiner's laptop, who was convicted of sexting a minor inappropriate  pictures.   This is not how classified documents should be handled. There should  have been an investigation done into that.   Don't forget Joe Biden's documents that are sitting in his garage  next to his Corvette where the door opens and closes.   Mr. Speaker, America sees this for exactly what it is, and we will  not allow it to stand.                            ____________________
