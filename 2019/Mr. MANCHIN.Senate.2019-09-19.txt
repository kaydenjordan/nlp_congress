 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution  that would recognize September as National Childhood Cancer Awareness  Month. In the United States, more than 15,000 kids are diagnosed with  cancer every single year, and more than 300,000 children are diagnosed  globally.   On average, more than 75 children in West Virginia alone are  diagnosed with cancer every year, which has been a steady increase over  the last 10 years. We have made a lot of progress over the last few  decades in research for prevention and care, but there is more work to  be done. That is why I am here today to continue the drumbeat and  elevate the issue.   I will share a story of a young man I met just last week. On Friday,  I had the honor of visiting with students and teachers at George  Washington High School in Charleston, WV. One student by the name of  Nicholas ``Nick'' Spence came up to me during my visit and shared that  at age 15 he was diagnosed with cancer. He later sent me a letter  telling me about his story and asked me to help raise awareness of  childhood cancer, which I assumed we had already done since we have  done it for adult cancer.   Nick's letter goes like this:         Dear Senator Manchin,        Thank you for visiting my school on Friday. It was really       cool to meet you. As I shared with you in person, at age 15       my life was changed forever. Before then, it never crossed my       mind that I would become a cancer patient, much less a       pediatric one.        I was diagnosed with cancer and underwent chemotherapy. As       a result, in May 2018, I had to have my leg amputated.        After two long years, I am proud to say that I finally       overcame and defeated my cancer, and I'm currently a senior       at George Washington High School.        I feel very strongly that there needs to be more awareness       about childhood cancer in West Virginia, and I appreciated       speaking with you about that during your visit.        That's why I'm writing today to ask you to continue       fighting for West Virginians and to do whatever you can to       help raise awareness about childhood cancer.        Signed, Nick Spence    Thank you, Nick, for standing up and reaching out to me. I will never  forget how you walked across the gym after we were done with the  meeting with all of the students at your high school, and I was  impressed by your willingness to stand up and come over and tell me,  basically, what you were concerned about and what you want to change.   In addition, I would also like to recognize some very special guests  who have driven here today from West Virginia, and they are in the  Senate Chamber today. From Charleston, WV, we have Kelly Wymer, Ali  Wymer, and Cherie White. I thank them for attending and being here.  They are in town representing the West Virginia Kids Cancer Crusaders  at the CureFest here in DC on the National Mall.   When Ali was just 6\1/2\ years old, she was diagnosed with cancer.  She underwent 2\1/2\ years of treatment, including two surgeries and  chemotherapy.   We are so proud to have Ali here in the Chamber with us today. She is  currently 21 years old and healthy as can be. They said ``healthy as a  horse.'' I say ``healthy as can be.'' She is a student at BridgeValley  Community and Technical College, majoring in healthcare--what else?   Nick, I know you are at home watching this now, and I just want to  thank you. I really want to thank you for sharing your story with me.  It really touched me how brave you are for speaking up and advocating  for people other than yourself.   I am glad we were able to do this in such quick order. Usually things  don't happen this quickly in Washington, but, truly, when it comes to  the children of our country and our home State, it means so much to us.   I am proud to say that this is a bipartisan resolution, and I have  teamed up with Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri to introduce this  resolution. This resolution is also supported by Senator Jack Reed from  Rhode Island and my fellow West Virginia Senator, Shelley Moore Capito.   In addition to recognizing September as National Childhood Cancer  Awareness Month, this resolution calls on Federal, State, and local  governments, along with nonprofit organizations, to create and host  programs and activities that focus on increasing public knowledge on  the risks of cancer.   Finally, this resolution recognizes the human toll of cancer and  makes a pledge that the United States of America will make the  prevention and cure of cancer a public health priority.   I am proud to introduce this resolution. And, Nick, thank you again.  Ali, thank you, and thanks to all of those who are so brave and the  families who support them and help raise awareness for childhood  cancer.   I urge all of my colleagues--all of my colleagues--to join me in  supporting this resolution.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
