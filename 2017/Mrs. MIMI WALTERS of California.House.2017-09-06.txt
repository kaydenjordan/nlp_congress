 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, which will help advance the  deployment of self-driving vehicles by allowing testing of this life- changing technology.   Back home in Orange County, long commutes and congestion are a way of  life. Sadly, traffic accidents, often fatal, are also a daily  occurrence in my district and across the country.   Some predict self-driving vehicles could save 300,000 lives each  decade. In Orange County alone, the deployment of this technology could  save the lives of 150 people every year.   I am especially proud that a piece of legislation I drafted, the MORE  Act, is included in the SELF DRIVE Act. The MORE Act will help advance  self-driving vehicle technology because it allows new entrants to the  automobile industry, such as tech and ride-hailing companies, to test  this lifesaving technology on public roads.   The SELF-DRIVE Act has the potential to make our roads safer,  alleviate congestion, and improve mobility for seniors and individuals  with disabilities.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
