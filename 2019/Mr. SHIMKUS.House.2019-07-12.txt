 Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Chair, this amendment is anything but simple. It  is highly complex. Per- and polyfluorinated compounds, there are  probably 5,000 different permutations, and my colleagues act like it is  one formulation; and it is multiple.   So what they want to do is, in essence, do a de facto ban by claiming  a class of 5,000 chemicals as qualified for toxic and in the Superfund;  and that is a de facto ban of all these applications.   We are all going to fly home tonight. We are going to close the door  to the plane. We are going to have this seal, and this seal is what is  used to protect--the seal around the airplane door--us, so we don't get  sucked out. Banned, toxic Superfund.   No one disputes our colleagues' concerns and maybe my concern about  former installations, current installations, and water in ditches from  firefighting foam. So let's deal with that issue.   Let's not do what this amendment and other amendments will do which  is throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater.   So what do we use some of these formulations of per-and  polyfluorinated compounds--again, some 5,000--for? We use it to save  the lives of people.   Here is a stent, which are in millions of people. PFAS banned, de  facto banned, because it falls under a Superfund. No one is going to  make them because they don't want to be held legally liable if this  stent eventually goes into a landfill. So we don't need that anymore.   More kids than I know are born with a hole in their heart. So what is  the chemical compound that helps plug the hole, so these children can  grow and mature? Oh, it is a PFAS-formulated compound. So let's have a  de facto ban on this device.   Remember, these medical devices are approved by our Food and Drug  Administration. They say they are safe to be inserted into the human  body. So why would we then say, if it is safe to be inserted into the  human body, these medical devices are now going to be unsafe in a  landfill, and then you have a Superfund act and, again, a de facto ban?   This shouldn't be in this debate. I have great respect for the  chairman and the ranking member, but this is a National Defense  Authorization Act. It is not an Energy and Commerce Environment and  Climate Change Subcommittee act; and I hope we will take that up.   EPA deals with toxicologists, analytical chemists, organic chemists,  epidemiologists, chemical biologists, material scientists, theoretical  chemists. Those are the ones who are going to help us decide which of  the 5,000 permutations of PFAS are actually good and which ones are  actually harmful.   But this says they are all bad. It is like--my folks don't want me to  use this example. It is like saying, an orange is bad. Let's ban all  fruit.   Okay. No, we are going to take the peeling of a banana and throw it  in a dump. Oh, no, that is going to be a toxic dump under Superfund,  and no  [[Page H5737]]  one is going to have and harvest bananas anymore. That is just  ridiculous.   It is moved by emotion. We understand that. It is moved by real  problems and groundwater contamination. We are not against that.   My plea is, let's use the committee process, and help you and help me  and these other communities affect change and provide safe drinking  water to our communities.   We have got the water communities who are afraid of this amendment.  They are afraid of this amendment because of previous practices, and  then them falling under Superfund liability, and then having to raise  rates based upon providing sludge to farmers who put it on their  ground, and then they get held up in this Superfund trap.   So I have all the waterway councils, all the water works, the  municipal utilities that are saying, this is not the way to go to ban a  whole class, and this is going to put us on the hook, and it is going  to raise water rates.   I also have a list of 20 or so manufacturing sectors. They said,  let's clean up the water. Let's not ban a whole class.                                                      July 11, 2019.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: We,       the undersigned associations, believe that Congress should       act to address contamination associated with per- and       polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in a manner that       prioritizes cleanups over bureaucracy. For this reason, we       oppose Amendment 440 offered by Reps. Kildee and Dingell, and       Amendment 48, offered by Rep. Pappas, to H.R. 2500, the       ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.''        PFAS are a large and diverse class of chemicals with unique       properties that have been used in a broad number of       beneficial applications for decades. Heightened attention to       potential health effects of certain PFAS chemicals has       understandably led to increased public concern and interest       in new regulatory protections in this area.        We support action to address these concerns, and are       committed to proactively working with Congress, regulators,       and other stakeholders to establish risk-based standards for       PFAS that protect human health and the environment.        We applaud the leadership of Reps. Kildee, Dingell, and       Pappas for pushing Congress to address PFAS contamination.       Amendments 440 and 48, however well-intentioned, are       unproductive approaches to expeditiously address PFAS       contamination.        Amendment 440 would require the Environmental Protection       Agency (EPA) to designate all PFAS as hazardous substances       under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,       and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund, within one year.       Similarly, Amendment 48 would require EPA to add all PFAS to       the list of toxic pollutants regulated by the Clean Water Act       and establish effluent and pretreatment standards, which       could trigger ``back door'' CERCLA designations.        CERCLA listing decisions are not political questions that       Congress is best positioned to address. EPA should retain its       traditional authority to study potentially hazardous       substances and to ascertain whether they should be designated       under CERCLA. The Superfund program has a strong track       record, and EPA's career scientists have the requisite       expertise to examine PFAS.        Moreover, Amendments 440 and 48 would likely lead to slower       cleanups because of an overwhelmed EPA and the potentially       needless reopening of vast amounts of remediated sites. Such       an approach could also undermine the nascent progress towards       clean up at some of the prevalent, known contaminated sites.        We are disappointed that an amendment proposed by Rep.       Fitzpatrick, with Reps. Boyle, Upton, McKinley, Rouda, and       Blunt Rochester, will not come up for a vote in the House.       The approach of this bipartisan amendment, which mirrors       provisions of the defense authorization bill passed by the       full Senate, would have encouraged the development of a       consistent approach and clear timelines for assessing and       regulating specific PFAS across all relevant federal agencies       to ensure that government regulations, actions, and       communications are consistent and coordinated for maximum       effectiveness.        Congress's goal should be to create conditions for cleanups       to occur as expeditiously as practicable. While we oppose       Amendments 440 and 48, we applaud the work of the amendments'       sponsors and the other leaders of PFAS issues in both parties       for their important contributions. We look forward to working       with you on this important matter as the legislative process       continues.            Sincerely,          Airlines for America; Airports Council International--            North America; Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers;             American Chemistry Council; American Forest & Paper             Association; Council of Industrial Boiler Owners;             Flexible Packaging Association; International Liquid             Terminals Association; National Association of Chemical             Distributors; Plastics Industry Association; Petroleum             Marketers Association of America; Society of Chemical             Manufacturers and Affiliates; TRSA, the Linen, Uniform,             and Facility Services Association; U.S. Chamber of             Commerce.     Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
