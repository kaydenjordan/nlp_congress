 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank every single  veteran in New Mexico and nationwide for their service and sacrifices  to our country.   But we cannot only thank our veterans for their service. We must  honor their service by providing veterans the services they have  earned.   In 2018, President Trump's VA began a process under the Asset  Infrastructure Review Act to develop a list of recommendations to  modernize and realign VA medical facilities.   Two weeks ago, the VA released its recommendations to the  Infrastructure Review Commission and proposed the closure of four  community-based outpatient clinics in rural areas of my district,  closing the Gallup, Las Vegas, Raton, and Espanola clinics.   Combined, these four clinics serve thousands of veterans in  predominantly Hispanic and Native American communities. Hispanics and  Native Americans serve our country at higher rates. We are incredibly  patriotic.   The VA wrongly assumes that these patriotic veterans can receive care  from other community providers. They fail to understand that, in our  rural areas, there aren't enough healthcare providers. The VA clearly  doesn't seem to understand rural America.    The VA's own report listed veterans' statements that they have  serious issues driving long distances for care and can't receive  critical care and quality care in many areas due to limited community  providers. While these were listed in the report, the VA may have  listened, but I don't think they heard. But I do hear. I hear my  veterans and their stories. I hear their needs.   I heard Harry. Harry is a 75-year-old Cold War veteran who is also a  cancer survivor. He is a survivor today because his clinic doctor, Dr.  Gomez, ensured Harry received a biopsy, and he received it quickly. It  caught his cancer and saved his life. The clinic doctor knew Harry. He  knew his history and could respond quickly to Harry's concerns. Harry  told me: ``It was my pleasure serving this country, but the thing is  that they need to take care of us.''   Chris, another veteran I spoke to, told me: ``Congress is quick to  send us to war, but when it comes to healthcare, the government is  severely lacking.''   Shirley cried as she told me she believes she is alive today because  she could drive herself to the clinic where she was immediately  triaged, stabilized, and sent to a hospital for the chest pains she was  experiencing. Her heart still beats today because of that clinic.   It breaks my heart that after all that these brave veterans have done  for us, we are abandoning them just because they live in rural America.   I know how my communities struggle to receive care and the toll it  takes on their loved ones to take a full day off work to drive them 6  hours just to draw labs or to have an annual checkup when it could be  done in 25 minutes or less in town closer to where they live. Some  veterans would be forced to drive those 6 hours round trip for care at  the VA hospital in Albuquerque, which is itself overwhelmed, where  veterans wait months for appointments.   Do you know what? The VA never spoke to the local Espanola VA clinic.  I did. The Espanola clinic doctor told me that other local clinics are  not specialized to the unique needs of veterans and don't understand  the mental toll that military service has had on our veterans. He  asked: ``Don't veterans deserve more?''   Veterans do deserve more.   I have traveled to rural parts of my district to meet with veterans  and hear what they need. The veterans I spoke to were upset, and  rightly so. I am upset, too. They gave years of their lives in service  to our country.   It is our Nation's solemn obligation to provide veterans the  healthcare, education, housing, and honorable services they have  earned, regardless of where they live.   This is about respect. This is about service. This is about saving  lives.   I will not stop until we convince the VA and, when it gets to him,  President Biden to reject these recommendations.   Instead of closing clinics, we should be expanding care and services  to our veterans, meeting their needs wherever they happen to live--in  cities, suburbs, or beautiful rural America and rural New Mexico.   That is how we truly thank our veterans.                            ____________________
