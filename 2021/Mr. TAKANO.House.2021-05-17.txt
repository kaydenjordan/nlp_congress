 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2704) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  equal employment opportunity functions of Department of Veterans  Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2704         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving VA Accountability       To Prevent Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. IMPROVEMENTS TO EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY                     FUNCTIONS OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Alignment of EEO Director.--        (1) Reporting and duties.--Subsection (h) of section 516 of       title 38, United States Code, is amended--        (A) by striking ``The provisions'' and inserting ``(1) The       provisions''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(2) Beginning not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this paragraph, in carrying out paragraph       (1), the Secretary shall ensure that the official of the       Department who serves as the Equal Employment Opportunity       Director of the Department--        ``(A) reports directly to the Deputy Secretary with respect       to the functions under this section; and        ``(B) does not also serve in a position that has       responsibility over personnel functions of the Department or       other functions that conflict with the functions under this       section.''.

(c) Reporting Harassment and Employment Discrimination       Complaints.--Subsection (a) of such section 516 is amended--        (1) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``(1) The       Secretary''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(2) The Secretary shall ensure that the employment       discrimination complaint resolution system established under       paragraph (1) requires that any manager of the Department who       receives a sexual or other harassment or employment       discrimination complaint reports such complaint to the Office       of Resolution Management, or such successor office,       immediately, or if such immediate reporting is impracticable,       not later than two business days after the date on which the       manager receives the complaint.''.

An       employee of the Department who is hired on or after such date       shall receive the first such mandatory annual training not       later than 60 days after being hired.''.        (e) Harassment and Employment Discrimination Policies and       Directives.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall--        (1) by not later than September 30, 2021, and on a regular       basis thereafter, review the policies relating to sexual and       other harassment and employment discrimination of the       Department of Veterans Affairs to ensure that such policies       are complete and in accordance with the sexual and other       harassment and employment discrimination policies established       by the Office of Resolution Management of the Department, or       such successor office; and        (2) by not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, issue a final directive and a handbook       for the Harassment Prevention Program of the Department.        (f) Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, and semiannually thereafter for one       year, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to the       Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate a report on the progress the       Secretary has made in carrying out this section and section       516 of title 38, United States Code, as amended by this       section, including with respect to reporting sexual and other       harassment and employment discrimination complaints pursuant       to subsection (a)(2) of such section 516.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2704.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2704, sponsored by Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee Chair Pappas, takes important steps to address sexual  harassment and discrimination at the VA.   This bipartisan legislation, the Improving VA Accountability to  Prevent Sexual Harassment and Discrimination Act, would prioritize VA's  tracking and responses to allegations.   For example, it requires VA's Equal Employment Opportunity Director  to report directly to the Deputy Secretary. It also requires that any  VA manager who receives a report of sexual or other harassment, or  employment discrimination, report that complaint within 2 business  days.   Among other important actions, this bill will also mandate additional  training to identify and address sexual, and other types of harassment,  and employment discrimination.   This legislation is based largely on the work of the Government  Accountability Office, who testified in our committee during July of  last year.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend, the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and also the author of  this important piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing this important piece of legislation, H.R. 2704, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2788) to amend title 38, United States Code, to eliminate  the cap on full-time employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs  who provide equal employment opportunity counseling.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2788         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Equal Employment       Opportunity Counselor Modernization Act''.       SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF CAP ON FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS WHO PROVIDE                     EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COUNSELING.         (a) In General.--Section 516 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by striking subsection (g); and        (2) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (g).        (b) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and House of Representatives a report regarding the       effect of the amendment under subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2788.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support Representative Lamb's bipartisan  legislation, the VA Equal Employment Opportunity Counselor  Modernization Act, which is cosponsored by Representative Mann.   This bill would help the Department address diversity and equity  issues within VA's workforce. It removes a portion of a 1997 law that  limits the number of VA counselors who can advise employees on equal  employment opportunity issues, provides alternative dispute resolution,  and helps process formal complaints.   VA's workforce has roughly doubled in size since the 1997 law was  enacted, and VA requested for the limit to be removed to allow the  Department to hire additional counselors to support the needs of a  large and still growing workforce.   Our Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee recently held a hearing  to examine important steps to address workforce diversity and inclusion  at VA. At this hearing, the subcommittee, once again, learned how  important these counselors are. This bill builds off that oversight and  will assist VA's efforts to support its workforce, which serves  veterans every single day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb), my good friend and the author of this  bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2788; and a member of the House Committee  on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, urge all of my colleagues to join  me in  [[Page H2363]]  passing this important piece of legislation, H.R. 2788.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2911) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit  to Congress a plan for obligating and expending Coronavirus pandemic  funding made available to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2911         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VA Transparency & Trust Act       of 2021''.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT OF CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC                     FUNDING MADE AVAILABLE TO DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Plan and Reports by Secretary.--        (1) Plan.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a detailed plan for       obligating and expending covered funds, including a detailed       justification for each type of obligation of such funds.        (2) Biweekly reports.--Every 14 days during the period       beginning on the date on which the plan under paragraph (1)       is submitted and ending seven days after the date on which       the Secretary has expended all covered funds, the Secretary       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a report detailing       the obligation and expenditure of, and the planned uses for,       such funds during the period covered by the report, including       a written justification for any deviation in such       obligations, expenditures, or planned uses from such plan.        (b) Inspector General Audits.--Not later than 120 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, and semiannually       thereafter for three years or until the Secretary has       expended all covered funds, whichever occurs first, the       Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs shall       submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate a report examining the       obligations and expenditures made using covered funds during       the period covered by the report. Each such report shall       include--        (1) a comparison of how the funds are being obligated and       expended to how the funds were planned to be obligated and       expended in the plan under subsection (a)(1);        (2) areas of waste, fraud, and abuse, if any; and        (3) any other matter the Inspector General determines       relevant.        (c) Comptroller General Reviews.--        (1) Interim report.--Not later than September 30, 2022, the       Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the       Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate an interim report containing a       review of obligations and expenditures made using covered       funds. The report shall include--        (A) a review of the process of the Department of Veterans       Affairs for preparing the request for funds;        (B) an explanation of how the expenditure of such funds met       the goals of the Department during the public health       emergency for which the funds were made available;        (C) any recommendations to improve the process of       identifying needs and expending funds during similar       situations in the future; and        (D) a review of the plans of the Department to continue       programs or investments that were begun with such funds but       will continue after such funds are expended.        (2) Final report.--Not later than September 30, 2024, the       Comptroller General shall submit to the Committees on       Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the       Senate a final report on the matters specified under       paragraph (1).        (d) Covered Funds Defined.--In this section, the term       ``covered funds'' means funds that are made available to the       Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to--        (1) the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Public Law       116-127);        (2) the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act       (Public Law 116-136); or        (3) the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-      2).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2911.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support Representative Bost's bipartisan  legislation, the VA Transparency & Trust Act, for which Representative  Pappas, Representative Mann, and I are original cosponsors.   This bill provides additional oversight for the funds Congress made  available to the VA through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act  and the CARES Act in 2020, as well as the American Rescue Plan, which  we passed earlier this year.   In addition to requiring the VA to report biweekly on how it spends  these supplemental funds, the bill mandates the VA Office of Inspector  General and the Government Accountability Office to periodically report  on VA's spending of these funds.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2911 adds to the existing oversight on VA's  spending and will enable greater transparency for Congress and the  public to ensure that these funds are spent efficiently and effectively  to support critical VA programs and services as we recover from the  COVID-19 pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend and the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I also ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 2911, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 240) to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the  Secretary of Labor to prioritize the provision of services to homeless  veterans with dependents in carrying out homeless veterans  reintegration programs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 240         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeless Veterans with       Children Reintegration Act''.       SEC. 2. PRIORITY UNDER HOMELESS VETERANS REINTEGRATION                     PROGRAMS FOR HOMELESS VETERANS WITH DEPENDENTS.         (a) Priority for Homeless Veterans With Dependent       Children.--Subsection (a) of section 2021 of title 38, United       States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``Subject to'' and inserting ``(1) Subject       to'';        (2) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as       subparagraphs (A) through (E), respectively; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(2) In conducting programs under this section, the       Secretary shall prioritize the provision of services to       homeless veterans with dependents.''.        (b) Additional Reporting Requirements.--Subsection (d) of       such section is amended--        (1) by striking ``the report an evaluation of services''       and all that follows and inserting ``each such report--'';       and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(1) an evaluation of services furnished to veterans under       this section and an analysis of the information collected       under subsection (b);        ``(2) an analysis of any gaps in access to shelter, safety,       and services for homeless veterans with dependent children;       and        ``(3) recommendations for improving any gaps identified       under paragraph (2).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 240.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on H.R. 240, the Homeless Veterans  with Children Reintegration Act introduced by Congresswoman Julia  Brownley.   There is increasing concern that shelters and homeless veteran  housing is not created to serve families, and that homeless veterans  with children may avoid seeking out services because they are afraid of  being separated from their children.   Representative Brownley's legislation seeks to start addressing the  issue by ensuring that veterans with families are prioritized within  the homeless veterans reintegration program, or HVRP. HVRP seeks to  address reintegrating homeless veterans into the workforce through  grants to partner organizations.   Mr. Speaker, in 2018, the Department of Labor identified homeless  female veterans and veterans with families as one of the three priority  populations for HVRP services. H.R. 240 would prioritize homeless  veterans with dependent children within the homeless veteran  reintegration program to ensure they get the resources they need to  return to housing without the fear of losing their children should they  seek help.   I applaud Representative Brownley for her work on this legislation,  and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the Homeless Veterans  with Children Reintegration Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), my good friend, the chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Health, and also the author of this important piece of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 240 as we did unanimously in committee. I suspect that if  this bill were brought to a vote before the entire body, it would pass  with near-unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 711) to amend the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 to  authorize the use of certain funds received pursuant to leases entered  into under such Act, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 711         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``West Los Angeles VA Campus       Improvement Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF LAND USE REVENUES UNDER WEST LOS ANGELES                     LEASING ACT OF 2016.         (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 2 of the West       Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 (Public Law 114- 226; 130       Stat. 927) is amended to read as follows:        ``(d) Land Use Revenues at the Campus.--        ``(1) In general.--Any land use revenues received by the       Secretary shall be credited to the applicable Department       medical facilities accounts or minor construction accounts       and shall be available, without fiscal year limitation and       without further appropriation, exclusively for any of the       following:        ``(A) Supporting construction, maintenance, and services at       the Campus relating to temporary or permanent supportive       housing for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families.        ``(B) Renovating and maintaining the land and facilities at       the Campus.        ``(C) Carrying out minor construction projects at the       Campus.        ``(D) Carrying out community operations at the Campus that       support the development of emergency shelter or supportive       housing for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families.        ``(2) Land use revenue defined.--In this subsection, the       term `land use revenue' means--        ``(A) any funds received by the Secretary under a lease       described in subsection (b); and        ``(B) any funds received as proceeds from any assets seized       or forfeited, and any restitution paid, in connection with       any third-party land use at the Campus.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to funds received by the Secretary       of Veterans Affairs after the date of the enactment of the       West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-226; 130       Stat. 927).       SEC. 3. MODIFICATION TO ENHANCED USE LEASES AT THE DEPARTMENT                     OF VETERANS AFFAIRS WEST LOS ANGELES CAMPUS.         Paragraph (1) of section 2(b) of the West Los Angeles       Leasing Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-226; 130 Stat. 927), is       amended by adding at the end the following new sentence:       ``Notwithstanding section 8162(b)(2) of such title, the term       of such an enhanced-use lease at the Campus may not exceed 99       years.''.       SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 711, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, the West Los Angeles VA Campus Improvement  Act, would amend a 2016 law concerning the West Los Angeles VA campus.   H.R. 711, as amended, is sponsored by Congressman Ted Lieu, and is  critical to the Department of Veterans Affairs' efforts, together with  community partners, to address veteran homelessness in the Los Angeles  area.   In addition, this legislation helps VA use already available funding  streams to fund supportive housing for homeless and at-risk veterans  and their families; community operations that support emergency shelter  and supportive housing; and renovations and minor construction  projects.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also want to express my gratitude to my  colleague, Ranking Member Bost, and the Republicans on the committee  for working with the majority. I believe that the issues that we worked  out were common sense, and upon further examination, I think taxpayers  and most independent, reasonable observers would say this is what  Congress should be doing on behalf of our veterans. I can't imagine why  there would be any objection to this on the floor of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  711, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2167) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  extensions of the time limitations for use of entitlement under  Department of Veterans Affairs educational assistance programs by  reason of school closures due to emergency and other situations, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2167         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2167, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on H.R. 2167, as amended, the GI  Bill National Emergency Extended Deadline, or GI Bill NEED Act,  introduced by Congresswoman Sherrill.   The COVID-19 pandemic didn't only impact veterans' health, but it  also put a serious strain on veterans' access to educational benefits.  The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the limit on VA authority to extend the  time for use of its educational assistance program benefits amid an  emergency.   Representative Sherrill's bill fixes these limits during times of  emergency for Montgomery GI bill users and those participating in the  Veteran Readiness and Employment Program.   Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes VA to pause the clock as needed  when an institution must close temporarily, or permanently, due to an  emergency, or when a student is prevented from continuing his or her  program for other reasons. This was an authority VA lacked during  COVID-19, and if not for the quick action by Congress, thousands of  veterans would have seen their benefits wasted.   Now it is time to take the lessons from the pandemic and fix this  problem once and for all. Not only that, but H.R. 2167, as amended,  includes additional improvements to VA education programs used by  veterans and their families. This legislation would require that VA  ensure the modern information technology (IT) service can process  claims faster and more efficiently through improved processing  integration and accuracy, data exchange and reporting, customer  integration, and simplification of the online experience.   The legislation would also expand in-State tuition rates at public  universities to participants in the Dependents' Educational Assistance  program.   Guaranteeing in-State tuition for those survivors using Dependents  Education Assistance, otherwise known as DEA, under Chapter 35, is a  low-cost lift that will drastically improve educational options for  surviving families and reduce their need for student loans.   I, therefore, ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the GI Bill  National Emergency Extended Deadline, or GI Bill NEED Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 2167, as amended, as sponsored by Congresswoman Sherrill  of New Jersey.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2878) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry  out a Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities Pilot  Program, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2878         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Native VetSuccess at Tribal       Colleges and Universities Pilot Program Act''.       SEC. 2.

(3) The most effective way to provide culturally competent       outreach and services to eligible students at Tribal colleges       and universities.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2878, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak on H.R. 2878, as amended, the  Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities Pilot Program  Act, introduced by Congressman Gallego.   Started in 2009, the VetSuccess On Campus Program helps student  veterans succeed and thrive through delivery of on-campus benefits,  assistance, and counseling. This outreach is intended to help veterans  complete their education and prepare them for jobs.   Since its inception, the program has expanded multiple times, and  currently supports 104 schools across the country and is served by 87  VetSuccess counselors.                                time  1500    However, Tribal colleges and universities are not currently served by  the VetSuccess program, creating a gap in access to the services and  benefits our Native American veterans have earned.   Madam Speaker, Native veterans serve in the Armed Forces at five  times the national average, and have served with distinction in every  major conflict for over 200 years. Native Americans have the highest  per capita involvement of any population in service in the U.S.  military, yet these same communities that serve disproportionately in  our military don't see the same resources delivered back to their  communities.   Congressman Gallego's legislation begins to close this gap by  creating the Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities  Pilot Program Act at three sites around the Nation serving Tribal  colleges.   But that is not all. This legislation also includes additional  improvements that will deliver more benefits to all veterans using  their earned educational benefits.   Included in this legislation is expanded housing benefits for  veterans as they seek to finish programs of education; additional  funding for high-technology education courses to serve more veterans  during our economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic; and an  extension of VA housing partnerships with local communities to house  more veterans who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness.   Madam Speaker, I applaud Congressman Gallego, a veteran himself, for  bringing this package to us, and I ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting the Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities  Pilot Program Act.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego), my good friend and an author of this  legislation, H.R. 2878, and a member of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Hampshire (Mr. Pappas), my good friend and chair of the  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  the State of Hawaii (Mr. Kahele).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. In closing, I  ask all my colleagues to join me in passing this important piece of  legislation, H.R. 2878, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1510) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit  to Congress a report on the use of cameras in the medical centers of  the Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1510         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPORT ON USE OF CAMERAS IN MEDICAL FACILITIES OF                     THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Report Required.--Not later than one year after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans       Affairs, in collaboration with the Office of Operations,       Security, and Preparedness of the Department of Veterans       Affairs, the Veterans Health Administration, and the Office       of Construction and Facilities Management of the Department,       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and the House of Representatives a report analyzing       the policies, use, and maintenance of cameras deployed by the       Department for patient safety and law enforcement at medical       facilities of the Department.        (b) Elements.--The report required by subsection (a) shall       include the following:        (1) A comprehensive review of the policies and procedures       of the Department regarding the use and maintenance of       cameras with respect to the following:        (A) Patient safety, including--        (i) an analysis of how cameras are used to monitor staff       and patients;        (ii) an analysis of the specific units within medical       facilities in which the use of cameras is prioritized to       protect patient safety;  [[Page H2373]]         (iii) an analysis of the procedures regarding the       positioning of cameras;        (iv) an analysis of the extent to which cameras monitor       locations where drugs are stored to ensure that drugs are       accounted for, and an assessment of whether this is a widely       used practice; and        (v) an analysis of the actions taken to preserve and       protect patient privacy.        (B) Law enforcement of medical facilities of the       Department, including--        (i) how exterior cameras are used;        (ii) how interior cameras are used; and        (iii) an analysis of locations, interior and exterior, in       which camera use is prioritized.        (2) Recommendations of the Secretary to improve patient       safety and law enforcement, including--        (A) the placement and maintenance of cameras;        (B) the storage of data from such cameras;        (C) the authority of supervisors at medical facilities of       the Department to review recordings from cameras;        (D) the number of staff required to monitor live footage       from cameras at each medical facility of the Department;        (E) the funding necessary to address shortfalls with       respect to cameras and the specific uses for such funding;        (F) any additional actions required to preserve and protect       patient privacy; and        (G) such other matters the Secretary determines       appropriate.        (c) Camera Defined.--In this section, the term ``camera''       means any video camera used in a medical facility of the       Department of Veterans Affairs for purposes of patient safety       or law enforcement, but does not include cameras used solely       by the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans       Affairs to assist in criminal investigations conducted by the       Inspector General.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1510, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1510, the Veterans' Camera  Reporting Act, introduced by Representative McKinley of West Virginia.   This bill, as amended by the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,  requires VA to submit a report to Congress analyzing the Department's  use and maintenance of video cameras for the purposes of patient safety  and law enforcement within all of its medical facilities.   Last Tuesday, a nursing assistant who was formerly employed at a VA  hospital in West Virginia was sentenced to seven consecutive life  sentences plus 20 years after she pleaded guilty to murdering seven  veterans and assaulting an eighth veteran with intent to commit murder.  She took insulin that she was not authorized to administer, and she  injected it into veterans who did not need it, killing all eight of  them.   Following the sentencing last week, the VA Office of the Inspector  General issued a report identifying numerous deficiencies in patient  care and failures in VA oversight at the facility where these murders  occurred. Among other things, the OIG found that there were no cameras  in the ward where these events occurred, nor in the medication room  where the insulin was stored, and there were no locks or other  mechanisms for monitoring access to medication carts where insulin was  also kept.   There are no words to adequately express the horror and sorrow we  feel about the heinous crimes committed against these veterans. We  cannot imagine the pain the families have endured since evidence of  these murders came to light nearly 3 years ago. We can only hope that  last week's sentencing will help the victims' families begin to heal  and to find a sense of closure.   In Congress, we have a responsibility to help ensure that VA never  allows something like this to happen again. Now, as an initial step, we  need to better understand how VA uses video cameras for monitoring  patient safety and physical security within its medical facilities. To  that end, H.R. 1510 will require VA to submit a report summarizing how  cameras are used to monitor staff and patients, the units within which  cameras are prioritized, and how cameras are used to monitor drug  storage. The report also must include recommendations on improving the  use of cameras at VA, including whether the Department needs additional  resources to install cameras for patient safety and law enforcement  purposes.   This bill will require VA's report to encompass all of its medical  facilities nationwide. Drug diversion, assaults, harassment, suicides,  and other patient safety incidents can occur at any VA medical  facility, not just hospitals. VA operates more than 1,000 inpatient and  outpatient facilities across the country. Congress needs a complete  picture of the extent to which cameras are used across VA so that we  can better assist the Department in addressing any shortfalls.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in approving this  important bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. In closing, I  ask all my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 1510, which cleared  the committee unanimously. I can see no reason why any Member would  vote against this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2494) to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish in  the Department the Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition  Administration, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2494         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2494.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak on H.R. 2494, introduced by  Congressman Wenstrup, and which would establish a fourth administration  at the Department of Veterans Affairs focused on economic opportunity  and transition.   When our servicemembers conclude their time with the armed services,  they are tasked with returning to civilian life. This is the sacrifice  they make for our security, and in exchange, we owe them more than a  thank you and well wishes. We owe them a commitment that they will be  supported in their transition to civilian life, and that they will have  a VA that is responsive to their needs.   That is why we passed the first GI Bill nearly 75 years ago to the  day and why we continue today to make improvements in providing our  Nation's veterans with the benefits they have earned.   Unfortunately, VA has struggled to track the effectiveness of  programs for education and employment, and Congress has struggled to  determine the Department's resource needs in these areas.   Madam Speaker, one of the main reasons we have identified through  hearings and discussion with our veterans service organizations is that  the Veterans Benefits Administration is simply asked to do too much.  While managing compensation claims is important, the responsibility of  managing transition, education, and housing benefits often takes a  backseat. To put it in perspective, the Veterans Benefits  Administration's structure has not significantly changed since the  Veterans Administration was established in 1930.   Madam Speaker, during the last 89 years, the services needed by  veterans has dramatically changed, which is why our committee has an  Economic Opportunity Subcommittee. It is time for the importance of  economic opportunity to be elevated at VA as well.   This bipartisan bill would create a new administration within the  Department to manage educational assistance, vocational rehabilitation,  and employment, education, career counseling programs, and broadly  defined shared transition assistance programs. That means a dedicated  Under Secretary for Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition solely  focused on fulfilling our promise to the veterans that they will get  the education they want, the housing they need, and the careers they  deserve.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing this important piece of legislation, H.R. 2494, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2441) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to expand  the Rural Access Network for Growth Enhancement Program of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and to direct the Comptroller General  of the United States to conduct a study to assess certain mental health  care resources of the Department of Veterans Affairs available to  veterans who live in rural areas.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2441         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans       Mental Health Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF RURAL ACCESS NETWORK FOR GROWTH                     ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM OF THE DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Expansion.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       establish and maintain three new centers of the RANGE       Program.        (b) Locations.--The centers established under subsection       (a) shall be located in areas determined by the Secretary       based on--        (1) the need for additional mental health care for rural       veterans in such areas; and        (2) interest expressed by personnel at facilities of the       Department in such areas.        (c) Timeline.--The Secretary shall establish the centers       under subsection (a) during fiscal year 2022.        (d) Funding.--There is authorized to be appropriated       $1,200,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2024 to       carry out this section.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE FURNISHED BY THE                     SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO RURAL                     VETERANS.         (a) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a study to assess whether the Department       of Veterans Affairs has sufficient resources to serve rural       veterans who need covered mental health care. Such study       shall include assessments of--        (1) whether the mental health care furnished by the       Secretary (through resources including the RANGE Program,       Enhanced RANGE Program, mental health residential       rehabilitation treatment programs, inpatient mental health       services, and PRR centers) is sufficient to meet the covered       mental health care needs of rural veterans;        (2) how best to expand and to appropriately locate       resources described in paragraph (1);        (3) whether to require the establishment of a PRR center at       a medical facility of the Department that serves 1,000 or       more veterans on the National Psychosis Registry;        (4) the demand by rural veterans for mental health       resources specified in paragraph (1);        (5) the average wait time for a rural veteran for mental       health resources specified in paragraph (1); and        (6) how many rural veterans died by suicide or overdose--        (A) while on a wait list for mental health resources       specified in paragraph (1); and  [[Page H2376]]         (B) during the term of the study.        (b) Report Required.--Not later than 18 months after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and House of Representatives a report containing the       results of the study under this section.       SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) The term ``covered mental health care'' means mental       health care that is more intensive than traditional       outpatient therapy.        (2) The term ``PRR center'' means a psychosocial       rehabilitation and recovery center of the Department of       Veterans Affairs.        (3) The term ``RANGE Program'' means the Rural Access       Network for Growth Enhancement Program of the Department of       Veterans Affairs.        (4) The term ``rural veteran'' means a veteran who lives in       a rural or highly rural area (including such an area in a       Tribal or insular area), as determined through the use of the       Rural-Urban Commuting Areas coding system of the Department       of Agriculture.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2441.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak on H.R. 2441, the Sgt. Ketchum  Rural Veterans Mental Health Act of 2021, introduced by Congresswoman  Axne.   This bill has not only bipartisan support, but also bicameral support  with the recent introduction of a companion bill from Senate Veterans'  Affairs Committee Chairman Tester and Ranking Member Moran.   This bill is named for an Iowa veteran who died by suicide after  failing to receive intensive treatment for his PTSD. It is designed to  honor his memory with action and to prevent a similar outcome for his  fellow veterans.   Through this legislation, VA will open three new RANGE programs in  rural locations, including territories and insular areas. VA RANGE  programs offer intensive outpatient services and case management for  rural veterans with mental illness, housing and food insecurity,  financial issues, and problems with daily living. They can be  absolutely lifesaving for veterans who need this kind of wraparound  care and safety nets.   Additionally, this bill calls for a GAO study of how accessible VA's  continuum of superior mental healthcare services, from outpatient to  residential and inpatient, really is for rural veterans.   We all know that even a well-designed system may not reach every  veteran who needs it. With this legislation, our work to close the gaps  will be guided by data. I, therefore, ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting the Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Axne), my good friend and the author of H.R. 2441.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   But before I reserve the balance of my time, let me say that I am  very, very pleased that we are addressing the issue of mental  healthcare in our rural areas. As we wind down this pandemic, I think  we are going to see not just veterans but Americans of all stripes who  live in our rural areas dealing with the need for increased numbers of  mental healthcare practitioners.   I congratulate and I thank the work of my colleague, Congresswoman  Axne, in moving the VA a step forward in this area. But there is far  more that needs to be done.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I extend my thanks to Ranking Member Bost and the  Republicans on the committee and all staff from both sides of the aisle  for putting together this package of 10 bills in advance of Memorial  Day. It is especially poignant to end today's package of bills with a  bill named in memory of Sergeant Ketchum.   As we failed to reach Sergeant Ketchum in a timely and effective way  in rural America, let's not forget that the VA's mental healthcare has  improved greatly over the past several years. We need to make sure that  quality of healthcare gets out into the rural areas.   We are charged as a Veterans' Affairs Committee to deal with our  veterans and their healthcare needs. Part of the answer to serving our  veterans is to make sure that we have robust providers, regardless of  whether they serve veterans or the general population. We need to look  at how we are going to do that in rural America, including our  territories and insular areas.  [[Page H2378]]    I will use this moment on the floor to plug that cause with all of my  colleagues who may be listening from their offices. We must, for the  sake of all the folks that have suffered so long from this pandemic,  look at how we are going to provide a robust provider network for  mental healthcare.   As we head into the Memorial Day weekend, I am so gratified and  pleased with the work we have done on a bipartisan basis to produce  this package of bills and that we have preserved the spirit of the  committee.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 2441, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
