 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.              Reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program     Mr. President, I rise to discuss the bipartisan  legislation that will reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program.  I wish to speak a little bit about flood insurance first before I talk  about our much needed legislation.   As most people know--but unfortunately some folks don't know or maybe  they forget--if you have homeowners insurance on your home and you have  a flood, you are not covered. Homeowners insurance does not cover  flooding. In order to be covered for flooding, you have to have a  separate policy, and about the only place you can go to get flood  insurance is from the Federal program--the National Flood Insurance  Program. Now, that is a bit of an overstatement. It is possible to buy  flood insurance from a private insurer--and certainly we want to  encourage private insurers to participate more in the flood insurance  market--but today, for the most part, if you want to carry flood  insurance, you have to get it through the Federal program, and that is  called the National Flood Insurance Program. It is administered by  FEMA.   It is hard to overstate the importance of flood insurance to the  American people. It is even harder to overstate the importance of flood  insurance to the people of Louisiana. The gross domestic product in my  State is about $220 billion to $230 billion a year. If you add up all  the goods and services that we as Louisianans produce every year, it  comes out to between $220 billion and $230 billion. Without flood  insurance, you can cut that figure in half. We would have to, in  effect, turn out the lights.   There are 450,000 flood insurance policies in my State. Many of those  people have to have flood insurance; it is a condition of their  mortgage. So the  [[Page S3449]]  Flood insurance program and, more specifically, the National Flood  Insurance Program, is extraordinarily important to America, but it is  even more extraordinarily important to the people of Louisiana.   We are introducing a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the National  Flood Insurance Program. The current program expires in September. If  we don't reauthorize it, most Americans who have flood insurance at the  present time will no longer be able to access it. It is critical that  the U.S. Congress act and act immediately.   The bill we are introducing--and I will explain in a moment whom I  mean by ``we''--is bipartisan legislation.   Now, there are a lot of issues that divide Congress today, and  reasonable people are entitled to disagree over some of these very  difficult issues, but there are also issues we can come together on,  and I respectfully suggest that flood insurance is one of them.   We have put together a bipartisan coalition, including Senator Bob  Menendez from New Jersey, who happens to be a Democrat; and Senator  Cory Booker from New Jersey, who happens to be a Democrat; Senator Thad  Cochran, chairman of our Appropriations Committee in the Senate, from  Mississippi, who is a Republican; Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, who  is a Republican; Senator Bill Nelson from Florida, who is a Democrat;  Senator Van Hollen from Maryland, who happens to be a Democrat; and  more Senators are coming on board.   We are introducing a bill called the SAFE National Flood Insurance  Program Reauthorization Act. SAFE, of course, is an acronym. It refers  to sustainable, affordable, fair, and efficient--SAFE--the SAFE  National Flood Insurance Program Reauthorization Act.   Let me briefly tell my colleagues what it does. I will start with  cost. It doesn't do a bit of good to offer someone insurance if they  can't afford it, and too many times that has been the case with flood  insurance. Right now, under the current program, the National Flood  Insurance Program is allowed to raise a homeowner's flood insurance  premium by 18 percent--not 10 percent, not 12 percent but by a  staggering 18 percent--and to do that every year. If you are insuring a  second home--let's suppose you have a vacation home--or if you are a  businesswoman or a businessman and insuring a commercial establishment,  the national program can raise your premiums every year by 25 percent.  Nobody can pay those kinds of increases.   No. 1, our bill would cap the amount the Flood Insurance Program can  raise someone's premium at 10 percent annually. I wish we could tap it  at zero percent annually, but 10 percent is certainly a lot better for  our people than 18 percent and 25 percent, respectively. If FEMA  properly implements some other provisions of our act, which I will talk  about in a moment, there will not be any increases.   No. 2, our bill, the SAFE National Flood Insurance Program  Reauthorization Act, would extend the National Flood Insurance Program  by 6 years. I wish we could extend it longer. I wish we could do 10  years or 15 years or 20 years, but it is necessary for us, as the  Presiding Officer knows, to get unified, bipartisan support on this  legislation, and we think 6 years--a 6-year authorization is probably  the best we can do to pass this bill.   No. 3, our bill will save about $750 million a year. Let me say that  again. Our bill will save about $750 million each and every year to be  used in the Flood Insurance Program. Here is how our legislation would  do it.   First, as we know, the Flood Insurance Program has a deficit. We have  had a large number of natural disasters, including floods, over the  past several years in our country, unfortunately. We had Hurricane  Sandy. We had Hurricane Katrina. In my State in Louisiana, last year we  had two horrible floods, both in the northern part of my State and in  the southern part of my State. In a couple of instances, we had 23  inches of rain in 2 days. I don't care if you live on Mount Everest, if  you get 23 inches of rain in 2 days, you are going to flood. Those  floods were very expensive.   Those catastrophes and many others caused the National Flood  Insurance Program to operate at a deficit. The deficit is $25 billion.  Another way of stating that is, the program owes $25 billion in debt,  but we owe it to ourselves. We don't owe it to a bank, we don't owe it  to a foreign country, we don't owe it to any private entity; we owe it  to ourselves, and we have been paying interest to ourselves out of the  premiums--the cashflow, if you will--of the Flood Insurance Program  every year. That 10 percent--10 cents out of every dollar that comes  into the National Flood Insurance Program--is devoted to just paying  the interest on this debt that we owe ourselves.   Our bill would suspend those interest payments for 6 years. That will  free up about $400 million a year.   We are also saving money by asking those who work with us in  implementing the National Flood Insurance Program to sharpen their  pencils. Let me explain what I mean by that. FEMA is in charge of the  National Flood Insurance Program, but FEMA doesn't run the program. It  doesn't run the insurance company that administers the policies. FEMA  hires private insurers in the private sector to actually run the  program. We call that the ``write your own'' program.   For the most part, those private insurers that administer the program  do a good job, but they don't have any risk. They have zero risk, none,  nada. The risk is on the National Flood Insurance Program--the Federal  government--and therefore the American taxpayer. We just hire the  private insurers to administer the program--to collect the premiums, to  sell the policies, to adjust the claims. So they have no risk. Yet we  are paying them 31 cents out of every dollar that the program would  take in.   Our bill respectfully suggests that is too much money. While we  appreciate the cooperation we get and the good work we get from the  private insurers who help us administer this program, we are going to  ask them--actually, we are going to tell them--to reduce their  compensation from 31 cents out of every dollar. That is going to save  about $350 million a year. So we just saved about $750 million a year  for the National Flood Insurance Program.   What are we going to do with the money? First, mitigation. With  flooding--and it is inevitable that we are going to have floods. I  don't know why bad things happen to good people, but they do. You can  pay a little bit up front or you can pay a whole lot later, and this is  what I mean by that.   If we spend the money on mitigation to protect against the flooding  that we know will inevitably happen, we will save money for the  American taxpayer in the long run, and we will use a portion of that  $750 million in savings to mitigate against flood risk. By mitigation,  I mean offering low- or no-interest loans to homeowners to elevate  their homes so they will not flood--building levees, building flood  walls. Our bill does not say specifically what mitigation measures  should be taken, and it does not say which mitigation projects will be  built, but it does say that mitigation is the answer, not the complete  answer but part of the answer. We haven't done enough of it. Now we are  going to have the resources to do it.    The second way we are going to use that money is to try to do a  better job with maps. We set rates in the National Flood Insurance  Program based on the likelihood that someone will be flooded. We  determine that likelihood by using maps drawn by experts using computer  models. We are not using the most up-to-date, state-of-the-art  technology to draw those maps, but if our bill passes, we will,  including but not limited to a new technology called LIDAR. I confess,  I don't understand the technology, but it is called LIDAR, Light  Detection and Ranging technology. It can be used to draw more accurate  flood maps to more accurately assess someone's propensity to flood.   Why is that important? You might be in a high-risk flood zone right  now and paying a large premium. With state-of-the-art technology, you  may be put into a lower risk flood zone and pay less. I am not  guaranteeing that result, but it is certainly possible. In any event,  we need to as accurately as possible assess the risk, and the only way  to do that is through proper mapping.   Our bill would also include a provision that will allow Congress to  provide better and greater oversight of FEMA in administering the  program. Let me say specifically what it will do.  [[Page S3450]]    The very able Administrator at FEMA who handles the Flood Insurance  Program testified before the Banking Committee a few months ago that if  one of these private insurance companies that administers the Flood  Insurance Program for us has lawyers or consultants who are not doing  their jobs, FEMA doesn't have the authority to fire them. This bill  will give FEMA the authority to fire those consultants, and here is why  this is important: Most of the lawyers, engineers, and other  consultants private insurance companies hire to help them administer  the program on behalf of the National Flood Insurance Program do a  pretty good job, but some of them do not. There have been recorded  instances both in New Jersey and in Louisiana where certain people,  engineers and lawyers, have seen it as their mission to do anything  they possibly can to keep a homeowner who has paid his or her hard- earned money to buy insurance from getting the money they deserve if  they flood, and that is just wrong.   If you are trying to defraud the National Flood Insurance Program, we  need to fight you like a tiger. But if you have paid your premiums and,  unfortunately, you have flooded, you are entitled to get your money.  You should not be required to fight some engineer or some lawyer who is  throwing up obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. Our bill says that  if there are consultants who do that and the private insurance  companies don't want to fire them, then, by God, FEMA will, and we are  going to hold FEMA accountable.   A couple more points I will mention: This bill will also extend  coverage limits. Right now, the most flood insurance a homeowner can  buy is $250,000. While that is a lot of money, that doesn't cover some  homes, given the rate of inflation in America today, and our bill would  expand coverage limits to $500,000 for homes and $1.5 million for  commercial establishments.   I have talked to some of my colleagues in the Senate and in the  House, and some of them, whom I am happy for, represent States that  haven't had any major floods, and I hope they never do. But if we have  learned anything in the last few years in terms of flooding, we have  learned that just when men and women think they can control everything  in this world and can control their destiny, they can't control God and  Mother Nature. Flooding can happen at any time.   Let me say it again. You can live in a mountain State. You can live  on top of a mountain. But if you get 23 inches of rain in 2 days, you  are going to flood, and that is why you need flood insurance. That is  why this bill is not just important to coastal States like Louisiana,  Mississippi, Florida, New Jersey, and Maryland; it is important to all  Americans.   This is a bipartisan bill. Have I mentioned that? I think I did. This  is a bipartisan bill. It is supported by many Democrats. It is  supported by many Republicans. It is a bill that is not only important  for our economy, but it is important for the peace of mind of the  American people. I hope we will not let politics get in the way of  doing what we know to be right.   Once again, the bill is called the SAFE--which stands for  Sustainable, Affordable, Fair, and Efficient--National Flood Insurance  Program Reauthorization Act. I hope this body will come together as one  and support this much needed legislation.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
