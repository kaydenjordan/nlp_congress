 Mr. Speaker, not even a month into this New  Year and I am already on the floor, once again, begging the same  question: What will it take to stop the relentless pace of mass  shootings?   Three mass shootings in California in just 3 days. Three different  men of three different ages used guns to murder their own neighbors or  coworkers.   Beyond the tragedies in California, there are victims of gun violence  every day in every State.   Regardless of our politics, we cannot continue to live and die this  way. We must do more. We must do more for the victims. We must do more  for the communities shattered. We must do more for the families left to  grieve.   Each mass shooting is a glaring violation of our inalienable rights-- life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   According to the 97 percent, a bipartisan group of gun owners and  non-gun owners, 70 percent of gun owners want to help reduce gun  injuries and deaths. There are a lot of ways we can combat the cruel  epidemic of gun violence, but what we cannot do is nothing.   We must all find the courage to act.                            ____________________
