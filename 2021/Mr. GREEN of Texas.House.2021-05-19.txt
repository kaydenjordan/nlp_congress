 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, and I rise today  understanding that William Cullen Bryant was right: ``Truth, crushed to  earth, shall rise again.'' Whether you believe that it was just a group  of tourists walking through the Capitol or not, you should want this  commission.                                time  1630    If you believe that it was an insurrection, you should want this  commission. You should want this commission because you cannot bury the  truth in an earthly grave of lies and not realize the words of William  Cullen Bryant, ``Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise again.''   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Thompson and the ranking member  for standing together to make this moment possible. Bipartisanship is  achieved when you have good decent people who can stand together for  the good of all.   God bless you, dear brothers.
