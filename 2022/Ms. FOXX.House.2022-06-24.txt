 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Virginia yielding time.  This is essentially the same bill we passed overwhelmingly yesterday,  except it was improved by our colleagues in the Senate. This bill is a  more targeted approach that includes temporary support for students and  schools. It puts an end to the permanent pandemic narrative that led to  unnecessary Federal programs with little return to taxpayers. For more  than 2 years, broad nutrition waivers provided free meals to everyone,  including wealthy families. This legislation returns these programs to  regular order.   Most importantly, this bill is fully paid for. It is an example of  respecting taxpayer funds, something the Federal Government is in short  supply of.   Simply put, this bill puts our school nutrition programs back on  track, so taxpayers, schools, and students are better served.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
