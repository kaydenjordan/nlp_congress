 Madam President, I rise today on behalf of Iowa's farmers  and ranchers in support of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 or  what we refer to as the farm bill. I thank Chairman Roberts and Ranking  Member Stabenow for bringing this critical piece of bipartisan  legislation to the floor for consideration.   Farmers, ranchers, and rural communities are resilient--some of the  toughest in the face of adversity. But low commodity prices, trade  tensions, and unpredictable weather have taken a toll on many of our  folks back home. These are the people Americans rely on day in and day  out to put food on our tables, clothes on our backs, and fuel in our  cars.   In trying times, it is essential that we provide farmers and ranchers  with the certainty and the predictability they need and they deserve.  These folks helped guide my priorities for this bipartisan farm bill,  which maintains a robust crop insurance, makes improvements to  commodity programs, and promotes soil health and water quality.   I am thankful that several of my provisions and amendments can be  found within this bill. Long overdue reforms to the Conservation  Reserve Program will refocus the program's intent on highly erodible  and environmentally sensitive land and provide opportunities for the  next generation of American farmers to access land to build  economically viable farm operations.   This bill also strengthens the ARC-County Program, limiting payment  discrepancies and ensuring that farmers receive the necessary support  they deserve. It also puts farmers first by providing critical support  and mental health resources to those in need or those facing tough  times.   I do want to note one area of the bill where I think we need to do  more, and that is on the issue of SNAP reform. Most notably, the bill  misses an opportunity to help able-bodied SNAP recipients rise up out  of poverty. SNAP is a program that is relied on by children, in  addition to elderly Americans, people with disabilities, and many  working families who are struggling to make ends meet. No American  should go hungry, and SNAP provides critical assistance to our most  vulnerable citizens.   We also have an obligation to ensure that this safety net does not  perpetuate a cycle of poverty and is not abused by those who should not  be taking this benefit. Unfortunately, we have seen some shocking  stories that show how SNAP has, at times, been misused. For example, I  am reminded of the 28-year-old, lobster-eating, Cadillac-Escalade- driving surfer from San Diego, CA, who had not worked in over a year  and was receiving food stamps. He was unabashedly abusing the system  and taking benefits away from those who need those benefits the most.  Surfing is a pretty physically active sport--I think we can all agree  to that--and it was safe to presume that this young man was able- bodied. We should not allow this type of behavior to continue, and we  should not allow more examples of people taking advantage of a safety  net that is set up to help those who need it the most.   While this example is an exception rather than the rule, I am  concerned that the ability to abuse the system could increase the  number of folks who simply choose to sit back and decide they will also  ride the free waves, rather than get in the game and return to  employment.   We need to encourage those who can to start working again. Getting  people back to work is the most effective way to prevent poverty, both  in the near term and for people's long-term stability. Programs like  SNAP should encourage able-bodied adults to participate in the labor  force. According to the Census Bureau, 30.5 percent of adults who did  not work lived in poverty in 2016. However, on the flip side,  [[Page S4703]]  just 2.2 percent of full-time workers and 14.7 percent of part-time or  part-year workers lived below the poverty line.   Folks who are employed are not only better off financially, they also  benefit from the sense of purpose and confidence that comes from a job.  As I always say, there is dignity in a job. Take, for example, April, a  Missouri woman who was on government assistance from the age of 16 to  the age of 30, receiving food stamps and housing assistance. When she  was caught shoplifting, she was forced to do community service. She  volunteered at Watered Gardens, a rescue mission in Joplin, where folks  living in poverty get the help they need while they are also working at  the gardens. April was so inspired by her time there that she started a  women's discipleship center in her community and is now living a  fulfilling life.   SNAP currently requires able-bodied adults without dependents to  work, participate in training, or volunteer for at least 20 hours a  week to receive assistance. That is the current requirement, but  unfortunately 35 percent of Americans live in an area where work  requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents have been  waived. They have been waived. Of the 1,200 areas where this has been  waived, over half have unemployment rates below 5 percent, and over 500  of those areas are at full employment. These waivers were intended for  States and communities that are experiencing economic downturns, not  States like California, which has a statewide waiver, despite a record  low 4.2-percent unemployment.   Our economy is booming right now. We have a 3.8-percent unemployment  rate. For the first time on record, the number of job openings exceeds  the number of Americans looking for work.   This is the best possible time for us to encourage work among able- bodied SNAP recipients. That is why I introduced an amendment which  would strengthen the waiver process to ensure that areas with low  levels of unemployment are not exempt from SNAP's requirement for able- bodied adults without dependents to work, train, or volunteer.   I planned to offer this amendment today. I am not going to because I  want to keep the farm bill moving for the sake of our farmers, but I do  want to see this done at conference. Despite its imperfections, we have  a bill before us that will feed hungry Americans, protect natural  resources, mitigate risk, and support rural jobs.   With heavy rainfall this past week across Northern Iowa, some hard- working men and women are now facing even greater challenges. Flooded  fields have producers worrying about crop damage. This all underscores  the need for a strong and reliable safety net and timely passage of the  farm bill.   The goal and absolute requirement is to provide farmers and ranchers  across our Nation the certainty and predictability they deserve during  difficult times. I look forward to working alongside my colleagues to  meet this goal by passing this farm bill, and I encourage support.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor Pastor Arthur  Arnett as he retires from Aurora Avenue Bible Church after decades of  faithful service to his congregation and community.   Pastor Arnett spent many of the early years of his life in Des  Moines, IA, where his father served as the pastor of Bethel Bible  Church, later to be renamed Aurora Avenue Bible Church. Even at a young  age, Pastor Arnett demonstrated his passion for service by volunteering  for any needed tasks around the church. After graduating from high  school, Pastor Arnett studied at the Prairie Bible Institute and worked  in a variety of jobs, including truckdriving, mechanical contracting,  and cooking. While holding these positions, Pastor Arnett's love of  ministry shone through as he discussed and shared his knowledge of the  Bible with many. In 1968, Pastor Arnett was called to military service  and trained in aviation. Shortly before leaving for a year of service  in Vietnam, Pastor Arnett married his wife, Connie Ray, in Tipton, IA.  After returning from Vietnam, Pastor Arnett once again devoted his life  to ministry and served congregations in Colorado and Kansas. In 1976,  Pastor Arnett joined the Seaman's International Christian Association,  where he was able to minister to thousands of seamen from all over the  world over the course of 12 years.   Pastor Arnett was then called back to his home church in Des Moines,  IA, where he began ministering on July 8, 1988. And on July 8, 2018-- exactly 30 years later--Pastor Arnett will retire from the pastorate at  Aurora Avenue Bible Church. After three decades as a pastor and many  more years as a volunteer, Pastor Arnett has been able to deliver  thousands of messages and touch countless lives through his faithful  service to his community and congregation.   I ask my colleagues to join me as I proudly recognize Pastor Arthur  Arnett, an Iowan whose lifelong devotion to service epitomizes the  great American ideals of hard work, duty, and dedication.                            ____________________
