 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his  leadership on this issue. I also want to thank the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for taking a lead on this important legislation.   As an elected official, I have the opportunity to interact with  individuals across my district who strive to create new or expand  existing small businesses. These are folks who work hard to provide for  their families and serve as the backbones of their communities.   Unfortunately, for many entrepreneurs, overregulation has stifled  their ability to innovate and grow. The National Federation of  Independent Business published a recent study showing that 30 percent  of small business respondents cited taxes, regulations, and red tape as  their most significant business problem.   While certain sectors are reaping the benefits of a strong economy,  the reality is that startups and small businesses are sitting on the  sidelines with limited access to credit. It is something I hear about  from businessmen and -women every single day, be they bankers,  retailers, farmers, doctors, and every profession in between.   We also know that many startups and businesses have historically  turned to local financial institutions for initial financing. In the  years after passage of Dodd-Frank, small bank lending is down  dramatically, leaving many commercial customers scrambling to find  other forms of reasonably priced financing.   Across the board, we are enabling a burdensome system that penalizes  entrepreneurship. We need to reverse course if we want to see a  resurgence of small business creation and growth.   H.R. 2201 is commonsense legislation that seeks to reverse one  impediment to entrepreneurship. Mr. Emmer's bill offers a thoughtful  approach to a problem that has hindered and, in some cases, prevented  small offerings across the Nation. It will appropriately scale Federal  rules and regulatory compliance and will allow small businesses to  access the capital necessary for growth.   More specifically, this legislation will exempt certain nonpublic  micro offerings from the SEC requirements. The bill features guardrails  that allow for investor protection and subjects any and all exempted  micro offerings to the full suite of Federal and State antifraud laws.   The result will be a less burdensome regulation that stifles  innovation and increases access to capital for startups and small  businesses that comply with the parameters included in the bill. This  bill is about Main Street, about the small-business men and women in  each of our districts.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank and applaud the gentleman from  Minnesota for his hard work on this legislation, and I ask my  colleagues to join me in voting in favor of the legislation.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman has 18\1/2\ minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 16 minutes remaining.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have laid out this morning exactly how vulnerable  groups and individuals can be taken advantage of with legislation like  this. I don't know exactly where this legislation originated, but I can  almost guarantee you that we are creating opportunities for individuals  who don't have the best interest of our constituents at heart to  literally get small groups together, 35, I guess, or less, and sell  them on ideas where they are raising funds that probably will not  result in profits as expected by those who are investing in these  schemes.                                time  0945    No, there are no protections. There is no notice. The SEC will not  know when and where these schemes are arising. So I would say to my  colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle: When are we going to act  as if we have the best interests of our constituents at heart? When are  we going to be about protecting consumers rather than opening up  opportunities for them to be the victims of fraud?   We have fraudulent schemes that are directed at the most vulnerable  people. I know where those people who are organizing these schemes will  go. They will go to our churches where well-meaning ministers and  parishioners will be taken advantage of.   In these vulnerable communities that are always taken advantage of,  we have people who are the victims of payday loans where they are  paying 400 percent for moneys that they are borrowing when they are  desperate in between paychecks. We have rent-to-own schemes. We have  all kinds of schemes where these convenience stores, in places where we  have food deserts, are charging extremely high prices for food that is  basically being sold for regular, ordinary, good prices in other  communities.   In some communities, even in California, the gas taxes are rising. We  have the rental market that is going off the scale all over this  country with people not being able to afford a decent lease or a decent  rental space, and so here we are just opening up another opportunity  for folks to be ripped off.   It is going to happen; I can guarantee you that. When you have  something like this that is passed by the Congress of the United  States, it is going to be taken advantage of, and the way that this is  constructed, it almost begs to be taken advantage of.   So do you know what happens when this kind of thing takes place and  Members of Congress put their reputations on passing this kind of  legislation? When the rip-offs start and people are harmed a few years  later, then they are going to come back with legislation talking about  how they are correcting the fraud and the rip-offs that we caused in  the first place.   When is this going to stop? We have a Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau that is struggling every day to protect our consumers. Prior to  Dodd-Frank, we had our oversight agencies with the responsibility of  protecting consumers, but they didn't have any real protection. So  Dodd-Frank reforms helped to create opportunities for Members of  Congress to be able to protect their consumers and not to be involved  in these kinds of schemes.   But the opposite side of the aisle has spent an inordinate amount of  time trying to kill off the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and  they have done it in so many ways. Not only do they come up with  amendments time and time again to try and shut down the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, they treat the Director of the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau so badly that they almost deny him the  opportunity to come before our committee and to be heard.   So I don't know whose side legislators are on who create this kind of  crap. I don't understand why it is deemed to be important to open up  the opportunity for schemes and to not give the SEC the ability to know  when they are getting started, to have the  [[Page H8673]]  kind of disclosures, and to have the kind of oversight that would  protect the most vulnerable people in our society.   Mr. Speaker, yes, this legislation will probably pass today. The  Republicans have the majority votes in this Congress, and I suppose  they are going to get all of their people to vote for this bill that is  going to rip off some of their constituents, and, again, we won't be  able to stop it because, again, they have the majority votes.   But I want the people of this country to know and understand what is  happening, who is doing it to them, and why they are having a difficult  time. At a time when the rental market is going off the scale and they  can't afford to pay the first and the last month's rent to get into a  place, I want them to know who is creating the difficulties in their  lives when their jobs have not increased their pay, they are still  trying to have a decent quality of life for their families, despite the  fact that the pay does not match the job that they are doing, and they  haven't had the pay increases.   When are we going to show that we stand up for the least of these?  When your churches get ripped off--and we are working on some of those  schemes now where, even with the responsibilities that the SEC has, we  have people who are getting ripped off, and here we come with another  piece of legislation. Then what we do is we shade it in terms of this  is for small business development. Then we hear from the opposite side  about all the other companies who started as little-bitty companies in  their garage. Well, they all started without this bill. They didn't  need this bill to start.   So why are you doing this? Yeah, you are right; there are a lot of  companies, and you have named them, particularly in the high tech  industries that started, and they had some of their own money to get  started with, and maybe the family helped them, I don't know, but they  didn't have this legislation. They didn't need this legislation. Nobody  needs this legislation.   This legislation is harmful, and I would ask my colleagues to vote  against the bill. If there are any Members on the opposite side of the  aisle who really are concerned about their constituents, I would ask  them to defy their leadership and vote against this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
