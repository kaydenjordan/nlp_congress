 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this budget  resolution as a first step in the process to repeal and replace  ObamaCare. It is undeniable that ObamaCare has failed. It has broken  promise after promise to the American people.   Constituents in my district in central Illinois are watching their  premiums skyrocket by an average of 15 percent. This chart next to me  here shows, all across the country in State after State, premiums have  skyrocketed. Citizens also face deductibles that are so high that they  try to get by without going to a doctor.    One constituent from Roseville, Illinois, whose insurance costs have  gone up 75 percent, stated to me recently: ``This is crazy. Almost half  of my paycheck goes to insurance. How do they expect us to afford  this?''   These burdensome costs stifle families and our small businesses'  ability to participate in and help grow our economy. We have a mandate  from the American people to fix this broken system and to rescue  citizens from escalating healthcare costs.                                time  1300    The goal is not to pull the rug out from underneath anyone. In fact,  we are working to provide a stable transition to better, more  affordable health care. We must have something that is economically  sustainable and fiscally responsible, something that actually works.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to replace ObamaCare  with a system grounded in economic reality--a market-driven, consumer- centered healthcare system that provides Americans with more choices,  lower costs, and greater flexibility. That is why we are working on a  replacement system that will expand consumer choice through health care  focused on their needs; a system that will spur innovation in health  care; attract new doctors and healthcare providers; and protect  patients with preexisting conditions.   Mr. Chairman, we must help Americans gain access to insurance they  can afford. Passing this legislation is one step towards helping people  and fulfilling our promise to the American people.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. We owe it to our  citizens.
