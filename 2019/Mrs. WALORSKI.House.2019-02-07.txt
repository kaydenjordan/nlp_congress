 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge a vote on H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   This bill would require doctors to provide medical attention to  children who survive an abortion attempt.   Unfortunately, H.R. 962 is needed more than ever with the passage of  a radical law in New York State that essentially legalizes infanticide.  That law allows abortions up to and even after birth and ends  safeguards to protect babies born alive after failed abortions.   Similar bills are being debated right now in States like Virginia,  where the Governor spoke of making newborns comfortable while doctors  and patients decide if they should be left to die.   We have to stand up against this radical legislation to protect the  rights of all infants.   This is not a partisan issue. It is simply what is right to do.   Congress must pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,  and I urge this Speaker of this House to schedule a vote as soon as  possible.                            ____________________
