 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the previous  question and in support of the immediate consideration of legislation  introduced by Leader McCarthy and House Republicans to defund and  prohibit the activities of the Biden administration's Disinformation  Governance Board at the Department of Homeland Security. That is right:  It is called the Disinformation Governance Board.   The notion that this ill-conceived effort will improve Americans'  trust in their government is fundamentally absurd. In fact, it is just  the latest example of how this administration, and specifically  leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, remains grossly out  of touch with what issues matter most to the American people.   At a time when the border is in a state of crisis and more Americans  than ever before are being fatally poisoned with fentanyl, everyone in  this room and in this country would be wise to take note that this, a  Disinformation Governance Board, is what your Department of Homeland  Security is focused on.                                time  1845    Are they focused on combating the drug cartels and human traffickers  that are profiting from the chaos at our southwest border? Apparently  not.   Are they focused on improving our economic security and resilience  against unprecedented threats from China, Russia, and others? It  doesn't seem like it.   Madam Speaker, as ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee,  I witnessed firsthand the consistent lack of transparency demonstrated  by Secretary Mayorkas and the Department of Homeland Security when  faced with congressional oversight and legitimate requests for  information on the department's mission.   Why on Earth would we trust the same department to now unilaterally  expand their mission and decide for us, the public, what is or is not  the truth? Why has the Department of Homeland Security been unable or  unwilling to answer basic questions as to the functions, remit, or  charter of this board when asked by Congress?   If the Biden administration was serious about making the board  apolitical, as they claim they are, why have they opted to appoint  known partisan operatives as its executive director and co-chairs? In  fact, it is reported that the named executive director herself has  promoted now-debunked claims on social media. Think about that. The  person that they claim to be the executive director is now the one that  has in the past herself engaged in disinformation. That is pretty  ironic.   I ask you, Madam Speaker, and my colleagues across the aisle, where  is the accountability for this misguided operation? With this vote, we  have the opportunity to send a clear message: This administration  should focus on restoring our national security, not making itself the  arbiter of truth and speech. This is America, this isn't a Communist  country.
