 Madam Speaker, Congress must protect women's  constitutional freedom to decide over their bodies. After the cruel  Texas--my home State--abortion ban, I visited the local Planned  Parenthood and heard horrific stories of women already resorting to  self-help, including finding an abortion tea on the internet.   We cannot go back to the dark ages of using dangerous wire hangers  for self-help and other things that will actually hurt and potentially  kill women. We cannot continue to go back. We must move forward and  protect our rights.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of the Women's Health Protection Act.
