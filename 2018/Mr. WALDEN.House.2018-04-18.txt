 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow; and further,  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet at 3 p.m. on  Monday, April 23, 2018.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Burgess and appreciate his  leadership on this issue and the hard work he and his members on both  sides of the aisle have done on the Subcommittee on Health in the  Energy and Commerce Committee.   As we all know, the opioid crisis is wreaking havoc and death on our  Nation. It is striking at the heart of communities from one side of the  country to the other. On any given day, you can browse the headlines to  learn of yet another life lost to addiction or about a raid that seized  overwhelming quantities of prescription painkillers or illicit drugs.   At roundtables throughout my district in Oregon over the last few  years, I have met with those victims. I have met with their families. I  have talked to doctors and treatment advocates. I have met with law  enforcement officers on the front lines of this fight. Sadly, their  stories are all too similar and all too familiar, but they put the  names and faces to this crisis that has touched every community in our  country.   We are here tonight because this crisis is having a devastating  impact on each of our districts and the people who live in them. No  community is exempt from the scourge of addiction. Nobody is immune  from the dangers of powerful drugs. The crisis has taken a hold on the  very fabric of our Nation, and we must do everything we can to stem the  tide of addiction, to help those who are addicted, and to stop the  deaths and destruction that follow the abuse of opiates.   Earlier this week, I visited the Prescribed to Death opioid memorial  that was stationed at the White House Ellipse. I was able to see the  individual faces of Americans who lost their own battles with opioid  addiction etched into the 22,000 pills on display. There was one for  each fatal overdose in 2015.                                time  1830    It is a daunting visual. It was made only more poignant by the  knowledge that those numbers have only continued to climb.   More than 100 Americans die from opioid overdoses every single day,  claiming the lives of more than 42,000 Americans who died in 2016  alone. That same year, we lost 506 Oregonians from opioid overdoses.   The committee--in particular, the Energy and Commerce Committee and  your subcommittee, Mr. Chairman--has a long history of working to  combat this evolving epidemic, from launching our earliest  investigations in 2012 to advancing bipartisan legislation like the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, and the 21st Century  Cures Act.   Most recently, we included critical funding to aid in the fight in  the recent government spending bill that President Trump signed into  law. This legislation included a record amount of resources to combat  the crisis, providing billions of dollars to communities across America  to tackle one of the biggest public health problems in a generation.  But we know that more can and must be done.   Now, the good news is that combating the opioid crisis is our  committee's top priority. It is why we have reviewed literally dozens  and dozens and dozens of comprehensive, bold, and bipartisan pieces of  legislation. In total, these bills will bolster our enforcement  efforts, will protect our communities, will advance our public health  and prevention efforts, and will address coverage and payment issues  within Medicaid and Medicare.   Tomorrow at the Energy and Commerce Committee, we will hear the  personal stories from families affected by the drug crisis and  individuals who are battling addiction. Then, next week, the Energy and  Commerce Committee will mark these bills up in our Health Subcommittee.  It is an important step forward to keep us on track in our goal of  having legislation to this House floor ahead of the Memorial Day  district work period.   We know that there is no silver bullet, there is no one-size-fits-all  approach that will remedy the catastrophic effects of this crisis that  has been building for the last decade, but much more can be done. We  will do much more, and we will do it on a bipartisan basis, to help  vulnerable patients get the treatment they want and need, remembering  there are some 20 million Americans with chronic pain. And we will  ensure these powerful drugs are not getting into the wrong hands.   As I conclude, I think it is important to point out that, if people  want more information, they can go to energycommerce.house.gov/opioids  and see the testimony that we have received and the work that we are  engaged in to rid this country of this terrible scourge and make our  communities safer again.
