 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SECURE Act. I thank  the chairman, Mr. Neal, and Speaker Pelosi for their leadership on this  important bill.   America is facing a retirement crisis. Nearly half of all the people  in America do not have any money saved for retirement. The SECURE Act  before us today helps fix that.   I am glad we could reach this bipartisan solution to make it easier  for workers, including home healthcare workers in California, to take  advantage of important retirement savings tools.   As a combat veteran and the father of two first responders, I  understand how important it is that this bill also reverses the harmful  tax hikes included in the Republican tax bill on survivor benefits.  Hiking taxes on Gold Star families and families of first responders is  unjust, and it insults how sacred these benefits are. It is just plain  wrong. This bill reverses that harmful provision.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Luria for her leadership in this  effort.   Madam Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in support of  this very important bill.
