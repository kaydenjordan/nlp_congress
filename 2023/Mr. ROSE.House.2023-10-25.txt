 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of America's greatest  ally in the Middle East--Israel, its people, and its right to defend  itself against the horrifying Hamas terrorist attacks that have taken  the lives of so many innocent individuals, including 33 Americans.   Since that deadly attack, I have been working to assist Tennesseans  and their families and friends in Israel in their attempts to come  home. I have also joined members of the Tennessee delegation in a  letter to President Biden urging him to support Israel by any means  possible, including by providing any weapons and munitions necessary  and punishing all involved in aiding the Hamas terrorists.   Lastly, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution we  are here voting on today, which reaffirms our commitment to Israel and  condemns Hamas' brutal terrorist attacks.   Mr. Speaker, we must do everything we can to protect and defend our  friend Israel.
