 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of victims  of gun violence.   Gun violence rips through a community, leaving trauma with the  families and friends of the victims, the medical staff, the first  responders, and the entire community for a lifetime. It is a trauma and  a scar too many communities in Colorado have faced, as well as the rest  of the Nation.   I represented Aurora, Colorado, on July 20, 2012, during the Aurora  Theatre massacre. I will never forget the victims and the families  impacted by that tragedy, including, A.J. Boik, 18; Jon Blunk; Jesse  Childress; Gordon Cowden, who died protecting his children; Jessica  Ghawi; John Larimer; Matt McQuinn; Micayla Medek; Veronica Moser- Sullivan, only 6 years old; Alex Sullivan; Alexander Teves; and Rebecca  Wingo.   These people died far too young. These stories are just a few of the  36,000 Americans killed each year, and 100,000 Americans shot and  injured by firearms. We cannot let this type of violence and tragedy  rip through another community.   Let's make 2020 the year we finally honor these victims with action.                            ____________________
