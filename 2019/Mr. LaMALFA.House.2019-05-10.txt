 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the recent  violence taking place in Israel and the Gaza Strip.   It all started when snipers from the Gaza Strip, unprovoked, fired  over the border upon Israeli soldiers. This was an unprovoked attack by  Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist organization. Israel has  every right to defend itself, so they did, as they should.   Following a responsive Israeli airstrike, hundreds of rockets were  launched from Gaza into Israel. People died on both sides of this  bloody conflict. Hamas fired these rockets from schoolyards, hospitals,  and everywhere else they could use human shields that they thought  would keep them safe from retaliation.   While some in the media and even in this Chamber attempt to blame our  allies in Israel and downplay the actions of Hamas, most of us have a  firmer grip on reality. Israel is not the bad guy here.   This is yet another example of peace being interrupted by Hamas  terrorists. If any other country in the world were on the receiving  end, no one would dare question the right to respond accordingly.   I can assure you that I join President Trump in standing 100 percent  with our friends in Israel. They have every right to defend themselves  from terrorist attacks.                            ____________________
