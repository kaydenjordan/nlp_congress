 Mr. Speaker, I, too, join my colleague, Representative  Thompson, in remembering and feeling very blessed to have known Jim  Hagedorn, our colleague and friend, and I pray for his family.   Mr. Speaker, on this day we need to discuss the fact that Vladimir  Putin is absolutely stunned by the courage and resolve of the Ukrainian  people. After 6 to 7 days of fighting, Ukraine controls most of its  major cities including the city that my family is from, Lviv. The  Russian people are protesting their leader's unprovoked aggression  seeing, as the world sees, that this is Putin's war alone.   We must do more. Our crippling sanctions are strongly hurting the  Russian economy. But, Mr. Speaker, we must recognize this conflict is  where energy is both the carrot and the stick. We must hit Putin where  it hurts, by cutting off imports of Russian oil to the United States,  unleashing U.S. energy, and ensuring Nord Stream 2 never goes into  effect.   Putin can't be trusted. This is understood. His prior interest in  diplomacy was insincere. We must show leadership. We must provide the  weapons that, by the way, were provided by the Ukrainian Parliament.                            ____________________
