 I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from Massachusetts  (Ms. Warren), and the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Whitehouse) are  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I was on the floor 2 days ago when the  Republican Senate leader came to the floor and said something which I  still don't quite understand, and I would like to refer to it in a  statement.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the  cloture motion with respect to the Merle nomination.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the confirmation vote on the Williams nomination, the Senate vote on  the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 920, the nomination of  Bernadette M. Meehan, of New York, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of  Chile.    Madam President, now, back to my statement.   I came to the floor and heard a speech by the Republican leader,  Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Now, it wasn't the first. I have heard  many, and I listen closely so that I can divine the strategy of Senate  Republicans. And for weeks we have heard speeches about the plight of  American families dealing with inflation. It is a real problem. If you  go to buy anything these days, you are shocked by the price, starting  at the gas pump, if you have aspirations to buy a car or truck,  ordinary food items--much more expensive. Most families are not seeing  any increase in income so it is a real hardship for them to keep up.   Well, the Senator from Kentucky has given that speech so many times,  I could almost repeat it verbatim. And I don't quarrel with his  premise. Inflation is painful for working families.   But then--but then--he went into an area of pricing and took an  exactly opposite point of view. What he said was he thought, if there  was an effort to control the price of prescription drugs, it was  ``socialist price control,'' it was really asking for something for  nothing, and he didn't support it.   And I stopped to think for a second. Wait a minute. All the polling,  when you ask American families what they worry about, tells you that  this is a big headache for families. They go to a doctor. Somebody is  sick. The doctor prescribes a drug. They take the prescription to the  drug store. They get it filled. And then comes the moment of truth, the  moment at the cash register when the family is told: Incidentally, that  will cost you $100, $200, $300 over your insurance coverage.   And you know what some families say?   I wish I could afford that; I can't.   And they don't pick up the drug or they pick it up and, instead of  taking it, they kind of wait and say: I will see if I get any better by  myself. They do the wrong thing because of the cost of prescription  drugs.   So when the Republican Senators come to the floor every day talking  about family expenses, it comes as a shock to know that they are  planning to oppose the Democratic effort to establish prescription drug  pricing. They complain about high prices for everything else, but they  don't seem to want to do anything when it comes to prescription drugs.   Americans pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,  an average of nearly four times as much paid by an American family for  exactly the same drugs that are being sold in Canada and Europe. Where  are those drugs made? All made in the same place, all made by the same  company, four times the cost for America.   To add insult to injury, many of these prescription drugs only exist  because of the successful investment by American taxpayers in the  National Institutes of Health. The National Institutes of Health is an  amazing research organization. They do the research, the basic  research. The drug companies capitalize on it, make the drugs, and sell  them at a profit. So taxpayers pay on the front end for the drugs.  American taxpayers and tax-paying families pay on the back end for the  actual cost of the pharmaceuticals.   Out-of-control prescription costs aren't just hurting people  financially; they hurt the health of Americans. One in five Americans  don't take the medications as prescribed because they can't afford  them. They cut their pills in half or they skip doses because they  can't do it; they can't pay it.   ``Your money or your life''--you expect to hear that from a stickup  artist, not from a pharmaceutical company. That is the choice Americans  face.   So we want to do something about it. Democrats don't want to hear  speeches about the costs to families. We want to do something. We want  to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors first and then  for families in general.    If you really care about inflation, most families would say, start  with prescription drugs. That is what we are doing. And the Republicans  are going to oppose this.   Ironically, Senator McConnell gives a speech calling it socialism to  deal with the cost of prescription drugs, and, within an hour, the  senior Senator from Iowa gives a speech on the floor of the Senate-- Republican Senator--how he wants to cut prescription drug prices for  seniors. One of them didn't get the message at the caucus. I think the  Senator from Iowa is right, incidentally.   So Democrats are proposing to allow Medicare to negotiate fair prices  for drugs. We have been doing that for a long time when it comes to the  Veterans' Administration. The Veterans' Administration buys a lot of  prescription drugs for our veterans--and I am glad they do--and they  negotiate with these companies to get a fair price. We think Medicare  ought to do the same thing. It reduces the cost of prescription drugs.  It makes them more affordable for seniors.   Now, a lot of people say: Well, if you do that, then the prescription  drug companies, the pharmaceutical companies, just aren't going to be  able to make it.   Well, here is the reality. Studies have found that Big Pharma could  lose $1 trillion in sales over the next decade and still remain the  most profitable industry in America--lose $1 trillion in sales and  still be the most profitable industry. Higher profit margins in pharma  than in the telecom industry, than in the defense industry, in the  banking industry, and the Republicans are saying they are afraid that  they are going to get hurt if consumers can buy drugs at lower prices.   But good news for those who fear that if you cut the amount of money  going to pharma, it will cut research. That is not what we have  learned. We know Bayer. It has been around a long time. It started off  as a German company. It made aspirin. Now they have made some sizable  acquisitions in the business.   They make a drug called Xarelto. Now, you would have to watch that  television ad 10 or 12 times to be able to spell ``Xarelto,'' but they  are trying to convince American consumers they can't live without it.  Bayer spent $18 billion on sales and marketing last year compared to $8  billion on research for drugs.   Johnson & Johnson: $22 billion on sales and marketing, $12 billion on  research. GlaxoSmithKline: $15 billion on sales and marketing, $7  billion on research.   Get the pattern? There is more money being spent on advertising than  on research for new drugs. Americans get bombarded with nine drug ads  on TV every day telling them to ask their doctor for the newest wonder  drug. There are only two nations on Earth where you can legally  advertise prescription drugs on television. One, of course, is the  United States. The other, for some reason, is New Zealand. Filling the  airwaves with ads is what Big Pharma does to try to convince customers  they can't live without their drugs.   So the claim that allowing Medicare to negotiate a reasonable price  for seniors will freeze out Big Pharma' s innovation just doesn't wash.   Senator McConnell says there is no ``free lunch'' when it comes to  prescription drug pricing. Let's keep in mind that the 14 largest drug  corporations spent more on stock buybacks--lining the pockets of their  CEOs--than on research and development over the past 5 years.   So here is what it comes down to. Look at these, just as an  illustration. I will do this quickly because Members are showing up to  vote. Insulin, discovered by Canadian researchers at the beginning of  the 20th century--they surrendered the patent for the drug for a dollar  so that it would never be overcharged to consumers because it is a  life-or-death drug for those suffering from diabetes.   Take a look, from the year 2004 to the year 2022, at what has  happened to the drug insulin cost--insulin cost--on a regular basis,  the manufacturing price by year. You can see it tracks all the  companies that make insulin. It is  [[Page S3521]]  as high as $300 a dose, and a person suffering from diabetes may need  three doses a month--$900 for insulin.   Well, let's take a comparative cost and take a look at what insulin  costs in other countries. The United States, while it is paying $98 for  a dose of insulin--look--Japan is paying $14; Canada, $12; Germany,  $11; France, $9; UK, $7; Australia, $6, $7. And the good news is these  are the same companies, the American companies, charging a fraction of  the cost to the other countries for insulin. This is one of the drugs  which we are working on now, Senator Shaheen and others, to bring down  the cost.   I am going to close by saying this. If you care about the costs that  families face, if you care about inflation, and you care about life-or- death medications, and you want to make them affordable, don't take the  position of Senator McConnell that this is socialism to demand  negotiation in pricing. Don't take his position that it is just a free  lunch to say that people will never have to pay more than $2,000 a year  out of pocket for drugs. This is a life-or-death decision. Even 70  percent of Republicans agree with that.   I wish the Senate Republicans would agree with it and join us in  supporting this bill.    Madam President, today, the Senate will continue its  vital work of confirming highly qualified judicial nominees to the  Federal bench. We will vote on an outstanding district court nominee:  Gregory Williams to the District of Delaware.   Mr. Williams is currently a partner at the firm Fox Rothschild LLP,  where he has an extensive trial practice that focuses on intellectual  property and other matters. Mr. Williams joined the firm immediately  after law school, rising through the ranks to become the first African- American equity partner in the firm's history.   In addition to his work in private practice, Mr. Williams has  dedicated countless hours to serving the Delaware legal and judicial  communities. He has worked as a Special Master in complex civil cases  for the District of Delaware; as president of the Delaware State Bar  Association; and as chair of the State's judicial nominating  commission. A graduate of Millersville University of Pennsylvania and  Villanova University School of Law, Mr. Williams received a unanimous  ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association and has the  strong support of Delaware's Senators, Mr. Carper and Mr. Coons. With  his depth of experience and impeccable credentials, Mr. Williams will  serve Delaware with distinction.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this outstanding  nominees.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
