 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2544) to improve the Organ Procurement and Transplantation  Network, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2544         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing the U.S. Organ       Procurement and Transplantation Network Act''.       SEC. 2. ORGAN PROCUREMENT AND TRANSPLANTATION NETWORK.         Section 372 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       274) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by striking ``The Secretary shall by contract'' and       inserting ``In General--The Secretary shall'';        (B) by striking ``establishment and'' and inserting       ``continued''; and        (C) by striking the second and third sentences and       inserting ``The Secretary may award grants, contracts, or       cooperative agreements, as the Secretary determines       appropriate, for purposes of carrying out this section.'';       and        (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``(b)(1) The Organ       Procurement'' and all that follows through the end of       subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) and inserting the       following:        ``(b) Composition.--        ``(1) In general.--The Organ Procurement and       Transplantation Network shall--        ``(A) be operated through awards to public or private       entities made by the Secretary that are distinct from the       awards made to support the organization tasked with       supporting the board of directors described in subparagraph       (B); and''.       SEC. 3. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.

SEC. 4. GAO REVIEW.         Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall--        (1) to the extent data are available, conduct a review of       the historical financing of the Organ Procurement and       Transplantation Network described in section 372 of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 274), including the       utilization of registration fees among entities that have       previously been awarded contracts under such section 372; and        (2) submit to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,       and Pensions and the Committee on Finance of the Senate and       the  [[Page H3930]]       Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives a report on the review under paragraph (1),       including related recommendations, as applicable.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 2544, the Securing  the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Act, introduced  in partnership with Representative Kelly of Illinois.   This critical legislation would improve the Organ Procurement and  Transplantation Network by allowing the Health Resources and Services  Administration to make the OPTN contracting process competitive.   The same entity has operated the OPTN contract since it was  established nearly 40 years ago. Recent reports and bipartisan  congressional investigations have shed light on logistical and  technological flaws within the OPTN that may have jeopardized patient  safety and may have led to lifesaving organs not being transplanted.   We must pass H.R. 2544 to increase competition and make sure the best  organization is selected to operate the OPTN. This will hopefully lead  to more organs being transplanted and saving lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2544 allows HRSA to improve the OPTN program. It  clarifies that HRSA does not have to implement a single contract for  all aspects of the program and encourages a competitive process to  choose the best contractors for each OPTN function. Nothing in this  legislation precludes HRSA from awarding UNOS a contract for each  function.   As a physician in Congress, my focus with this legislation is on  ensuring that HRSA has the authority that it needs to act on behalf of  patients and that the best innovators are able to compete and play  their part in saving lives.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 752) to require SelectUSA to coordinate with State-level  economic development organizations to increase foreign direct  investment in semiconductor-related manufacturing and production, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 752         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Semiconductor       Supply Chains Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. SELECTUSA DEFINED.         In this Act, the term ``SelectUSA'' means the SelectUSA       program of the Department of Commerce established by       Executive Order 13577 (76 Fed. Reg. 35,715).       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Semiconductors underpin the United States and global       economies, including manufacturing sectors. Semiconductors       are also essential to the national security of the United       States.        (2) A shortage of semiconductors, brought about by the       COVID-19 pandemic and other complex factors impacting the       overall supply chain, has threatened the economic recovery of       the United States and industries that employ millions of       United States citizens.        (3) Addressing current challenges and building resilience       against future risks requires ensuring a secure and stable       supply chain for semiconductors that will support the       economic and national security needs of the United States and       its allies.        (4) The supply chain for semiconductors is complex and       global. While the United States plays a leading role in       certain segments of the semiconductor industry, securing the       supply chain requires onshoring, reshoring, or diversifying       vulnerable segments, such as for--        (A) fabrication;        (B) advanced packaging; and        (C) materials and equipment used to manufacture       semiconductor products.        (5) The Federal Government can leverage foreign direct       investment and private dollars to grow the domestic       manufacturing and production capacity of the United States       for vulnerable segments of the semiconductor supply chain.        (6) The SelectUSA program of the Department of Commerce, in       coordination with other Federal agencies and State-level       economic development organizations, is positioned to boost       foreign direct investment in domestic manufacturing and to       help secure the semiconductor supply chain of the United       States.       SEC. 4. COORDINATION WITH STATE-LEVEL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT                     ORGANIZATIONS.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA shall solicit       comments from State-level economic development       organizations--        (1) to review--        (A) what efforts the Federal Government can take to support       increased foreign direct investment in any segment of       semiconductor-related production;        (B) what barriers to such investment may exist and how to       amplify State efforts to attract such investment;        (C) public opportunities those organizations have       identified to attract foreign direct investment to help       increase investment described in subparagraph (A);        (D) resource gaps or other challenges that prevent those       organizations from increasing such investment; and        (2) to develop recommendations for--        (A) how SelectUSA can increase such investment       independently or through partnership with those       organizations; and        (B) working with countries that are allies or partners of       the United States to ensure  [[Page H3931]]       that foreign adversaries (as defined in section 8(c)(2) of       the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019       (47 U.S.C. 1607(c)(2))) do not benefit from United States       efforts to increase such investment.       SEC. 5. REPORT ON INCREASING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN                     SEMICONDUCTOR-RELATED MANUFACTURING AND                     PRODUCTION.         Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA, in       coordination with the Federal Interagency Investment Working       Group established by Executive Order 13577 (76 Fed. Reg.       35,715; relating to establishment of the SelectUSA       Initiative), shall submit to the Committee on Commerce,       Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee       on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a       report that includes--        (1) a review of the comments SelectUSA received from State-      level economic development organizations under section 4;        (2) a description of activities SelectUSA is engaged in to       increase foreign direct investment in semiconductor-related       manufacturing and production; and        (3) an assessment of strategies SelectUSA may implement to       achieve an increase in such investment and to help secure the       United States supply chain for semiconductors, including by--        (A) working with other relevant Federal agencies; and        (B) working with State-level economic development       organizations and implementing any strategies or       recommendations SelectUSA received from those organizations.       SEC. 6. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated for       the purpose of carrying out this Act.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 752, the Securing  Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2023, sponsored by Ms. Eshoo of  California and Mr. Pence of Indiana.   I am pleased that we can look at ways to attract investment into our  country as opposed to shifting more demands onto our taxpayers.   This legislation requires SelectUSA to find ways that we can bolster  foreign direct investment in U.S. semiconductor supply chains.   Semiconductor technology powers much of our modern economy, including  payment cards, automobiles, cell phones, and the list goes on.   While we have led in chip design over the years, we have seen chip  manufacturing and its surrounding supply chains shift overseas.   Among the many lessons we learned from COVID-19 and the pandemic is  that the United States must lead in both the design and production of  semiconductor chips to ensure we do not fall behind China.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Pence), one of the primary sponsors of the  bill.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.  [[Page H3932]]         Madam Speaker, I also urge support for H.R. 752, the  Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains Act of 2023, as amended, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
