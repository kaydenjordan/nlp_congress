 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his work  and his love of music.   This new Democrat socialist majority wants the Federal Government to  interfere in our free and fair elections. This bill today, the  majority's most important bill, is a massive Federal Government  takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections. But  before I explain why, I want to highlight how the majority has gone to  great steps to actually hide their prize legislation from the American  people.   Madam Speaker, the American public need to understand, when you  become the majority, you reserve 1 through 10 of the numbering of  bills, and you want to make your number one bill the most important  thing you do for America today.   Two years ago we were in the majority, Madam Chair, and we made the  most important bill to make sure the people's money went back to them.  We wanted to cut your taxes.   The most important bill that the Democrat socialist majority has is  to take more of your money and give it to the politicians who want to  vote for this bill. How ironic.   Now, because H.R. 1 has had such a broad spectrum of where to go, it  was referred to 10 committees. Imagine that, 10 committees.   But 40 percent of this bill has not even been marked up because, what  did they do? They only went to one committee.   What committee did they go to? They went to the very special  committee, House Administration.   This House Administration, the Members who sit on House  Administration, I am sure they are probably selected from the  conference committee that goes forward to select individuals for it.   Oh, no, no, no. That is not the committee we went to. House  Administration is selected just by two people: the Speaker and the  leader. The Speaker and the leader.   And do you know what? It is one of the smallest committees we have.  Because if H.R. 1 is so important to the American public, I am sure we  would want everybody to see it. But, no, it is just nine people of this  House.   And in their jurisdiction, they didn't get to mark up the whole bill.  They only had about 60 percent of the bill to mark up.   But I want to thank our Republican colleagues on this committee:  first of all, Ranking Member Rodney Davis, Mark Walker, and Barry  Loudermilk. They were very thoughtful.   They realized, even though the chair of the House Administration,  when asked during the markup, would the other committees mark up this  bill, she promised--she promised--that the other nine committees would  see it, that the other nine committees could mark up that other 40  percent that House Administration didn't get to mark up.   But lo and behold, that is not true. Just as this new Democrat  socialist majority said there will be 72 hours before things come to  the floor, no. Yesterday we learned that can mean an hour; those other  71 don't matter.   But what the Republicans on the other side of the aisle did, they  wanted there to be a thoughtful approach on the issue. They provided 28  amendments to improve H.R. 1.   Do you know how many the Democrats on the other side that the Speaker  selected, those six Members--they didn't vote for one of them. They  could not find a way that, of those 28 amendments, one of them could be  accepted.   I guess the Speaker selected the right people for the House  Administration.   Now, they call this bill the For the People Act, but I want to  explain why I actually think it is for the politicians, because  everyone who votes for this bill today, they are all going to go home a  little more excited. Do you know why? They just got the taxpayers to  actually fund their elections, and they picked it in a manner where you  don't even know, and the multiplying effect of the 6 to 1, who provided  it.   So let's talk about ``For the Politicians Act.''   First, H.R. 1 wants to give American taxpayer dollars to political  candidates and campaigns, regardless of whether you support it. We are  not talking just Republicans or Democrats running. Any view they want  with any impression they want to say.   We just had a bill on the floor yesterday about hate. I imagine there  are going to be quite a few people who run for office who get  taxpayers' money who talk a lot of hate. I don't think America wants  their money spent on that.   This bill will give candidates a government match of 6 to 1, not a  dollar for dollar. No, no, no, no. The ``For the Politicians Act''  multiplies it. So, if a citizen gives $200, the government gives  $1,200.   That is why the new Democrat socialist party is so excited by this  bill. That is why they made it their number one priority. Hard-earned  taxpayer money should go toward building roads, bridges, or giving a  boost to struggling Americans, not just to political campaigns.   I am not sure about these other districts, but when I campaigned, no  one came to me and said: ``Let's make sure you take more of my taxpayer  money to give to you to run.'' I can't remember one time anybody on any  side of the aisle asked for that.   Worse, this bill would allow political candidates to profit off  actually running for office on the American taxpayers' dime. The bill  expands the use of taxpayer funds to include the childcare, the rent,  the mortgage, or even professional development.  [[Page H2596]]    We have now just created a new industry. Think of the individual who  just wants to run for office, who wants to spew hate, and says: ``The  taxpayers are going to pay for it. I am just going to keep doing it.''   Second, H.R. 1 legalizes the vote for convicted felons, even if that  person was convicted of election fraud. Can you imagine that? We are  going to vote on a bill today that provides more taxpayer money to  politicians, that is going to allow felons to vote, because we don't  care what States say. But even if you are convicted of election fraud,  come on down; we have got something special for you.    And this wasn't created by one new member of this Democrat socialist  party. It is the most important bill that they selected. It is H.R. 1.  No other bill matters to them but this. It just doesn't make sense to  me.   Third, H.R. 1 would weaken the security of our elections and make it  harder to protect against voter fraud. It automatically registers  voters from the DMV.   Voting is a right. It is not a mandate.   This legislation would also prevent officials from ever removing  ineligible voters from the rolls or even verifying the accuracy of  voter information.   To that point, H.R. 1 exposes our election system to widespread  fraud. Take ballot harvesting, for example. We have one less Member in  this body because of the harvesting of ballots, a practice where a  third-party activist can collect your absentee ballot from other voters  and turn them in for you, or potentially not even turn them in at all.   Can you imagine putting the trust of your vote in the hand of a  stranger? If that doesn't scare you, it should.   Sadly, this practice was weaponized in California and North Carolina  not so long ago, but now we want to make it everywhere.   You know, The Washington Post highlighted the peril of this practice.  Let me read you the headline: ``Don't Be Shocked by the North Carolina  Fraud Allegations. Absentee Ballots Are Much Less Secure Than Polling  Places.''   Absentee ballots are less secure than polling places.   The piece goes on to say: ``No one oversees voters filling out  absentee ballots to ensure that they fill out the ballot and return it  without tampering.   ``Campaigns and parties have taken advantage of this by turning to  campaign and party workers to deliver and return absentee ballot  materials for voters--on the honor system.''   And, finally, this bill wants to stack the deck in favor of the party  in power at the Federal Election Commission.   We talk a lot about bipartisanship. We have talked a lot about it in  different ways. The committee that could only mark up 60 percent of  this bill, you might say it is bipartisan. But it is not level. It is  six to three. That is why not one of the 28 amendments got adopted.   But the Federal Election Commission is an even six Commissioners, a  panel of three on one side and three on the other.   So what does this bill do that the new Democrat socialist majority  cares most about? Let's stack the deck. Let's stack the deck a little  further. Let's not make it three and three. Let's put the party in  power to get that one more, to put the thumb on the scale a little  further. So they want to make it a five-member panel.   This week, The New York Times wrote:         Republicans, arguably, have spent more time trying to       define this bill than Democrat socialists have spent trying       to promote it.    I wonder why. If it is your most important bill, the bill that is  going to define your Congress, let's look at what it is. They want to  take more taxpayer money. They want to give you less freedom.   Those who vote for it today, I guess they walk away with a raise in  their campaign. They are asking the taxpayer to give them 6 to 1.  Pretty good return, I would say. But it doesn't even matter if the  taxpayer supports you or not because you are just going to make  government larger and take the money away.   It is going to let people who are convicted felons open the door.  Come on and vote, even if you are convicted of election fraud.   It is kind of interesting to me that you would make it your number  one priority. It is kind of interesting to me, a structure of Congress,  if you referred to a committee, that you wouldn't have it all marked  up. It is kind of interesting to me the only committee you would pick  to mark it up is the one chosen by the Speaker. It is interesting to me  that this is where you spend your time.   We can do better, and I hope today we have a big voice to say  taxpayers should not pay for our elections, that politicians should not  vote to take more of taxpayers' hard-earned money so they could say  things that people disagree with.
