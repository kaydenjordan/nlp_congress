 Mr. Speaker, I rise today angered and upset over H.R. 5,  an attempt to make Black history not American history.   I have listened to my Republican colleagues suggest how this bill  empowers parents--I am a grandparent; that is not true--and how it  protects our children. From what?   Protect our children from reading about Harriet Tubman and Martin  Luther King, Jr.?   Protect our children from reading about Barack Obama, the first Black  President; Kamala Harris, the first Black Vice President; or Ketanji  Brown Jackson, the first Black Supreme Court Justice in this country?   Protect them from the Tuskegee Airmen, who were wingmen to save the  lives of White pilots?   Protect our children from what? American history and Black history  are the same.   Protect them from the research that Kizzmekia Corbett did on COVID- 19?   Protect them from all the inventions that we all benefit from?   Mr. Speaker, it is not right. It does not protect our children. What  are Republicans afraid of?                            ____________________
