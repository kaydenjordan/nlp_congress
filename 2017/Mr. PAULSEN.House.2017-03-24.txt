 Mr. Speaker, today we are taking a very important step  to lift the burden of the Affordable Care Act off of the backs of the  American people. A key component of this is repealing the burdensome  mandates and tax increases that were imposed to help fund this failed  law. This includes the medical device tax, a senseless policy that  placed an excise tax on lifesaving medical technology.    What did this achieve? A loss of 30,000 high-paying American jobs,  less research and development, canceled projects, and postponed  expansions. Most importantly, it hurt patients.   There is good news. Just a few years ago, in 2015, we came together  on a bipartisan basis and suspended the tax for 2 years. We are seeing  positive results. Companies are now hiring again, we have increased  research and development, and we have new investments in facilities  coming online.   We need to permanently repeal this onerous tax or it is going to  start up again. Voting ``yes'' today means permanent repeal of the  medical device tax.   Mr. Speaker, I am also encouraged to see several provisions I have  authored to enhance and expand the use of health savings accounts and  flexible spending accounts that are included in this legislation today.   HSAs and FSAs are now more popular than ever and used by 20 million  Americans. It is time to remove the restrictions on HSAs that were  imposed in ObamaCare so that we can make them more accessible and  easier to use and empower Americans to take more control of their  healthcare decisions.   Expanding HSAs will help us also begin to address the rising costs of  health care. One recent study showed that, when a large employer  switched their employees over to an HSA plan, it lowered their  healthcare spending by an average of $900 per employee over a 5-year  period. That is real savings, Mr. Speaker.   Let's support a better way forward to lower healthcare costs for  patients and put them back in control of their healthcare decisions.                                time  1415
