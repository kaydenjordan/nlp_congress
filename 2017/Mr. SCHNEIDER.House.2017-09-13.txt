 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment  which is included in this en bloc package. This amendment would  increase funding for the Small Business Administration Entrepreneurial  Development programs by $4 million, with the increase intended to  support entrepreneurship education.   Our entrepreneurs and small-business owners form the foundation of  the American economy. Entrepreneurs with inspired ideas benefit from  the educational resources and information that help them convert those  ideas into thriving businesses. Entrepreneurship education within the  SBA provides resources such as growth assistance, financial literacy  education, and basic information for aspiring entrepreneurs.   We in Congress have a responsibility to ensure that Americans, young  and old, with the entrepreneurial spirit and dedication to succeed have  access to lessons and resources that will help them succeed. This  amendment will help our small businesses to prosper and, ultimately,  create jobs.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to continue to ensure  that the United States remains the best place in the world to start and  grow a business.
