 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Chris Smith, for his  long work in this endeavor.   This past Monday, our country observed Martin Luther King Day. I had  [[Page H468]]  the privilege of participating back home in some events honoring Dr.  King.   While reflecting on Dr. King's legacy at one of the events, I  recalled decades ago when I first read the letter from the Birmingham  jail.   Dr. King explained there are two types of laws: just and unjust.   Dr. King asked: What is the difference between the two?   He answered that a just law is a man-made code that squares with the  moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of  harmony with the moral law.   To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas, Dr. King said: an  unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural  law.   Defending the natural law principles of the Declaration of  Independence is one of the reasons I ran for Congress. The first right  listed in the Declaration is the God-given right to life.                                time  2000    This Friday marks the 45th anniversary of one of the most somber days  in our country's history: the day that the Supreme Court issued Roe v.  Wade.   Associate Justice Byron White called this decision an exercise in  ``raw judicial power,'' as the court invented a right to abortion that  wiped out the laws of all 50 States.   To echo the words from Dr. King's 1963 address at the Lincoln  Memorial, the Supreme Court stamped the promissory note of the rights  in the Declaration of Independence with ``insufficient funds'' for the  unborn.   As we observe this sad anniversary, let us, once again, restore the  promise of our Declaration of Independence's right to life.   I look forward to greeting constituents at the March for Life.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, commend Congressman Smith for his tireless  advocacy in defending the defenseless.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Abraham), a member of Armed Services Committee; the  Agriculture Committee; and the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.
