 Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize Dr. Judy  Genshaft, a truly outstanding leader whose contributions to the Tampa  Bay area as the sixth president of the University of South Florida have  been unmatched, in my opinion.   President Genshaft has completely transformed USF by helping it  achieve elite status as a preeminent research university. The National  Science Foundation has ranked USF as one of the Nation's top 25  research universities.   Under Judy's leadership, USF has nearly quadrupled its research  portfolio to expand lifesaving research and develop cutting-edge  technologies. The school's success has attracted some of the brightest  young minds to the Tampa Bay area of Florida, growing enrollment by 40  percent, and USF's graduation rate has tripled with Dr. Genshaft at the  helm.   Summarizing the many accomplishments of President Genshaft in just 1  minute is impossible. She is a remarkable woman who has made the Tampa  Bay region a better place. As she prepares to retire, it is my honor to  say congratulations to her.   Go Bulls.                            ____________________
