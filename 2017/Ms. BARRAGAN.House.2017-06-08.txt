 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the  ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act. This bill has a hidden provision that strips away  oversight for payday lenders.   Payday lenders are like loan sharks, charging upwards of 400 percent  interest on loans. It is outrageous. They prey on vulnerable, low- income borrowers who are already struggling to get by.   That is how Yesenia from California got trapped in a cycle of debt.  Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and lost her job, so  Yesenia had to take out a loan just to buy food. The payday lender  garnished her wages and charged sky-high interest rates and fees. She  ended up paying back thousands more than she borrowed, all because she  needed food for her and her mother.   Let's protect our workers and families. Let's not take away oversight  of this abusive loan industry. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 10.  It is the wrong choice.    Madam Speaker, veterans shouldn't have to come home in  a body bag to be recognized as Americans.   Last weekend, I went, along with some of my colleagues, to Tijuana,  Mexico, where we visited veterans who have served this country, who  have picked up a weapon to go and fight in war to protect our freedoms.  They survived, came home, and some of them were deported.   Do you know that if you go and you fight overseas and you are not a  citizen and you die, you get automatic citizenship?   One of those people we saw this weekend is my constituent, Hector  Barajas, from Compton. This is a photo of him. He was proudly still  wearing his uniform. He was deported to Mexico after serving 5\1/2\  years in the U.S. Army, receiving two commendations.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 1405, which would allow noncitizen  veterans who have been deported to come home and come back to the  United States. I hope that he gets to come back, too.
