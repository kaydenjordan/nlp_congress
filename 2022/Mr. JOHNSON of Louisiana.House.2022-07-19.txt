 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the  opportunity. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for handling the  rule and highlighting this very important issue.   As he said, if the previous question is defeated, then Republicans  will amend the rule to immediately consider H. Res. 1233. That is the  resolution that condemns the spate of attacks that have recently  occurred against pro-life facilities, groups, and churches in the wake  of the Dobbs opinion.   Madam Speaker, these acts are reprehensible, but we shouldn't be  surprised they are occurring all across the country. They have gone  unchecked for far too long, ever since the draft Dobbs opinion was  inexcusably leaked to the public in that unprecedented act.    Republicans immediately condemned that leak as a threat to the  institution of the Court itself, as a threat to the Justices themselves  as individuals, and as a threat to our very Republic. The Democrat  leadership of this body did nothing.   Weeks went by as tensions grew. Protesters harassed sitting Supreme  Court Justices, a clear violation of the black-letter Federal Law.  Republicans filed a resolution condemning those acts. The Democrat  leadership of this body did nothing even as threats continued to pour  in against the Justices and their families.   The Senate acted. They unanimously passed legislation to extend  security to the families of the Justices. I and many of my colleagues  repeatedly called upon the Speaker of this House to bring this  resolution to the floor so we could pass it here and send it to the  President's desk. But do you know what we got, Madam Speaker? Nothing.   It was only when an attempt was actually made on the life of Justice  Kavanaugh that the Speaker finally gave in. She finally brought that  legislation to the floor so that we could push back against the angry  mobs.   Madam Speaker, the leadership of this body has another opportunity  before them today to, once again, push back against the mob. This has  gotten out of hand.   Radical leftists were emboldened by the inaction of this body and the  aftermath of a leaked opinion, and now they have targeted their  violence against the very groups that care for women and their unborn  children in their most vulnerable moments. It is unconscionable.   Here is a short list of some examples.   May 3, 2022: Individuals vandalized the Care Net Pregnancy Center in  Frederick, Maryland, with pro-abortion graffiti, including the messages  ``not real clinic,'' ``end forced motherhood,'' and go to Planned  Parenthood instead.   May 5, 2022: Portland, Oregon, vandals smashed numerous windows and  spray-painted graffiti on the Southeast Portland Pregnancy Resource  Center.   May 7, 2022: Activists vandalized a crisis pregnancy center in  Denton, Texas, with the radical pro-abortion messages ``not a clinic''  and ``forced birth is murder.''   May 7, 2022: In Fort Collins, Colorado, activists painted ``my body,  my choice'' on the doors of a Catholic parish.   May 8, 2022, Mother's Day: Individuals attempted to break into the  Oregon Right to Life office in Keizer, Oregon, reportedly igniting and  throwing two Molotov cocktails at the building.   May 8, 2022: Vandals spray-painted pro-abortion messages such as  ``abortion is a right,'' ``fake clinic,'' and ``liars'' on the side of  a pro-life pregnancy center in Manassas, Virginia.   May 8, 2022: A pro-life nonprofit center in Madison, Wisconsin, was  set ablaze and vandalized with the words ``if abortions aren't safe,  then you aren't either.''   May 13, 2022: Activists left threatening messages on the front of the  Alpha Pregnancy Center in Reisterstown, Maryland, including the  messages ``if abortions aren't safe, neither are you,'' ``you're anti- choice, not pro-life,'' et cetera.   May 18, 2022: Vandals targeted a women's faith-based medical clinic  in Auburn, Alabama, defacing the clinic's sign and staff members'  vehicles.   May 25, 2022: In Lynnwood, Washington, anti-life activists smashed  windows and vandalized the Next Step Pregnancy Center with the threat:  ``If abortion isn't safe, you aren't either.''   June 2, 2022: Jane's Revenge claimed credit for an attack in which  its members broke windows and scrawled messages, including ``God loves  abortion'' and ``fake clinic,'' at Agape Pregnancy Resource Center in  Des Moines, Iowa.   June 3, 2022: Capitol Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center here in  Washington, D.C., was the target of leftwing abortion extremists who  threw red paint on the door, threw eggs at the window, and spray- painted the window with ``Jane Says Revenge.''   I have pages and pages of these. I don't think I need to belabor the  point. It is every day now. It is out of control.   I am going to tell you, Madam Speaker, that this last one, July 11,  on the list here, activists vandalized the Women's New Life Clinic in  Baton Rouge, Louisiana, by spray-painting anti-life messages and  ``Jane's Revenge'' on the exterior walls.   That last one is personal to me. The Women's New Life Clinic stands  right next to the abortion provider in Baton Rouge and has offered hope  to countless women over the years. Women's New Life Clinic is doing  extraordinary work. I am proud to call many of the leaders of that  clinic personal friends. They do not deserve the treatment that they  have endured, but they certainly deserve the support of the House of  Representatives in condemning violence from the radical left.   America's pregnancy care centers provide absolutely essential  services in all 50 States. There are 2,700 of these pregnancy centers.  They serve millions of women every year. They are supported by over  10,000 medical professionals. I used to serve as legal counsel to a  number of these groups, so I am telling you this from personal  experience.   Madam Speaker, I can go on all day with these examples. I will spare  you. I would assume that you recognize the obvious.   When will this body stand up against the mob? When will we restore  law and order?   Chuck Schumer stood on the steps of the Supreme Court itself and  infamously called out Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch by name and said  that we would release the whirlwind. Well, here it is. This shouldn't  surprise us.   Madam Speaker, our side is ready to act. We are ready to do  something. We have an obligation and responsibility to do it.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.     Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, a  champion for freedom from Ohio (Mr. Jordan). There is a lot to talk  about here today, but I have to comment on what he just led in with and  this violence that we supposedly all decry. It is a bit of a double  standard, isn't it?   These care pregnancy centers are a vital institution in our country.  They are in all 50 States. There are over 2,700 of these centers doing  vital work every single day. They help millions of American women every  year. They employ and work with over 10,000 medical professionals.   Do you know what their singular goal is?   It is to help women who are in difficult pregnancy situations, to  help care for their unborn children. Who in the world could be opposed  to that?   You know what?   Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke for a lot of our colleagues on the  other side last week. She came out and shrieked they needed to be put  out of business in her State. They needed to get rid of these centers.  It is just incredible.   In the debate on the rule here on this floor in the last couple of  hours, I went down the litany of all those 50 occurrences--at least the  ones we know about, and there are more--where violence has been  perpetrated against these centers--these people who are doing  extraordinary work down in the trenches to help their fellow man.   I ran out of time, I could not list all of them and all of the  vandalism and the destruction and the Molotov cocktails and the hatred  that is spray-painted on the sides of these facilities that are funded,  by the way, by churches and nonprofits and individuals who care about  the sanctity of every single human life in America. Yet, there is just  complete silence on the other side. That is a really sad statement  about where we are.                                time  1230    I used to be legal counsel for a number of those care pregnancy  centers, so I speak to this with personal experience.   Let me get to the issue of the day. This bill is just another  superfluous exercise. This bill is completely and clearly unnecessary.   Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? The sponsors of this bill know that.  They  [[Page H6722]]  know that we are in a very divisive time in the country, and they are  doing this anyway.   This bill is not only unnecessary; it is more of the same. It is yet  another effort to delegitimize the Supreme Court. As Mr. Jordan  explained, they have been doing that in earnest. Senator Schumer went  to the steps of the Supreme Court and infamously called down the  whirlwind on Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch. By the way, it led to a  planned assassination of Justice Kavanaugh, all the lawless protests on  their lawns, threatening their children, and doxing the addresses of  Supreme Court Justices' children. It is just unconscionable. It is  against the law, the plain letter of the law, yet crickets from the  other side.   They want to delegitimize the Court. They tried to pack it. They want  to put four liberal Justices on the Court because they are concerned  about the conservative majority right now. It is a lawless approach and  a lawless response to the lawlessness of the radical left. So, this is  another effort to delegitimize the Supreme Court.   It is also a continued disregard, an utter and total disregard, for  the regular order in this body. I will explain in just a moment why  that is so perilous in a situation like this with a bill like this.   It is also more desperation to focus on anything other than their  policy failures, which Mr. Jordan articulated here a few moments ago.   Nonetheless, there is this bill before us today. Clearly, it is about  simple fear-mongering. This is a partisan bill to make partisan  arguments and to run ads in an election cycle. Do you know why we say  that, Mr. Speaker? Because, as Mr. Jordan said, in the Dobbs opinion,  which supposedly precipitated all this, it is clear if you read the  opinion that this is not only an unnecessary piece of legislation, but  it is divisive and misleading, and they know it. Because why? Anybody  can read the opinion for themselves. Justice Alito wrote the majority  opinion, of course, and he clarified it.   I am a constitutional law attorney. I used to litigate cases about  the Constitution, what it means, and how it should be applied. I did  that for 20 years before I got to Congress. Scarcely is there ever  language this clear written in a Supreme Court opinion.   Let me give you the quote again, Mr. Speaker, in case anybody missed  it, in case you didn't see it or you didn't want to see it. Justice  Alito said in the majority opinion: ``And to ensure that our decision  is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our  decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other  right.'' He continues: ``Nothing in this opinion should be understood  to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.''   Does everybody hear that? I will say that again: ``Nothing in this  opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not  concern abortion.''   Do you know why, Mr. Speaker? Because abortion is a unique area of  the law. Abortion is about taking the life of another unborn person,  another person, so the Court recognized that this is different and  distinct, and everybody knows that. Everybody recognizes that, even  Justice Clarence Thomas, whom they have worked so hard to demonize.   If you look at page 119 of the opinion, Mr. Speaker, you can see it  for yourself. Justice Thomas said: ``The Court's abortion cases are  unique . . . and no party has asked us to decide `whether our entire  Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised' . . .  Thus, I agree that''--and he quotes Justice Alito--nothing in the  Court's opinion ``'should be understood to cast doubt on precedents  that do not concern abortion.'''   That language is so clear. Anybody in this country can read that and  understand obviously and plainly what that means, every civics student,  every child. But, apparently, our friends on the other side don't like  that language, or they don't want to see it, so they have manufactured  this crisis, this demeaning and divisive debate, trying to reopen  Pandora's box that no one has opened except the Democrats.   This is crystal clear. We ought to take a moment to remember, too,  what did not happen after the Obergefell ruling that did happen after  the Dobbs ruling. Did anybody harass Justice Kennedy at his home after  Obergefell was handed down? No. Did conservatives--those who adhere to  the Judeo-Christian heritage of the country, Evangelicals, and  Catholics--did anybody vandalize businesses to promote their own  viewpoints? Absolutely not. Did Republicans call to abolish the  filibuster and add Justices to the Court? No, because we respect the  institutions of this Nation.   But that is exactly what we are seeing from the left: a death threat  on a Justice, endless protests outside the homes of the Justices,  threats on their children, and threats to pack the Court.   Mr. Speaker, we live in an extraordinarily divided time, and  reopening this policy, which is under no threat of any legislative or  judicial body anywhere, seems more like an attempt by Democrats to  stoke fear before the November elections rather than bringing the  country together.   Mr. Speaker, we could use an effort to bring the country together  right now. To that end, since the Democrats refuse to discuss what  Americans are most concerned with, I will take just a moment, since we  have the moment here, to walk through the failures of the Democrat  policies. It is a quick summary. I won't take long on it.   I have been doing townhalls back in my State of Louisiana, and I can  tell you what the people are concerned about, Mr. Speaker.   They are concerned about soaring prices in the grocery store, at the  gas pump, and their mortgages.   They are concerned about uninhibited illegal immigration at the  border and the utter lawlessness that threatens the very sovereignty,  safety, and security of our country.   They are deeply concerned about rising crime in our cities.   They are concerned about the stunning incompetence at the most basic  functions of government from the Biden administration.   These are what I am hearing back home as I travel the district  holding townhalls and talking to constituents. Those constituents sent  us here--the voters, the people--to be their Representatives and to  work on their behalf, to work on behalf of them and their ability to  provide for their families with little government overreach into their  lives.   From economic failures at home to failures on the border, the  Democrats have time and time again refused to work with Republicans on  how to address the issues at hand. Today is just another example. It is  just more of the same. Here we go, from one vote on an unnecessary bill  that is only being used as a distraction from those failures that I  referenced to a vote on a spending bill that will only make those  failures worse.   I mentioned that part of the problem here, too, is the Democrats are  rushing this bill to the floor outside regular order. They just  completely defied regular order. They released the text for this bill  only hours before its consideration in the Rules Committee last night.  Democrats have held no legislative hearing and no markups on this bill.   We serve on the Judiciary Committee. This would have been within our  jurisdiction. They didn't bother to bring it to a committee.   I remember from civics class that they taught us that this is how a  bill becomes a law: You go through the process; you go to the  committee. We shouldn't even teach that to kids anymore because it  doesn't happen here anymore.   But that recklessness, that carelessness, and that defiance of the  rules, order, and tradition here have real consequences because one of  the consequences in the language of this bill, just one by way of  example, is on page 3 of this private right of action clause. It raised  a lot of eyebrows. We didn't have time to analyze that, debate it, and  thoughtfully talk about that approach. Would that declare open season  on religious persons and institutions? I don't know. It is a question a  lot of people are asking today, scratching their heads, but, again, we  had no opportunity to delve into that, to talk about it, and debate it.  Nothing. So, they present this bill, and they drop it on the country.   Again, I just would reiterate, in summary, people back home ask us,  there  [[Page H6723]]  are lots of problems with things that are going on there, but this  particular bill, what is the problem?   I just summarized it by saying that it is unnecessary, divisive, and  misleading. What is worse is that the proponents of the legislation  know that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   We have just been treated to a master class of misinformation. The  Speaker also just said, ``Can you believe they are going after  contraception?''   Give me a break. She knows that is not true. There is not a single  Republican even talking about that or any of these other categories of  the law. This is designed to divide the country. This bill is a  shameful effort at that.   Mr. Nadler, when we were talking about our concerns about the care  pregnancy centers being under assault, to make his case that pro-lifers  are violent, he referenced the terrible murder of Mr. Slepian, an  abortion provider, in 1998. That was a quarter century ago.   We are talking about the last 11 weeks. We have had 50 care pregnancy  centers vandalized, attacked with Molotov cocktails, spray-painted,  threats being made to Supreme Court Justices. There is no equivocation  here at all.   Mr. Cohen implied that the conservative Justices misled the Senate in  their confirmation hearings. We have got the receipts on that. It is  demonstrably untrue.   Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion in Dobbs, said  during his 2006 confirmation that Roe was `` . . . an important  precedent of the Supreme Court.''   ``It was decided in 1973, so it has been on the books for a long  time.''   But he declined to call the ruling ``settled law.''   Justice Thomas, in 1991 in his hearings, he declined to comment on  his views on Roe at all. He said, ``I do not think that at this time  that I could maintain my impartiality as a member of the Judiciary and  comment on that specific case.''   Justice Gorsuch, 2017 confirmation hearings, he said Roe was `` . . .  a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was reaffirmed in Casey in  1992 and in several other cases.''   ``So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme  Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.''   However, he refused to signal how he would rule in future cases on  abortion.   Justice Kavanaugh, 2018 confirmation hearings, echoed Gorsuch by  saying that Roe was an ``important precedent,'' but he indicated during  his confirmation that he would be open to overturning ``settled law,''  including  [[Page H6726]]  Roe, citing a long list of past Supreme Court cases.   Justice Barrett, she was much more reserved on the Roe precedent.    Mr. Speaker, in her confirmation hearings  in 2020, she said she was committed to obeying ``all the rules of stare  decisis,'' promising that ``if a question comes up before me about  whether Casey or any other case should be overruled, that I will follow  the law of stare decisis, applying it as the Court is articulating it,  applying all the factors, reliance, workability, being undermined by  later facts in law, just all the standard factors.'' ``I promise to do  that for any issue that comes up.''   She said that she had to remain neutral on it as an umpire, as they  all did.   The record is clear. The quotes are there. Anybody can Google this.  What they are presenting here on this floor is not true. It is  demonstrably untrue, and they are doing it for partisan purposes. Every  time they talk, they reaffirm our position on that.
