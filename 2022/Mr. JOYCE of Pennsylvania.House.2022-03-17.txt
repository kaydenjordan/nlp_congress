 Madam Speaker, when I first became a  doctor, I made a promise that I would never perform, assist, or support  in any abortion or any abortion procedures. All doctors take an oath.  They swear to first do no harm. I made a promise that I would never  participate in the taking of a human life.   At 10 weeks a baby in their mother's womb has developed a beating  heart. At 11 weeks, the baby will have developed elbows, fingers, and  toes. And at 27 weeks, a baby inside the womb can hear their mother's  voice. It is clear that these children are human--constructed in the  image of God--and worthy of protection and worthy of love.   It is time to protect human life, it is time to protect the unborn,  and it is time to end this egregious practice of abortion.                   Recognizing the Work of Dr. George Hruza     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the work of Dr. George Hruza.   A graduate of New York University, Dr. Hruza went on to complete both  a dermatology residency at New York University Medical Center as well  as a laser surgery fellowship at Harvard Medical School. Later, Dr.  Hruza completed a Mohs and dermatologic surgery fellowship at the  University of Wisconsin-Madison with Dr. Fred Mohs.   Dr. Fred Mohs developed this revolutionary surgery--a technique that  allows for the precise removal and the repair of skin cancer.   Throughout his career, Dr. Hruza has proven himself to be a leader in  the field of dermatology. His tireless commitment to his patients and  their families has undoubtedly saved countless lives.   Dr. Hruza has come to Washington and done skin cancer screenings for  members of staff and Members of Congress--several who might be present  here today.   As the American Academy of Dermatology's president, Dr. Hruza's  relentless advocacy for innovation has helped to shape the way that  skin cancer today is treated in the United States. Skin cancers were  previously deadly. My own grandfather died from skin cancer, a skin  cancer that would be treated today by someone like Dr. Hruza and cured.   It is my privilege to call Dr. George Hruza a leader, a colleague,  and a friend of the United States Congress. As he continues his work as  the United Skin Specialists Missouri director, I wish Dr. Hruza every  continued success; his success in working to treat patients, his  success in developing innovation, and his success as one of the leaders  in dermatology not just in the United States but throughout the world.                            ____________________
