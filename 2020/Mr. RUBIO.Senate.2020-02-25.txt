 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit  at the heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a Florida  small business that not only creates a delicious product, but dedicates  time, effort, and money to serving its community. This week, it is my  pleasure to honor Tally Mac Shack of Tallahassee, FL, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   Despite having a graduate degree in criminology from Florida State  University and a job with a State agency, when the opportunity arose,  Justo Cruz jumped at the chance to pursue his entrepreneurial dream.  After attending a mac-and-cheese fest in 2017, Justo was inspired to  create comfort food with a gourmet twist. Creating social media  accounts and a logo, Justo started Tally Mac Shack that same day. He  traded in his 2006 Nissan Armada for an old Frito-Lay delivery truck,  converting it into the original Tally Mac Shack food truck, where he  experimented with his mac-and-cheese creations.   On October 1, 2017, Tally Mac Shack debuted at a food-tasting event  and sold out within 2 hours. Two-and-a-half years later, Tally Mac  Shack is 30 employees strong, boasts two food trucks, two brick-and- mortar locations, and has established a strong catering presence in the  Tallahassee area. Partnering with his alma mater, Justo established a  brick-and-mortar location on FSU's campus and a concession stand in its  football stadium.   Since its inception, Tally Mac Shack has emphasized the importance of  community service. The business has partnered with local agencies and  organizations to support a variety of causes, including Hurricane  Michael disaster relief and the Down Syndrome Association of Florida.  They have also supported the Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare Cancer  Center, the Kearney Center for the Homeless, and Fort Braden Middle  School. During its summer nonprofit program, Tally Mac Shack donates a  portion of its profit and a free visit from one of its food trucks to a  local organization. Participating groups include Big Bend Hospice,  Alzheimer's Project, Inc., Habitat for Humanity, and the local Humane  Society. Additionally, Justo recently announced that Tally Mac Shack is  an official On the Job Training partner with Leon High School's  culinary program, providing mentorship and job training to local  students.   Combined with community involvement, Tally Mac Shack's modern take on  a culinary classic was a recipe for success and business continues to  boom. Excelling on all fronts, Tally Mac Shack was recognized for its  community service as an inaugural winner of the 2019 All in Tally Award  for going ``above and beyond to make our community a better place to  live.'' Within its first 18 months, Tally Mac Shack was also honored  five times as Tallahassee's best food truck.   Tally Mac Shack is a great example of the pivotal role community- oriented small businesses play in the U.S. economy. I commend their  efforts to provide a quality product, while simultaneously prioritizing  local involvement and training to support local jobs. Congratulations  to the entire team at Tally Mac Shack. I look forward to watching your  continued growth and success.                            ____________________
