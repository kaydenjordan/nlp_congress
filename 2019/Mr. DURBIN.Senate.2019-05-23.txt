 Madam President, let me say how much I agree with the  Senator from Virginia. I endorse completely what he said. I would make  one amendment. Instead of just the compassion approach versus the  criminal approach, it is the commonsense approach versus the criminal  approach as well.   I do believe that the point has been made and demonstrated by what my  colleague said here and what he has said in previous meetings that when  we invest in family planning and sex education and good healthcare for  women, we have fewer unplanned pregnancies and fewer abortions, period.  Those policies that militate against that just increase the likelihood  of abortion.   Let me also add something that I think pro-life and pro-choice should  agree to come to terms with in unity. How in the world can we live in a  country--the United States of America--with all its wealth and all its  expertise, and have in the last 25 years the worst incidence of  maternal mortality in civilized countries around the world? More women  are dying in the United States giving birth today than 25 years ago.  Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, wouldn't you agree this should  be a high priority of our government--both parties--to reduce maternal  mortality here in the United States?   I might add that infant mortality is still unacceptable in the United  States. The rate of it is unacceptable.   Couldn't we agree, pro-life and pro-choice, to come together behind  those two?   I am a cosponsor of a bill introduced by Congresswoman Robin Kelly of  Illinois that she aptly entitled the ``MOMMA Act,'' which will try to  deal with maternal mortality issues, particularly as they relate to  women of color. And the irony, the surprise is that when you read the  data, the incidence of maternal mortality among women of color does not  track with poverty and education. It is a racial issue for reasons that  are hard to explain, but she addresses it, and I have joined her in  that effort.   The other point I would like to make is this: My colleague from  Virginia has talked about efforts in State legislatures that have gone  to extremes. What I call the Alabama two-step is the second step in  that process.   We spend our time day after day, week after week putting men and  women on the bench who were proposed by the Trump administration and  pushed through as quickly as possible by the Republicans in the Senate  who, frankly, are waiting for the day when they will have a chance to  endorse, approve these statutes my colleague has described, which are  extreme by any definition. That, to me, is problematic and troublesome  for us as a nation, that we are moving toward that possibility.   I see that the Senator from South Dakota is on floor, and I believe  he has a request to make.   I would like to ask unanimous consent, after his request, to be  recognized again.    Madam President, I see another colleague on the floor, so  I will make my comments brief.   We had a briefing this week in a room in the Capitol that the public  is not allowed to enter; it is called the SCIF. It was a briefing that  is given to Members of the Senate of top-secret, classified  information. It related to the situation in which we now find ourselves  in relation to Iran.   It was troubling to hear the comments being made by the leaders of  the Trump administration--the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of  State, as well as military leaders and leaders in the intelligence  community.   You see, what we are engaging in in the United States is a  confrontation with Iran. We are moving toward that. It started with  this President's insistence that the United States step away from a  treaty entered into by the Obama administration to stop the development  of nuclear weapons in Iran.   What President Obama succeeded in doing over many years of diplomatic  effort was to come to the table with Iran--an enemy of the United  States on many fronts--and to reach an agreement where there would be  international inspectors with free access to Iran to make certain they  did not develop nuclear weapons. We believed--the world believed that  Iran with nuclear weapons would be a danger to the region, a danger to  our ally Israel, and even a danger to the United States.   The coalition put together by President Obama was nothing short of  remarkable. You wouldn't be surprised to learn the coalition included  the United Kingdom, our traditional ally, but it also included Germany,  France, the European Union, Russia, and China. Russia and China. All  came to the table and agreed on it.   Did it work? International inspectors came and reported to Members of  Congress over and over that there were no locked doors, no areas where  access was denied, and that they could say with virtual certainty that  Iran was living up to the terms of this agreement.   So what did this President, President Trump, decide to do? He  canceled U.S. participation in the agreement. Why? Why would he believe  that the development of nuclear weapons in Iran is in the best interest  of anyone? Yet he did. He followed that with even more provocative  efforts in relation to Iran when it came to categorizing the  Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization--a step that moved even  closer to provocation and confrontation. And then, of course, we  decided to send our own military closer in to Iran itself. A carrier  group was dispatched to that region.   What is behind all this? Why is it that we are escalating the  situation with Iran? The President has been equivocal in trying to  explain it, but his National Security Advisor, John Bolton, has not.  John Bolton is a hawk. His position and his posture when it comes to  military confrontation was so controversial that in a previous  administration, he was denied the position of Ambassador to the United  Nations because of statements he had made. Now he is the top national  security advisor to the President of the United States. He has written  articles pleading for confrontation with Iran on a military basis.   Rumors fly out of the Pentagon--this morning's Washington Post  suggestion that we are already sending 10,000 more military advisors  into the region; a rumor 2 weeks ago that there was a contingency plan  for 120,000 American troops. I might add that the Secretary of Defense,  in my office this morning, denied both of these, but the fact is, more  and more information is tumbling out about a confrontation with Iran.   I will tell you that some of us--a handful of us in the Senate--were  here on the Senate floor when we debated and voted on a war in Iraq. It  was 18 years ago. We were given information by the Bush administration  and particularly Vice President Cheney about the danger of Iraq to the  United States of America, to the point where a vote came to the floor,  and the Senate approved an invasion of Iraq.   I remember that night. I remember it well. Twenty-three of us--one  Republican and twenty-two Democrats--joined together in voting no. It  may have been the most important and maybe the best vote I believe I  ever cast as a Member of the Senate.   It was a foreign policy mistake to invade Iraq. What followed was a  tragedy. We have spent billions and billions of American taxpayers'  dollars in that country. We have lost over 4,000 American lives in  Iraq, and over 30,000 or 40,000 came home with serious injuries,  including my colleague in the Senate, Senator Tammy Duckworth. We have  paid so dearly for that mistake.   The weapons of mass destruction we were sent in to destroy did not  exist. What was told to the American people about the danger of Iraq  was false--false. We are still there today, 18 years later, as we are  in Afghanistan--the two longest wars in the history of the United  States of America. Is there anyone who believed when we voted on the  Senate floor that we were voting for the longest war in the history of  the United States?   Now this administration, the Trump administration, is tempted to draw  us into another war in the Middle East. The question is whether Members  of the Senate and the House of Representatives will abide by the  constitutional responsibility and demand that the American people,  through our voices, have something to say about this decision.   If the American people are ready for a war in Iran, I would be  shocked. As I travel around the State of Illinois and other parts of  this country, I find no sentiment for the United States to engage in  another war at this moment in our history. I also find most people  believing that the provocative and confrontational efforts of the Trump  administration are drawing us nearer to that day.   So we leave now for a week. We will be back, but what will happen in  the 7 or 8 days we are gone? I worry about that based on the briefings  we have been given and the appetite of John Bolton and others in this  administration to move us into war.   We should not invade Iran. We should not engage in another invasion  in the Middle East. We should not subject America's young men and young  women to the possibility of military service in another war that can go  on indefinitely. There are better ways to deal with this. Let's rely on  diplomacy and direct negotiation. Let's work with our allies to bring a  peaceable result here and to stop activity which we know Iran is  engaged in which is objectionable. It can be done short of invasion,  short of military force, and short of war.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from votes number  128 and number 129 due to the birth of my granddaughter, Josephine  Emily Durbin. Had I been present, I would have voted yea to waive the  Budget Act with respect to the emergency spending to help the States  and Territories impacted by storms and other natural disasters. I would  have voted yea on passage of H.R. 2157, as amended by the Shelby-Leahy  substitute amendment, as well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Democrats continue to propose thoughtful,  effective solutions to the humanitarian crisis at our southern border.   In February, after the President finally ended his government  shutdown, I helped write an omnibus appropriations bill that included  $564 million for inspection equipment at ports of entry to detect  lethal narcotics and $414 million for humanitarian assistance at the  border.   Last week, I and a number of my colleagues are reintroducing a  comprehensive bill to address the root causes of the humanitarian  crisis coming out of the Northern Triangle. Our bill cracks down on  cartels and traffickers, provides for in-country processing so that  refugees can seek protection without making a dangerous northbound  journey, expands third-country resettlement in the region, and  eliminates immigration court backlogs.   I note with regret that the President and his political appointees in  the Department of Defense have other priorities. They continue to take  from our military and ignore our military's  [[Page S3093]]  readiness to build the President's medieval wall.   We all remember Donald Trump's idea that we need a 2,000-mile  concrete wall from sea to shining sea and his claim that Mexico would  pay for it. He said it some 200 times on the campaign trail and in the  Oval Office.   When Mexico said no, the President told the military they would have  to pay for it. On February 15, President Trump announced that he would  go around Congress and build the wall with $6.1 billion that Congress  gave to our military. After the announcement, the President was asked  if he had consulted his military advisers first. He said that they told  him some of the tradeoffs, but, ``It didn't sound too important to  me.''   In March, Acting Secretary Shanahan took the first step: taking $1  billion appropriated by Congress for military pay and pensions to use  for the wall. DOD told us that they had more money than they needed  because the Army missed their recruiting goals.   At a hearing that same week, Secretary of the Army Mark Esper  admitted that the Army hadn't budgeted for paying the salaries of the  troops on the border, and they were short $350 million. Why didn't  Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan take this $1 billion of extra  funds and give some to the Army? His notification to Congress laid it  out in disappointing detail. He labeled the wall a ``higher priority.''   It is incredible that these are the priorities of the President and  Acting Secretary Shanahan: wall first, military last.   Then on May 10, Acting Secretary Shanahan did it again, but he took  $1.5 billion from the military this time. The Washington Post headline  the next day said it all: ``Pentagon will pull money from ballistic  missile and surveillance plane programs to fund border wall.''   Once again, the Pentagon claimed that the funds were extra, that the  Pentagon couldn't spend this missile defense money and surveillance  money this year for various reasons. Once again, the ``higher  priority'' was the wall.   But the Army isn't the only one in need. Each military service is  blinking red. Last month, in a leaked memo, the head of the Marine  Corps, General Neller, said that the President's decision was  contributing to ``unacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness  and solvency.''   General Neller noted that the marines had already pulled out of three  military exercises and were cutting back on combat equipment  maintenance because there wasn't enough money to go around. He noted  that Hurricanes Florence and Michael last year had done $3.6 billion in  damage to Camp Lejeune and other Marine Corps property. He said that  marines were living in ``compromised housing,'' with another hurricane  season starting up this June. He also warned that he might also have to  cancel more than a dozen additional exercises if the marines didn't get  budget help. Once again, we are seeing the wall is first, and the  military is last.   In an unusual move late last month, Secretary of the Air Force  Heather Wilson published an op-ed highlighting the impact of several  natural disasters on Air Force bases. In October 2018, Hurricane  Michael inflicted $4.7 billion of damage on Tyndall Air Force Base in  Florida. In March 2019, a historic flood inundated Offutt Air Force  base in Nebraska, submerging dozens of buildings. The Senate continues  to work on an emergency supplemental to make a down payment on repairs  at these bases, as well as at Camp Lejeune, but in the meantime, this  $1.5 billion could have jump started repairs months ago. Once again,  the wall came first, and the military came last.   In each case, the Pentagon didn't ask me to approve these transfers  as it normally does. As vice chair of the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee, I have different priorities, the ones I have mentioned,  and so they went around me and the rest of Congress.   Also still to come is the $3.6 billion from cancelling important  military construction projects. The damage continues to pile up. These  harmful decisions will continue until my Republican colleagues side  with our military over a campaign pledge. I hope they think long and  hard about which one of those is more important.                            ____________________     Mr. President, once again, our Republican colleagues are  spending another week rubberstamping President Trump's extreme  nominees.   Daniel Collins, nominated to a California Ninth Circuit seat,  received a vote over the objection of both of California's Senators.   Before this year, a judicial nominee had never been confirmed over  the objection of both home State Senators. Mr. Collins's confirmation  marked the sixth time it has happened this year.   This Republican Senate has effectively killed the blue slip for  circuit court nominations. This is a precedent that could come back to  haunt each of our States. My Republican colleagues who are voting  repeatedly to override home State Senators' objections may come to  regret those votes someday.   I opposed the Collins nomination. I agree with Senators Feinstein and  Harris that Collins has ``a history of taking strong litigation  positions for no reason other than attempting to overturn precedent and  push legal boundaries.''   I am particularly troubled by his extensive representation of the  tobacco industry and his inadequate recusal commitment when it comes to  matters involving his former tobacco industry clients.   The district court nominees scheduled for votes this week also have a  long history of advancing extreme ideological views.   When it comes to abortion, North Carolina district court nominee  Kenneth Bell once wrote in an op-ed, ``There is no middle ground.''  Missouri district court nominee Stephen Clark has spent much of his  legal career litigating against reproductive rights and access to  contraceptives.   Utah district court nominee Howard Nielson wrote a memo for the  Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, arguing that the Geneva  Conventions, which prohibit torture, do not apply to civilians captured  abroad.   DC district nominee Carl Nichols has advanced extreme views of  Executive power, including arguing that Presidents and Presidential  aides have absolute immunity from congressional process.   I opposed these extreme nominees, and I regret that the Senate's  advice and consent process has become an exercise in Republican  rubberstamping. This institution can and should do better.                            ____________________
