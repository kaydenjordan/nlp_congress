 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott for  yielding and for being a strong partner over the years in recognizing  the importance of investing in America's workforce development.   While we look to the robust apprenticeship systems of Switzerland,  the U.K. and other countries, we know that the United States has the  potential to have our own unique, highly effective environment for a  mentor-led workforce. And today we can put resources behind our need to  match employers addressing community needs with our constituents who  seek skills and education.   At a time when many workers have been forced to look for new pathways  to financial stability, we have a responsibility as Members of Congress  to expand employment opportunities that provide meaningful work and  family-supporting wages.   The legislation under consideration today will do just that.   We have had many conversations in our Education and Labor Committee  about providing high quality educational pathways, and I appreciate the  work of the ranking member on that  [[Page H5968]]  regard. And we have spent much time together talking about this issue.   But I want to go on to pinpoint those issues that have to be  included. The educational pathways that we know do not require a 4-year  college degree that allow people to earn while they learn. Makes sense.  And provide nationally portable and recognized credentials.   We have tirelessly worked for months with our Republican colleagues  to make sure this legislation achieves these goals.   This past March, just before the world changed as we know it, we made  public a draft of this legislation that was open for feedback. We were  able to incorporate comments from over 20 groups and stakeholders. And  this legislation also incorporated feedback from the bipartisan  hearings and round tables we had with employers and apprenticeship  stakeholders.    One of the legislation's primary goals is to ensure that people  across the country are speaking the same language regarding  apprenticeships.   It is designed to demonstrate that apprenticeships are an equal,  high-quality, post-secondary, prestigious alternative to the  traditional 2- or 4-year college degrees.   Of great interest, this bill codifies youth apprenticeships as  opportunities that prepare high school students for post-secondary  education, much like advanced placement classes.   We have already seen how a small investment from the Federal  Government results in enormous returns. In 2017, the insurance company  Aon started their business in Chicago with only two employees and 25  apprentices. Now, they have over 50 employees and over 750 apprentices  all across the country. In fact, they have announced the expansion of  their Chicago apprenticeship network to cities and employers across the  country who are following their lead in looking at registered  apprenticeship credentials as alternatives to a 4-year degree.                                time  1530    But here is the key. As the CEO of AON himself stated: ``The biggest  obstacle to success at scale is not in finding a qualified supply of  talent, it is incenting employers to create the demand for quality,  career-track jobs that look beyond traditional hiring practices,''  which is precisely what this bill sets out to do.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from AON's CEO Greg  Case highlighting their and other employers' excitement about the  expansion of the registered apprenticeship system and demonstrating how  many firms have not only not been hindered by the current registered  system, but rather are enormous beneficiaries of it.                                                             Aon,                                     Chicago, IL, November 16, 2020.      Hon. Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education and Labor, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: Thank you for your leadership and       support in the effort to grow apprenticeship programs across       the country. Our employees are the foundation of our company       and young people across the country are the future of our       workforce. Finding a way to both create opportunity and by       doing so, reach the best talent, is a challenge we can all       embrace. We are very proud that the apprentice model we       created in Chicago in 2017 with two employers and 25       apprentices has grown to 43 employers and over 750       apprentices--it proves that talent plus opportunity equals       success.        Because of the success of the Chicago Apprentice Network       and the positive impact this talent strategy has had for our       firm, Aon announced yesterday that we will be expanding our       Apprenticeship commitment to seven cities across the United       States supported by an investment of $30 million over the       next five years.        Aon will initiate the Apprenticeship program expansion next       year in the metropolitan areas of Chicago, Houston,       Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco and       Washington, D.C. Along with this expansion, Aon will lead the       development of a nationwide network of employers to create       10,000 new apprenticeships across the United States by 2030.        This development of apprenticeships in the office and       corporate sector allows a model that has been successful in       the trades--earning while you learn--to expand to fast       growing areas of the economy. And like other successful       apprenticeship programs, ours are and will continue to be,       registered with the Department of Labor to ensure quality of       both training and work.        We live in a world of rapid change and increased volatility       in the economy and the job market. In building the workforce       of the future, the biggest obstacle to success at scale is       not in finding a qualified supply of talent, it is incenting       employers to create the demand for quality, career track jobs       that look beyond traditional hiring practices. By creating a       working model that has grown across industries, we can show       others the path to success in creating apprentice programs in       the corporate sector.        Aon's apprenticeship program has brought so many talented       colleagues to our firm and we know it has tremendous       potential to create similar opportunities and professional       networks for both apprentices and participating employers       across the United States.        We thank you again for your efforts and stand ready to       assist in the expansion of our model to communities across       the United States as we create the workforce of the future.            Best,                                                         Greg Case.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Scott for yielding  me the additional time.   We all talk a good game in wanting to build this economy and build  opportunities for our constituents who do not want to pursue a 4-year  degree, but we haven't put financial muscle and know-how behind  creating these valued credentials that employees seek.   In closing, I want to make one point, that this legislation only  codifies the standards for programs that have registered for access to  the credentials and funding provided for in this bill. Unregistered  workforce programs that do not want access to this bill's resources  will not need to change their programs.   We are simply strengthening the known registered apprenticeship  system that is in place today with more clearly established programs.  Families can sit down at the kitchen table, discuss their futures, and  look to the rejuvenated registered apprenticeship system as one of many  high-quality pathways to post-secondary education.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
