 Madam Speaker, due to flight delay issues, I was unable  to vote in support the following votes.   Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 683,  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 684, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 685, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 686, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 687.                            ____________________
