 Madam President, today we expect the House of  Representatives will pass the 2-year government funding agreement the  Trump administration and Speaker Pelosi announced earlier this week. I  stand with the President, who has publicly expressed his support for  the agreement on several occasions. I am grateful to the members of his  administration who led the negotiations: Secretary Mnuchin, Acting  Chief of Staff Mulvaney, and Acting OMB Director Vought.   Considering the circumstances of divided government, this is a good  deal. After the House approves it today with bipartisan support, I  expect the Senate to do the same next week. Here is why it is a good  deal: It achieves the No. 1 goal on the Republican side of the aisle of  providing for the common defense and continuing our progress in  rebuilding the Armed Forces of the United States and modernizing them  so they can continue to keep Americans safe and project power for years  to come. This has been a top shared priority for this Republican Senate  and this Republican White House for 2\1/2\ years.   Pentagon leaders need stable, reliable, and sufficient resources. The  greatest military on Earth should not drift in uncertainty. Our  servicemembers deserve better than a string of funding crises and  continuing resolutions. Our commanders need predictable resources and  sufficient resources to lay the foundations for the future of our  national defense.   Servicemembers deserve to deploy armed with state-of-the-art training  and cutting-edge equipment; their families deserve the best support  services the Nation can offer; and the Nation as a whole deserves the  global presence that is up to snuff and competitive with the leaps  forward in which our adversaries have invested heavily.   That is why we have delivered historic increases in resources for  modernization and DOD reforms--to ensure the U.S. military is strong  and agile enough to confront a growing number of threats to America and  our interests. That is why just a few months ago we authorized the  largest year-on-year increase in defense funding in more than a decade.  This funding agreement is the next step forward in that process.   Every Member of this body knows the threats we face are serious and  getting more serious: the resurgence of great power competition with  nations like Russia and China; the destabilization of influence of  state-sponsored terror and regional aggression from bad actors such as  Iran; and the testing of historic alliances.   Amidst the growing international chaos, the preeminent obligation of  the U.S. government is to provide for the common defense. This  agreement prioritizes that commitment to the safety and the security of  the American people.   A nation that understands these threats and takes them seriously  makes serious investments in the readiness of its own defenses today  and the modernization that will preserve their strength into the  future.   For years, we have seen China extend its strategic reach, testing the  waters of the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.  [[Page S5074]]  We have watched its Communist leadership nearly double military  spending in the last decade and push the boundaries in everything from  offshore territorial claims to 5G technology.   America's edge is in jeopardy. Our allies in the Pacific are uneasy.  The administration's budget agreement with the Speaker will allow  America to ensure that our own foot stays on the gas pedal as well.   Meanwhile, in the Middle East, we are confronted daily with  escalating threats to our allies and interests. State-sponsored terror  and proxy actions are becoming bolder. Gray zone activity in places  like the Straits of Hormuz is raising the economic and geopolitical  stakes of Iran's meddling.   From Syria to Crimea, Russia continues to stretch its legs. Not since  the height of the Soviet Union have we seen Moscow this focused on  extending influence beyond its borders. All over the world, historic  alliances and partnerships like NATO need to be strengthened and  renewed for this new landscape.   Fortunately, in the coming days, we will have the opportunity to  address all these areas--Europe, the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific, and  beyond. That opportunity is this bipartisan spending agreement. So I am  grateful to the administration for ensuring that such robust funding  for our national security is included in this package. It will make us  safer worldwide and make needed investments in our own facilities right  here at home, like Fort Knox, Fort Campbell, and the Blue Grass Army  Depo, which Kentucky is proud to host.   What is more, I commend the President's team for firmly holding the  line on the laundry list of leftwing policy riders that some House  Democrats had sought to push throughout their partisan appropriations  process over there on the other side.   We are talking about far-left wish list items, things like reversing  the Trump administration's decision and getting title X taxpayer  dollars flowing back into the pocket of Planned Parenthood, weakening  the conscience rights of healthcare professionals, removing protections  for the Second Amendment, and efforts that would have weakened ICE and  defunded the President's efforts to secure our border.   These are just some of the policy riders the far left had hoped to  smuggle into the appropriations process--perhaps using the full faith  and credit of the United States as leverage, but the administration  froze all of them out. They are not in this deal. They shepherded an  agreement that delivers on our most basic responsibility to the  American people. They set the stage to provide for the common defense.  Today it is the House's turn to follow through, and then, in the near  future, it will be ours.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk that is due a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what my  friend the Democratic leader is asking unanimous consent to pass is  partisan legislation from the Democratic House of Representatives  relating to American elections. This is the same Democratic House that  made its first big priority in this Congress a sweeping partisan effort  to rewrite all kinds of the rules of American politics--not to achieve  greater fairness but to give themselves a one-sided political benefit.   The particular bill the Democratic leader is asking to move by  unanimous consent is so partisan that it received one--just one-- Republican vote over in the House. Clearly, this request is not a  serious effort to make a law. Clearly, something so partisan that it  only received one single solitary Republican vote in the House is not  going to travel through the Senate by unanimous consent.   It is very important that we maintain the integrity and security of  our elections in our country. Any Washington involvement in that task  needs to be undertaken with extreme care and on a thoroughly bipartisan  basis. Obviously, this legislation is not that. It is just a highly  partisan bill from the same folks who spent 2 years hyping up a  conspiracy theory about President Trump and Russia and who continue to  ignore this administration's progress in correcting the Obama  administration's failures on this subject in the 2018 election;  therefore, I object.    I object.    Madam President, for the information of all of our  colleagues, I want to provide an update on the remaining items the  Senate needs to complete before we adjourn for the August State work  period.   Here is what we need to accomplish before Members depart next week:  We need to confirm well-qualified nominees to two open positions of  utmost importance--the Deputy Secretary of Defense and our Ambassador  to the U.N. These jobs are important, the nominees are impressive, and  we need to confirm David Norquist and Kelly Craft next week.   Obviously, we need to pass the bipartisan funding agreement that  President Trump's negotiating team worked out with Speaker Pelosi. The  House will pass it today. The President is strongly in support of it.  The Senate needs to pass it and put it on the President's desk next  week.   We need to make more headway on the backlog of qualified judicial  nominees who are waiting for confirmation, so next week we will also  need to process a significant, bipartisan package of district court  nominees.   That is our to-do list for next week--the Deputy Secretary of  Defense, the U.N. Ambassador, the bipartisan government funding  agreement, and a significant group of well-qualified judges. Not bad  for a week's work. That is what the Senate will accomplish before we  adjourn for August.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 119.
