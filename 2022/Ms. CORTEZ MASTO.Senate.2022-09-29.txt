 Mr. President, today I recognize Mylan Barin  Hawkins, who passed away on August 26, 2022. Mylan devoted her life to  serving others and made invaluable contributions to the State of  Nevada. She was a dedicated political and social activist who fought to  advance women's rights and advocated for healthcare for women and  children.   Mylan was born in Chicago, IL, and attended the University of  Chicago. Mylan was involved in Chicago Ward Boss politics before moving  to Florida, where she founded Project Survival after giving birth to a  premature son. Project Survival helped build a neonatal center at the  University of Miami Jackson Memorial Hospital. Mylan was driven by her  passion to work on women's and children's healthcare. She served on  nonprofits and advocacy campaigns wherever she went. She helped raise  funds for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and for the Sloan  Kettering Memorial Hospital in New York.   In 1976, Mylan settled in Reno, NV, and immediately set to work to  advance women's rights in the State. Mylan joined the National  Organization for Women in their mission to ratify the Equal Rights  Amendment. Along the way, Mylan helped pass ground-breaking legislation  and ballot initiatives in the State. Mylan also cofounded the Nevada  and California Diabetes Association, an organization focused on  providing local services including camps, teen, family and adult  support programs, and emergency medical information and referral  services.   In the late 1980s, Mylan and her colleagues realized the dangers  ahead for reproductive freedom. They worked tirelessly to draft a State  ballot referendum protecting Nevada women's reproductive rights, which  passed in 1990. Mylan continued to advocate for women's rights and was  in her late 70s when she launched the 2016 Women's March in Reno,  gathering thousands of supporters. Mylan also helped found Northern  Nevada Marches Forward, an inclusive volunteer led nonprofit with a  mission to support, spotlight, and uplift the voices and power of  diverse people and communities to create transformative social change.   Mylan's tenacity and courage are a testament to the grit and spirit  of Nevada women, and her legacy lives on in the countless women and  activists she has inspired and mentored across the State. Her service  and dedication to her country, community, and her family will not be  forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  100th anniversary of the Nevada Taxpayers Association.   In 1922, Nevadans started the organization that would become the  Nevada Taxpayers Association, NTA. From its first office located in the  Reno National Bank Building, the small organization has continued to  work on behalf of Nevada taxpayers. It is now one of the oldest  governmental research and advocacy associations, not only in Nevada but  in the United States.   Today, the NTA is a renowned tax policy and analysis organization,  providing valuable service to the citizens of the Silver State. NTA  advocates on behalf of Nevada's working families for policies that  promote efficiency, accountability and common sense. NTA ensures State  and local lawmakers have the data and expert analysis to craft fair tax  policy, including by providing the public with ``Tax Facts,'' a digest  of tax history dating back nearly 50 years.   NTA had the foresight to advocate with the Nevada Legislature to  establish a rainy day fund to insulate the State budget from dramatic  swings that sometimes resulted in tough choices and devastating cuts to  critical services such as education and healthcare. There are many  examples of NTA raising difficult issues that required legislators  across the aisle to work together. From helping establish the Nevada  Gaming Law in the 1930s, to developing a ``computers for schools  program'' for Nevada's public school system, the association has played  an active role in fiscal policy analysis and research that has  strengthened our State for the benefit of every Nevadan.  [[Page S5537]]    Congratulations to the Nevada Taxpayers Association on its 100th  anniversary and for supporting good government in Nevada. I look  forward to its continued success.                            ____________________
