 Madam Speaker, just yesterday, the squad and other  Democrats reintroduced the socialist Green New Deal.   This dangerous proposal costs over $90 trillion and will destroy  thousands of American jobs. But Speaker Pelosi and President Biden have  no intention of stopping it. In fact, they are planning to use their  partisan infrastructure package as a vehicle to enact several Green New  Deal priorities.   While details of what they consider infrastructure, and I use that  term loosely, are not finalized, it does not inspire confidence that  the Democrats are already turning away from regular order, which  requires bipartisanship to get the bill through Congress.   Here is what we know about the package so far. It advances $600  billion to Green New Deal priorities. Only 5 percent will go toward  roads and bridges and 2 percent for airways, waterways, and ports. They  are planning the largest tax hike since 1968 to pay for their agenda,  and an estimate from the National Association of Manufacturers shows  that their proposed corporate tax hike would cost 1 million jobs.                            ____________________
