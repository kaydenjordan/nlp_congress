 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 140.   As has been pointed out, buried in section 3 of this otherwise  noncontroversial water and lands bill is the text of H.R. 986, the  Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act. This nongermane provision would strip  thousands of employees of their rights and protections under the  National Labor Relations Act at Tribal enterprises located on Tribal  lands.   At issue in the Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act are two solemn and  deeply rooted principles:   First, the right that Indian Tribes possess in matters of local self- governance;   Second, the rights of workers to organize unions, bargain  collectively, and engage in concerted activities for mutual aid and  protection.   Rather than attempting to balance these two important principles, the  bill chooses sovereignty for some over the human rights of others. I  would note that the approximately 75 percent of workers employed at  Tribal casinos are not members of the Tribes running the casino, but  this bill would strip labor rights of hundreds of thousands of these  workers as well as those who are actually members of the Tribes.   In doing so, this legislation would abandon the carefully drawn  balance between Tribal sovereignty and workers' rights that was adopted  in the San  [[Page H116]]  Manuel decision by a Republican-led National Labor Relations Board in  2004. Perhaps prompted by litigation, the board ruled that the National  Labor Relations Act will only apply if it does not impact the exclusive  rights of self-governance in purely intramural matters or abrogate  rights guaranteed by treaties.   The San Manuel decision is based on legal principles governing  Federal laws of general applicability with respect to Indian Tribes  that have been upheld by appeals courts for over 30 years. That is why  courts have ruled that Tribes must comply with labor and employment  laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; the Occupational Safety and  Health Act; the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA; and the  employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act.   Yet this bill singles out the National Labor Relations Act on the  grounds that Tribes must be given parity with State and local  governments which statutorily are exempt from the NLRA. Maybe States  and localities should have been considered, but the statutes are clear  that they are exempt.   This is not a reason why Tribes should be exempt from an otherwise  generally applicable law. Furthermore, State and local governments are  covered under title VII of the Civil Rights Act; whereas, Tribes are  expressly exempt.   For employees of Tribal enterprises, therefore, unions are the sole  protection under Federal law against discrimination, including sexual  harassment, because they can negotiate a collective bargaining  agreement that enforces employees' rights to be free from such conduct.   Democrats and Republicans together have insisted that our trading  partners abide by and enforce basic labor rights anytime we do a trade  deal. And Congress has repeatedly required these obligations in trade  agreements, but today the House will vote on a bill that takes away the  assurance that employees have for the freedom of association if they  are employed in many Tribal casinos.   This creates a fair question: Would this legislation place the United  States Government in breach of any of the trade agreements that are now  in effect? According to the International Labor Organization, in an  opinion on a similar bill a few years ago, it would, in fact, put us in  breach of trade agreements.   We should be able to fashion compromises that, frankly, protect both  workers' rights and Tribal sovereignty, but what is before us today  fails that test. There is no principled basis for stripping hundreds of  thousands of workers from the right to join a union and negotiate  better wages simply because they happen to work in a commercial  enterprise on Tribal lands.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan), the ranking  member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 10, 2018, on page H116, the following appeared: from the  Northern Marianna Islands      The online version has been corrected to read: from the Northern  Mariana Islands    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.

Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter in opposition to the  bill from the AFL-CIO.                         AFL-CIO Legislative Alert           American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial             Organizations,                                   Washington, DC, January 9, 2018.        Dear Representative: The AFL-CIO urges you to oppose the       Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act, H.R. 986, which would deny       protection under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to a       large number of workers employed by tribal-owned and -      operated enterprises located on Indian land. Among these       workers are over 600,000 tribal casino workers, the vast       majority of whom are not Native Americans. In recent years,       the number and type of enterprises affected has grown well       beyond the gaming industry, and would now include mining       operations, power plants, smoke shops, saw mills,       construction companies, ski resorts, high-tech firms, hotels,       and spas. Many of these are commercial businesses that       compete with non-Indian enterprises. As proposed, the Tribal       Labor Sovereignty Act would strip all workers in these       enterprises of their rights and protections under the NLRA.        The House bill, introduced by Representative Rokita, would       overturn a decision by the National Labor Relations Board       (NLRB) in San Manuel Indian Bingo & Casino, 341 NLRB No. 138       (2004), which applied the NLRA to a tribal casino enterprise.       In San Manuel, the NLRB looked to Supreme Court and circuit       court precedent to articulate a test for whether the NLRB       should assert jurisdiction over tribal enterprises, whether       located on tribal lands or outside them. (Before San Manuel,       NLRB jurisdiction was determined based solely on location: On       tribal land, the NLRB would forego jurisdiction; off tribal       land, the NLRB would assert jurisdiction. Under the San       Manuel test, the NLRA will not apply if its application would       ``touch exclusive rights of self-governance in purely       intramural matters.'' Nor will the NLRA apply if it would       ``abrogate Indian treaty rights.'' The Board in San Manuel       also considered other factors, including whether the casino       in question was a typical commercial enterprise, employed       non-Native Americans, and catered to non-Native American       customers.        In San Manuel, the Board concluded that applying the NLRA       would not interfere with the tribe's autonomy, and the       effects of the NLRA would not ``extend beyond the tribe's       business enterprise and regulate intramural matters.''       However, the test articulated in San Manuel provides a       careful balancing of tribal sovereignty interests with the       NLRA's federal labor law protections. In a companion case,       Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corp., 341 NLRB No. 139 (2004), the       Board tipped the balance the other way and didn't assert       jurisdiction.        The AFL-CIO supports the principle of sovereignty for       tribal governments, but does not believe that employers       should use this principle to deny workers their collective       bargaining rights and freedom of association. While the AFL-      CIO continues to support the concept of tribal sovereignty in       truly internal, self-governance matters, it is in no position       to repudiate fundamental human rights that belong to every       worker in every nation. Workers cannot be left without any       legally enforceable right to form unions and bargain       collectively in instances where they are  [[Page H124]]       working for a tribal enterprise which is simply a commercial       operation competing with non-tribal businesses.        The International Labour Organization (ILO), an agency of       the United Nations, has confirmed this view in response to a       question about whether excluding (from the NLRA) workers       employed on tribal lands would conform with principles of       freedom of association. These values are at the core of the       ILO Constitution and the ILO's Declaration on Fundamental       Principles and Rights at Work. The Director for the       International Labour Standards Division wrote that in the       absence of tribal ordinances offering full protection of       internationally recognized rights, ``it is critical that the       State (the national authority) takes ultimate responsibility       for ensuring respect for freedom of association and       collective bargaining rights throughout its territory.'' In       other words, if the tribes themselves don't guarantee these       basic rights--and many do not, the U.S. government must not       abdicate its responsibility to protect them.        Notwithstanding the importance of the principle of tribal       sovereignty, the fundamental human rights of employees are       not the exclusive concern of tribal enterprises or tribal       governments. In fact, the vast majority of employees of these       commercial enterprises, such as casinos, are not Native       Americans. They therefore have no voice in setting tribal       policy and no recourse to tribal governments for the       protection of their rights.        The AFL-CIO opposes any effort to exempt on an across-the-      board basis all tribal enterprises from the NLRA, without       undertaking a specific review of all the circumstances--as       current NLRB standards provide. Where the enterprise employs       mainly Native American employees with mainly Native American       customers, and involves self-governance or intramural       affairs, leaving the matter to tribal governments may be       appropriate. However, where the business employs primarily       non-Native American employees and caters to primarily non-      Native American customers, there is no basis for depriving       employees of their rights and protections under the National       Labor Relations Act.            Sincerely,                                          William Samuel, Director,                                     Government Affairs Department.     Mr. Speaker, a lot has been said about State  and local being exempt and Tribes not being exempt. Well, that was a  decision made way back when. The law specifically exempts State and  local. Maybe it should; maybe it didn't; but it did. Tribes were not  specifically exempted.   So in conclusion, this bill will strip hundreds of thousands of  employees of the right to join a union. Where some Tribes have Tribal  labor ordinances that are fair and workable, others do not. And at  least one expressly prohibits the formation of unions.   There is no principal basis for excluding these workers from coverage  under labor law just because they happen to work in a commercial  enterprise on Tribal lands. If this bill will come into law, it will be  the first rollback of workers' rights under Federal law in over 70  years, and it may well place the United States in violation of several  international trade agreements.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
