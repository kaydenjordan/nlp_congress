 Madam Speaker, on the second day of SALT, my  constituents have said to me that they send more money to Washington  and get back less than almost any other State in the country. The SALT  cap compounds the attack on New Jersey, forcing our residents to send  even more money to Washington without a return on that investment.   For every dollar New Jersey sent to Washington in 2017, we got back  only 82 cents. That puts us in 49th place, almost dead last in State  return on Federal tax dollars. And this was before the Federal  Government stripped the full SALT deduction.   Meanwhile, States like Kentucky got back $2.35 for every dollar they  sent to Washington. That is nearly three times what New Jersey gets.   The 2017 tax bill unfairly targets States like mine that pay more  than their fair share. We fund projects in Kentucky and do not see that  same investment, say, on things like infrastructure, for example, in  our State.   We need to restore the SALT deduction cap and keep money in the  pockets of New Jerseyans so we can continue to power the Nation's  economy.                            ____________________
