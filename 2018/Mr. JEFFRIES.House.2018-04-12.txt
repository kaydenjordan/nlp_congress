 Mr. Speaker, the so-called balanced budget amendment is  nothing but a phony, fraudulent, and fake effort to promote fiscal  responsibility.   I am perplexed by the notion that my good friends on the other side  of the aisle would come to the House floor to lecture the American  people about the budget when their actions are primarily responsible  for the situation in which we find ourselves.   How did we arrive at a moment where, in this country, we confront a  crippling $20 trillion debt when the Clinton administration handed the  Bush administration a budget surplus?   I am glad you asked that question.   Number one, a failed war in Iraq, brought to us by a Republican  administration;   Number two, an unnecessarily prolonged conflict in Afghanistan,  brought to us by a Republican administration;   Number three, the Bush tax giveaways of 2001, brought to us by a  Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican President;   Number four, the 2003 Bush tax giveaway, brought to us by a  Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican President;   Number five, the collapse of the economy in 2008, brought to us by  Republican-inspired financial deregulation;   Number six, the Republican tax scam of 2017 that will explode our  debt by an additional $2 trillion.   Republicans burn down our fiscal house and then show up with a so- called balanced budget amendment and act like the volunteer fire  department.   I am from Brooklyn. I know a hustle when I see one. We will not allow  anyone to balance the budget on the backs of working families, middle  class folks, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted,  veterans, and rural America. We will not allow anyone to devastate  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   The American people deserve a better deal.
