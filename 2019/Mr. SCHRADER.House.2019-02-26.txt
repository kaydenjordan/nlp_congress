 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the Natural  Resources Management Act, a bipartisan package that includes my bill,  the Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.   This legislation would designate over 21 miles of the Molalla River  as wild and scenic, a Federal designation that will permanently ensure  its protection and preservation as one of Oregon's many national State  treasures.   The idea to designate the Molalla River as a wild and scenic  recreational river was initiated over 12 years ago by Molalla residents  who were looking to preserve and protect their river. Mr. Speaker, I  want to acknowledge and thank these community partners, chief among  them the Molalla River Alliance, American Rivers, Molalla River Watch,  Northwest Steelheaders, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and  the city of Molalla.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize the efforts of a few key  individuals: Mike Moody, John Atkins, Jack Hammond, Mike Clarke, Kay  Patterson, Craig Roberts, Bill Taylor, David Moryc, Bob Rees, and,  frankly, so  [[Page H2216]]  many others who have worked tirelessly on this project. It is because  of their hard work that the cultural, historical, and recreational  benefits of the Molalla River will be protected for generations to  come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the Natural Resources Management Act.
