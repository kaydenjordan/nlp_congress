 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Make America  Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act that the House is considering.  This bill is a package of legislation that the Appropriations Committee  has diligently worked on over the last several months that will fund  our domestic and national security priorities.   This is legislation that prioritizes conservative policies, invests  in proven and effective programs, and reduces unnecessary and wasteful  spending. It will fund the government in a fiscally responsible way,  keeping a lid on spending as we have since taking the House majority in  2010.   It will continue our work of rolling back burdensome, job-killing  policies to help our economy grow even faster than we have seen over  the last 7 months when we have added more than 1 million jobs.   It includes many items that the House has already passed this summer,  like the largest pay raise for our troops in 8 years and the most  funding to care for our veterans in our Nation's history.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure to keep our  government functioning efficiently and effectively for the American  people.                            ____________________
