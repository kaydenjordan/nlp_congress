 Mr. President, I come to the floor to take a few minutes  to address the deeply harmful bill House Republicans announced  yesterday to be put in place, TrumpCare. Since the election, I have had  constituent after constituent come up to me with tears in their eyes  wondering what the future holds for their healthcare. They are worried  about losing coverage, wondering how they are going to make ends meet  if their premiums spike, and they are worried that without protections  laid out in the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies will once  again have more power to decide what kinds of care are and are not  covered.   My constituents and people across the country were listening when  President Trump said he would provide ``insurance for everybody'' that  would be higher quality and lower cost. They heard Senate Republicans  say it is important any new healthcare plan ``do no harm.'' They even  saw House Republicans reassure them that they wouldn't ``pull the rug  out'' from under anyone on ObamaCare.   This legislation that has now been rolled out represents a broken  promise to patients and families. It will leave them sicker, more  vulnerable to the chaos Republicans are creating within our healthcare  system, and less financially secure. Millions of people who only just  gained Medicaid coverage will lose it. Premiums could increase as much  as 30 percent for people who lose coverage because they are too sick to  work or become unemployed. People struggling with mental illness and  substance abuse disorders, including opioid addiction, which is  ravaging States nationwide, may find their insurance no longer has to  cover the treatment they need. Key public health programs that families  across the country rely on would be slashed.   TrumpCare would be a disaster for our workers and our families, but  let's be clear about whom it does work for: those at the top. TrumpCare  not only harms the same workers and families Republicans promised to  help, it does so in order to reduce the tax burden for the wealthiest  and for the insurance companies. In fact, this bill even includes a  payout for insurance company executives. This is the definition of  taking our healthcare system backward.   I also want to make it clear what TrumpCare will mean specifically  for women. As someone who has fought time after time to protect women's  ability to make their own healthcare decisions, I can tell you, this  bill is a wish list by and for the extreme politicians who insist on  telling women what to do with their own bodies. It will defund Planned  Parenthood. It will undermine key protections for women's healthcare  that were included in the Affordable Care Act. By slashing Medicaid,  this bill will take coverage away from low-income women and women of  color who disproportionately rely on Medicaid to get the care they  need.   I cannot oppose this bill more strongly, and I am going to be doing  everything I can to fight back against it. I know Senate Democrats are  ready to do so as well, and I urge any Republican who is truly  concerned about their constituent's health, their well-being, and their  financial security, rather than just partisan politics, to do the right  thing and join us.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.                      Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare     Mr. President, I come to the floor actually on behalf of  students across the country, and for those who are so passionate about  their education that they want to dedicate themselves to teaching, and  to urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and support strong and  accountable teacher preparation in America today.   While this rule may not be the rule that any of us would have written  on our own, it is important.   Let me say at the outset that there are many great teacher prep  programs that exist around our country, and they are doing a great job  preparing our teachers to succeed in the classroom, but there are also  teacher preparation programs out there that are struggling and need  support to help make sure they produce great teachers for our schools.   Now, as a former preschool teacher and as a mom, I know how important  it is to have great teachers in our classrooms, and I understand how a  good education, with an amazing teacher, can change a child's life. I  am sure all of our colleagues think back on that one special teacher  they had who shaped their mind and changed their life. They teach us  not only how to read and write and do arithmetic, but good teachers  teach us how to think critically, how to be creative, how to form an  argument. I know I am not alone in saying that I owe much of what I  have to the quality of the public education I received growing up, and  I have spent my career fighting to make sure every child in America has  the same opportunity I did.   Unfortunately, too many teaching students today are forced to take  out huge amounts of student loans to afford continuing their education  so they can realize their dream. They are willing to make this  sacrifice. They don't complain. The very least we can do for those who  want to become teachers is to make sure they are actually getting their  money's worth when they make an investment in themselves.   That is what this rule does. It helps make sure students can make  informed decisions about the quality and preparedness of their  education.   Here are a few of the ways this rule does that--and I am hoping my  colleagues will see that this shouldn't be controversial. This rule  strengthens and streamlines reporting requirements of teacher prep  programs to focus on employment placement and retention of  graduates. It provides information from employers to future teacher  candidates so they can make an informed decision about their education  by choosing a school that improves the likelihood they will find  employment after graduation. It makes sure that prospective teachers  can access this information they need before they take out massive  amounts of student debt.    When teacher programs are struggling, this rule helps States identify  at-risk and low-performing programs so States can provide them the  support they need to adapt or adjust their programs and help their  teaching students succeed.   There is one more reason I would urge my colleagues to oppose this  resolution today. Simply put, it would put more power into the hands of  Secretary DeVos, and many of us don't yet have the trust that she would  use that power to promote the best interests of students in higher  education. Secretary DeVos does not come from a higher education  background. We don't know whether she supports providing information on  teacher placement rates and retention rates before prospective teachers  take out student loans. We have no idea what she would do if this rule  went away, and I believe it would be too risky to find out.   By investing in our teachers, we are investing in our future  generations. Our future teachers have the right to know whether they  are receiving a quality education, and they deserve to know that before  they take out massive amounts of student debt.   It helps to improve teacher prep program accountability and gives  prospective teachers the information they need to make an accurate  decision on which program is most likely to make them a successful  teacher in the classroom.   It ensures that Secretary DeVos does not have more power to implement  unknown policies that could hurt students and reduce the number of  qualified great teachers in our public schools.   Without this rule and the information that it ensures, students will  have a hard time finding a quality teacher prep program that will help  them get a job after they graduate. I think that is simply wrong. We  should be working to make sure teaching students have full access to  information and options. This rule would give them less.   For all the future teachers out there, I urge my fellow Senators to  vote against this CRA because every young adult deserves to know that  the program they enroll in is actually preparing them to be a  successful teacher in the classroom, and every student deserves to have  an amazing teacher in every classroom.                         Every Student Succeeds Bill    Finally, Mr. President, I wish to bring up one more thing that is  very important to me--the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act--and a  potential serious threat to it. It seems that Republicans are thinking  about bringing to the floor another CRA that would eliminate the rule  that provides States with flexibility and guidelines to create their  State plans. I want to be very clear. I hope Republicans reconsider  that approach.   The Every Student Succeeds Act is a critical part of our bipartisan  education law. It is an important part of the civil rights protections  it offers, as well as the assurances it made that every student would  have an opportunity to succeed, no matter where they live or how they  learn or how much money parents make. Jamming through that resolution  would weaken it, and it would be a major step toward turning our  bipartisan law into another partisan fight.   Rolling back the Every Student Succeeds Act rule less than a month  before States have to submit their plans to the Department of Education  will cause chaos and confusion in the States, and it will hurt our  students, our teachers, and our schools. It will also give Secretary  DeVos greater control over that bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act  and give her the tools to implement her anti-public education agenda.   Secretary DeVos's lack of experience and expertise, as well as her  damaging track record on school privatization, leaves her unqualified  to implement this bipartisan law that governs public education and  public schools without the important guardrails that rule ensures.  Given her record and her comments, she would almost certainly push for  measures that disregard key civil rights protections in the Every  Student Succeeds Act and could allow unequal, unfair, and unreliable  accountability for schools across the country.   The Every Student Succeeds Act rule is supported by Democrats and  Republicans, by teachers and businesses, and by parents and  communities. We should not go backward.   I urge my colleagues to reconsider moving forward with that  resolution, which I understand they want to bring up later this week,  and work with us to continue building on that bipartisan progress that  we all worked toward for our students.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.  [[Page S1628]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
