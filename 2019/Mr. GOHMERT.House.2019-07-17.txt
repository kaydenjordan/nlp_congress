 Madam Speaker, this is such a disturbing time for those  of us who have spent our adult lives trying to see that justice is  done, laws are followed, and yet here we again come after Attorney  General Bob Barr and another Cabinet official, Ross.   The truth is, I didn't really know Bob Barr when he got nominated. I  knew that he was friends with Bob Mueller. That caused me concern. But  it appears we have an attorney general who is concerned about justice  and he is concerned about stopping injustices. And yet, we still have  people who are wanting to cause as much trouble for the President and  stop his administration from getting as much accomplished for the  American people as possible.   It has got to stop at some point. It is like a game, we come here and  we are going to hold him in contempt again. This is a double secret  probation against Bob Barr. How many double, triple, quadruple secret  probations are we going to do? This isn't going to amount to anything.   If you take this to any Federal judge to try to enforce it, he or she  will look at the procedure and go: This is ridiculous. You are not  going to have me hold the attorney general in contempt for trying to  follow the law, and you are wanting to interrupt his efforts to follow  the law. That is not happening.   So this is all about a show, when there is true injustice going on.  Thank God that we have a President who wanted to see justice done. He  knew he didn't collude. And now we have an attorney general who is  trying to do the same thing.   Madam Speaker, let's say no to this contempt. Let's get back to doing  the job that the American people want us to do.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, and I  appreciate him yielding.   This is something we ought to be talking about every day because it  is a crisis. It makes a difference. It is helping destroy our country.   And it is really tragic, though, and I would not superimpose any type  of attack on personalities, however, I think what we really have is not  evil intentions. I think it is just massive ignorance. Because we have  heard over and over: Oh, if you want to secure the border, you want  just U.S. citizens, then you are a racist.   So that just reflects an ignorance.    Mr. Speaker, there is no question about that.    No, it is.   But American citizens are comprised of every race, of every  nationality, all walks of life. It is one of our strengths, people  coming from so many different walks of life, countries, races. Yet when  we have applied the standard ``from out of many, one,'' then we have  been our strongest, all different races, nationalities.                                time  2015    But now, in order to tear down this country and the greatness in the  way of opportunities and help around the world for other countries, not  seeking some hegemony, not seeking imperialist motives, we want  everyone to be better off. We want peace. We want good for everyone.   But if you destroy our borders and people flood in who are not  educated on what it takes to keep a self-governing country, you won't  keep it.   Eric Metaxas has a book out on this, but it goes back to what  Benjamin Franklin said when he was asked at the end of the convention,  ``What did you give us?'' And they wondered if it was another monarchy.   ``A Republic, Madam, if you can keep it.''   The one thing we know: No country has lasted, either as a complete  democracy like the Athenian city-state or whether it is a  parliamentarian country--they don't last 200 years.   We are 230 now. We are moving on. So, we are in a very desperate  situation to try to keep this shining light on a hill that shines light  for the world.   So, it is important that we have borders. If we don't have borders,  if we don't secure our borders, then we will come--as many have wanted.  They wanted to see America fall from within.   As Lincoln said, if death be our light, then we will die by suicide  is basically what he was saying.   We have got to secure our borders so that we can welcome people  continuing at the rate faster--more people coming in than any other  country in the history of the world.   But I have had people in my district say, ``We went to the border. We  went through these facilities. We have all this information. People are  being kept in cages. It is horrible.''   Well, I go down a lot, have been down many times. And I started going  down during the Obama administration. That is when the cages were  built. They were built by the Obama administration. That is when  overcrowding was started, during the Obama administration.   But it is like there is an intent, as my friend from Florida was  pointing out, for political purposes, that we want to try to make the  Trump administration look bad, so we will take all the wrongdoing that  occurred during the Obama years, the mistreatment of people that have  come in illegally, and project that onto the Trump administration, and  we will push to have even less enforcement on our borders.   We will make these promises of, gee, we are working on all these  kinds of things. Here is an article from The Hill: ``Democrats calling  for decriminalization of illegal entry abandoning national  sovereignty.''   They want to decriminalize--it is against the law, it is a crime to  come into the country illegally. They are sending every message they  possibly can. It is not a dog whistle. It is a big neon sign saying  ``Come.'' Whether you are coming from Asia, Africa, South America,  Central America, we don't care. Just come illegally, as many as you  can. We will overwhelm these folks. We are going to be able to probably  get a lot of people that are here illegally voting, and then will be  the end of the Republican Party.   And what they don't say--maybe they don't realize--is that it will  also be the end of a self-governing nation as we knew it. Because the  way this normally works out--and we are well beyond the maximum,  basically, 200 years. When we lose our freedom, it won't come back. We  are done. And there will be no place for people being mistreated around  the world to come after that.   It is interesting, though, when I have been down to the border,  especially during the Obama years, the Obama administration personnel  kept me out of some of those facilities. We had to really raise Cain  and get in there.   So, we have got people who are not part of the government, and they  go waltzing into these facilities. That is ridiculous.   Then we know that there were two pictures that were initially--they  had to be withdrawn, but they were from 2014, about people in cages. I  had seen that my friend, Mr. Yoho, had the pictures. Those are from the  Obama administration.   Mr. Speaker, let me just finish by pointing out, this truly is a  threat to the existence of a self-governing country as we have known  it. This is serious stuff.   For those who have big hearts, those of us that want to help as many  people as we can, destroying the fabric of a self-governing country  will not allow better fabric to take its place.   You will have another Venezuela. It always works out. People try to  self-govern for so long, and then, eventually, untoward efforts bring  about chaos.   And, normally, the way chaos is dealt with is push for a monarchy, a  totalitarian government, a Putin, a Chavez, a Hitler. There is some  effort to get somebody in that can get all of this under control, and  it is the end of a democratic republic.   So, I am really pleased that my friend, Dr. Yoho--I tell friends, he  is a guy, having been a veterinarian, that was best equipped to work in  Congress because he has had so much experience dealing with the south  end of a northbound horse. So I thank him for bringing about this  Special Order, and I am looking forward to many more. We need to talk  about this, this is a threat.    Mr. Speaker, our Border Patrol agents are exhausted.  They have worked so many hours.  [[Page H5990]]    We had a hearing today in Judiciary on a bill adding requirement  after requirement, millions and millions of dollars. They didn't give  them any money in the 4.6 to do the job of enforcing the border. Our  Border Patrol agents need help. They are in big trouble.
