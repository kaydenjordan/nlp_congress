 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5760) to provide for a comprehensive interdisciplinary research,  development, and demonstration initiative to strengthen the capacity of  the energy sector to prepare for and withstand cyber and physical  attacks, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5760         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Grid Security Research and       Development Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Nation, and every critical infrastructure sector,       depends on reliable electricity.        (2) Intelligent electronic devices, advanced analytics, and       information systems used across the energy sector are       essential to maintaining reliable operation of the electric       grid.        (3) The cybersecurity threat landscape is constantly       changing and attacker capabilities are advancing rapidly,       requiring ongoing modifications, advancements, and       investments in technologies and procedures to maintain       security.        (4) It is in the national interest for Federal agencies to       invest in cybersecurity research that informs and facilitates       private sector investment and use of advanced cybersecurity       tools and procedures to protect information systems.        (5) The number of devices and systems connecting to the       electric grid is increasing, and integrating cybersecurity       protections into information systems when they are built is       more effective than modifying products after installation to       meet cybersecurity goals.        (6) An understanding of human factors can be leveraged to       understand the behavior of cyber threat actors, develop       strategies to counter threat actors, improve cybersecurity       training programs, optimize the design of human-machine       interfaces and cybersecurity tools, and increase the capacity       of the energy sector workforce to prevent unauthorized access       to critical systems.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 5760, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5760, the Grid  Security Research and Development Act.   I first want to thank the chairwoman of the Committee on Science,  Space, and Technology, Ms. Johnson, and the ranking member, Mr. Lucas,  for their help in passing the Grid Security R&D bill out of the  Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and bringing it to the  floor.   I also thank my colleague, Congressman Randy Weber from Texas, for  joining on as a bipartisan cosponsor.   Mr. Speaker, the Grid Security R&D Act supports sustained investment  across Federal agencies in research and technology to keep pace with  the rapidly evolving threats to our electrical grid. The bill focuses  on protecting our grid from two major threats: Cyber and physical.   Access to reliable power is core to our economy, and the impact of  physical threats to our electric grid have never been clearer than now.   This summer, in my home State of California, the scenario of high  winds, combined with lightning strikes and dry ground, have created  some of the most dangerous wildfires in our State's history. In  addition to burning millions of acres and causing loss of life, these  wildfires put a significant part of our region on notice for potential  emergency power shutoffs to reduce the risk of new outbreaks and  further wildfire damage.   However, these shutoffs are not as simple as turning off and on a  light switch. It takes time to de-energize transmission systems in  advance of a severe weather event and to reenergize the system after  the threat has passed.   While safety and preventing wildfires is a high priority, these  shutoffs can leave hundreds of thousands of people without power for a  few days. Dangerous wildfires, intense periods of drought, and other  severe weather events have become increasingly more common in recent  years because of climate change and will continue to threaten our grid.   Furthermore, the inability to protect our grid from these severe  weather events becomes more magnified during significant emergencies  like the COVID-19 pandemic.   Our hospitals and emergency rooms are working around the clock to  save lives. They need access to reliable power and the assurance to  know that the power will not go out during an important surgery or stop  a ventilator from running.   In addition, food banks and restaurants rely on refrigeration to  continue supplying food to those in need and our small businesses  cannot reopen if they can't keep the lights on.   Ensuring access to electricity is critical in times like this. That  is why I am proud to lead this bill, which would help strengthen the  resiliency of our electric grid against physical threats. Our bill  would also provide funding to develop technologies that would toughen  our grid against wildfires and other natural disasters by improving  early detection of deteriorating electrical transmission and  distribution systems.  [[Page H5029]]    This aging equipment can tend to spark and come in contact with  vegetation during high-wind events and natural disasters causing  wildfires.   This bill will also spur the development and implementation of  microgrid and battery storage technologies, provide backup power  options so that in the event of an emergency power shutoff, a more  targeted shutoff will impact less households.   The threat of climate change in our electric grid is real. We have an  opportunity to continue the modernization of our power system  infrastructure, and this bill is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, the other focus of our bill is improving cybersecurity  across our electric grid. As the grid and other forms of critical  infrastructure become more digitized, the risk that cyberattacks would  shut down critical systems has increased, and in some cases these  attacks can even cause physical damage to the grid. The types of  cyberattacks also continue to become more sophisticated.   Last year, cyber hackers remotely attacked electric grid networks for  the first time, affecting several Western States, including California,  Utah, and Wyoming. Given how critical reliable access to power is to  our daily lives, these attacks highlight the need for investment to  address this evolving threat.   H.R. 5760 would authorize a comprehensive, coordinated research  effort across Federal agencies to advance cybersecurity capabilities  for the energy sector.   Research areas would include: improving rapid detection of cyber  intrusions, integrating cybersecurity features into the energy  infrastructure, and focusing in on cyber solutions through our defense  sector that can be modified and transferred to the civilian power  sector.   Lastly, our bill invests in strengthening our cybersecurity  workforce. As our electric grid continues to modernize with renewable  energy and energy storage technologies, a high-skilled workforce will  be needed who understand the evolving threats.   I look forward to working with the Senate to get this bill passed  into law so we can continue to improve the resiliency of our electric  grid.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
