 With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Lorna Breen was a talented and dynamic  physician who served as the medical director of the emergency  department at New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital. Lorna was from  Charlottesville, VA, and very devoted to her family there. She attended  Cornell University and then the Medical College of Virginia. She was  deeply religious, an avid skier, a volunteer with senior citizens, a  salsa dancer, and a musician.  [[Page S4594]]    Mostly, Lorna Breen was a beloved, compassionate, and demanding  doctor. A colleague said of her: ``She had something that was a little  bit different and that was this optimism that her persistent effort  will save lives.''   Dr. Breen suffered from something very common among health  professionals--the deep stress of dealing with patients day in and day  out--helping them, worrying about them, celebrating with them, praying  for them, and mourning for them.   Healthcare professionals routinely experience high levels of stress.  As many as 45 to 55 percent of this critical workforce suffers from  burnout. Physicians have the highest rate of death by suicide of any  profession in this country, with a suicide rate more than twice that of  the general population. That was the case before COVID-19.   In November 2019, Dr. Breen and three colleagues published a short  article in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine titled:  ``Clinician burnout and its association with team-based care in the  Emergency Department.'' The article that she coauthored begins this  way:         Recent work has noted the alarming prevalence of clinician       burnout among providers, particularly among acute care       physicians. Burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion,       physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness, which may lead to       feelings of depersonalization and reduced accomplishment.    The article went on to describe how staffing models--in this case,  the use of fixed working teams--could mitigate the effects of stress on  staff and also improve patient outcomes. Within just a few months of  the publication of this article, healthcare professionals like Dr.  Breen, already dealing with high stress levels, faced a new foe:  coronavirus.   Dr. Breen's hospital was overrun by the virus in March and April, as  were others in New York, as are others in this country. By late March,  the Allen, a small community hospital serving a low-income population  in Northern Manhattan, was blitzed with an emergency department clogged  with nearly three times its normal number of patients. Dr. Breen shared  the sense of anxiety now understood by the whole country: ``People I  work with are so confused by all the mixed messages and constantly  changing instructions.'' And then Dr. Breen got the virus herself,  coming down with fever and exhaustion on March 18 and quarantining in  her New York City apartment as she tried to recover. While she was  trying to recover, she was texting her colleagues to see if they were  OK. She was trying to help them find supplies that they could buy to  use at the hospital.   Finally, she returned to work on April 1, and the situation in her  emergency room, her hospital, her city, was even grimmer. Her sister,  Jennifer Breen Feist, described what Lorna faced.         When [Lorna] returned to the hospital, she was confronted       by an overwhelming, relentless number of incredibly sick       patients. She and her colleagues worked 24/7 during the peak       in New York with limited personal protective equipment,       insufficient supplies, not enough beds, not enough help. Many       of her colleagues were out on medical furlough. She told me       patients were dying in the waiting rooms and hallways. . . .       There was so much suffering, so much death.    During the peak of the crisis in New York City, nearly a quarter of  all patients admitted to the Allen for COVID-19 would die. Dr. Breen  messaged her Bible study group: ``I'm drowning right now--may be AWOL  for a while.'' She kept right on working.   By mid-April, Dr. Breen reached out for help to deal with the stress  she was feeling by talking to colleagues and family. She admitted that  she had thought about hurting herself. She told one friend:         I couldn't help anyone. I couldn't do anything. I just       wanted to help people and I couldn't do anything.    Dr. Breen was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for 11 days and went  home when she was discharged to be with her family in Charlottesville  to recover, and on April 26, Dr. Breen died by suicide, leaving no  note.   Dr. Breen was a victim of coronavirus, even though her death is not  counted among the 151,000 people who have succumbed to the virus. But  she was also a victim of another condition that is a preventable  condition that affects our healthcare professionals. We place enormous  demands upon our healers. Our society, including the medical profession  itself, does not do enough to recognize the real cost that the work  inflicts upon the mental health of our caregivers. Perhaps even our use  of the term ``hero,'' meant as the highest praise, subtly communicates  an expectation that our healers must be strong superheroes, placed high  on a pedestal by society, thereby making it even more difficult for a  caregiver to admit vulnerability and simply ask for help.   Loice Swisher, an emergency room physician in Philadelphia, puts it  this way:         We don't want to be seen as a weak link. We don't want to       be seen as incompetent or place an extra burden on our       colleagues. It's almost like you're being kicked off the       island--you don't belong any more--if you admit to [needing       help].    It is still common practice in this country for State medical boards  and hospitals to ask doctors seeking licensing and credentialing  whether they have ever been treated for depression or other mental  illness. This heightens the barriers to asking for help when we should  be making it easier to do so. Lorna's sister Jennifer attests to this:         And when [Lorna] became so overworked and despondent that       she was unable to move, do you know what she was worried       about? Her job. She was worried that she would lose her       medical license, or be ostracized by her colleagues because       she was suffering burnout due to her work on the front lines       of the Covid19 crisis. She was afraid to get help.    Lorna's worries were not unusual. A 2019 survey of physicians by the  American Medical Association showed that nearly 40 percent of surveyed  physicians are wary about seeking mental health counseling, while  another 12 percent indicate that they would only do so in secret.   Dr. Breen's family is devastated by her passing, but they are  honoring her by advocating for the cause of a more humane profession,  one in which mental health challenges are acknowledged, mental health  resources are available, and the healer accessing those services is  encouraged.   I am proud today to introduce the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care  Provider Protection Act, together with my colleagues, Senators Young,  Reed, and Cassidy. The act aims to reduce and prevent suicide, burnout,  and other mental and behavioral health conditions among healthcare  professionals. In particular, the act would establish grants for  training healthcare professionals, students, and residents with  strategies to improve their mental well-being and job satisfaction;  identify and disseminate evidence-based best practices for combating  burnout and suicide; establish a national education and awareness  campaign targeting healthcare professionals to encourage them to seek  support and treatment for mental and behavioral health concerns; create  grants for employee education, peer support programming, and mental and  behavioral health treatment with a priority for providers in COVID-19  hotspots; and initiate a comprehensive study on healthcare professional  mental health needs, including the impact of COVID-19 on our providers,  that can produce recommendations for all levels of government and the  medical professions themselves.   We introduced this bill mindful of the many priorities that are  currently being discussed while we negotiate our continuing response to  the Nation's coronavirus challenge. It is our hope that this bill might  make it into the next COVID-19 bill as a tribute to Lorna Breen and so  many like her.   How should we honor the work and sacrifice of a Lorna Breen? How do  we honor those healthcare frontline workers whom we call heroes every  day? How do we recognize the tremendous work they are doing and also  the tremendous burden that they carry? Let's pass this bill and show  that we care about our healers and are committed to providing them the  resources and the culture they need to keep healing.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:   S. 4352. A bill to provide for the water quality restoration of the  Tijuana River and the New River, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Environment and Public Works.
