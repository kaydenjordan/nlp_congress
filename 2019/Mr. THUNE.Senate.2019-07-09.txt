 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we received more good economic news on  Friday with the announcement that the economy created 224,000 jobs in  June.   Meanwhile, unemployment remained near its lowest level in half a  century. June marked the 16th straight month that unemployment has been  at or below 4 percent. That is a tremendous record.   June also marked the 11th straight month that wage growth has been at  or above 3 percent. Before 2018, wage growth had not hit 3 percent in  nearly a decade.   Friday's announcement was just the latest piece of good news about  the economy. Thanks to Republican economic policies, the economy has  taken off during the Trump administration. Economic growth is up, wage  growth is up, personal income is up, and the list goes on.   Importantly, the benefits of this economic growth are being spread  far and wide. One of the distinguishing features of the economic  expansion that we have been experiencing is the way it has been  reaching those who have trailed behind economically.   Over the past 3 years, pay hikes for the lowest income workers have  exceeded pay hikes for the richest workers. Huge numbers of new blue- collar jobs have been created, and the employment situation for  minorities has improved substantially.   The unemployment rates for Asian Americans, African Americans, and  Hispanic Americans are all at or near record lows. The Wall Street  Journal notes that ``Nearly one million more blacks and two million  more Hispanics are employed than when Barack Obama left office, and  minorities account for more than half of all new jobs created during  the Trump Presidency.''   So where has all this economic progress come from? At the end of the  Obama administration, 2\1/2\ years ago, the economic outlook wasn't too  rosy. The economy was sputtering, and American families were  struggling. Some were predicting that a weak economy would be the new  normal.   Republicans, however, didn't agree with that. We knew that American  workers and American businesses were as dynamic and creative as ever.  But we also knew that burdensome regulations and an outdated tax code  were holding our economy back and reducing the opportunities available  to workers. So when we took office in 2017, we got right to work on  improving  [[Page S4714]]  our economy in order to improve life for the American people.   We eliminated burdensome regulations that were acting as a drag on  economic growth, and we passed a historic reform of our Tax Code to put  money in Americans' pockets and make it easier for businesses to grow  and to create jobs. Now we are seeing the results: a thriving economy  that is extending more opportunities to more Americans.   For all of Democrats' talk about inequality, it is actually  Republicans and President Trump who have done something about it. We  have helped create an economy that is lifting up people across the  entire economic spectrum.   There is still more work to be done, of course. For one thing, we  need to make sure that the agriculture economy is able to catch up to  the economy at large. But thanks to tax reform and other Republican  economic policies, American workers are doing better than they have in  a very long time.   It is unfortunate that the gains we have made would be reversed if  Democrats have their way. Democrats' plans--from budget-busting  government-run healthcare to free college--all have one thing in  common: They would cost a lot of money.   Where would the government get most of that money? From tax  increases--tax increases on businesses and tax increases on ordinary  Americans.   Thanks to the tax relief that Republicans passed, the economy has  expanded, paychecks have increased, and more jobs and opportunities  have been created.   Raising taxes would result in the opposite: fewer jobs and  opportunities, a smaller economy, and more families struggling to get  by on smaller paychecks.   Republicans are determined to make sure that doesn't happen. We are  committed to building on the progress we have made and further  expanding economic opportunity for all Americans.   I yield the floor.
