 Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand with Members of the  House and Senate leadership and members of the Congressional Black  Caucus to introduce the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I am  proud to be an original cosponsor of the legislation.   This legislation is a timely, critical, bold, and transformative  start to addressing the issues millions of Americans have been  protesting about. I believe we also need to reorganize funding  activities for law enforcement in a way that works to bring police and  communities closer together, not further apart.   We must also change our laws to enable swift action to prosecute  misconduct by police officers, improve training and transparency, and  create a national use of force standard for police who are charged to  protect and serve our communities, all of which are included in the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. We owe it to those who have died  and those who have honored them.   So let us vote ``yes,'' and let us vote to continue working on these  critical issues.
