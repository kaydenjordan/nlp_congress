 Mr. Speaker, Putin's decision to bring this horrific  tragedy upon the people of Ukraine is rightly to be condemned, and it  is right at this moment in history that we do not fund this aggression  by proxy through the purchase and importing of Russian oil.   But it is also tragic that the Biden administration and Democrats in  this Chamber would rather turn to dictatorial, terrorist-sponsoring  regimes to fill the energy gap rather than the world-renowned work  ethic and innovation of the American people.   This administration should be doing everything it can to ramp up  production and increase energy exports. Back home in Texas, we know  that one of  [[Page H1400]]  the best ways this can be achieved is by investing in our ports, like  the Port of Corpus Christi in my district.   Increasing U.S. energy exports can provide relief and hope for the  Ukrainian people. It can give Europe the assurance it needs to break  away from Russian energy. And it can provide relief and economic  opportunity for American families.   It is past time to stop Biden's assault on American energy and  restore America's energy dominance.
