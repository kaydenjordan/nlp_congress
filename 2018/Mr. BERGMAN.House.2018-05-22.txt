 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the fiscal  year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.   I want to thank Chairman Thornberry for all his leadership on this  bill.   Providing for our Nation's common defense is our constitutional duty.  As a retired lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, I know that  certainty from Washington, especially on this side of the river, is  critical for the military to carry out its missions. Our men and women  in uniform need consistency and reliability over the long term to meet  complex threats, changing threats, in all corners of the world.   This bill increases resources for readiness training and upgrades  essential  [[Page H4296]]  equipment to provide our warfighters with increased capabilities on  land, at sea, and in the air.   I also want to thank the committee for including report language  highlighting the critical role that the Soo Locks play in our national  security. The Soo Locks, located in my home district, are a single  point of failure in a multibillion-dollar supply chain and a potential  target for disruptive activities. Any unscheduled outing of the locks  would threaten our national economy and, in turn, our national  security.   Again, I thank the chairman for all his hard work on this defense  authorization. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying bill.                                time  1145
