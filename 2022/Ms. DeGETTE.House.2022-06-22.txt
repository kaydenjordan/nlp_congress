 Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to stand here today in  support of this legislation, which will revolutionize how our Nation  researches and develops new cures and treatments for some of the  world's most difficult diseases.   There is not a person in this room or in this Capitol who hasn't been  impacted in some way by a devastating disease--cancer, Alzheimer's, or  something else. These diseases don't care if you are a Democrat or a  Republican. They affect all of us. It needs to be our collective  mission to cure all of them immediately.   The ripple effect that they have on our communities is immeasurable.  The pain and suffering that they cause, not just to those who become  ill but to their families, friends, and loved ones, is irreparable.  They place significant strain on our public health systems and  significant strain on our economy.   For years, scientists and researchers, both here in the U.S. and  around the world, have been searching for ways to prevent and treat  these devastating illnesses.                                time  1630    I see my friend and colleague Fred Upton here on the floor with us  today. Fred and I worked on the 21st Century Cures bill in 2016 which  has revolutionized the way we do a lot of this discovery and  development. But what we need more of now is an all-hands-on-deck  approach to end these illnesses, and that is exactly why this  legislation was developed.   As Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Pallone, and others said, it will create a new  Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, ARPA-H, which will bring  together some of the world's greatest minds and give them access to the  Federal Government's seemingly unlimited resources to make the  impossible possible.   Mr. Speaker, modeled after the DARPA program, as you heard, the new  agency will be lean and it will be mean. It will be targeted at  specifically researching and finding cures for some of the most  intractable diseases that we have.   It is going to be run by a small number of program managers, and it  will be able to take on the high-risk, high-reward projects that others  simply cannot. It will not substitute for the basic research at the NIH  or the research at our great universities or in private  [[Page H5801]]  business. It will supplement it by targeting these tough issues, and it  will reshape the future of biomedical research in this country for  many, many years to come.   As I said, this legislation is an opportunity. It is an opportunity  to put our country on track to ending cancer as we know it. It is an  opportunity to save millions of lives. If we cure cancer, and if we  save lives and improve the health and well-being of our constituents,  isn't that what we came here for?   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote ``yes.''
