 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1836, as amended, the  Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act of 2021.   While I support the intent of this bill, I do not believe that it is  the right solution for our Nation's guard and reservists at this time.   Founded in 1636, the National Guard evolved from groups of colonial  militias into one of the toughest and one of the most professional  fighting forces in the world.   From defeating the British during the American Revolution, to  fighting in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Reserve component has  served in every major conflict in the history of this Nation.  [[Page H52]]    In recent years, the Guard and Reserve have been called up more often  as their missions have changed.   These brave men and women are not only on the front lines overseas,  but they are also deployed at home to protect the southern border and  assist in the response to COVID-19, among others.   We must never forget the sacrifices the men and women in the Guard  and Reserve make when the Federal Government calls on them to serve.   I agree that Congress must take a hard look at duty status reform and  the potential expansion of benefits for guard and reservists. But this  bill before us today would be an unwise expansion of benefits.   The higher level of sacrifice of Active-Duty servicemembers is  reflected in the higher level of benefits provided by the VA. This is  why the government recognizes the increased sacrifices of the Reserve  component when they are called up on most Federal Active-Duty orders.   I believe that one of the biggest misunderstandings in this debate is  that many of the types of Federal Active-Duty service that members of  the National Guard and Reserve perform already qualify for the GI Bill  eligibility.   I support the goal of ensuring that all time spent on nontraining  Active Duty Federal orders should count towards GI Bill eligibility.   However, the bill before us today would go far beyond that and  provide eligibility for the GI Bill for service related to annual  training and drilling weekends.   Training has never counted towards eligibility, and members of the  Guard and Reserve know that when they sign up. Let me say that again.  Training has never counted towards eligibility with members of the  Guard and Reserves. They knew it when they signed up. It is the  additional call-ups to Federal Active-Duty service that members of the  Guard and Reserve may not know about.   This type of service would be covered by Congressman Moore's  amendment, which I believe is a better alternative.   Also, covering training is the largest cost driver of this bill,  which leads to my second point.   The CBO projects that the expansion of benefits laid out in this bill  would require nearly $2 billion in mandatory offsets for the first 10  years following enactment. While these costs are paid for in the  current budget window, that does not tell the whole story.   CBO also estimates that this bill will cost taxpayers more than $5  billion in each of the next four decades after fiscal year 2032. This  would equate to at least 20 billion extra dollars over the next 50  years.   None of these extra costs are offset, which means our children and  grandchildren will be paying for them and be paying them off for many  years to come.   In a tight fiscal environment, I believe that full Active-Duty  benefits for training and drilling is a bridge too far. I am also  concerned that the offsets that are used in this bill should be saved  for higher priority issues like expanding services to toxic-exposed  veterans.   Addressing the needs of toxic-exposed veterans is both my and  Chairman Takano's number one priority that we are trying to deal with  right now. That could require Congress to find hundreds of billions of  dollars in offsets. Offsets are few and far between in the Veterans'  Affairs Committee. We will need every penny of them to enact these  needed reforms that we were talking about earlier.   Earlier this week before the Rules Committee, Chairman Takano  indicated that $2 billion is an insignificant amount compared to the  potential full cost of addressing toxic exposure, and therefore, is not  worthy to try to save here. I disagree.   It is silly that I even have to say this, but $2 billion is a lot of  money. It is worth saving. Ask any taxpayer. And remember, the people  we are talking about are taxpayers, as well.   Like me, my constituents and many Americans are concerned that  Congress doles out billions of taxpayer dollars like candy. That must  end. We can provide needed benefits for veterans without burdening  future generations. But that requires Congress to make tough decisions  and to put first things first.   Many of my concerns could have been discussed, debated, and possibly  even addressed if the majority had conducted the proper level of  engagement with committee members, VA, and other stakeholders on this  bill.   The majority did not hold a single legislative hearing on this bill  this Congress. As such, we were not able to receive views from the  committee members, the administration, the mortgage industry, or  veteran service organizations. Those views are a critical part of the  legislative process.   Why was this bill not put on the agenda for one of the two  legislative hearings the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity held this  Congress?   This is no way to responsibly legislate, and I implore Chairman  Takano to go back to our committee's bipartisan tradition of conducting  full legislative due diligence before sending bills to the House floor.    In closing, I am supportive of reviewing and, where warranted,  expanding benefits for members of the Guard and Reserve. However, we  must do so in a way that is fiscally responsible, appropriate, and  respects the many differences between Guard and Reserve service and  Active-Duty service.   The bill before us today does not meet that standard.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just quickly before I yield time to my  colleague from Ohio, I would like to remind the Members that training  for members of National Guard and Reserve has never been counted  towards GI Bill eligibility. Members of Guard and Reserve know that, as  I said in my opening, when they sign up.   Now, the Democrat majority did not hold a legislative hearing on this  bill, so to that extent, the expansion of eligibility was needed to  increase recruitment and retention within the Guard and Reserve  component and DOD, but DOD did not have the opportunity to testify to  that before the committee because we didn't meet.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup), who has actually served both in the Reserve and Active  component of our military.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Bergman), a man who has truly experienced what it is to serve, the  highest ranking officer that serves in this body today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just to clear up some statements that I think were made  by some of the people while talking, it was brought up that we actually  have already dealt with toxic exposures, and we haven't. It is vitally  important to understand that.   Those costs that we are still going to be looking at, whether it is  300 or 150 or whatever it is, we haven't found that out or figured that  out yet. It is vitally important to understand that it is still out  there, and there is going to be a cost.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Smith), someone from our side of the aisle who does a great job and  that we trust tremendously to watch our costs and watch our spending.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the debate with many others, and so  many times it is being misunderstood that the Guard and Reserve don't  receive these benefits when they are called up on Federal--they  actually do on many of the Federal orders. The Moore amendment would  allow that to occur.   I think many of our Members are confused on what they actually are  receiving time for toward their GI Bill. I want to express again what  we are saying is that the overreach here that occurs is that one  weekend a month, 2 weeks a year, they know when they sign up that that  is the difference. It is not going to be credited.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I think Members of the House need to  understand because many speakers, including the previous speaker,  brought up the fact that those who serve should receive these benefits  who actually serve on the battlefield. When they do, they do. Under  this existing system right now they receive that benefit.   What we are talking about now is an expansion to those days of  reservist, the weekend a month and the 2 weeks a year. It is completely  different from the fact when they are on Federal orders, and the Moore  amendment would actually deal with that and take care of that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Fitzgerald).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Wisconsin an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am ready to close, but there are a few things in the closing that I  want to be sure and bring up.   First off, the GI Bill cannot be included in--was not included, and  those benefits would be removed if they refuse to take the vaccine. So  the MTR is actually a legitimate motion that is something that we do  need to deal with that was not taken care of in that bill.   And just so you know, a vitally important issue that was brought up  by General Bergman, our speakers that we have had here today, they  don't take this lightly. They are very serious about this. They have  served themselves. They have served in these capacities. They  understand the concern. And the concern of retention in the Active  Forces is a serious concern.   We just received notice that the Army raised its max bonus for new  recruits to $50,000 due to struggling in trying to get people to come  on to Active Reserve. By offering this benefit above and beyond that  has been a concern of many of those that have expressed that concern.   But let me tell you this on this debate today. I want to thank  Chairman Takano and others for a thoughtful and respectful debate,  which is vitally important on an issue like this.   I also want to thank Congressman Levin. His passion on these issues  was truly present as well, and we understand that.   You know, I am a former marine. I am a former active marine. I am a  marine because, you know, once you are a marine you are always a  marine. That is vitally important to remember. And as a father of a  marine and a grandfather of a marine, these issues are personal to me.   Now, I understand the sacrifices that members of our National Guard  make every day. And I think some of the things that were spoken of here  today confuse the fact that when they get called up to Active Duty, go  over to Iraq, go to Afghanistan, those qualify towards their GI bill.  It does. And I am not opposed to them receiving education benefits, nor  was anybody that spoke here today.   But the Guard and Reserve is that; it is a Guard and Reserve. And  whenever they are activated, yes, they should receive those benefits.  That is why the Moore amendment is so vitally important that we are  going to be talking on  [[Page H58]]  later as well. If we adopt that, it will cover everything except that  component that those Guard and Reserve members knew when they joined,  that they didn't get those benefits for that 1 weekend a month and  those 2 weeks a year.   And why is that? Because it is a separate standing than an Active- Duty military personnel.   This discussion--and I know we all want to respect our Guard and  Reserve, but this is not the way to do it. Doing it in the right order,  hearing from everyone in committee, discussing these issues, bringing  them up, and getting input from those stakeholders that are involved,  was the proper way to do this; not to do it here on the floor in this  manner.   I think the debate has been really good. I hope that the people that  are listening understand. I hope that our colleagues understand what it  is; that a vote against this is not a vote against the Guard and  Reserve. A vote against this is simply saying, no, there is another way  that is more fiscally responsible, that will still offer benefits and  reward those for their service. But this is not the right way.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the underlying bill,  ``yes'' on the amendments that we are coming up with, but ``no'' on the  underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the amendment,  although I am not opposed.    Mr. Speaker, Congresswoman Ross' amendment would require VA  to share information regarding mental healthcare, community care, and  other services to veterans who have recently transitioned out of the  military.   Leaving the military can be a difficult and vulnerable time for many  veterans. It is critical that separating servicemembers receive support  as they restart their civilian lives. Part of that is ensuring that  they are educated and empowered to take advantage of the benefits they  earned by serving the Nation in uniform.   Now, right now, the education occurs primarily through the Transition  Assistance Program, or TAP. TAP was created in 1990, and always  includes information on the VA care, benefits and services that those  transitioning out of the military may be eligible for.   Now, TAP is a great program, and it is vitally important because  those of us who are older veterans, the only tap we got was on the  shoulder and a hey, good to see you; have a great life. But now TAP  actually has that opportunity.   In addition, the Trump administration began the Solid Start program  in 2019. Through Solid Start, all new veterans are contacted by the VA  three times during their first year out of uniform. Those contacts  occur 90, 180, and 360 days after separation from service and are a  priceless opportunity for newly separated servicemembers to connect  with the VA.                                time  1400    Congresswoman Ross' amendment would require that the VA provide  information to those new veterans, including information regarding the  healthcare, including mental health, community care, military sexual  trauma, and the Veterans Crisis Line.   As I indicated, the VA already provides new veterans with information  during TAP and through the Solid Start program. This amendment simply  ensures that the materials VA provides to new veterans specifically  includes these subjects.   For that reason, I am in support of her amendment, and I encourage  all of my colleagues to support that. I thank Congresswoman Ross and  the cosponsors of this amendment for their work, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Congressman Moore's  amendment to H.R. 1836, as amended, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill  Parity Act of 2021.   While I do not support the underlying text of the bill, I believe  that Congressman Moore's amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, would  make important, commonsense changes to it.   The underlying bill would make a vast and costly expansion of  benefits to Guard and Reserve members to include GI Bill eligibility  for every day in uniform under Federal orders. This includes GI Bill  eligibility for weekend drills and training.   As I stated during the general debate earlier, I believe that this  bill's $2 billion mandatory cost is using rare offsets that take away  from the priorities this committee has in serving our Nation's  veterans. That is why today I stand in support of Congressman Moore's  amendment.   These substituted provisions would simplify current law so that any  time spent on Federal Active Duty by members of the Guard and Reserve  for service other than for training would count toward GI Bill  eligibility. This would include service in support of protecting the  southern border, federally funded missions in support of efforts to  combat COVID-19, and other critical Active Duty missions.   The amendment would only require $16 million in mandatory offsets,  compared to the $2 billion the underlying bill would cost.   Not only is this policy change good for our Nation's veterans, but it  also does not burden our children, grandchildren, and future  generations of American taxpayers with tens of billions of dollars over  several decades in unfunded offset costs like the underlying bill  would.   This is without question a more measurable and fiscally responsible  approach to more fully honor the valuable service that these men and  women of the Guard and Reserve perform.   I want to thank Congressman Moore for his hard work on the amendment.  Before yielding back, I would like to say that if a person votes  against this bill, it is not a vote against the Guard and Reserve. It  is a vote for the taxpayers, which Guard and Reserves are also  taxpayers. It is the reason why we should have had a more full debate  on this bill in committee so these things could have been brought up.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
