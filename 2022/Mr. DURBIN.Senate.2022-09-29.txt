 Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to confirm  another outstanding nominee to the Federal bench: Arianna Freeman,  nominated to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.   Ms. Freeman is an accomplished appellate attorney and a ground- breaking pick for the Third Circuit. Her perspective, experience, and  legal acumen will greatly benefit the court. And once confirmed, she  will be the first Black woman to serve on the Third Circuit.   After earning her B.A. with honors from Swarthmore College and her  J.D. from Yale Law School, Ms. Freeman clerked for three judges on the  Eastern District of Pennsylvania, based in Philadelphia.   In 2009, following her clerkships, Ms. Freeman joined the Federal  Community Defender's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,  an office she has served with distinction. As a Federal public  defender, Ms. Freeman has dedicated her career to representing indigent  criminal defendants seeking to vindicate their constitutional rights-- to due process, effective assistance of counsel, and other  constitutional guarantees.   Unfortunately, some of my Republican colleagues have suggested that  Ms. Freeman's public defense work disqualifies her from judicial  service.   In reality, Ms. Freeman has undertaken this work in support of the  Constitution and the rule of law. Her zealous advocacy has helped to  ensure that the protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are made  real for criminal defendants. Throughout her career, she has advanced  the cause of equal justice under law.   Ms. Freeman received a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from  the American Bar Association.   She has the strong support of Senator Casey, as well as many leaders  in the Pennsylvania legal community. This includes four former Federal  prosecutors who sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee writing, ``We  are impressed by Arianna's diligence, intelligence, dedication, and  integrity. It is because of her ethics and compassion, grounded in  sensibility, that we are confident she will provide sound and measured  opinions, while approaching each case without bias and with respect for  the rule of law.''   I will support Ms. Freeman's confirmation, and I urge my colleagues  to do the same.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I want to take a moment to remember a  visionary business and civic leader who passed away on Saturday. John  Rowe once said ``there are two ways to become a CEO: Succeed your  boss--or find a company that's in a lot of trouble.''   John--never afraid of a challenge--took the harder of those two  routes. He came to Chicago in 1998, arriving as CEO of Unicom  Corporation, owner of Commonwealth Edison. Com Ed was in sorry shape  back then. Things got so bad that the city was considering a move to  buy its own electrical system. Over the next 14 years, John transformed  Unicom into Exelon, the largest electric parent company America.   He was a Republican who believed in the science behind climate change  and staked his company's future on his belief that money could be made  through ``clean, reliable and affordable energy.'' He was among the  first CEOs in the industry to focus on climate change, first testifying  before Congress on the potential effects of carbon emissions in 1992.  Under his leadership, Exelon became the first utility to join the U.S.  Climate Action Partnership, a group of businesses advocating for  Federal legislation that required significant reductions of greenhouse  gas emissions.   He believed that truly successful leaders should be active beyond  their businesses. So he invested his time and personal wealth back into  the community. Along with his wife Jeanne and their son Bill, he  established the Rowe Family Charitable Trust. He and Jeanne also  cofounded two public charter schools in Chicago--and visited them  frequently. He worked with universities, especially the University of  Wisconsin, his alma mater, and supported museums, including the Chicago  History Museum and the Illinois Holocaust Museum.   I especially admired John for his strong support of Dreamers and  immigrants. He was conservative, but he was mystified by the opposition  of many of his fellow conservatives to creating a pathway to  citizenship for immigrants. ``When did it become conservative to say  people can't work and can't pay taxes?'' he asked.   He cofounded the American Business Immigration Council, a coalition  of business leaders supporting comprehensive immigration reform. He  said that creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who want to  work and contribute to this country: ``economically important,  politically smart, and morally right.''   When he mentored young immigrants, he found it difficult to explain  why they should go to college in a country where they will not be able  to work legally. So he supported the Dream Act. He also supported DACA,  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that has granted  work permits and protection from deportation to more than 800,000  immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.   In a speech he gave shortly after he stepped down as Exelon's CEO in  2012, John said there are just a few attributes of successful  leadership, among them were an unflagging commitment to continuous  learning, an ability to act despite uncertainty, and ``leading  somewhere worth going.''   From helping to show the way to a future of cleaner American energy,  to fixing our immigration system so that  [[Page S5529]]  it supports our economy and honors our heritage, John Rowe spent his  life leading. He was a visionary leader, and I am proud to have called  him a friend.   Loretta and I send our deepest condolences to John's wife Jeanne,  their son Bill, and to the countless people whose lives he made better.  He will be missed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last month, Attorney General Garland made  one of his most important decisions yet as head of the Justice  Department: He appointed a new Director to the Federal Bureau of  Prisons.   Now, why is that a big deal? Because for years, the Bureau of  Prisons--which is charged with care of more than 140,000 adults in  custody--has been plagued by corruption, chronic mismanagement, and  misconduct reaching all the way to the top of the Agency. Under the  former Director--Michael Carvajal--the Bureau of Prisons turned a blind  eye to numerous allegations of sexual abuse, criminal conduct, and even  torture and murder. Time and again, former Director Carvajal refused to  hold his own employees accountable, and he repeatedly failed to  implement much-needed reforms to our Federal prison system. These  failures not only jeopardized the lives of adults being held in Federal  custody--but also the lives of the nearly 35,000 Americans who work in  BOP facilities every day.   Fortunately, as of last month, the Bureau finally has a chance at a  fresh start. Earlier today, the Judiciary Committee welcomed the  Bureau's newly appointed Director, Colette Peters, who testified about  her vision for America's Federal prison system. And based on her  testimony, I am hopeful that her leadership will mark a critical  turning point for the Bureau of Prisons. Director Peters shares my  belief that the top priority for the Bureau can be summed up in one  word: reform.   She is a reform-minded leader who is committed to clearing out the  bureaucratic rot that has festered for far too long. And unlike her  predecessor, Director Peters has not spent her career climbing the  rungs within the Bureau's bureaucracy. She has been putting in the work  of building a better justice system in her home State of Oregon.   Over the past decade, Director Peters served as the head of Oregon's  Department of Corrections. In this role, she pioneered a new model for  the State's correctional system--one that, I hope, she will bring to  the Bureau of Prisons--she calls it ``The Oregon Way.'' The Oregon Way  is centered around ``prioritizing employee health and well-being by  normalizing the correctional environment and, in turn, improving the  outcomes for incarcerated people.''   Director Peters was inspired to develop this model after she traveled  to Norway, where she visited six of the country's prisons. She saw for  herself how a rehabilitation-focused prison system can help prepare  incarcerated people for successful reentry into society--and ultimately  reduce recidivism rates.   And as director of Oregon's Department of Corrections, she  implemented some promising reforms to the State's prisons, like  dismantling death row and rearranging housing areas to prevent  correctional officers from spending long shifts alone.   Director Peters' vision for a rehabilitative, humane correctional  system is exactly what the Bureau of Prisons needs at this moment. But  let's also be clear: The grave, systemic problems within the Agency  won't end with the appointment of a new Director.   This challenge is far too complex for any one person to solve--no  matter how noble their intentions may be. And as chair of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I give the American people my word: We will be  watching the Bureau like a hawk. Our oversight role has never been more  important.   That is why yesterday--in anticipation of her appearance before the  Judiciary Committee--Representative David Trone and I led a number of  our colleagues in sending Director Peters a letter.   In it, we urged her to take immediate action in reducing the use of  restrictive housing, also known as solitary confinement. It should be  one of the first steps she takes as Director. Appallingly, the Bureau  of Prisons has made a habit of throwing prisoners into solitary  confinement, an almost medieval practice that should be, in the words  of the Justice Department, ``used rarely, applied fairly, and subjected  to reasonable constraints.''   But former Director Carvajal repeatedly ignored that recommendation,  and right now, on any given day, more than 10,000 people within BOP-- nearly 8 percent of the entire Federal prison population--are being  held in some form of solitary confinement. That is inhumane--and  unconscionable.   Ten years ago, I chaired the first-ever congressional hearing on  solitary confinement. One of the witnesses was an exonerated formerly  incarcerated person named Anthony Graves. He was wrongfully convicted  for a murder he did not commit. During his time in prison, Mr. Graves-- an innocent man--spent 16 years in solitary confinement. Imagine that:  being held in isolation, in a cage the fraction of the size of this  Senate floor, for 16 years.   Mr. Graves told the members of the committee, ``Solitary confinement  does one thing, it breaks a man's will to live. . . . I have been free  for almost two years and I still cry at night, because no one out here  can relate to what I have gone through.'' ``I battle with feelings of  loneliness. I've tried therapy but it didn't work.''   I know that Director Peters understands that solitary confinement can  cause severe mental anguish for adults in custody. As director of the  Oregon Department of Corrections, she made important progress in  reducing the use of restrictive housing in facilities across the State.  I trust that she will work to do the same at BOP.   After that 2012 hearing, the Obama administration took some  encouraging steps to reform and reduce the use of restricted housing in  the Federal prison system. Unfortunately, under the Trump  administration, that progress stalled, and the rate of individuals in  solitary confinement steadily increased. The Biden administration has  committed to addressing this, and Director Peters made clear today that  it will be one of her priorities.   But it is also the responsibility of lawmakers in Congress to improve  our Nation's laws regarding the use of solitary confinement and ensure  that a change in administrations will never  [[Page S5549]]  again lead to an increase in this harmful practice.   Today, I am reintroducing a piece of legislation--with my friend and  fellow committee member Chris Coons--that does just that: the Solitary  Confinement Reform Act. We first introduced this bill back in 2016, and  we have reintroduced it in every Congress since. That is how important  it is. It will require the Bureau of Prisons to limit the use of  solitary to the briefest terms--under the least restrictive conditions  possible. And it will improve access to mental health care services for  individuals who have been held in solitary.   As we turn a new page at the Bureau of Prisons with Director Peters,  I can think of no better way to begin reforming the agency than by  passing the Solitary Confinement Reform Act. Let's finally build a  justice system that actually rehabilitates adults in custody and  prepares them for successful reentry into society.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 5038         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

A bill to provide benefits for noncitizen members of the  Armed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. President, last month, Attorney General Garland made  one of his most important decisions yet as head of the Justice  Department: He appointed a new Director to the Federal Bureau of  Prisons.   Now, why is that a big deal? Because for years, the Bureau of  Prisons--which is charged with care of more than 140,000 adults in  custody--has been plagued by corruption, chronic mismanagement, and  misconduct reaching all the way to the top of the Agency. Under the  former Director--Michael Carvajal--the Bureau of Prisons turned a blind  eye to numerous allegations of sexual abuse, criminal conduct, and even  torture and murder. Time and again, former Director Carvajal refused to  hold his own employees accountable, and he repeatedly failed to  implement much-needed reforms to our Federal prison system. These  failures not only jeopardized the lives of adults being held in Federal  custody--but also the lives of the nearly 35,000 Americans who work in  BOP facilities every day.   Fortunately, as of last month, the Bureau finally has a chance at a  fresh start. Earlier today, the Judiciary Committee welcomed the  Bureau's newly appointed Director, Colette Peters, who testified about  her vision for America's Federal prison system. And based on her  testimony, I am hopeful that her leadership will mark a critical  turning point for the Bureau of Prisons. Director Peters shares my  belief that the top priority for the Bureau can be summed up in one  word: reform.   She is a reform-minded leader who is committed to clearing out the  bureaucratic rot that has festered for far too long. And unlike her  predecessor, Director Peters has not spent her career climbing the  rungs within the Bureau's bureaucracy. She has been putting in the work  of building a better justice system in her home State of Oregon.   Over the past decade, Director Peters served as the head of Oregon's  Department of Corrections. In this role, she pioneered a new model for  the State's correctional system--one that, I hope, she will bring to  the Bureau of Prisons--she calls it ``The Oregon Way.'' The Oregon Way  is centered around ``prioritizing employee health and well-being by  normalizing the correctional environment and, in turn, improving the  outcomes for incarcerated people.''   Director Peters was inspired to develop this model after she traveled  to Norway, where she visited six of the country's prisons. She saw for  herself how a rehabilitation-focused prison system can help prepare  incarcerated people for successful reentry into society--and ultimately  reduce recidivism rates.   And as director of Oregon's Department of Corrections, she  implemented some promising reforms to the State's prisons, like  dismantling death row and rearranging housing areas to prevent  correctional officers from spending long shifts alone.   Director Peters' vision for a rehabilitative, humane correctional  system is exactly what the Bureau of Prisons needs at this moment. But  let's also be clear: The grave, systemic problems within the Agency  won't end with the appointment of a new Director.   This challenge is far too complex for any one person to solve--no  matter how noble their intentions may be. And as chair of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, I give the American people my word: We will be  watching the Bureau like a hawk. Our oversight role has never been more  important.   That is why yesterday--in anticipation of her appearance before the  Judiciary Committee--Representative David Trone and I led a number of  our colleagues in sending Director Peters a letter.   In it, we urged her to take immediate action in reducing the use of  restrictive housing, also known as solitary confinement. It should be  one of the first steps she takes as Director. Appallingly, the Bureau  of Prisons has made a habit of throwing prisoners into solitary  confinement, an almost medieval practice that should be, in the words  of the Justice Department, ``used rarely, applied fairly, and subjected  to reasonable constraints.''   But former Director Carvajal repeatedly ignored that recommendation,  and right now, on any given day, more than 10,000 people within BOP-- nearly 8 percent of the entire Federal prison population--are being  held in some form of solitary confinement. That is inhumane--and  unconscionable.   Ten years ago, I chaired the first-ever congressional hearing on  solitary confinement. One of the witnesses was an exonerated formerly  incarcerated person named Anthony Graves. He was wrongfully convicted  for a murder he did not commit. During his time in prison, Mr. Graves-- an innocent man--spent 16 years in solitary confinement. Imagine that:  being held in isolation, in a cage the fraction of the size of this  Senate floor, for 16 years.   Mr. Graves told the members of the committee, ``Solitary confinement  does one thing, it breaks a man's will to live. . . . I have been free  for almost two years and I still cry at night, because no one out here  can relate to what I have gone through.'' ``I battle with feelings of  loneliness. I've tried therapy but it didn't work.''   I know that Director Peters understands that solitary confinement can  cause severe mental anguish for adults in custody. As director of the  Oregon Department of Corrections, she made important progress in  reducing the use of restrictive housing in facilities across the State.  I trust that she will work to do the same at BOP.   After that 2012 hearing, the Obama administration took some  encouraging steps to reform and reduce the use of restricted housing in  the Federal prison system. Unfortunately, under the Trump  administration, that progress stalled, and the rate of individuals in  solitary confinement steadily increased. The Biden administration has  committed to addressing this, and Director Peters made clear today that  it will be one of her priorities.   But it is also the responsibility of lawmakers in Congress to improve  our Nation's laws regarding the use of solitary confinement and ensure  that a change in administrations will never  [[Page S5549]]  again lead to an increase in this harmful practice.   Today, I am reintroducing a piece of legislation--with my friend and  fellow committee member Chris Coons--that does just that: the Solitary  Confinement Reform Act. We first introduced this bill back in 2016, and  we have reintroduced it in every Congress since. That is how important  it is. It will require the Bureau of Prisons to limit the use of  solitary to the briefest terms--under the least restrictive conditions  possible. And it will improve access to mental health care services for  individuals who have been held in solitary.   As we turn a new page at the Bureau of Prisons with Director Peters,  I can think of no better way to begin reforming the agency than by  passing the Solitary Confinement Reform Act. Let's finally build a  justice system that actually rehabilitates adults in custody and  prepares them for successful reentry into society.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 5038         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
