 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   This is a serious issue. Some would say it is an issue about freedom,  about individual integrity, as to who makes choices. I hear a lot about  freedom, about government not interfering.   Madam Speaker, millions of women across our country and the men who  stand with them are in shock and outrage at the new law in Texas and  the Supreme Court's refusal to block it from taking effect. Texas  senate bill 8 bans any abortion after 6 weeks. That is, of course,  before most women know that they are pregnant.   It includes no exceptions for rape or incest. What do you think the  psychological impact on the health of a woman is if you don't think  this is about the health of women?   As many as 90 percent of women seeking reproductive care in Texas do  so after 6 weeks, meaning that this law effectively bans women in the  State from accessing the full range of reproductive care that they are  guaranteed under Roe v. Wade. Now, my presumption is, of course, most  speaking against this are not for and didn't support and would like to  see Roe v. Wade repealed.   Also deeply disturbing is the way senate bill 8 is enforced. The law  gives any private individual the authority to police any of their  fellow citizens whom they suspect may be providing for or receiving  reproductive care. How draconian, how communistic, how authoritarian  such a scheme is.   This vigilante system is at odds with the values of American  democracy, reminiscent of the kind of tactics previously used behind  the Iron Curtain and still employed by totalitarian regimes.   The bill before us today would enshrine in statute the rights women  are guaranteed under Roe v. Wade that the majority of Americans support  at a time when they are increasingly under attack.   Statistics released in June by the Guttmacher Institute showed that  over 500 bills restricting women's healthcare access had already been  introduced since the start of this year in State legislatures; and as  of last month, nearly 100 of those had been enacted.   The policies enacted by senate bill 8 and similar measures in other  States under Republican control not only have the effect of eliminating  access to reproductive choice, but also to a range of lifesaving  healthcare services for women, particularly for low-income women.   This will probably not affect many wealthy women who can get in their  car or get on the airplane and go wherever they might go. So opposition  to this bill is directly discriminatory to women of less means to their  healthcare. These range from cancer screenings to prenatal visits; from  treating injuries to referring patients to counseling after trauma like  sexual assault.   According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, nearly 90 percent of  American counties do not have a single reproductive care provider.   For many women, the health clinics that provide these services are  their primary source of healthcare. Measures like senate bill 8 are  forcing many of these clinics to shut down.   Our country ought to be working to expand these resources for women,  not make the healthcare harder to access.   We know that S.B. 8 and similar laws being enacted across the country  will not stop women from seeking the full range of reproductive care.  You know that. Back to the hanger, perhaps, and the death of scores,  thousands, perhaps, of women who see no alternative.   The Women's Health Protection Act is a necessary response to  Republicans' efforts to make it harder for women to access healthcare  across the country. I thank Judy Chu for leading this effort. I am  grateful to Congresswoman Chu for authoring this legislation and  championing this cause.   I am the father of three daughters, the grandfather of two  granddaughters, and the great-grandfather of three great- granddaughters. I, frankly, do not want any of us making decisions for  their healthcare.   Democrats are committed to taking action to secure Roe v. Wade and to  protect women's access to reproductive healthcare no matter where they  live.   The Women's Health Protection Act is a critical step in securing that  ability for millions of American women, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for  morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m.  for morning-hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider several bills under suspension  of the rules. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced  by the close of business today.   Mr. Speaker, the Budget Committee has announced a markup for the  Build  [[Page H5160]]  Back Better Act for tomorrow and Saturday. It is my intention to bring  it to the floor next week.   This legislation will help move tens of millions of Americans closer  to economic security while also making transformational investments in  making childcare more affordable, helping Americans access healthcare,  and addressing climate change with the seriousness that it deserves and  demands.   On September 27, pursuant to the rule passed on August 24, the House  will consider the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This  legislation passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis last month and  would create millions of good jobs all across America by investing in  critical infrastructure.   That bill and the Build Back Better America Act are the essence of  the vision and program that has been proposed by President Biden,  which, as I said, will grow millions of jobs and make the lives of  Americans more secure and safer.   Mr. Speaker, if time allows, the House may also consider three bills  from the Committee on Education and Labor:   H.R. 3110, the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act, which amends the Fair  Labor Standards Act to provide workplace protections for mothers to  pump breast milk in the workplace.   H.R. 3992, the Protect Older Job Applicants Act, which allows  applicants to bring a disparate claim under the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act of 1967 when they experience age discrimination while  seeking a job.   In addition, H.R. 2119, the Family Violence Prevention and Services  Improvement Act of 2021, which modifies, expands, and reauthorizes the  fiscal year 2026 Family Violence and Prevention Services program, which  funds emergency shelters and supports related assistance for victims of  domestic violence.   Mr. Speaker, lastly, there may be additional legislative items as  possible and as necessary.    The Budget Committee is going to take it up tomorrow. They  don't need a CBO score for that. The Budget Committee chairman is  seeking a CBO score as soon as that can be attained, but I don't know  that particular date that that will occur.   Clearly, this bill has been under consideration for a very long  period of time, and the President proposed it a very long time ago, in  the early part of this year. So it is something that the CBO has been  considering, that the committee has been considering. Hopefully, the  CBO can produce a score relatively quickly. But I don't, in answer to  the gentleman's question, have a specific time or date.    Mr. Speaker, it is my expectation that we will be getting  a score. I want to tell the gentleman it is also my understanding that  the expenditures that will be proposed will be paid for.    New revenue.    As I said, the Committee on Ways and Means and the  Committee on Finance have worked on revenues to pay for what we are  going to buy so that we do not create additional debt. That is my view,  that they continue to have that intention.    There are use taxes on a lot of things, and there are also corporate  taxes in that bill. There are some additional revenue items in that  bill as well. But I can't tell you exactly because they have not  offered a manager's amendment, which I expect to have offered at the  Committee on Rules. That does not come out of the Budget Committee, as  the gentleman knows.   The Budget Committee is going to put together the 12 bills and send  them to the Committee on Rules, and then the Committee on Rules will  act on them. I expect a manager's amendment, but I cannot predict for  the gentleman what that manager's amendment will be at this point in  time.    It is possible.    Well, we have to see what the Budget Committee does  tomorrow.    We all will.    We will have to see how the debate goes on Monday, see how  long that takes.    I have advised Members that, obviously, we have a lot of  work to do and that we have scheduled a number of workweeks, committee  workweeks--which, by the way, I think have been very successful. We  started those in June of last year, and I think they worked out very  well, giving the committees an opportunity to meet uninterrupted by  having to come to the floor.   With votes, as we know, we continue to have the challenge not only of  COVID but the variant, an additional illness spike, so we are still  having votes longer than we otherwise would have. So I think that those  work periods have worked very well, and there are some scheduled for  October.   But I have also advised Members that we have a lot of work to do, and  if we need more legislative time, we will provide for that, and Members  will get sufficient notice for that. But I did want to put them on  notice that we may have to have more floor time than is currently  provided for by the committee workweek schedule.   But as soon as we have a sense of when those days will be needed, we  will let Members know.    Well, obviously, the government funding authority ends on  September 30 at midnight, the end of the fiscal year, and it would be  our intention to deal with whatever bill the Senate sends back to us-- if, in fact, they do not take our bill--as soon as it comes to us.   We believe that it is absolutely essential not to shut down  government, which is costly, disrupts the lives of the American people  and those who are expecting services, and is irresponsible.   Even more irresponsible is not increasing the debt limit. I have been  saddened on a regular basis that our Republican colleagues are prepared  to vote for debt limits when you have a Republican President and not  when you have a Democratic President, as if somehow it is the President  that creates the debt.   The President doesn't create the debt. The Congress creates the debt.  This is not for debt that we may create in the future. It is for debt  that we have already created, either by cutting taxes, therefore  cutting revenues, or by spending money.   As you know, the debt limit was substantially increased under the  Trump administration in a bipartisan way. But unlike this year,  Democrats joined with Republicans to ensure that the full faith and  credit of the United States of America was not put at risk. And the  President of the United States signed that legislation, a Republican  President.   So it is, I think, very sad that our Republican friends did not join  every Democrat in saying we will not put at risk the full faith and  credit of the United States for debts that have been incurred.   Now, I have been here for some time, and just in terms of the public  debt going up, under Bush 1, it went up 55 percent; Clinton, 37  percent; Bush 2, 86 percent; Obama, 88 percent; Trump, 39 percent.                                time  1215    Now, obviously, those figures all are based on a lower base than  their successor had, but it is interesting that under Ronald Reagan,  the debt went up 189 percent, and he signed every one of those. And he  also urged us not to put the credit at risk.   In addition, on September 8, 2017, the Republican-controlled House  voted 316-90 to suspend the debt limit through December 8, 2017, under  a deal endorsed by President Trump. The ``yea'' votes included Majority  Leader Kevin McCarthy, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, and  Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers.   Again, on September 8, the Republican-controlled Senate voted 80-17  to suspend the debt limit through December 8, 2017. The ``yea'' votes  included Majority Leader McConnell, Majority Whip Cornyn, Finance  Chairman Hatch, and GOP Conference Chair John Thune all voting in favor  of that.   In addition, on February 9, 2018, a year later, the Republican- controlled House voted 240-186 to suspend the debt limit through March  1, 2019. Voting ``yea'' were Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Majority  Whip   Steve Scalise, Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady, GOP  Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, all voting for the measure.   Leader McConnell has stated that it would be irresponsible not to  extend either the date or the amount of the debt limit. The business  roundtable has said this: Failure to let the U.S. Federal debt limit to  meet the U.S. obligations would produce an otherwise avoidable crisis  and pose unacceptable risk to the Nation's economic growth, job  creation, and financial markets. Goldman Sachs has essentially said the  same thing, the American Bankers Association, and numerous other  organizations that I can mention.   So I am sorry that earlier this week the Republicans voted  unanimously against keeping the government open and making sure that we  did not compromise the full faith and credit of the United States of  America. But I will assure the gentleman, as soon as a bill is sent  back from the Senate, that we will take that up. I hope it is a  responsible bill.   I hope it does what Senator McConnell, under President Donald Trump,  said ought to be done. Perhaps now that we have a Democratic President,  somehow the fiscal responsibility does not seem as important as it did  when Donald Trump was President, and I think that is unfortunate.   I, personally, by the way, think that the debt issue is a phony  issue. There are only very, very few countries that have a debt limit.  The debt limit is decided when we spend money or cut revenues, not in  some other venue. And once we do that, the assumption ought to be, and  I think has been, that we are going to pay our debts as a country.   And the only time we came close to not doing that was about a little  less than 10 years ago, and for the first time since I have been a  Member of Congress, which is over 40 years, the rating of the United  States was reduced, minisculely, but nevertheless reduced. A shocking  consequence of playing games with the debt limit.   So I would hope that my friend would urge his party to not treat this  as either a political issue or partisan issue, and would treat it as  the issue it is, an issue of the fiscal responsibility and full faith  and credit to the United States of America.    Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   It is hard to respond, Mr. Speaker, to a not-responsive issue on why  we are not voting to extend the debt limit. McConnell said he wasn't  going to vote for the debt limit long before there was anything about  Iron Dome. In fact, we passed Iron Dome. We passed it overwhelmingly  with over 420 votes. It is now over in the Senate, and I hope they pass  it immediately, which would, by the way, be faster than they would have  done the CR.   Having said that, the gentleman voted for $5 trillion of debt in  2020. It wasn't paid for. We were confronting a great crisis called  COVID-19. And in a bipartisan way, we passed $5.4 trillion of spending,  the largest amount of spending, I think, in any year that I have been  in this Congress.   We did it in a bipartisan way with the expectation that we would  borrow that money to meet the emergency that confronted us, and that we  would pay for that debt. It didn't have anything to do with politics.  It didn't have anything to do with who was President of the United  States. And all that verbiage was to mask the fact that, frankly, my  Republican friends don't like voting to pay the bills.   They do like to cut revenues, whether or not they balance the budget.  And the good news, from their standpoint, was they inherited an economy  that was going up incrementally every year.   The gentleman talks about jobs on his tax bill. Under President  Obama, who inherited a tanking economy from George Bush, not  withstanding the tax cuts that they had effected, during the Obama  administration we created 10,838,000 jobs. During the Trump  administration 6,688 net jobs. About 35 percent less. But that is  irrelevant, it is a smokescreen. It is to distract.   The fact of the matter is we have incurred debt, we have incurred it  in a bipartisan way. Whether the objective was defense or whether it  was domestic or tax cuts, we created the debt on behalf of the United  States of America. We borrowed money and we said to our creditors: we  will pay you back.   It had nothing to do with Iron Dome. The Republicans had said if the  debt limit was in there, they weren't going to vote for it. They were  not going to take responsibility for the debt that they, in a  bipartisan way, $5.4 trillion last year, incurred, signed by Donald  Trump.   Donald Trump could have stopped every nickel of that money from being  spent. He did not. It was a bipartisan agreement.                                time  1230    I believe, although I don't have the figures in front of me, that Mr.  Scalise voted for every one of those bills. He can correct me if I am  wrong on that.   But the debt limit is a pretense that somehow if you vote against  raising the debt limit you will somehow, Mr. Speaker, solve the debt  problem of the United States.   No. The way you solve that is paying your bills.   I would urge the gentleman--I don't know what is going to come back  from the Senate, but I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, my experience has  been, particularly over the last, about 15 years, it has been Democrats  who have responded to the fiscal responsibility call of Republican  Speakers--Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan--who couldn't get the majority of  Republicans in their own party to vote for their bill exercising fiscal  responsibility. I am proud to say that Democrats were there on behalf  of bills sponsored, essentially--I don't know the name of the sponsor  on the bill--but supported by both Speaker Boehner and Speaker Ryan. I  don't have those figures in front of me, but I can bring them up  perhaps next time we talk.   So I would urge my friend, let's get off this political Biden this  or--I don't even know if any of those bills have passed because I don't  know what list he is reading from, but, Mr. Speaker, he lists the names  of bills in Congress.   We passed the rescue plan but got no Republicans on that.   Why?   Because we were over having a Republican President. So now a  Democratic President was trying to make  [[Page H5163]]  sure that this country didn't fall through the floorboards, that our  small businesses didn't fall through the floorboards, that our families  and individuals didn't fall through the floorboards, and that our  childcare providers didn't fall through the floorboards. So they were  through voting for those bills. They were voting for them when Trump  was President but stopped voting for them when Biden was President. I  get that. But the debt limit is about all of us. It is about our  country.   Very frankly, as Goldman Sachs and the Business Roundtable and others  have said, it is about the global economy. It is about jobs. It is  about working men and women having jobs and America being competitive  with the rest of the world. That is what the debt limit is about, and  that is what the Business Roundtable is saying, not one of our spokes- organs. That is what the Chamber of Commerce is saying.   So, yes, we can argue the specifics, the 4 million less jobs were  created under Trump than were created under Obama. We can talk about  that. We can talk about a larger debt under Trump in terms of actual  dollars. I am not going to talk about that.   Why?   Because we incurred them together because we needed to do so because  our country was in trouble and our people were in trouble.   So I will tell the gentleman we are going to--his question was, in  case we all forgot it, we probably did--that we are going to deal with  the bill that comes back because we are absolutely committed to making  sure that the full faith and credit of the United States is not put at  risk.    I have different facts.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I will not characterize the substance of that argument. However, I  believe it has no merit, Mr. Speaker, none, zero, zip.   It is as if we Democrats, when we voted three times to assure that we  didn't violate the debt limit under Donald Trump, as if we would say:  Well, this is not our debt, this was, after all, the debt of the tax  cut of 2017, so we shouldn't pay this.   In fact, the debt, of course, like family debt, is not necessarily  for the car, for the mortgage, or for the clothes that we bought for  our children to go back to school. It is a cumulative debt, a  cumulative debt that--by the way, under Democratic Presidents since  President Truman--were increased 24 percent; under Republicans since  Truman, 45 percent.    It would be ridiculous, Mr. Speaker, for me to say: Well, I am only  going to pay for this debt, that debt, and this debt that I agree with.   Of course, the $5.4 trillion that Mr. Scalise and I voted for in 2020  is a part of the debt that we need to have to service now. In fact,  what we of course did, we didn't increase the debt limit per se because  politically that was very controversial because people demagogue it. So  what we did was we changed the date, which is a ruse, which is a  political sleight of hand. It has the same exact effect.   So, Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, the argument that it is not my  debt and your debt and this--in fact, most of those bills haven't  passed and haven't created any debt yet. I don't know the list, so I  don't know whether they have been passed or some have passed. I  presume, obviously, the rescue plan did pass, it wasn't paid for. Of  course, it was approximately 30 percent of what Mr. Scalise and I voted  for in 2020.   But, nevertheless, the debt is the debt; and not to support making  sure that America legally can pay that debt is irresponsible.    I don't know the status of those bills. I will check on  the status of those bills.   Let me say, Mr. Speaker, there is a tragedy occurring at our border.  There are people in grievous circumstances and in unbearable danger in  their home countries. That has been a case for some period of time, and  we have some very bad people taking advantage of that and promising  them a free route to America, taking advantage of that pain, that  suffering, and that fear that so many people have, in this case  Haitians who fled their own country, presumably many of them after an  extraordinary earthquake and they are living in places that are not  their homes.   We all talk about it, and we all believe that America is the greatest  [[Page H5164]]  country on the face of the Earth. It is. Therefore, it is not  surprising that people who are in pain and grieving and are concerned  for the future of their children want to come to the United States of  America. But, clearly, we cannot take all of the people who would like  to come to America.   Therefore, we need a system because America is made up of immigrants.  It has been made strong by immigrants. It has been made successful by  immigrants. It has been made a great country by immigrants.   My own father came from Denmark at the age of 32 in 1934. Almost  everybody who serves in this House, some are immigrants themselves who  came themselves to the country. Some at 2 years of age and some at  other ages.   The gentleman is correct. We need to deal with this. We need to deal  with it in a humanitarian way, in a way that honors our values and  respect for individual lives and individual persons. That is one of the  great, great differences that we celebrate in America, the importance  that we put on the individual.    We said that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are  created equal--today we clearly would say all men and women--and  endowed not by us, not by our Constitution, and not by our laws, but by  God. We have some of God's children who are fearful, scared, and  running, running to a safer place. And that place for almost all the  world is America.   So we have a responsibility, Mr. Speaker, to adopt a rational,  comprehensive immigration reform regime where people will know the  rules of coming to America. They will know the rules of how you apply,  how you are processed, and how you are vetted. Whether you are coming  here because you just want to come to America to succeed and to make  your family live in a better neighborhood called America, or you are  coming because your family and your are unsafe in the country in which  you then reside, we need comprehensive immigration reform.   I would be glad to work very closely with my friend, the Republican  whip from Louisiana, on seeing if we can get to that place because we  have all been talking about it, all of us.   I think there is not a person in this room--I don't know about in  this room, but over the years--who hasn't said our immigration system  is broken, who hasn't said we need secure borders, who hasn't said we  need secure borders and reveled in the fact that we are a nation of  immigrants who have made us stronger so that we can get to a place  where we pursue a rational policy for implementing that concept.   So I will tell my friend, I will look at those two or three pieces of  legislation he mentioned and talk to the committee chairs about their  status and let the gentleman know.
