 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to H.R. 4712.   This bill would allow the Federal Government to override a doctor's  medical judgment, without exception. It is motivated by politics, not  science.   First, this bill reiterates current law, which already protects all  newborns from medical negligence. Second, the criminal penalties in  this bill go above and beyond current law and are clearly intended to  intimidate doctors. This isn't sound medical practice. This is politics  impeding a doctor's medical judgment.   And what is more, this intimidation would endanger newborns. This  bill would require all newborn infants to be immediately transferred to  the nearest hospital, but not all hospitals have neonatal units, or it  might be harmful to move the infant immediately. Clearly, the intent is  not to protect newborns but to stir outrage.   This bill is a solution in search of a problem. It is unnecessary,  redundant, and part of a broader attack on women's health and  reproductive rights from this Chamber and the Trump administration.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
