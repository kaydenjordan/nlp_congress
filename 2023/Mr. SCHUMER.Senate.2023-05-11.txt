 Mr. President, with June 1 only 21 days away, the most  important thing congressional leaders can do to protect the well-being  of Americans is to say, loud and clear, default is off the table.   That is the assurance the President gave 2 days ago when he met with  congressional leaders. It is the assurance Leader Jeffries and myself  gave that day at the meeting, as well. Even Leader McConnell said the  United States will not default on the national debt.   Speaker McCarthy, however, continues on a path to drive the country  toward disaster. Instead of taking default off the table, Speaker  McCarthy is taking default hostage.   Let me say that again because that sums up what is happening right  now.   Instead of taking default off the table, Speaker McCarthy is taking  default hostage.   The strategy of the hard right remains ``our way or the highway.''  Either Americans accept devastating  [[Page S1610]]  cuts to veterans, law enforcement, and even cancer research, or the  hard right will allow default--what a terrible choice.   And that is what makes this default fight uniquely dangerous: The  hard right is dominant in the House, and they seem to be ready--seem to  be perfectly willing--to let the United States default.   Speaker McCarthy realizes his hard-right agenda--as embodied in their  ``Default on America Act''--cannot win support from the American people  on the merits. So he and the hard right are holding the country hostage  to default.   And if anyone doubts that the hard right is in control, all they have  to do is watch last night's CNN town hall, where former President  Donald Trump openly called on Republicans to ``do a default'' if they  cannot enact their hard-right agenda.   Never mind that, under Donald Trump's watch, Republicans agreed to  avoid default three times without ever getting hung up about unrelated  partisan priorities. And never mind that 25 percent--a quarter--of the  national debt was actually accumulated while President Trump was in  office.   He is openly calling on his party to destroy the economy if they  can't pass their radical agenda.   By now, of course, it is old news that Donald Trump is about as  qualified to run the country as a broken brick, but the danger here is  he holds enormous sway over Speaker McCarthy and the hard right.   If Donald Trump says that it is better for the United States to  default than it is for Republicans to compromise, that, unfortunately,  only makes default more likely.   Donald Trump's demand for default would cause tens of millions of  Americans to suffer.   This isn't difficult: Can we all clearly and unmistakably take  default off the table? Will Speaker McCarthy take default off the  table? He is the only one of the five of us who met at the White House  who has not answered that.   Speaker McCarthy, will you allow the hard right to keep pulling the  strings and push our country off a cliff, or will you make it clear  that, no matter what, we will preserve the full faith and credit of the  United States?   Look, we recognize that Republicans have objections about certain  policies, certain spending, certain investments. We do not agree with  them, but these discussions are a normal part of the budget process  that both sides have engaged in for a long time. This is too important  for brinksmanship and reckless ultimatums.   White House staff, along with my office, the Speaker's office, Leader  McConnell, and Leader Jeffries, will continue to meet in an attempt to  find a constructive way forward on the budget, appropriations  priorities.   If Speaker McCarthy is willing to state that, despite what Trump  says, default is off the table, there can be real progress on the  budget. Obviously, as the Speaker of the House, McCarthy will have some  real influence in that. But that progress should not and cannot be tied  to default.   I hope Americans take a moment to listen to the dangerous things  President Trump has said last night about default, because he exposed  just how unfit MAGA Republicans are for governing and how serious they  are about their threats.   (Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.)                             Military Nominations    Madam President, now, on military holds, I want to talk about the  profane and dangerous things a colleague of ours recently said on the  radio. For the past couple of months, hundreds of senior military  officers and their families have had their lives unnecessarily put on  hold because of a Senator from Alabama.   Senator Tuberville's actions are endangering our military readiness,  provoking reaction not just from the current Secretary of Defense but  from seven--seven--former Defense Secretaries from both parties.   And, earlier this week, new comments of his came to light where he  not only doubled down on his obstruction but also, apparently, bemoaned  the military's efforts to root out White nationalism from our Armed  Forces.   Let me read the exchange with Senator Tuberville because it is  shocking. During the interview, the Senator was asked:         Do you believe [the Defense Department] should allow White       nationalists in the military?    The Senator's response:         Well, they call them that. I call them Americans.    Can you believe that? Revolting--utterly revolting. Does Senator  Tuberville honestly believe that our military is stronger with White  nationalists in its ranks? I cannot believe this needs to be said, but  White nationalism has no place in our Armed Forces and no place in any  corner of American society. Period. Full stop. End of story.   I urge Senator Tuberville to think about the destructive spectacle he  is creating in the Senate. His actions are dangerous. His words are  gravely damaging, and his refusal to think about the consequences of  his actions on our military personnel and families is a stain upon this  Chamber.   Senators are called to a higher standard of conduct, but our  colleague from Alabama is dragging all of us down. And for what? To  push the hard right's party line on banning freedom of choice.   Senator Tuberville needs to do two things. He needs to come out and  state clearly and unequivocally that White nationalism is un-American,  and he needs to drop his destructive holds on hundreds of our senior  military leaders. This farce is endangering our national security and  putting the lives of men and women who have served our country for  decades in real trouble, and it needs to end.                          Business Before the Senate    Madam President, now on Senate business, it has been a very, very  busy week on and off the Senate floor. There is so much going on in the  country that it may have overshadowed the fact that it has been an  extremely busy week and much is being accomplished this week.   On the floor, we confirmed more of President Biden's appointees to  important positions across the government. And today, we will vote to  advance Bradley Garcia to serve as a circuit court judge for the DC  Circuit, one of the most important Federal courts in the country,  teeing up his nomination for Monday when the Senate returns.   Off the floor, our committees are hard at work holding hearings and  advancing important nominees and legislation. The Commerce Committee  yesterday moved the Railway Safety Act, sponsored by Senators Brown and  Vance of Ohio, out of committee and with bipartisan support. I thank  the Senators from Ohio and Senators Casey around Fetterman from  Pennsylvania and other cosponsors for their work on this bill after the  derailment in East Palestine.   I look forward to working with them to bring it to the floor for a  vote. Today, the HELP Committee is holding a hearing on our bipartisan  cannabis legislation, the SAFE Banking Act. We made a lot of good  bipartisan progress on SAFE Banking last Congress, and the work is  continuing. And there is also a markup today in the HELP Committee on  legislation for PBM reform, which could lead to lower costs of insulin  for non-Medicare Americans.   It has been a very busy week in the Senate on very important issues  that affect us all: rail safety, SAFE Banking, making growing and  selling marijuana safe, and PBM reform, which can lead to reduction of  insulin costs for non-Medicare people. We will keep moving ahead with  our work to support the American people and reward the trust they  placed in us.                  Anniversary of Buffalo, New York, Shooting    Madam President, finally, on the shooting in Buffalo a year ago, this  weekend, the hearts of every single American will be with the ``City of  Good Neighbors,'' Buffalo, NY. At 2:30 in the afternoon on Saturday,  May 14, of last year, in a predominantly Black neighborhood on  Buffalo's east side, 10 lives were cut short from the worst shooting in  Buffalo history--10 beautiful Americans. We will never get them back.  They were parents, they were sons and daughters, friends, security  guards, a policeman--all taken away from us in just minutes.   I am going to read their names: Ruth Whitfield, Roberta Drury, Aaron  Salter, Jr., Heyward Patterson, Pearl Young, Geraldine Talley,  Celestine Chaney, ``Kat'' Massey, Margus Morrison, Andre Mackneil.  [[Page S1611]]    God bless their memories.   I don't know what could possess someone to bring violence to a place  like that. But I do know that the Buffalo shooting was a manifestation  of the original sin of this Nation, the legacy of slavery and the  centuries of racial hatred that continue to poison our society.   It is also one of the worst examples in recent memory of another  terrible epidemic in this Nation, the epidemic of gun violence. We have  made important progress in the area of gun violence. Last year, in the  wake of what happened in Buffalo and Uvalde, the Senate came together  in a way that it hadn't for decades, beating back the dark forces of  the NRA and passing the first gun safety bill in more than a quarter  century. Some of the friends and relatives of those who passed away in  Buffalo were instrumental in importuning us to pass this legislation,  and I thank them for it, for lighting that candle.   But we have a long way to go and a lot of work to do before our job  is done. Gun violence is a shameful blemish on this Nation. We cannot  allow ourselves to tolerate it. Indifference on this subject has been a  death sentence for too many Americans.   Finally, Madam President, today the Senate will meet for a special  caucus to talk about the next steps on gun violence. While nobody  pretends progress will come easily, we have a moral obligation to keep  pushing, keep fighting, keep working to rid this Nation of gun  violence.   May God bless Buffalo and bless all the families impacted by the  tragedy 1 year ago.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, before I do the wrap-up and lay down some  stuff we are doing next week, I would like to talk about the week we  just had.   As Democrats here in the Senate work to continue to avoid default,  the No. 1 issue affecting our country has also been a very productive  week in the Senate. So much has happened around the country over the  past few days that it may have overshadowed just how busy things have  been in the Senate this week and the kind of productive week that we  have had on many important issues that affect the American people. I am  very proud of what we were able to accomplish.   On the floor, with the return of Senator Feinstein, the Senate today  advanced Bradley Garcia to serve as circuit court judge for the DC  Circuit--one of the most important Federal courts in the country--and  Members should be ready to vote on confirmation come Monday. That is  probably the second-most important court in the country, and we are  appointing a very good person as circuit court judge there.   Off the floor, the Judiciary Committee was busy as well. The  Judiciary Committee just reported out six more judicial nominees for  lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. Judges were a top priority  last Congress, and they remain a top priority in this Congress. We are  hoping to move forward on many more judges.   Also, yesterday, the Commerce Committee, under the able leadership of  Maria Cantwell, also reported out the Railway Safety Act--sponsored by  Senators Brown and Vance of Ohio--with bipartisan support. This is  significant. After the derailment of East Palestine, the need for the  rail safety reform became clear as day, and Americans are demanding  that the Senate take action.   The Railway Safety Act is a major step forward for avoiding accidents  similar to the one in East Palestine and improving rail safety across  the country. It is going to make all our railroads safer. We have all  seen so many of these derailments, often because the railroads weren't  doing what they were supposed to. This act is a big step forward in  requiring them to do so. I look forward to working with both sides to  bring the Railway Safety Act to the floor.   And, today, the Senate Banking Committee also held a hearing, a big  step on our bipartisan SAFE Banking Act that we have worked on  together, Mr. President.   The SAFE Banking Act would ensure cannabis businesses have equal  access to critical banking infrastructure in States that have legalized  cannabis. We have all heard the tales of small businesses, and even  larger ones, walking around with a huge amount of cash because they  can't do banking. SAFE Banking would change that and allow them to bank  as other businesses because it is legal in many States.   And I am working to ensure we include criminal justice provisions in  SAFE Banking Plus--most importantly, the expungement of criminal  records for certain low-level marijuana offenses.   We have made a lot of good bipartisan progress on SAFE Banking last  Congress. And after today's hearing, we hope there will be a markup on  this bill in the near future. We are really moving forward in a record  way on a very important issue.   Finally, last, but certainly not least, the HELP Committee also  advanced PBM and generic drug-pricing reform. It will reform the PBM  system, which we know is one of the reasons the cost of drugs is so  high. Hopefully, with the reform, the cost of prescription drugs like  insulin for non-Medicare Americans will come down. We reduced insulin  to $35 for those on Medicare, but we need to work on reducing insulin  costs for everybody, and this bill is a major step forward in that  direction.   So it has been a busy week--significant progress on many issues:  judicial nominees; rail safety; SAFE Banking reform; and PBM reform,  which can lower insulin costs for millions of Americans. It has been a  good, strong week. And I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  for moving forward.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations: all nominations placed on the  Secretary's Desk in the Coast Guard; that the nominations be confirmed  en bloc; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further  motions be in order to any of the nominations; and that the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
