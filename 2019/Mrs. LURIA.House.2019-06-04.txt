 Mr. Speaker, I rise today grieving for Virginia Beach, a  great city in our district, where the year's most devastating mass  shooting happened last Friday.   That morning, 12 innocent people left their homes for work, but they  didn't return home to their families, and they never will. Eleven of  them were devoted public servants with more than 150 years of combined  experience, and one was a dedicated contractor. I am honored to  remember them today.   Laquita C. Brown, a right-of-way agent who lived in Chesapeake, was  an avid traveler who chronicled her trips to New York City, Europe, and  West Africa. A friend of hers called her ``Ms. Worldwide.'' Her 40th  birthday was coming up in November.   Ryan Keith Cox, an account clerk who lived in Virginia Beach, had a  golden voice and sang in his church choir. He had recently accepted his  own calling to the ministry to follow in the footsteps of his father, a  friend, Pastor E. Ray Cox, and the pastor of New Hope Baptist Church.   During the shooting, Keith guided colleagues to safety, but did not  join them so he could look out for others.   Tara Welch Gallagher, an engineer who lived in Virginia Beach,  educated the public about clean water and served her city for 6 years.  Tara's survivors include her husband and her 22-month-old son. Her  husband told a reporter: ``She was everything to me.''   Mary Louise Gayle was a right-of-way agent who lived in Virginia  Beach. A proud grandmother, she had just turned 65, and her children  planned to take their mom to Portland later this month to celebrate her  birthday.   Alexander Mikhail Gusev, a right-of-way agent who lived in Virginia  Beach, moved from Belarus to seek a better life in America. He was a  generous and thoughtful person, who was said to grab his lawnmower and  cut his neighbor's lawn without even being asked.   Joshua O. Hardy was an engineering technician who lived in Virginia  Beach. He was a loving uncle, a healthy eater and runner, he smiled on  the job, and found time to write a beloved children's book that spoke  to youth about strangers in their midst.   Michelle ``Missy'' Langer, an administrative assistant who lived in  Virginia Beach, loved the Pittsburgh Steelers, Paul McCartney, and the  ocean. A friend said, ``I will miss her smile and her hugs. That is the  hardest thing.''   Richard H. Nettleton, an engineer who lived in Norfolk, helped  design, install, and maintain Virginia Beach's water and sewer systems.  An Army veteran, he enjoyed mentoring young engineers.   Katherine A. Nixon, an engineer who lived in Virginia Beach, was a  devoted wife and mother to three daughters, one of whom is just 15  months old. According to her neighbor, her final call was to her  husband just moments after she was shot.   Christopher Kelly Rapp, an engineer who lived in Powhatan, played the  bagpipes and loved Scottish music. Compared by some to Mr. Rogers, he  was known as encouraging and enthusiastic.   Herbert ``Bert'' Snelling, a contractor who lived in Virginia Beach  and was visiting the Municipal Center for a permit; he led his church's  security team, and in his work, he did everything from small handyman  repairs to building homes.   Robert ``Bobby'' Williams, a special projects coordinator who lived  in Chesapeake, worked for Virginia Beach for 41 years. He helped build  the seawall in our city and planned on retiring this year to spend more  time with his family.   The losses here will never be replaced, but so many heroes emerged to  prevent further horror.   Over the weekend, I saw heroic first responders--police, fire, and  EMS personnel--who ran into the line of fire to  [[Page H4225]]  save others before comforting our community in the immediate aftermath  of this tragedy.   As the hours and days go by, we hear tens, if not hundreds, of  stories of the heroism of individuals who helped save lives during this  tragic event, including the officer among the first responders who, in  the performance of his duties, took a bullet to protect our community,  and was, by the grace of God, saved by his protective vest.   I saw believable bravery in Sentara Hospital where Sunday, I had the  honor of visiting a survivor of the shooting. She clasped my hand as I  stood at her bedside, and her strength and resolve were palpable as she  had only narrowly come away alive.   I saw love and hope at heartfelt vigils across our community where  people of all faiths joined in prayer to remember those who left us all  too soon.   I saw strength among our city leaders and police chief as they  addressed our grieving community, determined to remember the 12 we lost  far too soon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I continue today in grieving for Virginia  Beach and for those that we lost.   Those who knew the victims are making statements that we need to  hear.   Bert Snelling's neighbor told a Virginian-Pilot reporter, ``It's the  world we live in now, and it's a shame.''   A friend of Missy Langer's told The Washington Post, ``This kind of  stuff has got to stop.'' And another friend said, ``She didn't deserve  to die like that.''   None of them did.   This is a moment where doing nothing is no longer an option. To prove  that point, all we have to do is look at the first responder who ran  into the building and took a bullet to protect his fellow citizens. To  him, it was never an option to not act.   If there is a lesson that we take out of this tragedy, all we have to  do is look at him.   We must run into the building together.   We must act.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the 12  wonderful people whose lives ended far too soon in Friday's mass  shooting in Virginia Beach.   Our city, our Commonwealth, and our Nation grieve.   Now is the time for healing, coming together, and determining ways to  prevent this kind of tragedy from ever happening again.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my House colleagues to please join me in a moment  of silence for those who lost their lives.                            ____________________
