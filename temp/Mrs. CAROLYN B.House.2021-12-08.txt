 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend  the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5119) to amend title VI of the Social  Security Act to extend the coverage of Coronavirus Relief Fund payments  to Tribal Governments, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5119         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF COVERAGE OF CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUND                     PAYMENTS TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS.         Section 601(d)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       801(d)(3)) is amended by inserting ``(or, in the case of       costs incurred by a Tribal government, during the period that       begins on March 1, 2020, and ends on December 31, 2022)''       after ``December 31, 2021''.     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this  measure.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5119, a bill to  extend the availability of Coronavirus Relief Fund payments allocated  to Tribal Governments under the CARES Act of 2020 for 1 additional  year.   This bipartisan bill was introduced by Mr. O'Halleran of Arizona and  Mr. Young of Alaska with companion legislation sponsored by Mr.  Sullivan and Ms. Murkowski in the Senate.   The historic CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020, and  included critical aid for States, territories, Tribes, and large  localities to combat the coronavirus pandemic. However, the Treasury  Department did not have a preexisting allocation process for disbursing  the $8 billion set aside for Tribes.   According to a GAO review, it took extra time to set up these  processes. Treasury also established some allocation methodologies  without consulting with Tribes first, which led to legal challenges and  even further delays of emergency relief.   Taken together, these delays have resulted in a compressed timeframe  for Tribal Governments to put their CARES Act funds to work, which is  unacceptable in light of the disproportionate impact the pandemic has  had on the Tribal community.   According to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, COVID-19 infections were 3.5 times higher for American  Indians and Alaska Natives compared to White Americans during the first  7 months of the pandemic. Other reports revealed that 1 in 475 Native  Americans in the U.S. died from COVID-19 compared to 1 in 825 White  Americans.   The ravages of the pandemic have been compounded for our Tribal  neighbors due to longstanding health disparities and social inequities.  The deaths of Tribal elders from COVID-19 caused an incalculable and  irreplaceable loss of cultural knowledge and language.   Tribes must be given a fair opportunity to put Federal aid dollars to  work tackling these serious issues. H.R. 5119 is a commonsense step to  ensure that Tribes have parity with recipients who have not faced  similar delays in gaining access to CARES Act funding.   Finally, I want to assure my colleagues that CBO has confirmed that  this bill does not increase Federal spending.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the dean  of the House, the outstanding leader from the great State of Alaska,  for his insightful comments and for fighting so hard for the residents  of Alaska, the Alaska Native residents, and the American Indians. This  bill will take care of the Tribes in many of our States across the  country.   I also want to thank my colleague, Mr. O'Halleran, who could not be  with us. He has a conflict with another committee meeting.    I want to thank the Democratic leadership here in the House, Speaker  Pelosi and the Democratic team, for bringing this to the floor and also  Mr. Comer, Mr. LaTurner, and others for being part of this bipartisan  effort. This is truly a bipartisan effort.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and if the gentleman from  Kansas is ready, then I am prepared to close.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, the gentleman  raised some important points, and it is under consideration. But this  bill is before us right now, and it is an important bill.   Madam Speaker, if the gentleman from Kansas has no further speakers,  then I am prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for his leadership on this important bill, and also the dean  of the House, Mr. Young, for his passionate support, who expressed so  clearly the need of this important bill.   I thank Mr. Comer. It was good to work together in a bipartisan way.   And I want to also thank the Democratic leadership for bringing this  bill to the floor.   I urge passage of H.R. 5119, as amended, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
