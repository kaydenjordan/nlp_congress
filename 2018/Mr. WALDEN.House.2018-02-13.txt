 Mr. Speaker, this is a tough night for those of us on the  Energy and Commerce Committee. We come to the floor tonight to pay  honor to our staff director Ray Baum, who passed away after a valiant  multiyear fight with cancer.   He left this world on February 9, unexpectedly in many respects. He  left before we were ready, but not before he filled us with love and  grace and kindness, shared his intellect and his great humor.   I got to know Ray in 1988. I know you don't know this is actually me  on the right here. I had hair. I was younger. This is Ray here. We were  both elected to the legislature.   And I don't know about you all, but oftentimes you meet people and  you don't remember 30 years later or whatever where you first met them.  With Ray, I absolutely remember the minute I met him.   Then-State Representative Bob Brogoitti from La Grande decided not to  run and was announcing that pretty late in the process. I happened to  be in Salem at the capitol when he brought this young attorney out of  La Grande, Ray Baum, into the capitol and said: I am going to announce  I am not running, and he is my guy to replace me.   Well, Ray and I both were first-time candidates in 1988; he in La  Grande in northeast Oregon, and I in Hood River, Sherman, Gilliam,  Wheeler Counties and part of Wasco. We both ran in the seats that our  fathers had held and, in different eras, both been defeated. His dad  already had the votes to be speaker of the house, he just didn't quite  get reelected in his seat.   And we both won in 1988. We served together in the Oregon  Legislature, became fast friends. The Republican leader of the house  looked at the two of us and dubbed us the ``pablum twins'' after the  baby food. We certainly outgrew that over time.   But we became very good friends. We shared a lot of time together,  legislated a lot together. We had a terrific experience. We both  really, really were committed to public service.   Ray was a member of the bar. From 1983 to 2003, he practiced law with  his brother David in La Grande.   As I said, he was elected to the Oregon Legislature in 1988 and  served through 1997. I became majority leader when Republicans took the  house in 1990 and served in that role until I went over to the senate.  He followed me as the house majority leader for the '95 session.    And then an interesting thing happened. He left the legislature, and  Democratic Governors, knowing what a great leader he was and how well  he got along with people, decided to appoint him to the Public Utility  Commission in Oregon. It is a three-member commission appointed by the  Governor, and he was the lone Republican.   In 2003, he and the family moved to Salem. He accepted this position  as a commissioner for the Oregon Public Utility Commission, where he  was until 2011.   In 2010, the Governor appointed him as chairman, as a Republican, of  the Public Utility Commission with the other two Democrats, and they  always kept the consumer in mind. He was always about good, fair public  policy.   From 2005 to 2011, he served as the State chair of the Federal-State  Joint Board on Universal Service. From 2008 to 2010, he served as  chairman of the National Association of Regulatory Utility  Commissioners Telecommunications Committee. So he rose up in the ranks  of the national organization to which he belonged.   He was an incredible family man. Those of us who knew him knew it was  all about his wife, Kristine, and all about their children, Rachael and  Wyatt and Alexis and Mary and Andrew and Elizabeth. His kids and his 10  grandchildren, they were the light of his life.                                time  2030    He had twin callings, if you will: his family life--an incredible  father, grandfather, and husband--and public servant. He was asked  about that all the time.   He said about his wonderful wife, Kristine: ``She has been a great  example of service to others. Her charity never ends. She supported me  in my pursuit of politics and put up with my `public service  impairment.' ''   He was all about public service, and it showed. In the work we did on  the Energy and Commerce Committee, I remember calling him when I became  chairman of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee. We  interacted over the years on telecom policy, given his national roles.   I said: Ray, they are going to make me chair of the Communications  and Technology Subcommittee. I am going to need your help.   He said: Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure. Just call me. Whatever. Yeah, that is  fine.   I said: No. Ray, I am going to need your help.   He said: Well, I can come back from time to time.   I said: No. Ray, I am going to need you here in Washington.   He said: Oh, oh. I don't think Kristine would go for that.   Well, their kids were out of the house at that point, and as fate  would have it, she said: Actually, I think that would be fun. I think  that would be a nice change.   That shocked him. So he came back and served as a senior counsel, a  special adviser on the Committee on Energy and Commerce and on the  Communications and Technology Subcommittee, and he played a big role.   Then, our mutual friend, Gordon Smith, with whom we had both served  in the State legislature and who now is president and CEO of the  National Association of Broadcasters, lured him away for, I think, all  of about 9 months. And as much as he enjoyed fighting the fight for  broadcasters, which was my background, he really loved public service.   When I became chairman of the committee, he actually reached out to  me and asked: Hey, you know, what are you going to do with that  position?   I was delighted that he had an interest in coming back to public  service, and he loved it.   You heard from our colleagues earlier tonight during 1 minutes, Anna  Eshoo and Frank Pallone, the top Democrats on the committee, who loved  Ray and still do. He was just one of those rare human beings.   I talked about his great intellect and I talked about his friendship.  But what I haven't talked about is what I would call his ``Rayisms,''  these funny little sayings that he always used that I think found their  way into our vocabulary and speech without us even knowing. His  constant reminder was: ``The fun never stops. The fun never stops.''  And he would use that along the way. Generally, when things were going  off the rails, he would say: ``The fun never stops.'' And he would also  say: ``Thanks for coming out today.''   We all heard that on a regular basis. And on Fridays, he would go  around to the staff and he would say: ``You know, you have been doing  such a great job, why don't you take the next couple of days off?''  Saturday and Sunday, of course. He would say: ``Remember to come back  in the morning.''   He was, as I said, cursed, as he would describe it, with a public  service impediment. He was very faithful, had deep faith, and was very  active in the Mormon church--he and Kristine both. And he would joke  that he was the only Mormon ever to oversee the Oregon Liquor Control  Commission. He was a member of that, too, along the way.   I want to share a couple of things. Before I do, let's get this  picture off of here because I am aging in place. This is Ray with  Senator Cory Gardner from Colorado, and he was on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, and Anna Eshoo, and some of the great staff we have  worked with over the years on the Communications and Technology  Subcommittee, where he just really thrived and got a lot done. I think  about the work that we passed in a bipartisan way to free up spectrum  and all.   When he was diagnosed with prostate cancer several years ago and it  had migrated, tragically, into his bones, I forget who gave him the  hats, but we knew he was going to lose his hair. So somebody came back  with a different set of hats to cover up the loss of hair. Now, there  is nothing wrong with losing your hair, I might say just as an aside,  but he tried them all on; and I think you get the spirit of Ray: ``The  fun never stops.''   I want to share a couple of comments, and then I know I have got  [[Page H1114]]  some terrific colleagues here who want to share with the body and with  our friends who are watching.   Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted out when he learned of Ray's passing last  week: ``Ray Baum was a kindhearted man with a deep commitment to public  service. The whole House mourns his passing. Please keep Ray's wife,  Kristine, and their family in your prayers.''   FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said: ``I had the pleasure to work with him  over the past few years and was impressed by his keen intellect,  fundamental kindness, and passion for advancing the public interest. He  was a good man and I will miss him.''   Commissioner Michael O'Rielly said: ``More than a colleague, Ray was  a wonderful individual with an endearing smile.''   Gordon Smith at the NAB said: ``In the time he spent working at NAB,  he was to everyone a delight. We will miss his everyday greeting: `It's  nice to have you out today!' His zest for life, his creative  legislative mind, his infectious humor, his love for others, and his  determined work ethic as he battled cancer, these were an inspiration  to all.''   We both served with a guy in Oregon named Peter Courtney. I think he  probably holds the record for the longest-serving State legislator, a  Democrat from outside the Salem area. And I know he holds the record  for the longest presidency of the Oregon State Senate. He said: ``Ray  taught me a lot about how to work with the other party; how to disagree  and still get things done.''    Former State Senator David Nelson from Pendleton said: ``He had a  great sense of humor and a great mind, a quick mind. He was a consensus  builder.''   Don't we need more of those in this process?   Former Union County Commissioner, Democrat John Howard, said: ``When  he took a position on an issue, people listened. Whether they were  Democrat or Republican, people valued his opinion.''   People just on Facebook wrote:   ``Ray Baum served the people of northeastern Oregon with  distinction.''   ``Ray was a wonderful person who set a great example.''   ``Being blessed to have been neighbors for a number of years with Ray  and his family, chukar hunting on the breaks of the Snake River will  never be the same.''   ``Ray was one of the finest persons I have ever encountered in Oregon  politics. Top-notch selfless person.''   One of Ray's assistants, Drew McDowell, said: ``One of my first days  here was a very rainy morning, and Ray walks in without skipping a beat  and says, `Sure is a nice day for a duck.' I knew right then he was the  type of guy that could brighten up a rainy day.''   A.T. Johnson from the Energy Subcommittee said: ``One of the last  legislative victories came from the health team--providing FDA help for  our soldiers and other servicemembers. When I think of Ray, I really do  think of the happy soldier--fighting for others, fighting his own  battle, and doing it with joy and grace.''   Jennifer Sherman, press secretary, said: ``Ray loved returning to  Utah to visit with his family, particularly when there was a new  grandchild to be welcomed.''--Did I say there were 10?--``And when Ray  returned to D.C., he made the focus of his daily walk-and-talk about  the newest little one, to show off the latest photos''--how proud he  was--``or to tell us what his grandkids were up to while he was hard at  work in D.C. It was always clear that his heart was in Utah and Oregon  with his loved ones.''   It is hard to stand here and pay tribute, not because I don't feel  all that for Ray, but because I probably spent most of the last 4 years  in wonderful denial, just believing that Ray would somehow muscle  through it and be with us.   I would say, being chairman of the committee, I get one of those  passes from time to time that allows a senior staffer on the floor. I  think there were a lot of Members who, for a long time, wondered what  district he represented because he just interacted with Members here in  a way I have never seen, including with the leader and the Speaker.   He would corral them. He would cajole them, work them on our issues  and the committee's issues, and always did it with such a smile and  such a wonderful way: big heart, big brain, incredible mentor for young  and old alike. For young staff and old Members, he was a friend. He  will be missed. He will not be forgotten. His imprint is all over the  State of Oregon and, now, all around the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Shimkus), the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very kind and  thoughtful remarks and his tribute to a really great public servant. I  think he hit the nail on the head. Ray's having served and having gone  through elections gave him that perspective. And having come from a  rural part of America, like a lot of us do--in fact,  [[Page H1115]]  my district encompasses where he is from--it gives you a different  perspective as well about some of the issues that sometimes get lost  otherwise. I thank the gentleman for coming and for sharing.   I know we have some other Members here who I think wanted to make  some comments. I don't know who would like to go next. Maybe the  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), who also was a public  utilities commissioner--if I have the right title for whatever it is in  North Dakota--public service commissioner. The gentleman knew Ray from  that era and got to put up with him here, as I would kindly say.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer).                                time  2045     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Cramer. I appreciate his  coming down here tonight and sharing his thoughts. I think he really  summed it up well.   Now the chairman of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection  Subcommittee, Bob Latta, who was the vice-chair of the Communications  and Technology Subcommittee when I chaired that. Ray was a big part of  the Communications and Technology Subcommittee and ended up as the  staff director. I thank Bob for coming down to share his comments  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Cramer. I appreciate his  coming down here tonight and sharing his thoughts. I think he really  summed it up well.   Now the chairman of the Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection  Subcommittee, Bob Latta, who was the vice-chair of the Communications  and Technology Subcommittee when I chaired that. Ray was a big part of  the Communications and Technology Subcommittee and ended up as the  staff director. I thank Bob for coming down to share his comments  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman both for his wonderful  words about Ray and also his terrific record of public service here in  this institution.   I know we have a couple other Members who have come down tonight. I  think this really speaks volumes about the impact that Ray had on all  of us that so many Members of Congress are coming down tonight at this  hour to pay tribute and to say thanks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).  Morgan Griffith is a terrific member of our committee. He is the vice- chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. I thank the  gentleman for coming down.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Morgan for those comments.   He always maintained such a wonderful sense of humor about his own  predicament knowing that there was a timeline. He had been given 3 to 5  years because of the bone cancer. He went through the treatments and  held up very, very well. But I know on more than one occasion he looked  at me.   I said: How are you doing, Ray?   He said: Well, I am doing all right. But, hey, nobody has gotten out  of here alive yet.   He would always take the edge off. When you were feeling bad about  him, he somehow would relieve that tension.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).  Buddy Carter is a distinguished member of our committee. He worked with  him on a lot of different issues, healthcare, and different things. I  thank Buddy for coming down tonight.     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Carter for those wonderful  words. I know Ray had such great respect for the gentleman from Georgia  and other colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the committee. The  working relationships that he developed were almost unlike any other  staffer I have ever known, because he really wasn't a staffer. It is  kind of a funny thing. It is not like he thought of himself as a Member  or anything. He was just Ray. He didn't let barriers keep him from  helping people succeed.   I just think for Oregon, my home State, he was kind of the sixth  Congressman. The only thing he lacked was a voting card. People knew  when Ray was speaking, he was speaking on my behalf. We could double up  on Northwest issues, whether it was the Columbia River Treaty, rural  telecom issues, or energy grid issues.   It was really a twofer for the price of one. Well, maybe 1\1/2\. Ray  had that ability to reach across the aisle, reach across any divide,  and close the gap and make us better people.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would just say that Ray was one of those  people, as I said in the beginning, who left before we were ready, but  not before he filled us with love, kindness, grace, and shared his wit  and humor--some humor better than others.  [[Page H1117]]    It was just good to have Ray. God bless him on his journey. God bless  Kristine, his brother and sister and their families, and his kids and  grandkids. He touched our lives. He left us better than he found us-- this country, this State--and we are all indebted to him and so  appreciative that we got to know him and work side by side with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 2 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, February 14, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
