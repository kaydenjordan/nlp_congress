 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, you might notice a little smile on my face. Honestly, as  I was walking over here to speak on the bill, I was reflecting on my  own life as a father.   I have five children. When two of my children were little, my wife  was away from the house, and I was to meet her somewhere. One needed  their diaper changed, and then I had to feed the other. By the time I  did that, the other diaper had to be changed. My wife called me, and  she said: ``You can't get out of the house, can you?''   Mr. Speaker, pregnancy and motherhood, of course, bring joy and  unique challenges and call from all of us a higher sense of duty.   My wife carried my children in their earliest formation, and I  carried that burden and opportunity to give them life in other ways.  But if we can see pregnancy as a part of community, a journey of life  for our good, the good of all, and the good of our Nation, then we  accept that it requires reasonable accommodation at work when someone  is pregnant, when they are giving life to their child, or if they have  necessarily hard conditions. It is only the right thing to do,  especially for those who are suffering.   Now, as I have been listening to this debate, a concern has been  raised about civil rights and religious organizations, considerations I  am surprised that haven't been worked out before now. But let's keep  working on that and pass this important bill.    Madam Speaker, I wish to congratulate Pastor Mike  Moreno and the entire congregation of Christ Lutheran Church in  Norfolk, Nebraska, on their 150th anniversary.   With a shared mission to share God's word, share God's love, and as  they say, ``Do it now,'' the community of Christ Lutheran Church is a  family. As one member of the congregation said, ``When one is hurting,  all are hurting. When one is joyful, we celebrate together.'' How  beautiful.   The church also oversees Christ Lutheran School, educating 225  students in grades K-8, in an environment that develops a child  spiritually, emotionally, physically, socially to know the personal  story and potentiality of each student.   Though we have many hardships and challenges in the world today,  Madam Speaker, I am quite certain that Christ Lutheran Church and their  community will remain a place of solace and hope for those seeking to  hear good news.                            ____________________
