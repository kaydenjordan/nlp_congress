 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Alfred J. Rioux, a dedicated public servant,  advocate, and friend to many. Sadly, Mr. Rioux passed away on November  9, 2019, at the age of 85. He will be remembered for his commitment to  Connecticut and his jovial spirit.   Born in Hartford, CT, Al served in the Navy as a seaman 2nd class and  deep-sea diver on the USS Skylark during the Korean war. Once  discharged, he started an apprenticeship in Hartford for the Arrow-Hart  Hegeman Company as a tool and die engineer.   Upon moving to Newington, CT, with his family, Al began working in  real estate and insurance. At the same time, he became a member of the  Connecticut Home Builders Association, helping to develop single-family  homes in his town. This initial involvement in Newington would serve as  the catalyst for Al's lifelong devotion to Connecticut politics.   In the 1970s and 1980s, some of Al's pivotal roles included helping  Bill Cotter successfully win his first term in the U.S. House of  Representatives, serving as an aide to Congressman Cotter, a 15-year  position as the Newington Democratic Party's Town chairman, and  attending the 1980 Democratic National Convention as a delegate in  support of President Jimmy Carter. He also served two terms as the  sheriff of Hartford County.   Al gave back to his communities outside of politics, as well. In one  of the first kidney transplants performed at Hartford Hospital through  Dr. Robert Schweitzer and Dr. Stanley Bartus's transplant program, Al  received a kidney from his sister, Dorothy Williams, in 1975. This  successful operation led him to organize the Connecticut Kidney  Research Fund Golf Tournament. Throughout its many years, the  tournament helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of  Hartford Hospital's kidney transplant research.   Through his involvement in Connecticut politics, transplant advocacy,  and numerous organizations, Al left a lasting impression on everyone  around him thanks to his zeal for life and readiness to help others.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Al's family  during this difficult time, particularly to his wife Elma and his many  children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. May their many  wonderful memories of Al provide them solace and comfort.                            ____________________
