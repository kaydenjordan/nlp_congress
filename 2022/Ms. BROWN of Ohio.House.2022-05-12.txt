 Mr. Speaker, last week we marked Teacher  Appreciation Week. This week, and every week, we say thank you to  educators who help our students learn and grow.  [[Page H4877]]  We also honor their sacrifices and tireless efforts to carry our  students forward during the last two difficult years.   From engineering and business to public service and journalism, all  professions depend on the profession of teaching. I will always  remember the teachers who made a difference in my life. I am so  grateful for the teachers who put their heart and soul into inspiring  students in my district each and every day.   I thank our teachers' unions, including those in my district, the  Cleveland Teachers Union and the Akron Education Association, for their  efforts to advocate for educators and to fulfill the promise of high- quality public education for every student.   Again, I thank all the teachers in Ohio's 11th Congressional District  and across America.                            ____________________
