 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Winchester Rescue  Mission on celebrating 50 years of caring for the homeless in our  community.   In July of 1973, Morris Whitaker took out a $20,000 loan and bought a  building to convert it into a homeless shelter for men, and the rescue  mission was born.   Over a decade later, the rescue mission extensively expanded its  operations to help more people in need, adding a commercial kitchen,  and increasing the number of beds.   Most recently, the current CEO and executive director, Brandan  Thomas, spearheaded the opening of a new four-bed shelter for women in  a single-family home and purchased a separate building to add 15 more  beds for displaced women.   Brandan now has plans to convert a former restaurant into a homeless  shelter later this year on Valley Avenue in Winchester.   This new venture will offer even more services to help local  residents without permanent housing address mental health and addiction  issues, learn how to properly care for themselves, and find jobs and  affordable housing.   Communities all over the country face the, at times, daunting task of  caring for large numbers of homeless people, but under Brandan's  leadership, and the four others who led prior, the Winchester Rescue  Mission has proven that with compassion, commitment, and selfless love  to folks who need it most, anything is possible.   Congratulations again to the Winchester Rescue Mission, and I wish  them another 50 years of success.                            ____________________
