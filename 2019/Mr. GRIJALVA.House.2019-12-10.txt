 Madam Chair, last week, I was honored to attend the  United Nations Climate Change Conference with Speaker Pelosi and my  Democratic colleagues in Congress.   That conference focused on the urgent need to prevent climate change  from destroying our oceans. The consensus is clear: Oceans across the  planet are already being damaged, and coastal communities everywhere  are hurting.   At the conference, we were asked how we plan to respond to the  climate crisis. We could either plan now and build a sustainable future  or delay and pay a very, very heavy price. To me, that was an easy  choice.   While we need to end our dependence on fossil fuels, we also need to  plan for the impacts we already know are coming for millions of  Americans.   This package of bills does that. Forty percent of Americans live in  coastal counties. From fishing to shipping to recreation and tourism,  American jobs depend on healthy, resilient coasts. These communities  need the tools to protect themselves.   We need to support our coastal communities in their adaptation and  resilience planning, especially indigenous and disadvantaged  communities that are often most at risk. We need to support all these  communities and fund adaptation and coastal planning that will protect  these communities and their ways of life.   This bipartisan package, led by Members from across the country and  across the aisle, will help communities on the front lines of climate  change prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change that  endanger livelihoods, communities, and ecosystems.   I commend the many sponsors on this important work and urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 729.                                time  1515
