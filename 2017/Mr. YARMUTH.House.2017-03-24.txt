 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, after 7 years of campaigning against the Affordable Care  Act, congressional Republicans have finally produced what they  cynically describe as a replacement plan.   Sadly, however, this bill will unravel all of the progress we made  under the ACA, including expanding access to health insurance to 22  million Americans and improving the quality of coverage and care for  tens of millions more.   It nearly doubles the amount of uninsured people in this country,  guts Medicaid by almost $900 billion, and weakens the Medicare trust  fund.                                time  1130    That was bad enough. But the last-minute changes to this bill are  astonishing and appalling. This legislation now allows insurers to end  coverage for prescription drugs, mental health, maternity and newborn  care, preventive care, emergency room visits, hospitalizations,  outpatient care, rehab visits, lab services, and pediatric care. That  is not progress. That is not a fix. That is a potential health crisis  for every American.   My Republican colleagues are well aware of this. Why else would they  have drafted this bill and these last-minute changes in secret? Why  else would complicated legislation affecting the lives of millions be  sent to the floor just 2 weeks after it was introduced with no  congressional hearings, not a single one, on a bill that impacts the  health care of nearly every American family? Why else would they rush  the bill to the floor without an updated Congressional Budget Office  estimate of how much coverage and care will be lost by their backroom  deal that ends consumer protections?   I get it. I wouldn't want to, nor would I know how to justify giving  nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy paid for  by threatening the health and well-being of millions of American  families.   Who is getting these huge windfalls?   Companies like Amgen, with annual profits of more than $3 million;  Medtronic, with annual profits of more than $6 billion; and Gilead  Sciences, with $13 billion in profits in 2016 alone.   When the CBO released its report last week showing that 24 million  hardworking Americans will be left without healthcare coverage by 2026  if we pass this bill, that premiums will rise 15 to 20 percent next  year, that people will pay thousands of dollars more in deductibles and  out-of-pocket costs, and that older Americans will be priced out of the  market by an age tax, I thought for sure it was dead on arrival, that  there was no way my Republican colleagues would walk this plank. But  here they are, and they are trying to take millions of American  families with them.   Fourteen million Americans will lose health coverage next year if  this bill is approved. Twenty-one million Americans will lose coverage  in the next 3 years alone, wiping out all of the coverage gains from  the ACA in just 3 years. For pretty much everyone else in the  individual market, deductibles and other costs will be higher. And for  lower-income individuals, out-of-pocket costs will be much higher.   Insurance companies will again be able to sell plans that offer much  less financial protection, and we will return to the days when millions  of people in this country will live in fear that they are always one  serious illness or accident away from bankruptcy.   This bill will result in the largest transfer of wealth from  struggling families to the well-off in our Nation's history, giving $1  trillion in tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires, and corporations.  It is Robin Hood in reverse, but this is far worse because access to  lifesaving care is being stolen.   I don't say that casually. I have met people, constituents of mine,  whose lives have been saved because of the Affordable Care Act.   This is from one of my constituents:   ``My name is Kevin Schweitzer. I am 62 years old and I'm a lifelong  resident of Louisville, Kentucky.   ``I worked hard, took risks and built a successful small business  that I sold at age 59. My wife and I were excited about our prospects  as we headed into early retirement. As a retiree too young for  Medicare, I purchased health insurance on the open market. Less than a  year later, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I have undergone multiple  scans and 2 cycles of chemo. I am winning the battle so far, but since  this disease is in my blood I will be fighting it for the rest of my  life.  [[Page H2407]]    ``A cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event that not only attacks  the body, but the mental stress is just as tough to deal with. Thanks  to ObamaCare, I've been able to rest easier knowing that my illness  wouldn't bankrupt my family and that I'll be able to provide for my  wife even after I'm gone.''   I also heard from a young woman named Sarah Adkins. She suffers from  chronic kidney disease. Sarah was able to get health insurance because  of the ACA. On January 9, 2011, it saved her life. One of her kidneys  shut down and almost went septic. If she didn't have coverage, she  would have waited or not gone to the hospital at all. The doctor told  her that if she had arrived at the ER an hour later, she would have  died.   Mr. Speaker, the health of my constituents Kevin Schweitzer and Sarah  Adkins is at stake in this debate. They, and the hundreds of other  constituents I have heard from who have serious and chronic health  conditions, will need high-quality, affordable health coverage for the  rest of their lives. Under this bill, they will get less coverage, it  will cost more, and eventually they will be priced out of the market,  leaving them nowhere to turn for the care they need.   And that is not all. Because of the last-minute changes to this bill,  insurers will be able to sell stripped-down coverage to weed out people  with preexisting conditions. They will be able to refuse, for example,  to offer coverage for chemotherapy drugs and cancer treatments, insulin  pumps, hospital stays, and prescription drugs that treat chronic  conditions across the board. Basically, if you have a serious health  problem, the care you need may not be available to you at all.   When the American people were promised by President Trump and  Republican congressional leadership that their existing coverage would  be preserved and that everybody would have insurance and it would be  less expensive and much better, they, understandably, believed they  would be treated much better than this. None of those promises are in  this bill. In fact, the opposite of every one of those promises is what  is in this bill. Those were promises made to every family in our  congressional districts, and this bill fails them at every turn.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 38,200 people from his congressional district  in California losing health care and coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 40,500 people from his congressional district  in Ohio losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 50,200 people from his congressional district  in Minnesota losing health coverage and care.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries),  a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 60,400 people from his congressional district  in Texas losing health coverage and care.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins), a  distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 65,800 people from his congressional district  in New York losing health coverage and care.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene), a  distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 56,000 people from his congressional district  in Florida losing health coverage and care.   I yield 1\3/4\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman  Schultz), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.                                time  1200     Mr. Speaker, I remind my friend from Indiana that his  vote for this bill will result in 37,900 people from his congressional  district losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), who is a distinguished member of  the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that the gentleman's  vote for this bill will result in 50,100 people from his congressional  district in Louisiana losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is the distinguished vice ranking member  of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 38,200 people from his congressional district  in California losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Carbajal), who is a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I mention to my colleague that his vote  against this bill will result in 56,600 people from his congressional  district in South Carolina losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\3/4\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 44,600 people from his congressional district  in Wisconsin losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee and the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleague that his vote for  this bill will result in 50,000 people from his congressional district  in Kansas losing health coverage and care.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, in concluding the presentation from the Budget  Committee, I just have to say that the bill we are considering today is  a mess. It is not a healthcare bill at all.   This bill is driven by a desire to cut taxes for the wealthiest  Americans and many wealthy corporations by nearly $1 trillion in all.  It is paid for by making health care unaffordable for millions of  people.   This is irresponsible. It is not what the American people want, it is  not what they deserve, and it is certainly not what they can afford.   We are not the only ones opposing this legislation. It is opposed by  an amazing array of American organizations and individuals, including  the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association,  the American Nurses Association, the National Rural Health Association,  AARP, the National Disability Rights Network, the American Diabetes  Association, American Cancer Society, and Easterseals, virtually every  healthcare and consumer advocacy group, Governors from both sides of  the aisle, and a growing list of our Republican colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Budget Committee staff for the incredible  job they have done throughout this process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous  consent that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), chairman of  the Energy and Commerce Committee, control the balance of my time.
