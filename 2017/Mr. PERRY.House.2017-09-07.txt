 Mr. Chairman, first I want to thank the gentleman from  Colorado for the amendment and the committee for the opportunity. The  U.S. Institute of Peace is intended to be a nonpartisan independent  national institute funded by Congress, and I question both the  nonpartisan nature of the Institute and the need, quite honestly, for  the Federal Government to fund it now, at least $1 billion over these  many years at $35 million a year, and, as the gentleman from Colorado  said, in a duplicative effort.   Nobody is against peace and nobody is against love. The question is:  Do we need a State Department doing it at the cost of billions of  dollars and then this other organization doing the exact same work at a  cost of another $35 million annually when we are $20 trillion in debt  and more, maybe up to $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities? And then  to add insult to injury, regarding the nonpartisan independent nature  that the taxpayers are forced to fund, on January 5th of 2016, on an  episode of C-SPAN, Manal Omar, the acting vice president for the Middle  East and Africa Center conducted a highly divisive,  [[Page H7126]]  partisan attack on then-leading Republican primary candidate Donald  Trump and the Republican party as a whole.   Some of her more egregious statements include: ``What Trump is doing  is inciting violence, make no mistake about it. He has blood on his  hands.'' And ``Trump and other Republican rhetoric have validated that  type of violence against Muslims. It has given them an excuse to  actually turn the negative rhetoric into violence.''                                time  1600    Her comments followed the violent attacks in San Bernardino and  Paris.   To my knowledge, no punitive action was taken against Ms. Omar, and  she continues to serve as the associate vice president for the Middle  East and Africa Center at USIP.   I wrote the Institute a letter in that regard inquiring as to her  status, whether there would be punitive measures taken for this obvious  partisan and vicious attack on the Republican Party and the candidate  that was then leading, and, of course, I didn't hear back until, oh, I  don't know, 2 days ago, when we saw that there was an amendment to  defund the U.S. Institute of Peace.   Again, Mr. Chairman, to add insult to injury, this place spends $35  million, including telling the American people what they should think  about their politicians. That is not their mission, that is not what we  are paying for, and that is why we should stop paying for it.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members that remarks in  debate may not engage in personalities toward the President, including  by repeating remarks carried elsewhere that would be improper if spoken  in the Member's own words.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act       shall be used to give formal notification under, or prepare,       propose, implement, administer, or enforce any rule or       recommendation pursuant to, section 115 of the Clean Air Act       (42 U.S.C. 7415).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendment would prevent funds from being used to expand EPA  authority pursuant to section 115 of the Clean Air Act.   Now, this isn't an amendment to assail the Clean Air Act, but there  is a flaw with it, which is section 115. That section of the Clean Air  Act allows the EPA to mandate State emissions levels to whatever amount  the agency deems appropriate if they find two things. They have to find  that U.S. emissions endanger a foreign nation; and the endangered  nation has a reciprocal agreement to prevent or control emissions in  their own nation.   Now, it was previously argued that the Paris climate agreement met  those requirements. When they wrote the Clean Air Act back in the  1970s, they never foresaw the Paris Agreement. And the Paris Agreement  is not a treaty. It is an agreement.   Fortunately, President Trump's decision to withdraw from the  agreement has alleviated those prior concerns. Whether you agree with  this President or the last one or the future President is immaterial.  The point is that this portion of the law shouldn't exist. That  authority shouldn't exist at the executive level, especially when we  don't do treaties anymore.   Despite the temporary relief, the fact remains that section 115 of  the Clean Air Act is just simply bad policy. Section 115 delegates an  incredible amount of authority to the executive branch without any  safeguards, without any oversight by the legislative branch.   This amendment would block the use of section 115 to delegate this  power over the energy sector, over our States, to the unelected,  unaccountable bureaucrats at the EPA.   In the future, such expansive authority at the EPA could be  economically devastating and could threaten the reliability and  viability of our Nation's energy sector without any checks and  balances.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. McCOLLUM. So the gentleman was talking about the Paris climate  agreement, which the Trump administration withdrew from?    Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. McCOLLUM. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. McCOLLUM. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Yes, ma'am.   Ms. McCOLLUM. And then you said you were worried about the  administration using section 115 of the Clean Air Act to impose  regulations.   It has been my experience, from my point of view, representing my  constituents, we were disappointed about the withdrawal from the Paris  climate agreement, and we haven't seen this administration be  aggressive on clean air.   So could you please explain to me your concerns about the Trump  administration and section 115 of the Clean Air Act? Because, if they  are doing things that you are concerned about, maybe I need to take a  fresher look at what the Trump administration is doing, because I have  seen them do nothing but block, cut back, and deny the ability to move  forward on the clean air agreement. So I am confused to the point of  your amendment.   The Obama administration is gone, and the Trump administration has  removed almost everything I care passionately about with clean air.    If the gentlewoman will continue to yield, what I am  concerned about is not necessarily the Trump administration or the  Obama administration. Any administration with the unbridled power that  section 115 gives the administration, without any checks or balances,  to make an agreement with another nation and then enforce--have their  agency enforce their regulations at whatever they deem appropriate on  every single State in the United States, without any ability of  Congress to intervene whatsoever.   It is not particular to this administration, the last administration,  or any future administration. It is particular to all of them. The  authority, in my opinion, should not exist for them to do that without  any checks and balances from the legislative branch.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, the Perry amendment would only be  in effect for 1 year because this is not a policy bill. This is an  appropriations bill. So the gentleman's concerns about having long-term  consequences of a future President in the future would not be addressed  by this particular amendment.   So I oppose the amendment. It is a long line of Republican amendments  on the attack of the clean air and the EPA's authority. But I think  this really makes it crystal clear the point that we shouldn't be doing  deep policy that you want to discuss on an appropriations bill because  it only lasts for a year.   As far as I know, the Trump administration has nothing up its sleeve  to improve air quality over the next year, so I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment. And I urge my colleagues who care about these  policy situations: You control the House, you control the Senate.  Please go to the committees of jurisdiction.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Calvert).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 60  printed in House Report 115-297.  [[Page H7174]]    It is now in order to consider amendment No. 61 printed in House  Report 115-297.                    Amendment No. 62 Offered by Mr. Pearce    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 62  printed in House Report 115-297.
