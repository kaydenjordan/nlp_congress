 Madam Speaker, former President Ronald Reagan once said,  ``The best social program is a job.''   Job creation and growing our economy are bipartisan issues that  benefit all Americans.   This past year, we saw the impact that COVID had on our businesses,  both large and small. But now, as we are reopening the economy, many  employers are unable to find workers to keep up with the high demand  for goods and services.   A major roadblock to businesses being able to hire staff comes from  the Federal supplemental unemployment payments made on top of the  unemployment already received by the States. These payments have caused  many potential employees to continue collecting unemployment from the  government rather than reentering the workforce.   Thankfully, many Republican Governors, including Mississippi's  Governor Tate Reeves, have ordered the end of the Federal unemployment  payments now that the economy is open.   As a Congress, we need to follow the example of Mississippi and other  States and bring this program to a close, as more Americans find it  possible to return to normal life.                            ____________________
