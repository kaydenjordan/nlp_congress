 Madam Speaker, last week, President Trump used his  authority and took clear, decisive action to protect American lives.   By eradicating Iran's top terrorist, he sent a clear message to our  enemies that the Obama days of appeasement are over, and America will,  once again, stand up to terrorists. We cannot allow another Benghazi.   However, I am in disbelief that some Members of this body are finding  ways to blame President Trump for the current situation in Iran.   Fact one, Iran's regime has been an enemy of America since 1979. In  recent months, they have shot down U.S. drones, attacked oil tankers,  shot rockets at our bases, and attacked and tried to take over our  embassy. Taking out Soleimani was a long-overdue action to make the  world a safer place and protect American lives.   Fact two, President Trump does not want war. Yesterday, while  addressing the Nation, President Trump made clear there is a path  forward with peace for Iran if they are willing to set aside their  nuclear ambitions.   This is personal for me. My son and his family currently serve in an  embassy abroad in a war-torn land. I want to thank President Trump for  protecting my family and our women and men in uniform abroad.                            ____________________
