 Madam Speaker, I rise to commemorate the longstanding bond  our Midwest communities enjoy with the Fightin' Fifty-Fifth Wing, the  United States Air Force wing right here at Offutt Air Force Base in  Nebraska. It has units all over the world.   The 55th Wing and the 55th Wing Association will jointly celebrate a  uniquely treasured relationship at this year's reunion in April that  will feature numerous dedications and commemorative events.   The Fightin' Fifty-Fifth's historic lineage began before World War  II. Since 1940, the unit has distinguished itself as a preeminent Air  Force organization, flying and supporting worldwide operations in peace  and conflict. Of note, the 55th Fighter Group conducted fighter sweeps  over the invasion beaches on June 6, 1944, using their P-38s. In 1966,  the Fightin' Fifty-Fifth transferred to Nebraska as part of the  Strategic Air Command.   For over 50 years, the 55th Wing personnel have supported national  interests around the world, focusing on providing first-class  reconnaissance, real-time intelligence, command and control,  information warfare, and combat support capabilities. It is the largest  wing in Air Combat Command and flies the most diverse types of  aircraft.   Notably, since Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm,  the 55th Wing is the only Air Force wing with continuous operations,  maintenance, and aircraft presence in  [[Page H2837]]  the United States Central Command theater of operations.   Indeed, the sheer longevity of this storied unit's history and global  mission reach personifies their motto, ``The Sun never sets on the  Fightin' Fifty-Fifth.''   The unit's exceptional record of service was the catalyst for the  55th Wing Association's creation. Following decades of the Fightin'  Fifty-Fifth camaraderie, global deployments, and operational  achievement, a handful of veteran aviators were determined to preserve  this invaluable heritage so it would not be lost to future generations.   This innovative initial cadre formed the 55th Strategic  Reconnaissance Wing Association to serve alongside the Offutt's 55th  Strategic Reconnaissance Wing Active-Duty force. Both organizations  were eventually renamed to today's 55th Wing and 55th Wing Association,  respectively, and have remained in Nebraska ever since.   The 55th Wing Association is comprised of Air Force veterans who  served honorably in the Fightin' Fifty-Fifth, most of whom were  stationed at Offutt Air Force Base. The 55th Wing Association's support  to their Active-Duty counterparts is second to none, and its support to  the 55th Wing alumni is a model for other Air Force organizations to  emulate. It embodies the impressive relationship between alumni  veterans and Active-Duty military members, and they have it in their  credo, ``Honoring those who served, and serving those who do.'' It  could not be said any better.   This bond between veteran citizens and military personnel is nothing  short of remarkable. These organizations demonstrate the very best of  cooperation to serve our national interests, sustain organizational  values, and foster military fellowship from as far back as those who  served in World War II to those of the present who still fly, fight,  and win our Nation's battles right now. Their relationship will forever  be enshrined at the many ceremonies in Nebraska on April 6, where  monuments will be dedicated to the alumni of the Fightin' Fifty-Fifth  past, present, and future.   In 2003, the 55th Wing Association captured the inspirational essence  of their history in choosing the following inscription on their U.S.  Air Force Museum monument, and it says:         We must never forget that freedom is never really free; it       is the most costly thing in the world. And freedom is never       paid in a lump sum; payments come due in every generation.       All any of us can do is to offer the generations that follow       a chance for freedom.    The 55th Wing Association also chose these same words for inclusion  on the monuments they will dedicate this April. They are fitting praise  for the accomplishments of the past and a challenge to the Fightin'  Fifty-Fifth for the future.   Just 11 days ago, Nebraska was hit with the worst national disaster  in the history of our State and a third of Offutt Air Force Base was  damaged, including key operations and support facilities. The Fightin'  Fifty-Fifth never missed a beat supporting operations all over the  world. This indomitable spirit of the Fightin' Fifty-Fifth led the  Secretary of the Air Force, Heather Wilson, to say: ``Not even Mother  Nature could defeat the 55th Wing.''   So, after 75 years as an organizational flying wing, over a half  century based in Nebraska, and more than 25 consecutive years deployed  in the Middle East for combat operations, the Fightin' Fifty-Fifth  deserves our highest respect, and I am honored to salute the 55th Wing  Association for all of its efforts to preserve its rich heritage.                            ____________________
