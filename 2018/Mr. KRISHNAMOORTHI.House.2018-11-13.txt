 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the appointment of  Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General of the United States.   Mr. Whitaker has repeatedly dismissed the value and seriousness of  the Mueller investigation while advising the President on strategies to  sabotage it, including through advocating for investigations the DOJ's  own professional staff had already determined were unnecessary.   Mr. Whitaker's broader record on issues of justice is just as  disturbing, as the Anti-Defamation League found his opposition to the  appointment of non-Christian Federal judges to be ``deeply troubling.''  [[Page H9508]]    Lastly, Mr. Whitaker's service as Acting Attorney General has been  widely recognized by legal experts from across the political spectrum  as unconstitutional because of the clear requirement that principal  officers, such as the DOJ's Secretary, demand Senate confirmation.   The United States needs an Attorney General worthy of the office and  committed to protecting the efforts of Special Counsel Mueller. But so  long as Mr. Whitaker remains in office, he should follow ethical  guidelines and recuse himself from the Mueller investigation.                            ____________________
