 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor America's health and  wellness coaches. Health and wellness coaches help people change their  unhealthy lifestyles and manage chronic illnesses.   Mr. Speaker, I am a diabetic. I also suffer from macular degeneration  and heart disease. I know firsthand how difficult it is for people to  change their behaviors and make healthier life choices, but I also know  that changing behavior can improve overall health and reduce the amount  of costly medical care people need.   The American Medical Association recently found that having a health  and wellness coach involved in a person's wellness journey not only  increases patient satisfaction and engagement, but also reduces  physician stress and burnout by freeing up their time.   Last week, I introduced H. Res. 733 to express support for health and  wellness coaches and to designate this week as National Health and  Wellness Coach Recognition Weak.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating our  Nation's health and wellness coaches.                            ____________________
