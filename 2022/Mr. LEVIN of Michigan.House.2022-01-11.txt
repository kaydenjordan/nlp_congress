 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  resilient, dedicated, and understandably exhausted, yet unflagging,  educators and school staff across the Nation.   I have spent my career advocating for an equitable education system,  and I am a proud dad of four children who are products of Michigan  public schools. In fact, my daughter Molly is currently a high school  junior who is set to graduate next year. I can hardly believe it.   That is why I have been especially disheartened when I meet regularly  with educators and superintendents in Macomb and Oakland Counties and  hear stories of how these frontline workers navigate from one crisis to  another, seemingly without end. From multiple COVID-19 waves and  politicization of commonsense public health measures, like masking and  vaccines, to mass shootings, like the Oxford High School tragedy in my  home county of Oakland County that we are still mourning, and startling  learning loss and social delays.   Mr. Speaker, our educators, school staff, and administrators are not  catching a break. They are working tirelessly and meeting daily, even  over holiday breaks, to make sure they can provide the best learning  environment for our students. Across the board, they reported trouble  finding teachers, finding bus drivers, finding kitchen staff and  everything in between.   Our students are returning to the classroom with immense needs in the  midst of a teacher and substitute shortage. All manner of staff and  administrators, including even superintendents themselves, are stepping  up and entering the classroom as substitutes.   One thing is very clear: We need a societal shift to address the  issues around staffing, attendance, learning loss, and the social and  mental health needs of our students. As the omicron variant continues  to surge, we must prioritize education and consider it a sacred public  good instead of an industry, and value our educators and school staff  by providing living wages, safe work environments, and ending the  attacks on educators and their unions.   The pandemic has exposed long-simmering problems, as crises are wont  to do. It is a time for a fundamental reset; time for us to realize  that, while markets do a great job of distributing goods and services  across the society, there are a few social goods that should not be  determined by market forces but, rather, lifted up above them as a way  to protect our democracy and make the healthy functioning of markets  possible in the first place.   One is public safety. Another is access to quality healthcare for  every person. A third is an excellent public education for every child,  from preschool to community college.   We cannot continue to put our educators through the wringer. Longtime  professionals in my district tell me they are hearing from new teachers  who say they won't last a couple of years, much less decades.   My response was this: We must restore the education profession; the  dignity of the education profession; the worth and the standing of the  education profession, no matter how difficult it is. We must train  teachers and prepare them for success, offer them appropriate pay and  benefits, and support them, not only in the classroom, but in our  society with the dignity and respect they deserve.   As a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I urge my  colleagues to join me in continuing the fight for robust investments  and just policies to make sure our country, our economy, and our  education system work for every American, not just the wealthy few.                            ____________________
