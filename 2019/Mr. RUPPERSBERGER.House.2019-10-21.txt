 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of a good  friend, patriot, and one of the most principled, passionate men I have  ever known; that is Elijah Cummings.   Elijah Cummings was an individual who has done so much for his  community, has done so much for his country and his state. I had the  honor of serving with Elijah Cummings for over 25 years. We also went  to the same high school, City College.   Congressman Cummings received attention on the national stage as  chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, and as such he  was fighting for our democracy every single day, signing subpoenas in  the hours before his death. He spoke truth to power and was taking on  what many of us see as dangerous threats to our system of government,  divided by our forefathers into three equal branches.   But even as he commanded a gavel as chairman, he never stopped  fighting for Baltimore and the little guy. Chairman Cummings can rest  easy knowing that he did everything he could in his time to restore the  principles of our democracy and equality.   His passing is a tremendous loss to me personally, the city of  Baltimore, our State, and our country. My heart goes out to his family  and friends and staff during this time of grief.                            ____________________
