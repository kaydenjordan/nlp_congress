 Mr. Speaker, East Rosebud Creek is one of Montana's  most picturesque and popular streams. It is located in Carbon County,  Montana, just north of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in the Custer  National Forest. It provides important habitat for fish and wildlife as  well as a myriad of recreational activities, including hiking, fishing,  hunting, kayaking, and climbing.   My bill designates a 13-mile section of East Rosebud Creek beginning  at its source, the East Rosebud Lake, as a wild river. A second 7-mile  section from the outlet of East Rosebud Lake to the point where the  waterway enters private property would be designated as a recreational  river.   This legislation specifically applies only to the segments of the  creek that lie within public lands. Important historical uses outside  of the wild and scenic river boundary are protected by this bill.   Finally, H.R. 4645 explicitly prevents the creation of a buffer zone  to restrict land use outside of the designated area.   This legislation represents a great compromise that has earned  support from a diverse coalition that includes local ranchers,  sportsmen, conservationists, businesses owners, and others. Companion  legislation has been introduced with the support of the entire Montana  delegation, including both Senators.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure.
