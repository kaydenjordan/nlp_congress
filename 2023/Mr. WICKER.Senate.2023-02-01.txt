 Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize the  dedication of an exemplary civil servant, Mr. Lon Pribble, on the  occasion of his upcoming retirement. Lon Pribble began his service to  the Nation as a cadet in the U.S. Military Academy in 1979, serving as  a military officer until his first retirement at the rank of lieutenant  colonel in 2005. However, as a dedicated, energetic individual, he  could not stay away from Army service for long. He soon began  supporting the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, also  known as ERDC, as a contractor analyst. In 2010, Lon became the  director of government and legislative affairs for ERDC as a civil  servant. My staff and I have had the pleasure of working with him ever  since. In his role, Mr. Pribble has communicated the Army's emerging  research priorities as well as how my constituents at ERDC help meet  the needs of American warfighters. His deep knowledge of key  legislative issues and advice to Army leaders and Members of Congress  alike positively impacted the Army's interests with Congress. He has  kept us informed about facility improvements, changes in the workforce,  and partnerships that ERDC is developing throughout Mississippi and the  rest of the Nation.   Part of the legacy Lon Pribble leaves at ERDC is an enhanced  capability to meet critical Army research needs. He did this through  his work supporting facility upgrades, such as construction of the  Fragmentation Research Laboratory, the Target Preparation Facility, and  the Supercomputing Research Center. Through these efforts and many  others, the four ERDC laboratories in Vicksburg have become world-class  facilities, and I am proud to represent them. While I am particularly  grateful for his work in Mississippi, I know that he similarly  supported improvements to the Army's research and development  capabilities in other locations across the Nation. These efforts  include a new annex housing researchers who study military beach  operations in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and an expansion of  the Permafrost Research Tunnel near Fairbanks, AK, which is improving  our understanding of the Arctic terrain. During his tenure at ERDC, Lon  Pribble's experience in facilities led him to become a resource to the  broader defense research enterprise by chairing a government panel  charged with assessing defense laboratory infrastructure issues.   Lon Pribble is an outgoing personality and was instrumental in making  connections for industry and academic partners across the State and the  Nation to help carry out ERDC's mission. I have appreciated his efforts  to ensure that partnerships between ERDC and Mississippi universities  continue to grow, advance the science and technology to meet Army  needs, and develop a diverse student talent pool experienced in Army  priorities.   For these efforts, Lon Pribble has received numerous civilian  recognitions in addition to his former military awards, including twice  receiving the Commander's Award for Civilian Service in 2016 and in  2020. These honors recognize that Lon Pribble has embodied the Army's  ideal of selfless service as both a military officer and a civilian. I  join my constituents in thanking Lon Pribble for his commitment to our  State and the Nation and wish him a happy retirement.                            ____________________
