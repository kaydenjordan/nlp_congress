 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  the life-saving work of Officer Brooks Yandle of the White Lake Police  Department.   Over the weekend of July 4, Officer Yandle responded to a call about  a 43-year-old woman unresponsive to CPR. Upon arriving, Officer Yandle  determined that the victim had overdosed on heroin, took quick action  to resuscitate her, and saved her life.   This is not the first time Officer Yandle has acted to save lives. In  2016, he saved a grandmother and her four grandchildren found  unconscious and suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.   Officer Yandle's courage and decisiveness has saved multiple lives,  and he is a credit to the noble profession of law enforcement. I am  proud to pay tribute today to him and to the entire White Lake Police  Department.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, our presence today, this unserious legislation, even  all the yelling across the aisle and the straying off topic, they all  underscore a contrast: Democrats whip up hysteria; Republicans show up  to work.   They call a Saturday session, supposedly because of an emergency.  Republicans are here, but about 70 Democrats don't show up. And that  has been the pattern all summer: Republicans come to work; Democrats  dial it in, sometimes from the fishing boat.   They say the virus keeps them from congregating to work, but they  encourage the throng outside the Postmaster General's personal  residence.   Or consider Representative Grijalva: not at work today, but joined a  postal union protest 4 days ago. They can congregate to whip up  hysteria, just not to work.   Now, Louis DeJoy is showing up to work. Testifying yesterday, he  calmly debunked apocryphal tales about blue collection boxes and  sorting machines.   Monday, he testifies before the House Oversight and Reform Committee,  but Democrats fan hysteria today without waiting for facts, even though  they don't show up.   Let's drop the hysteria. Let's all show up to work. Americans need  our help.
