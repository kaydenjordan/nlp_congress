 Madam President, today I wish to honor John Brown  University's centennial anniversary.   On September 29, 1919, John E. Brown, Sr., founded a school in Siloam  Springs, AR, to educate young men and women of any means ready to  dedicate themselves to a life of public service. Guided by one  fundamental belief, ``Christ over all,'' education at JBU has never  been merely academic. The school's founder was committed to the  holistic development of students and sought to form an institution that  would serve as a place to learn, as well as a place to worship and work  with emphasis placed equally on the head, heart and hands.   In its early days, JBU offered an associate's degree program and  consisted of three colleges: Siloam Springs School of the Bible, John  E. Brown Vocational College, and John E. Brown College. Students were  required to choose an academic major, attend classes half the day, and  work the other half.   In 1934, JBU expanded into a 4-year university with degree programs  in construction, engineering, agriculture, and education, along with a  core of liberal arts and Bible classes. By 1962, it was nationally  accredited. Since then, academic emphasis and growth have continued to  flourish with the establishment of an honors program, a degree  completion program, and a graduate school. JBU now has an enrollment of  nearly 2,500 undergraduate and graduate students from 38 States and 53  foreign countries.  [[Page S5662]]    Although much has changed over the past 100 years, John Brown  University remains committed to its spiritual identity and mission to  educate students in the head, heart, and hand. I congratulate JBU for  reaching this milestone and look forward to its next century of  continued success.                            ____________________
