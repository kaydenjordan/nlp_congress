 Mr. Speaker, it was a fitting end to an outstanding  season for the Aliquippa High School football team. They were  victorious in 14 of their 15 games.   The Quips, led by their new head coach and former quarterback, Mike  Warfield, fought their way to a resounding victory as they became Class  3A State football champions. The 35-0 win against Middletown High  School resulted in the Quips' third PIAA State championship.   The Aliquippa football team has been a perennial contender for State  football titles. This season, a powerhouse offense outscored teams by  more than 700 points, and a formidable defense shut out 7 of their 15  opponents.   The Quips team also won the WPIAL championship, and Coach Warfield  became only the third coach in WPIAL history to win a State  championship in his first year.   Congratulations to Aliquippa High School, Coach Warfield, the  coaching staff, and the team for their outstanding achievement. They  have made western Pennsylvania proud.                            ____________________
