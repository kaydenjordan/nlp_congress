 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my opposition to this morally  bankrupt bill, and I include in the Record a letter of opposition from  the National Rural Health Association.                [From the National Rural Health Association]                  Vote NO to the American Health Care Act         The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on       the American Health Care Act (AHCA).        Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other       populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced       that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and       the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural America. The       AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural       America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more       uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure       crisis.        Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill improve       the base bill, NRHA is concerned that the bill still falls       woefully short in making health care affordable and       accessible to rural Americans. For example, the modified bill       contains a decrease in the Medical Expense Deduction       threshold from 10% to 5.8% in an attempt to assist Americans       between the ages of 50 and 64 who would see their premiums       skyrocket under the current plan. However, this deduction is       not a credit and therefore would be of little use to low       income seniors that are in very low tax brackets or do not       pay income tax at all. Additionally, the new amendments to       freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of Jan. 1, 2018, and       reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will       disproportionately harm rural Americans.        The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural       Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved       populations in our nation without coverage, and further       escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to       the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit       rural areas hard.  [[Page H4145]]       . . . Poor, older Americans would see the largest increase in       insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times reports ``Americans       who swept President Trump to victory--lower-income, older       voters in conservative, rural parts of the country--stand to       lose the most in federal healthcare aid under a Republican       plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.'' Let's       be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed rural America.       The lack of plan competition in rural markets, exorbitant       premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op collapses, lack       of Medicaid expansion, and devastating Medicare cuts to rural       providers--all collided to create a health care crisis in       rural America. However, it's beyond frustrating that an       opportunity to fix these problems is squandered, and instead,       a greater health care crisis will be created in rural       America.        Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural       health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect       it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain       access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America       are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to       protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements       are critical for rural patients and providers:        1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-      expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are       covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).        Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is       different and thus requires different programs to succeed.       Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not       `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and       targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for       millions of rural patients and financial stability for       thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal       health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect       its rural safety net providers. The federal government must       not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities       to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to       care.        Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access       to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a       state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a       matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to       create stability among rural providers to maintain access to       care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent       to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,       a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is       provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued       access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not       limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective       Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health       Service providers, and individual rural providers.        2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace       enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing       70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack       of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.       Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34       for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).        Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,       cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to       participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,       poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural       Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and       less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.       Rural communities have fewer health care providers for       insurers to contract, with to provide an adequate network to       serve the community.        Any federal health care reform proposal must address the       fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural       markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies       are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for       participation and are currently not obliged to provide       service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.       Demographic realities of the rural population make the market       less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance       company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the       same way that financial service institutions are required to       provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable       insurance companies should be required to provide services in       underserved communities.        3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals       serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),       thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the       board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad       debt decrease significantly.        However, because of unaffordable health plans in rural       areas, rural patients still cannot afford health care. Bad       debt among rural hospitals has actually increased 50% since       the ACA was passed. According to MedPAC ``Average Medicare       margins are negative, and under current law they are expected       to decline in 2016'' has led to 7% gains in median profit       margins for urban providers while rural providers have       experienced a median loss of 6%.        If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to       protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be       undone. The National Rural Health Association implores       Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the       nation.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Service Employees  International Union's letter voicing strong opposition to the deadly  American Health Care Act for their 2 million Members.  [[Page H4158]]                                                           SEIU,                                                        May 2, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 2 million members of       the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), America's       largest healthcare union, I write to voice strong opposition       to the American Health Care Act (AHCA). New provisions in the       legislation manage to make a bad bill worse. Not only does       the bill cause millions to lose insurance coverage, face       higher costs, and end Medicaid as we know it, but now it also       strips essential protections for those with pre-existing       conditions. The AHCA will leave millions of men, women, and       children without access to high quality, affordable health       care. The AHCA legislation unequivocally jeopardizes working       families' safety, health, and financial security.        The AHCA will leave millions of Americans without health       insurance and therefore without access to healthcare. The       last available estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional       Budget Office (CBO) estimated about 14 million fewer people       will have health insurance in 2018, and by 2026, 24 million       fewer people will have coverage compared to the current       baseline under the ACA. Unfortunately, we do not have more up       to date information. Despite the importance that healthcare       plays in the lives of working families, Congressional leaders       have indicated that they intend to hold a vote on the       legislation without knowing its impact.        The AHCA also decimates the Medicaid program, rationing and       endangering healthcare for children, seniors, people with       disabilities, and their families as well as for those who       have gained coverage as a result of the Medicaid expansion.       According to CBO, the legislation will cut federal funding       for Medicaid by $880 billion over ten years. Americans know       that Medicaid is working and realize the key role that the       program plays in helping families afford care--including       nursing home care and home and community-based services for       elderly and disabled individuals. Nearly 1 in 5 Americans are       covered under Medicaid and rely on it to get health services.       Under the AHCA, those Americans would lose access to vital       care that may mean the difference between life and death.        Additionally, the AHCA would cap the amount of money states       receive in Medicaid funding from the federal government each       year, regardless of the cost of providing healthcare to those       who qualify. Medicaid is already a lean program especially       when measured on a per capita basis, and cuts from capping       federal funding will quickly force states to cut services,       limit enrollment, and decrease payments to hospitals and       other providers. Also, Medicaid is the largest payer for long       term care in the country. The program pays for more than 60       percent of all nursing home residents and for more than 3.2       million Americans with home- and community-based care, which       allows many older Americans and people with disabilities to       remain in their homes rather than move to a more expensive       institutional setting. States--which must balance budgets and       already face fiscal pressures--will not be able to make up       the lost federal dollars and will be forced to deny care. The       inevitable result will be that the AHCA will make it much       harder and more costly for older Americans, people with       disabilities, and their families to get services they need.        In addition, the legislation will effectively end the       Medicaid expansion, which provides health coverage to       millions of people earning low to moderate incomes. While the       bill purports to allow states to maintain the expansion,       states will only receive an enhanced match, or additional       funding, for people who enroll before 2020 and maintain       continuous coverage. It is widely understood that there is       significant churn on and off the program in this coverage       category, and thus over time the reimbursement rates for       states will drop. The resulting large cost shift to states       may lead them to eliminate coverage for this group       altogether. In fact, seven states have triggers that would       end the Medicaid expansion in their state if federal       reimbursement decreases.        Lastly, Medicaid provider rates are already extremely low       in most states. Cuts to Medicaid, capped funding, and       elimination of the Medicaid expansion would lead to further       reductions in rates for providers, leading to job and other       spending cuts in the health care industry that will have       ripple effects on the broader economy. We have serious       concerns that hospitals, especially those that serve       communities that may not have access to many providers, could       be forced to close or cut back services, further reducing       access to care in underserved areas.        Those who purchase coverage in the individual market do not       fare much better under the proposed bill. The AHCA provides       tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 to individuals to       purchase private insurance--substantially lower than the       ACA's current levels for the majority of those who receive       them. Unlike the ACA, it is unclear that people with access       to employer insurance that is unaffordable or inadequate will       be eligible for credits, which would mean that they will be       left without access to coverage and care. The bill also       creates an age tax on older Americans by letting insurance       companies charge people over 60 as much as five times what       they charge others for the same coverage. CBO found that       under the initial bill introduced, premiums for those between       age 50 and 65 would sky-rocket. Moreover, it is unclear what       coverage will be available on the individual market or if the       current healthcare marketplaces will even still exist under       this scheme. Between premiums and out of pocket costs like       deductibles, especially for those most in need of care due to       pre-existing conditions, illness, or age, the result could be       higher costs for less coverage.        A bad bill has managed to have been made even worse by the       ``MacArthur-Meadows Amendment.'' The amendment guts essential       protections for those with pre-existing conditions. It would       allow states to charge those with pre-existing conditions       higher premiums by allowing states to very easily waive       community rating requirements, which currently prohibits this       practice. Furthermore it would grant states, through a waiver       that is approved by default, the ability to opt out of       essential health benefit requirements, a core set of medical       services, like hospitalizations, mental health, maternity       care and prescription drug coverage, which all insurers are       required to cover under the ACA. If states waive       requirements, insurers could leave those who are sick or with       pre-existing conditions out to fend for themselves and face       exorbitant costs to get life-saving care they need. Experts       agree that the funding included in the ``Upton-Long       Amendment'' is completely inadequate to protect those with       pre-existing conditions. The Administration and Congressional       Leaders promised to the American people that those with pre-      existing conditions would remain protected--this bill even       with added amendments defaults on that promise.        Another failure of the AHCA is that it hurts women by       freezing funding to providers like Planned Parenthood,       risking the health and well-being of the 2.5 million people       who rely on the organization for basic care. One in five       women in the United States has visited Planned Parenthood       clinics and for many low-income women of color, including       many of our members, Planned Parenthood is their essential       health provider. For these individuals, healthcare is not an       ideological struggle or about the politics of one policy       versus another; it is a necessity that could mean the       difference between sickness and health.        The real winners of the AHCA appear to be special interests       and the wealthy. The legislation repeals most if not all of       the ACA tax provisions for special interests like the       pharmaceutical and insurance industries, offsetting these       costs with the massive cuts to Medicaid described above. The       bill also maintains the so-called ``Cadillac tax,'' which       places a tax on workers who have robust health coverage,       merely delaying implementation to 2026. Implementation of the       tax will punish people who have decent insurance, and will       encourage employers to further shift health costs to workers.       Furthermore, the incentives for health savings accounts,       which encourage wealthier people to shelter pre-tax income,       are of little use to working households earning low-to       moderate incomes.        The AHCA is not care, it is chaos. The legislation creates       an environment of uncertainty and unaffordability for       Americans and is a bad deal for working families. The bill       radically restructures Medicaid as we know it and cuts       funding for the program significantly, endangers women's       health, and further enriches corporations, special interests,       and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of working       families' access to healthcare and financial stability. The       American people will hold you accountable for how you proceed       in this moment. We therefore respectfully ask you vote no on       the American Health Care Act and the proposed amendments to       the legislation when it comes to a vote in the House of       Representatives. We will add this vote to our legislative       scorecard. If you need any additional information please       contact Ilene Stein, Assistant Legislative Director.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,                                           International President.     Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in strong opposition to H.R.  1628, which is a bill to take away health care from 24 million  Americans.   Whether you believe it or not, health care is a basic right.   This shameful bill steals from the most vulnerable among us,  including seniors, veterans, people living with HIV, children, and the  disabled. And this new bill is even more dangerous and destructive than  when they brought it to the Floor last time.   It would, yes, rip away health care from 24 million people. It would  reduce benefits, make families pay more for less, and transfer $600  billion in tax cuts to the very wealthy.   This is outrageous.   Access to women's health is denied by defunding Planned Parenthood.  Medicaid, as we know it, will end. Healthcare costs for working  families and seniors will skyrocket.   It allows states to eliminate essential health benefits like  maternity care, cancer screenings, and emergency care.   Mr. Speaker, this is not a health bill at all. This is a massive tax  giveaway to the wealthy.   Let me tell you, as a woman of faith, I am appalled and I am saddened  by the hypocrisy displayed in this bill by people who say they are  religious.   I want to remind you--in the Scriptures, the Book of Mark, chapter  12:31, we are reminded to love your neighbor as yourself.   I hope Republicans remember to love their neighbor as themselves  today and vote ``no'' on this mean-spirited, evil and morally bankrupt  bill.   This is a matter of life and death, and the American people deserve  better.
