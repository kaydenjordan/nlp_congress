 Mr. Speaker, I and my colleagues are going to spend  the next hour raising to the attention of every American the large and  looming crisis that hangs over the heads of our fellow Americans, but  especially the next generation of Americans on account of our ever- growing, massive, almost incalculable national debt at $31 trillion and  counting; with a projection of $16 trillion over the next decade. By  the way, half of that will be interest payments on the debt, without a  single dollar or dime going to something productive, to help a soldier  or a sailor or a senior with a safety net program. It will be servicing  the debt of this country.   I believe this is the long-term greatest threat to America. As  Admiral Mullen stated when asked by the defense community what the  greatest national security threat was, he replied: The national debt is  the greatest national security threat.   Why?   Because a debt crisis in any form will undermine our ability to  provide for the common defense and have a military and weapons systems  that will be sufficient for the ever-evolving and growing threats,  especially the great power threats like China.   It will undermine economic security and prosperity, and this land of  opportunity, this American promise for our children and grandchildren.  I don't believe there is a more important issue.   In his Farewell Address, George Washington, our first President and  one of the Founding Fathers, the Father of America, mentioned foreign  influence, factions that divide us and weaken the bonds of American  unity, and American oneness, but then he mentioned, `` . . . avoiding  likewise the accumulation of debt not only by shunning occasions of  expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the  debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned . . . `'   Translation: You may have to borrow money when you are in a world  war, but just like the last time we were over 100 percent debt-to-GDP,  our Nation was willing to make the cuts to expenses and bring down the  debt when we were in peacetime.   We are now at 128 percent over the size of debt relative to our  economy in World War II. We are carrying the largest debt in the  history of the United States, and we are not at war. The horizon and  the trajectory, not only over 10 years, but if you look at 30 years, it  is over $120 trillion in additional debt. It is mind-boggling. It is  unconscionable. And I think it is immoral to hand a country--in such  shambles fiscally and so bankrupt--to the next generation, and just  literally wipe out their future and the blessings of liberty and  opportunity that every generation of Americans have inherited to date.   George Washington says we should avoid these things. We should bend  the expense curve. We should bring down debt, and not ungenerously  throw that debt upon posterity, the burden, he says, `` . . . which we  ourselves ought to bear.''   I see that every day in Congress. Instead of us bearing the burden by  paying for the government that we believe the American people want--I  am not so sure they want this government, this ever-expanding  government--but when we are giving that government to them, we ought to  pay for it and not defer the taxes on the next generation.   That is not the American way. That has not been the American  tradition of our lawmakers. We are in a real bad spot and it is going  to take courage. It is going to take courage from everybody, regardless  of party, to find a way not only to start paying for things through  expense cuts, and in the case  [[Page H8300]]  of my Democrat colleagues, raising revenue.   We are way beyond just being able to offset and even grow the economy  and get out of this debt hole. We are going to have to take  extraordinary action. It is going to require extraordinary courage.  Quite frankly, I haven't seen that on either side.                                time  1815    But I think we have a tremendous opportunity in the future as  Republicans look to take over in the House as the majority party and  then get to demonstrate to the American people leadership on this  issue.   We have seen $5 trillion in new spending over the last 2 years under  this administration--$5 trillion. And I hope and pray that my party  will live up to the confidence and trust that the American people will  put into us to steward this great Nation of ours and lead and take on  the great challenge of the 21st century, which is the national debt.   Mr. Speaker, I have more to say but my dear friends my colleagues are  here from all over the country to speak on this matter.   The first one is my dear friend from the First District of Kansas, a  man who is no stranger to public service. He served his great State as  Lieutenant Governor and is now serving in the United States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, he asked me to remind folks that he represents the great  State of Kansas, and his alma mater, Kansas State, which upset the  Oklahoma University Sooners. They beat them three out of the last four  times so that is pretty darn impressive. With that track record, please  lend him your ears, my fellow Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kansas.   I think it is important to be honest with the American people even if  the truth hurts.   When I am asked who caused this disastrous level of debt, this deep  hole that we have dug for our children and grandchildren, I say that  while the Democrats have certainly done a whole lot of spending beyond  our ability to pay and beyond what I think is the appropriate scope and  scale of the Federal Government, which I think should be targeted and  limited and focused on its mission, provide a common defense, and  secure the liberties of us and our posterity, I am quick to remind them  that Republicans have their fair share of blame.   And while I am celebrating the thought, the opportunity for  Republicans to be in the majority and to fulfill this commitment to  America, which includes curbing wasteful spending and ensuring that  this government is accountable to we the people, let's be honest. I was  here in the 115th Congress as a freshman, and I saw the contributions  that my party contributed to this. I saw us blow past the spending caps  that we voted for to constrain spending. I witnessed us put aside pay- for provisions to offset these programs that we think are so important  and necessary for taxpayers.   I even was part of the Budget Committee that in the second year  wasn't able to pass the budget out of the committee, let alone this  Chamber.   So when we talk about the Democrats failing for the last 2 years to  even pass a budget out of committee--which I am happy to say because it  is the truth, and it is quite shameful for any party to not have a  budget, let alone live by it, like every American--we, as Republicans,  have made our contributions to this. And we ought to own it. We ought  to feel the burn in our conscience until we actually unite as a party  and reach across the aisle where we can to address, what I would call,  a curse on the next generation of Americans.    Ben Franklin--God bless him--said, `` . . . when you run in debt; you  give to another person power over your liberty.'' He said the second  vice in public service is lying, the first is running up a debt.   I have got a good friend who I have come to respect tremendously, not  only for his service in the United States Congress but his service to  our country as a foreign service officer. He is wicked smart, and a  great patriot. Peter Meijer hails from the Third District of Michigan,  from the Great Lake State.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Meijer), to  make some comments on this important issue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for  his heartfelt comments and his deep concern for our country and our  Nation's future under this gigantic weight of $30-plus trillion in debt  and this dark cloud and the clouds that gather.   Mr. Speaker, I have another dear friend and colleague who is very  passionate about this issue. Certainly a patriot, served his country,  served the Lone Star in the House and Senate, and decided he would  venture out here in Washington, D.C., to be another voice for the  freedom-loving, God-fearing people of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Fallon), who I  am honored and proud to serve alongside of.    Mr. Speaker, I couldn't have said it better myself,  and I thank the gentleman from Texas.   We need to harness that passion, and we need to unify not only our  conference to lead by example but the entire United States Congress to  take this on.   We do have existential threats, like our adversary China. We have a  number of threats, and we have to address them responsibly and with  urgency. But I don't see a bigger, long-term threat that could just  knock the shine plum off the shining city on the hill than this boulder  that is rolling downhill, this snowball that is going to impact every  aspect from national security to our economy to domestic tranquility-- the whole shooting match, as we say in Texas--if we don't step up and  have the courage to lead and to deliver for our children.   Speaking of children, I have a friend and colleague on the Ways and  Means Committee who has raised a family and is expecting to have his  children inherit this American promise, this exceptional Nation, and  the future opportunities it affords our fellow countrymen. He ran a  business, a family-owned construction company. He has served at the  local and county level. He has served in the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania's Senate, and I believe he was the leader of the senate's  budget and finance committee, so this guy knows what he is talking  about.   I imagine when he was leading the charge for the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania in the senate they balanced their budgets, they paid their  debts, and they lived fiscally responsibly within their means because  that is what leaders do with other people's money.   I am proud to hand over the mike to Lloyd Smucker for his comments,  and I thank him for his service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Smucker).    Lloyd Smucker is my brother. We came in together and  served our first term in the 115th Congress. I know he is committed to  this. I am proud and confident in his leadership on the Budget  Committee.   I just, again, share the sentiment of my colleagues and the sense of  urgency--the sense of urgency. This crisis, this debt-related crisis,  is very different from any other crisis we have experienced, in that,  for example, with the pandemic and COVID, and the government's response  to COVID which was sometimes the problem itself, but altogether, we  were able to borrow and print enough money to bail out of it. But when  the dominoes fall on a debt crisis, it doesn't matter how much China  will lend us. It doesn't matter how much the Federal Reserve prints.  They can print to their heart's desire. It won't fix it, and we will  weaken this country, its global dominance, its global leadership, and  the values that America represents to the entire world.   So I am grateful to Mr. Smucker.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to another colleague on the Committee on Ways  and Means and from the Keystone State, another proud citizen of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This guy has run a business. I think I  have heard him say, and I will paraphrase, if he ran his business like  the knuckleheads in Congress run this country, he would have been  bankrupt before he could ever make payroll, let alone make a living.   This is a man who is known for his Knute Rockne locker-room speeches  like they did there in Notre Dame. Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, he can  fire you up, and he has a fire in his belly. I guarantee you, Mr.  Speaker, when we get the majority--and I don't want to be presumptuous,  I should say, God willing, if the people give us the majority--I know  that this man is going to be riding herd on our conference and the  entire Congress to do the right thing. He has four children and 10  grandchildren. That is what we call skin in the game.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly),  who is my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to Mr. Kelly and proud to  call him a friend and colleague. I am going to shake his hand as he  leaves.   Listen, this is what it is going to require. It is going to require  that level of push and punch and clawing and scratching, yelling if  necessary, kicking a chair over in the Chamber, and saying the House is  on fire. It is going to burn down before our children ever taste the  sweetness of the blessed life in this country.   I believe we are going to do it. I believe in this country, and I  believe that the American people, especially over the last couple of  years of this spending frenzy, are waking up to this.   One of the sinister elements of a debt crisis is you don't feel the  pain until you feel the pain. But once you feel the pain, it is too  late. The world cannot afford to have America in any position besides  the pole position for the sake of stability, freedom, and the  fundamental rights of every human.  [[Page H8304]]    Nobody knows that freedom is nothing without security more than a  Navy fighter pilot who hails from the 25th District of California. He  is an Iraq war veteran and was a State assemblyman. He flipped a seat  that was Democrat for years, probably over 20 years, not because he was  a great Republican but because he is a great man, and he is a great  leader. He loves this country, and he just wants a safer, stronger,  freer Nation for his two boys.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garcia),  my friend.    Mr. Speaker, that was well said by my friend,  Representative Garcia. I thank him for his service to the country in  the Navy and in the United States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I am inspired tonight. I am inspired by my colleagues  who are ready to fight by taking on the tough issues, making the tough  decisions, and exercising the courage that every leader in this country  has that ever did anything meaningful for this great Nation, and for  their posterity. We are ready for this.   I know one man has got a lot of fight in him; he is a warrior from  Wisconsin. He is a man that is no stranger to the budget, to the budget  process, and to the broken and dysfunctional dynamics and elements of  the budget process in this place.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for Glenn Grothman from the great State of  Wisconsin representing the Sixth District.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wisconsin and I am  grateful for his courage. He speaks truth. He is not up here to win  friends and influence people; he is up here to make sure the outcomes  of our decisions are in the best interests of our country. And  certainly bending the curve on spending, reining in our debt, and  restoring fiscal responsibility is at the top of his list.   America is counting on him, and I am, too--as a senior Member of this  body when we get the majority--to remind every single Republican and  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle what is at stake. If we  don't, what is at stake? I thank Mr. Grothman.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, we timed it perfectly. I will just wind  down and then I will wind up the next speaker and dear friend and  fellow Texan.   James Madison, I think, summarized it in his statement: A public debt  is a public curse, and in a Republican form of government, the worst of  its kind.   That cloud hanging over the heads of our children, that snowball  coming down the mountain, that is the 21st century challenge. That is  the bankrupting of our children's future by spending our country into  oblivion.   It is our great challenge and we enter it with sober minds and with  prayerful hearts that God would give us the courage to take on the  forces in our own party and in this building and outside this building,  and anything that stands in our way until we reverse the curse, and we  can look into our children's eyes and we can tell them we have handed  them this country better than we found it, like every generation of  great leaders for this country.   Mr. Speaker, now I get to sit and listen to a great fighter for  freedom, my fellow Texan (Mr. Roy).   God bless America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 29, 2022, on page H8305, in the second column, the  following appeared: God bless America. -------------      The online version has been corrected to read: God bless  America.
