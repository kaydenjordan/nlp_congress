 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend,  Representative Manning, for yielding time; to Chairman Meeks for  advancing this legislation in committee; and to Chairwoman Bass; and my  friend Congresswoman Kim, for partnering with me on this important  effort.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my resolution on Mozambique,  which calls for stability and the cessation of violence in northern  Mozambique and condemns the attacks and violence by ISIS-Mozambique.   It calls for a new strategy and a new approach for how the U.S.  engages with Mozambique to address conflict and violent extremism. And  part of why passing this resolution today is so important, is because  we need to raise awareness in this body and in this country about the  dire humanitarian situation in Mozambique.    Since 2017, ISIS-Mozambique, also known as Ahlu al Sunnah wal Jamaah,  has inflicted violence on communities in Mozambique. These insurgents  have brutalized people and targeted civilians through mass beheadings  of men and boys, abductions of children, and attacks against key  civilian infrastructure.  [[Page H5713]]    This violence, combined with the government response to it, has  killed over 1,700 civilians in Cabo Delgado Province alone.   The international community, particularly the Southern African  Development Community forces and Rwanda's forces, have responded with  troop deployment to secure areas and shield civilians from continued  violence. But let's be clear. We know that a military-led response will  not be enough.   That is why I was so supportive of the Biden administration's recent  designation of Mozambique as a priority country under the Global  Fragility Act, so that we can better align resources among the  interagency and work to address the key drivers of this violence and  other forms of instability in the country.   And as we craft our strategy for Mozambique, we must be clear-eyed  about the underlying grievance and what it will really take to make a  difference in preventing new violence from occurring. We know that  terrorism and violent extremism are also fueled by perceptions of state  repression, human rights abuses, and socioeconomic and political  marginalization. We know that these factors exist in Mozambique and in  the state response to ISIS-Mozambique. We need to be honest about the  challenges impacting the Mozambican people in order to get serious  about preventing future terrorist recruitment.   We also need to ensure that we are helping the Mozambican Government  support development goals of Cabo Delgado and northern Mozambique that  will allow all sectors of society to thrive.   That is why I am looking forward to the United States' partnership  with the Mozambique Government and the Mozambican people and to  ensuring our strategy is shaped by lessons learned from our  counterterrorism missions across the world that have consistently  fallen short.   This resolution has strong support from across the ideological  spectrum. I am proud to lead the passage of this important resolution,  and I urge my colleagues to support it.                                time  1630
