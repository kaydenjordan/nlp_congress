 Scott  Franklin) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority  leader.  [[Page H1573]]     SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a  longtime friend and the biggest advocate for veterans in central  Florida, retired Air Force Colonel Gary Clark.   I have known Colonel Clark for 20 years as a fellow veteran and  veteran's advocate. I am honored to recognize him as one of the  distinguished 2020 inductees into the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame.  This is an honor truly befitting Gary, thanks to his countless  contributions to Florida's veterans.   Florida is known as the most veteran-friendly State in America, with  over a million vets calling the Sunshine State home. Anywhere you go in  central Florida, if there is a veteran in need, you can bet that Gary  is on it.   Retiring from the Air Force in 1993, Gary continued his service and  quickly became a distinguished advocate for veterans. Gary established  the Polk County Veterans Council, developed a partnership for the Polk  County School Board to support 13 Junior ROTC units, and chairs the  Flight to Honor Polk, which brings senior veterans to the memorials  near Washington.   Gary coordinates an annual Veterans Day breakfast with the Rotary  Clubs of Lakeland and has chaired the 15th Congressional District of  Florida's Service Academy Nominating Committee for at least a decade,  and he remains the chair for my current board.   Mr. Speaker, it is simply impossible to think of veterans in central  Florida without thinking of Gary Clark. On behalf of Polk County and  the 15th District of Florida, we congratulate him on this honor and his  induction into the Florida Veterans' Hall of Fame, and we thank him for  his selfless service to our veteran community.                     Supporting Public Access to Capitol     SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, on a more somber note,  I rise in support of public access to this House, the people's House.   While I have only been a Member since January 3, as a former Naval  aviator who had the privilege to travel to over 40 countries, I know  the importance of our free and open democracy in both the figurative  and the literal sense.   I was on the House floor on January 6 when violence erupted. As we  continue to investigate the tragedy that resulted, the military  fortress erected in response is a gross overcorrection.   Capitol Police have indicated there is no credible threat justifying  maintaining this security posture. On March 4, facing nonspecific  rumors of a potential threat, the House rushed to conclude its work the  night before and did not meet. Not only was the threat unfounded, but  the Senate, operating under the same security protocols as the House,  was open and conducting the people's business, the same Senate that is  only a few yards down the hall behind us.   Speaking of the differences between the two Chambers, doesn't it seem  odd that the same House impeachment managers who testified before the  Senate without masks would insist that I be fined if I take my mask off  right now, even though I have been vaccinated and there is no one  around me?   In addition to dismantling this fortress, we should begin relaxing  the protocols put in place a year ago to limit the spread of COVID.  Today, all House Members have been offered the vaccine, and roughly 75  percent have been vaccinated. Many of the remaining 25 percent  have antibodies from being infected previously.    There is no justification for this House to continue operating in a  quasi-virtual state. The CDC has issued new guidelines easing masks and  social distancing for the nearly 32 million people who are fully  vaccinated.   It is time to end the proxy voting, begin in-person committee  meetings, and return to regular order. Our strength as an institution  relies on personal relationships and the ability to build alliances  where we find common interests. As a freshman, I have yet to meet most  of my colleagues. We should be working to find common ground, and that  is simply not possible in a virtual meeting.   Mr. Speaker, as the new administration acts to tear down the wall at  our southern border, we have a new one right here, paralyzing the seat  of democracy. The hypocrisy is obvious, and it is shameful.   This is no longer about safety. It is about making every effort to  create disruption and hide what is really going on from the American  people.   It is time to take down the razor wire fencing, send the troops home,  and open the people's House to the public.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Scott Franklin of Florida, Mr. Cloud, Mr.               Owens, Mr. Gooden of Texas, Ms. Foxx, Mr. Gimenez,               Mr. LaMalfa, Mr. Hice of Georgia, Mr. Williams of               Texas, Mr. Feenstra, Mr. Guest, Mr. Cawthorn, and Mr.               Moore of Utah):        H.R. 2002.
