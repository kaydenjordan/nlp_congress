 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and  colleague, Representative Jonathan Jackson, for yielding to me in  commemoration of Caribbean-American Heritage Month.   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in commemoration and celebration of  the designation of Caribbean-American Heritage Month during this month  of June. I add my voice to those who have lauded Congresswoman Barbara  Lee for her leadership in ensuring this designation 17 years ago.   It is with an immense sense of pride in this special moment in the  lives of those of us in communities across the Nation of Caribbean  descent. For nearly two decades, this month has served as a cherished  opportunity to honor the boundless contributions of Caribbean Americans  to our Nation.   From grass-roots activists, the first Black woman to run for  President--the Honorable Shirley Chisholm--the first female Vice  President--the Honorable Kamala Harris--to thought leaders,  entertainers, entrepreneurs, diplomats, business moguls, Michelin-star  chefs, and the brave, highly decorated members of our military,  Caribbean Americans compose an integral part of our Nation's legacy,  fabric, and future.   It is indeed the honor of my life and the dream of my ancestors to be  a woman of Jamaican descent representing my home and my community--the  place where I was born and raised--and to carry the torch of my people  in the United States Congress.   As we acknowledge the excellence and contributions of Caribbean  Americans, let this month remain a beacon for uplifting diversity, the  preservation of legacy, the strength of unity, and the undeniable truth  that we, the descendants of Caribbean peoples, are a force to be  reckoned with, and that our culture and contributions deserve every  acknowledgment and all the appreciation of a grateful Nation.   From Jamaica to Barbados and every nation in between: Bless Up, One  Love, Walk Good.  [[Page H2736]]
