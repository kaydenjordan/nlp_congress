 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Friday, I visited Wilde Lake High  School in Columbia, which is located in Howard County, MD, between  Washington and Baltimore. I wanted to talk to students about the tragic  Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in  Parkland, FL, which left 17 students and faculty members dead. This is  the deadliest high school shooting in American history. I went to Wilde  Lake because one of their own teachers, Laura Wallen, was shot to death  in September 2017, and her former boyfriend is now on trial for her  murder.   I was extremely impressed by the passion of these students. They had  a great deal of interest in the subject matter; they were extremely  articulate; and they asked great questions. I found it extremely  encouraging for the future of Howard County, MD, and this Nation. These  students are rightfully concerned about their safety and the safety of  their classmates. It has been 2 weeks since a disturbed young man  invaded Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.   The reaction seems to be like clockwork after each shooting. There is  bipartisan shock, anger, and horror. Predictably, the question comes  out: Will this time be different? The answer for the Republican leaders  in Congress has always been ``no'' as the outrage and call to act  quickly falls back to NRA talking points versus reality. This time, the  students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the students in  Maryland and across the country are not taking ``no'' as the final  word. This time, the survivors are leading the way and are speaking out  in a forceful way like we have not heard before.   Students like Ryan Deitsch, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School, want to know why these students--the children--need to be the  ones to speak out ``just to save innocent lives,'' he said. He wants to  know why the adults cannot be the adults and do what is necessary to  protect children.   I think the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have had  a clear, articulate message that this carnage needs to stop. They want  to feel safe in their schools again. Armed with their cell phones and  their stories, they have taken up the banner of hashtag ``never again''  and are changing the face of this debate to make this country safer  from gun violence.   Alex Wind, another survivor from Stoneman Douglas, laid out the  larger problem of why students are mobilizing:         We're marching because it's not just schools. It's movie       theaters, it's concerts, it's nightclubs. This kind of stuff       can't just happen. You know, we are marching for our lives,       we're marching for the 17 lives we lost. And we're marching       for our children's lives and our children's children and       their children.    So what can we do?   There are several pieces of legislation that are ready to go. The  Democrats and some Republicans have been willing and ready to act.  Leader McConnell could move any one of these bills right now. Let's  start by making it clear that weapons of war are not needed by  civilians of any age. I have cosponsored S. 2095, the Assault Weapons  Ban of 2017, offered by Senator Feinstein.   This legislation would, one, ban the sale, manufacture, transfer, and  importation of military style assault weapons; two, ban any assault  weapon that accepts a detachable ammunition magazine and has one or  more military characteristics; three, ban magazines and other  ammunition feeding devices that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition,  which allow shooters to quickly fire many rounds without needing to  reload.   The bill also requires a background check on any future sale, trade,  or gifting of an assault weapon that is covered by the bill, and it  prohibits the transfer of high-capacity ammunition magazines. It also  bans bump fire stocks and other devices that allow semiautomatic  weapons to fire at fully automatic rates. Congress should also pass the  Background Check Expansion Act, S. 2009, which I have cosponsored and  has been offered by Senator Murphy.   This bill would expand Federal background check requirements to  include the sale or transfer of all firearms by private sellers, just  as licensed dealers are required to conduct checks for sales under the  existing Brady Law. The bill requires background checks for the sales  or transfers of all firearms from one private party to another even if  either party is not a federally licensed dealer. This requirement  extends to all unlicensed sellers whether they do business online, at  gun shows, or out of their homes.   According to a recent poll, a record 97 percent of those surveyed  said that they support requiring background checks for gun buyers--97  percent. Why can't we get this done? It is not a heavy lift. Americans  are with us on this. We need to recognize that saving children's lives  is more important than the National Rifle Association.   Congress also should ease restrictions on gun violence research and  prevention efforts by removing onerous restrictions on the Centers for  Disease Control research. We can improve States' sharing of information  with Federal databases that screen gun buyers.   At a townhall last week, Senator Rubio, when questioned by an  audience of students and parents from Stoneman Douglas, said that ``the  problems we are facing here today cannot be solved by gun laws alone.''  With that, I agree, but these gun laws will make a difference. Yes,  there is no single solution, but we should be united in our willingness  to do what we can to save lives.   I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we must  devote more resources to mental health priorities to identify young  people who may be about to cause harm to themselves or others.  [[Page S1297]]    Let's attack this problem from multiple directions. We cannot raise  our hands in the air and give up because there is no one law that can  solve the problem. Sitting on the sidelines is not an option when our  children are being killed, sometimes by other children, and  surrendering to the false logic that the problem is too big to address  falls well short of what the American people deserve. We were sent here  to our Nation's Capitol to make the tough decisions and to do the right  thing.   I agree with Alex Wind that this problem we need to tackle is larger  than simply school safety, but I would like to talk about that  specifically for one moment.   In an effort to turn the conversation away from an assault weapons  ban or closing loopholes in background checks, the President decided to  latch on to this idea that we should arm teachers and educators in our  schools. We do not need, as President Trump has suggested, more guns in  the schools, and we do not need teachers carrying guns. We do know that  teachers are hired to teach, not to be security guards.   Let's listen to our educators and say no to this proposal. The answer  to keeping guns and gun violence out of our schools is not to bring  more guns into the school. The students I talked to at Wilde Lake High  School in Columbia, MD, understood that adding more guns would not help  the situation and could lead to more problems in the schools  themselves. They certainly want to see their buildings more secure, but  we can do that through infrastructure improvements, technology, and  school resource officers.   Why are these things happening in the United States with such  alarming frequency and not elsewhere around the world? Gun-related  deaths unfold in tragic circumstances across this country daily, with  more than 1,800 people killed by guns this year alone, according to the  Gun Violence Archive, a not-for-profit group. Mass shootings often  shine the spotlight on the United States and its position as a global  outlier.   The number of firearms available to American civilians is estimated  to be around 310 million, according to the 2009 National Institute of  Justice report.   According to the Small Arms Survey, the exact number of civilian- owned firearms is impossible to pinpoint because of a variety of  factors, including arms that go unregistered due to illegal trade and  global conflict. Estimates indicate that Americans own nearly half of  the 650 million civilian-owned guns in the world today, which is nearly  one gun for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Our  Nation is well armed. India is home to the second-largest civilian  firearm stockpile, estimated at 46 million.   Americans own the most guns per person in the world, with about 4 in  10 saying they either own a gun or live in a home where there is a gun,  according to the 2017 Pew Center study. Forty-eight percent of  Americans said they grew up in a house with guns. According to the  survey, a majority--66 percent--of U.S. gun owners own multiple  firearms. The No. 2 country in the world for the largest number of guns  per capita is Yemen--a country that is in the throes of a 3-year-old  civil war. They trail significantly behind us. They have 54 guns per  100 in Yemen; we have 88 guns per 100 in the United States.   When it comes to gun massacres, the United States is an anomaly.  There are more public mass shootings in America than in any other  country in the world. The United States makes up less than 5 percent of  the world's population but holds 31 percent of global mass shooters. In  Australia, for example, four mass shootings occurred between 1987 and  1996. After those instances, public opinion turned against gun  violence, and Parliament passed stricter gun safety laws. Australia  hasn't had a mass shooting since.   Gun safety laws work. The public demands that we take action to make  our communities safer.   Gun homicide rates are about 25 times higher in the United States  than in other developed countries. The United States has one of the  highest rates of death by firearms in the developed world, according to  World Health Organization data. The calculations based on OECD data  from 2010 show that Americans are 51 times more likely to be killed by  gunfire than people in the UK.   Most American gun owners say that a major reason they own a gun is  for personal protection, according to the Pew study. However, the  majority of firearms-related deaths are attributable to self-harm. Gun- related suicides are eight times higher in the United States than in  other high-income nations.   Thinking of Stoneman Douglas High School, we all wonder out loud,  what drove this young man to kill indiscriminantly? There is no one  single reason, but that is no excuse for Congress and lawmakers in all  of our States to remain frozen and fail to act to try to stop a future  shooting from happening. If anything, it should be the impetus for us  to move forward on many fronts and to take many actions to support our  children and support our communities so more lives are not lost in such  a violent way.   We cannot allow the story of this shooting to end like all the others  in recent history. We should have taken action after three students  were killed and five wounded in December 1997 at a high school in West  Paducah, KY. We should have taken action after two students opened fire  on April 20, 1999, in Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, killing  12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 26 others. We should have  taken action after a gunman fatally shot 32 people in a dorm and  classrooms at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, VA, on April 16, 2007.   Columbine, Virginia Tech--for a period, these names became a code for  some of the worst killings in our history. Nearly 5 years later, it  happened again. Three students were killed and two wounded in a  shooting on February 27, 2012, that started in a school cafeteria in  Chardon, OH, as students waited for buses to other schools. Then there  was Sandy Hook. I know we all remember a 20-year-old gunman, in  December of 2012, killing 20 first grade children and 6 educators  inside Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT--elementary school  students. These were first graders, for goodness' sake, young children  who should clearly have moved us to action. But no. The killings  continued because the Republican leadership has been unwilling to budge  from the NRA-approved message.    We have had bipartisan support for some of this legislation, as we do  today, but too many are so afraid of the NRA response that they lose  sight of the fact that children are being killed right before our eyes.   On September 8, 2016, a 14-year-old girl died of a self-inflicted  gunshot wound after shooting and killing another female student at  Alpine High School in West Texas.   Just 20 days later, on September 28, a 6-year-old boy was fatally  shot on the playground of Townville Elementary School in South Carolina  by a 14-year-old boy who had just killed his father. Another child and  a teacher were struck by bullets but survived.   I know some of you are thinking: I haven't heard about these  shootings. That is a problem in and of itself. School shootings have  become so commonplace and so much a part of our lives that children  dying in our schools may not make it into the paper. We might miss it.  We cannot let this become commonplace. It cannot be the new norm.   Another incident you may not have heard of happened last April. A  gunman opened fire in the special education classroom of his estranged  wife at North Park Elementary School in San Bernardino, CA, killing her  and an 8-year-old boy and wounding another child.   In September of last year, in Rockford, WA, a 15-year-old boy was  killed at Freeman High School and three female students were wounded  when authorities say another 15-year-old boy opened fire with a  handgun.   In December of last year, two students at Aztec High School in New  Mexico were killed by a gunman disguised as a student.   Barely a month ago, in January, 2 students were killed and 14 wounded  by gunfire when a student opened fire before classes began at Marshall  County High School in West Kentucky. A 15-year-old--a 15-year-old--is  being charged for this crime.   This time, the survivors are speaking out in a forceful way like we  have not  [[Page S1298]]  heard before. I think the students speaking out have had a clear,  articulate message that this carnage needs to stop. I am not sure I  know any lawmaker or American who would disagree with the idea that our  students need to be safe in their schools. It means that we need to  act--really act this time.   Setting aside the outrageous idea of arming teachers, it has been  heartening to see the President move in the direction of legislative  solutions, such as expanding background checks and banning bump stocks.  The devil is always in the details, and we will see how far the  President is willing to stray from the NRA and whether the Republican  leadership will back the President or remain on the sidelines of  protecting the American people and especially our children.   On that Valentine's Day, February 14, when I heard about the shooting  in Parkland, FL, my immediate reaction was horror, pain, and outrage.  How could we allow this to happen yet again? Schools should be a safe  harbor for our children, not a place of killing and terror. I was in my  office thinking about how tragic this is, not only for those who were  killed but for all the children who were there. I am as frustrated as  the people across this country. I want to pass commonsense gun safety  legislation. Why shouldn't we get these military-style weapons off the  streets?   It is hard to know what will motivate the congressional leadership to  bring up this issue, what will jar them to action. I want action. We  may not solve the problem entirely, but we need to try. We need to do  something.   A new CNN poll released just this Sunday finds that 70 percent of  Americans now back tougher gun laws. This is a huge jump from 52  percent after the tragic, horrific October shootings in Las Vegas. This  number includes 49 percent of Republicans, which I think is  encouraging. Saving lives should not be a partisan issue. Commonsense  gun safety legislation should not be a partisan issue.   Public opinion polls may not be perfect, but they are generally  helpful to show trends. Americans are getting it. It is time that we  do. This trend toward protecting the American people, and especially  our children, is moving in the right direction. The American people are  letting their voices be heard on this issue.   Thoughts and prayers might console the grieving for a moment, but  action speaks louder and will have a lasting impact. From my hometown  of Baltimore to the many towns across America that have had their names  in the headlines because of gun-related tragedies or mass shootings,  people are calling upon Congress to act.   I don't care what the reasons are for a change of heart, but let's  get bills on the floor. What we are proposing are logical next steps to  address the deadly problem that has been festering in this country for  too long. Too many young lives have been lost. Will this time be  different?   Mr. President, in honor of the victims of Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School, I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Alyssa Alhadeff, 14; Scott Beigel, 35; Martin Duque       Anguiano, 14; Nicholas Dworet, 17; Aaron Feis, 37; Jaime       Guttenberg, 14; Chris Hixon, 49; Luke Hoyer, 15; Cara       Loughran, 14; Gina Montalto, 14; Joaquin Oliver, 17; Alaina       Petty, 14; Meadow Pollack, 18; Helena Ramsay, 17; Alex       Schachter, 14; Carmen Schentrup, 16; Peter Wang, 15.     Mr. President, to all the victims of gun violence who  have preceded them, let's make the answer a resounding yes.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wish briefly to note that Saturday,  February 17th, marked the 10th anniversary of the independence of  Kosovo. I want to congratulate the people of Kosovo on reaching their  aspirations for statehood 10 years ago and to support their current  aspirations to be part of a democratic, integrated, and peaceful  Europe. I urge the government and people of Kosovo to use this  anniversary as an occasion to strengthen their commitments to democracy  and human rights, to seek reconciliation with their neighbors, and to  undertake and fully implement the reforms necessary to move forward in  these areas.   In 1998, the situation in Kosovo was markedly different. Still a  province of Serbia, with its autonomy unilaterally revoked and its  ethnic Albanian majority harshly repressed, Kosovo erupted in conflict.  After years of passive resistance to Serbian rule, the people of Kosovo  had enough and began to clamor for their rights. Early international  efforts to restore peace were unsustainable, and with U.S. leadership,  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, Alliance was compelled to  intervene militarily the following year, placing Kosovo under the  administration of the United Nations, UN, and opening the question of  its status.   The violent chaos of 1998 and 1999--marked by horrific war crimes,  massive displacement of populations, and ultimately the death of an  estimated 12,000 or more people--made subsequent efforts to reach  agreement on Kosovo's status a challenge, and only in February 2008  could Kosovo assert independent statehood based on a plan developed by  the respected Finnish politician, Martti Ahtisaari.   This last decade has seen continued challenges as Kosovo has tried to  achieve greater recognition of its independence abroad and to develop  its democratic political institutions and economy at home. Perhaps the  most important and positive development has been the direct dialogue  since 2012 between Serbian and Kosovo officials in Brussels, under  European Union, EU, auspices. These talks have sought to normalize  relations between Belgrade and Pristina and to achieve practical  progress that would improve the lives and protect the rights of the  people in and from Kosovo. Some agreements have been reached, but  implementation has been difficult. This work continues.   As a Member of Congress, both House and Senate, I have been a witness  to Kosovo's history. As a member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission for  more than two decades and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee since coming to this Chamber in 2007, I have visited Kosovo  and participated in numerous hearings on developments there. I have met  with its leaders, as well as those of Serbia and other neighbors, and  engaged in critical debates on issues ranging from military  intervention and peacekeeping operations to diplomatic recognition and  bilateral support for the country's democratic and economic  development.   As Kosovo moves into a second decade of statehood, I urge those  countries that have not yet recognized its independence to do so now,  particularly those in the European Union. Kosovo's independence is a  reality, and full EU recognition will help pave the way to Kosovo's  European integration as it continues to take the necessary steps to  strengthen its democratic institutions, respect human rights, and  adhere to the rule of law. Progress in these areas is desperately  needed and something we should all want. Withholding recognition  accomplishes nothing.    While I make this call urging Kosovo's recognition, I want also to  urge Kosovo's political leaders not to wait for outside incentives, but  to see progress as in Kosovo's own interest and to make this progress  now. Nothing will strengthen support for Kosovo and its integration  into Europe in the years to come more than its efforts to take  responsibility now for doing the right thing.   In this regard, I encourage the Kosovo Government to make clear its  commitment to democracy. The political turmoil in the country has  raised questions about the strength of this commitment.   I hope to see steps in Kosovo to boost respect for human and property  rights of members of minority communities, whether Serb, Roma, Turk,  Bosniak, or any of the others who live in Kosovo. This has been one  area where progress has been sadly lacking with regard to what we would  expect.   I also urge the Kosovo Government to make progress on justice for  past atrocities by supporting the work of the special court established  for that purpose and respecting its decisions and judgements. Upholding  the rule of law for crimes that individuals in Kosovo have committed  will boost Kosovo as a nation and contribute to a  [[Page S1313]]  sustainable peace and prosperous future.   With its young and enthusiastic population, I personally have little  to question about Kosovo's future being bright, but the job of Kosovo's  leaders today is to erase all doubts at home and abroad through  accelerated progress on the democratic and human rights values we all  hold dear. By doing so, Kosovo will make an even stronger claim to the  Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe--OSCE--NATO, and  EU memberships it deserves in the years to come.   Let me conclude, by expressing my support for continued U.S.  leadership in the Western Balkans, a leadership that ended a decade of  regional conflict, helped bring Kosovo to where it is today, and can  make a difference still. With Russian and other outside influences  seeking to undermine the progress we have made, it is in our interest  to engage more actively and offer a positive alternative to a difficult  past. It is in our interest to see Kosovo and the entire region stable  and secure, reconciled and integrated, and--above all--prosperous. Let  this be a time where we not only celebrate the progress we have made in  the past decade, but also commit to more rapid progress in the decade  to come.   Congratulations, Kosovo, on your 10 years of independence. You can  count on the continued support of your friends in the United States.                            ____________________
