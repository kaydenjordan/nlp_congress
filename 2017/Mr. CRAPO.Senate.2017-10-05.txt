 Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of the  Honorable Randal Quarles to be a member of the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System.   Mr. Quarles has extensive government and private-sector experience  dealing with both domestic and international financial markets. He is  no stranger to public service in his having previously served in  multiple top posts in the Treasury Department.   Mr. Quarles has also been nominated to serve as the Vice Chairman for  Supervision, a role that has never been officially filled. Instead,  former Federal Governor Dan Tarullo has acted as the de facto Vice  Chairman for Supervision in various ways, including by chairing the  Federal Reserve Board's Committee on Supervision and Regulation,  overseeing the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee,  and representing the Fed at the Financial Stability Board and in Basel,  among other functions.   In February, Chair Yellen committed in a hearing that she expected  President Trump's nominee for Vice Chairman for Supervision to have the  same responsibilities that Governor Tarullo had, including heading the  Federal Reserve's Committee on Supervision and Regulation and  representing the Fed at the Financial Stability Board and in Basel.   I expect Mr. Quarles to perform those same duties in the interim, and  I look forward to confirming him to that position soon. Mr. Quarles has  strong bipartisan support and was voted out of the Banking, Housing,  and Urban Affairs Committee with the affirmative vote of 17 to 6. If  confirmed, he will play a key role in developing regulatory and  supervisory policy for the Federal Reserve System.   I urge all of my colleagues to support Mr. Quarles' nomination today  and vote for his confirmation.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and  consent to the Quarles nomination?    Mr. President, I rise to make a unanimous consent request.  We have been able to work out an agreement on further aspects of Mr.  Quarles' nomination.   I want to thank my ranking member, Sherrod Brown, for working with us  on this and helping us to be able to move forward.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 303.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the nomination.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Randal  Quarles, of Colorado, to be Vice Chairman for Supervision of the Board  of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for a term of four years.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; that any statements  relating to the nomination be printed in the Record; and that the  Senate then resume consideration of the Gingrich nomination.   One modification, Mr. President. I am striking the portion of this  unanimous consent request relating to the Gingrich nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Is there further debate on the nomination?   Hearing none, the question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to  the Quarles nomination?   The nomination was confirmed.                            ____________________
