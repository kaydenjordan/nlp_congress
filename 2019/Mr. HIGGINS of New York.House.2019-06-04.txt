 Madam Speaker, June is Pride Month, marking  50 years since the uprising at the Stonewall in New York City to  protest discrimination against LGBT Americans.   The month is marked by celebrations in communities all over the  country. Last week, in western New York, we raised the pride flags in  both Buffalo and Niagara Falls.   The House this year passed the historic Equality Act to extend the  legal protections of Federal civil rights laws to LGBT Americans,  prohibiting discrimination in housing, employment, and medical  treatment.   Passing the Equality Act into law couldn't be more urgent. This  administration has taken steps to roll back rules across Federal  agencies, reversing years of progress and invoking fears in communities  throughout this Nation.   As a member of the Equality Caucus, I am proud to recognize Pride  Month. I am committed to fighting these discriminatory actions and will  keep working toward full equality for each and every American.                            ____________________
