 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the success of the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Program,  otherwise known as FINI, in providing low-income Americans the  opportunity to put healthier food on the table for their families.   As a joint program between the National Institute of Food and  Agriculture and the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, FINI provides  funding to improve the nutrition in SNAP households.   Last month, Secretary Perdue announced nearly $17 million in grants  to help SNAP participants purchase healthier food options for their  families. This funding would not have been possible without FINI, which  was authorized by the 2014 farm bill.   As chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, creating opportunity for  low-income families to afford nutritious food options is incredibly  important to me, and we want to ensure the program is viable for  generations. Last year alone, SNAP helped at least 44 million families  put nutritious food on their tables. That allowed 19 million children  to lead healthier lifestyles.   The FINI program is successful, and we see the success through the  good it does for the health of American families.                            ____________________
