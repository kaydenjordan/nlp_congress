 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment, which  is imperative to bringing home an essential supply chain and protecting  our national security, all while protecting the environment.   Rare earth elements and critical minerals are essential components in  the daily lives of Americans, as well as in national security  technology from home computers, televisions, and vehicles, to major  weapons systems, including lasers, guided missile systems, jet engines,  and alloys for armored vehicles.   Currently, China controls the bulk of the global supply of these  critical minerals and rare earths that support America's economy and  defense industrial base.   The demand for these minerals will steadily increase as the global  economy adopts new technologies, placing the United States and its  allies at a growing disadvantage unless steps are taken to shift  production and sourcing away from Chinese Communist Party-controlled  entities.   The risk of supply disruptions is amplified by U.S. dependence on  unreliable foreign sources and red tape that disincentivizes domestic  sourcing.   It is estimated that 80 percent of rare earth minerals in the United  States come from China. For too long, bureaucratic red tape and  uncertainty in the permitting process forced critical mineral and rare  earth operations overseas.   This amendment works to jump-start American critical mineral, rare- earth element, and carbon production to make our supply chains more  resilient while creating opportunities for coal and coal byproducts to  be used in new, clean, and innovative ways.   According to Bureau of Land Management estimates, there are nearly  5,200 coal-related abandoned mine sites that have yet to be fully  reclaimed. Through this amendment, we are creating an avenue for rare  earths to be extracted from coal waste at these abandoned mine sites.   This would not only help the United States with this critical supply  chain need but also address our Nation's environmental and reclamation  needs.                                time  1730    Specifically, this amendment would include projects related to  extraction, recovery, or processing of critical minerals, rare earth  elements, or carbon from coal, coal waste, coal processing waste, or  pre- or post-combustion coal byproducts, or acid mine drainage from  coal mines as covered projects eligible for FAST-41 permitting for the  purposes of securing the economic and national security of the United  States.   Mr. Chair, whether you are like me, a member of the Congressional  Coal Caucus or a member of the Sustainable Energy Caucus or a national  security hawk or a member of the Select Committee on Strategic  Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party,  every Member of Congress should be for this win-win-win solution, a win  to reclaim these abandoned mine sites and fix an environmental problem,  a win for the coal industry and the workers in the coal industry who  need alternatives to combustion of coal now that we are in the  transition phase of our energy development in our country, and  certainly a win for national security. This is a way for us to end  overdependence on the Chinese Communist Party for critical, national  security sensitive supply chain needs.   The United States must innovate and secure its supply chain of  sensitive strategic materials in order to reduce reliance on Chinese  Communist Party-controlled materials overseas.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``aye'' on my amendment,  which I expect to be fully bipartisan, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
