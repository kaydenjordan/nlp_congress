 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor and  to mourn the loss of one of Corpus Christi Police Department's finest,  Officer Alan McCollum, who was tragically killed in the line of duty.   President Ronald Reagan once said: ``There can be no more noble  vocation than the protection of one's fellow citizens.''   Officer McCollum was a compassionate, devoted, and admired public  servant who dutifully worked to keep south Texas safe.   Before serving as a police officer, Officer McCollum served 21 years  in the U.S. Army, earning the Bronze Star and numerous other accolades.  Following the Army, his service to others continued by joining the  Corpus Christi Police Department in 2013, where he was a valued member  of the Honor Guard and SWAT team.   Last year, he once again demonstrated his willingness to sacrifice  his own safety for others by helping push an overturned car back on its  wheels after it had caught fire, saving the life of the driver.   On Saturday, Officer McCollum paid the ultimate price, sacrificing  himself, while upholding the rule of law.   Scripture tells us that the Lord is near to the brokenhearted and  those who are crushed in spirit. Right now, so many of us, in Texas,  the Corpus Christi Police Department, and the family of Officer  McCollum, are brokenhearted.   Our prayers are that his family and friends touched by this tragedy,  and especially his wife of 12 years, Michelle, and his three daughters,  Hannah, Carissa, and Liliana, would feel the Lord near them during this  difficult time. I extend my deepest condolences to them during this  extremely difficult time.                 Honoring the Service of Officer Michael Love     Mr. Speaker, this week, I had the opportunity to visit  Corpus Christi Police Officer Michael Love in the hospital as he  recovers from injuries he sustained in the line of duty.   Over the weekend, he was conducting a routine traffic stop when his  patrol vehicle was struck, pinning him down.   I had heard from many of his fellow officers of his optimistic and  indomitable spirit, which I had the opportunity to witness firsthand  when I visited him and his wife, Lauren, in the hospital. He told me  that, despite everything he is going through, even knowing the months  of recovery that lie ahead, he would still sign up to serve our  community as a Corpus Christi police officer.   We cannot express our gratitude enough for his sacrifice and his  bravery.   We must continue to pray for the safety of all our first responders,  and support them as they protect us, as well as their families, who  they hug a little bit tighter every day as they face the dangers that  lie ahead.   We are thankful for the loving, brave, and patriotic man that is  Officer Michael Love, and for those who serve with him.                            ____________________
