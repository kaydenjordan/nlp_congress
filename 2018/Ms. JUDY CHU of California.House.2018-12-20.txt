 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to H.R. 88.   This bill contains a provision that can only be described as sneaky.  It is an anti-choice provision that has no place in a tax bill. It  tries to circumvent our Supreme Court and redefine ``person'' by  allowing parents to open 529 college savings accounts for unborn  children.   Actually, this provision is unnecessary because, under current law,  parents can already do this. They can open 529 college savings accounts  for future children in their own name and then change the name of the  beneficiary after the birth of their child.   But the implications of adding ``unborn child'' directly into the Tax  Code are serious. This is a thinly veiled attempt to codify the legal  concept of the unborn child and, therefore, claim that, legally, the  fetus is separate from the mother.   This language has appeared in Republican tax bills before, and anti- choice extremists did not attempt to hide its reason for its inclusion.  When this provision appeared in the House version of H.R. 1, the GOP  tax scam, the spokesperson for the anti-choice group March for Life  stated publicly:         We hope that this is the first step in expanding the child       tax credit to include unborn children as well.    This is an obvious attempt to lay the legal groundwork for  undermining a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. It is an  outright attack on women's reproductive rights.   Right before Republicans must turn over control of the House to  Democrats and before a record number of Congresswomen are sworn in,  Republicans are making a last-ditch effort to erode women's  constitutional rights to control their own bodies in order to score one  last point for an extremist base, and all in a bill that they know is  dead on arrival in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this bill and  vote ``no.''
