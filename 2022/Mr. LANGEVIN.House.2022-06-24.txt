 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 2938,  the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.   As we speak, our Nation is being wracked by an epidemic of gun  violence. Every year, 40,000 Americans die from guns, more than 110  every single day, many of them children. We have the power to prevent  this carnage, but for decades, Congress refused to act. Well, no more.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not perfect. No bill is. But this  legislation will save lives. Once signed into law, the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act will help keep guns out of the wrong hands. It will  protect survivors of domestic abuse by closing the boyfriend loophole.  It will crack down on straw purchases and improve background checks for  people under 21. It will deliver hundreds of millions of dollars for  improved mental health services, community-based violence prevention  initiatives, and school safety.   The issue of gun safety is personal to me. It is about time that  Congress takes action. Let us pass this historic, bipartisan bill and  send it to the President's desk today.
