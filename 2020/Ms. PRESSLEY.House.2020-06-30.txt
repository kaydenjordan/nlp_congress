 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement in  support of my amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 2, the Moving  Forward Act and thank my colleagues for their work on this legislation.   Our nation's transportation and infrastructure policies play a  critical role in building healthy and safe communities.   But, for too long they have perpetuated many of our most entrenched  inequities.   My amendment would require us to examine how our nation's  transportation policies have impacted and targeted our most vulnerable.   It is critical that we understand how transportation policies are  criminalizing Black and brown communities.   Specifically, we have seen violent enforcement of fare evasion  policies and the discriminatory placement of speed cameras and other  surveillance technology in our lowest income communities.   Mr. Speaker, this is a moment of reckoning.   The people have organized and peacefully protested for more than a  month to affirm that Black Lives Matter and demand the end of racist  systems and policies that disproportionately criminalize our Black and  Brown neighbors.   We have a mandate to center justice in all of our policymaking. Our  transportation policies are no exception.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Thank you. I yield.
