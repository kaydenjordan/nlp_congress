 Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Ohio  had asked earlier: Where does it say in the President's notes--and  these are notes; this is not a transcript--the word, ``favor''?   Page 3, I would direct the gentleman: ``I would like you to do us a  favor,'' the President of the United States says.   And the problem with this mob-like tactic is that, when you ask  someone to do a favor, you owe that person something in return. And,  when that person is a foreign leader, that means, as President of the  United States, one day you will have to put a foreign leader's  interests ahead of America's interests.    This is only the tip of the iceberg, this note that the President has  released, and that is why it is important that we hear from the  whistleblower.   It is also important to note that Ukraine depends on the U.S.  economically, militarily, and the credibility we afford to them when we  support them. So, you don't need to be explicit with them when you tell  them that you need a favor and you are withholding military funds.   In this case, the whistleblower did everything right; so now it is  time for the Acting Director of National Intelligence to do the same.
