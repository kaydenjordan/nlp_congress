 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to criticize the Republican plan  to enact a 30 percent sales tax. This move would cost American families  millions of dollars with higher prices for food and household  necessities, and it would provide millions to the already wealthiest 1  percent of Americans.   Remember when many of these House Republicans were running for  office? They claimed to make inflation and other economic factors their  number one priority. Instead, their priority has been to make it easier  to mislead the American people, stock committees with people who want  to overthrow the country and increase prices on everything from  gasoline to groceries to punish working-class Americans.   Thankfully, we have a Democratic Senate to shut down these abuses of  power and protect the American people.                            ____________________
