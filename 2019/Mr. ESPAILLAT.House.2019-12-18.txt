 Madam Speaker, if you live on Lenox Avenue in the  village of Harlem in my district, you are not above the law.   If you live on Webster Avenue in the Bronx part of my district, you  are not above the law.   If you live in Washington Heights, the immigrant neighborhood in my  district, you are not above the law.   So I submit to you, if you live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, you are  not above the law, and you will be held accountable.   President Donald Trump asked the Ukrainian President to ``do us a  favor'' and look into the Bidens. That is abuse of power.   President Trump used the official White House meeting to extort the  Ukrainian President. That is abuse of power.   President Trump ordered White House staff to withhold $400 million in  aid to Ukraine. That is abuse of power.   President Trump and his staff defied multiple subpoenas from  Congress. That is obstruction of Congress.   He blocked witnesses from testifying before this body. That is  obstruction of Congress.   No one is above the law. I cast my vote for these Articles of  Impeachment, and I ask my colleagues to do the same.
