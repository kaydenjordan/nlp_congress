 Mr. Speaker, since the Affordable Care Act was signed  into law, millions of Americans have gained access to valuable  healthcare services, and every American has seen their health insurance  benefits improve.   While there are ways the Affordable Care Act can be improved, we  cannot afford to go back to the days when big insurance companies had  the power to decide what care Americans could receive, deny coverage to  children with diagnosed conditions, cancel coverage  [[Page H247]]  when people got sick, and place limits on the amount of care people can  receive.   Last week, Carol Lodi from Harvard, Massachusetts, in my district,  called and told her story. She and her husband gained healthcare  coverage under the Affordable Care Act. She is 61. Her husband is 63.  They are self-employed. She said: ``If we lose the insurance, we don't  know what we'll do.''   Mr. Speaker, please listen to the Lodi family and millions of other  families like them. Don't turn your back on them and make America sick  again.                            ____________________
