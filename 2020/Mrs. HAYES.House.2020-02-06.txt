 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment to preserve the  ability for new, voluntarily recognized unions to collectively bargain  for a reasonable period of time without the threat of an invited  decertification campaign.   I include in the Record a letter from the National Education  Association in support of the PRO Act.                                 National Education Association,                                   Washington, DC, February 6, 2020.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 3 million members of       the National Education Association who work in schools and on       college campuses in 14,000 communities, we urge you to vote       YES on the Protect the Right to Organize Act (H.R. 2474).       Votes associated with this issue may be included in NEA's       Report Card for the 116th Congress.        Collective bargaining is crucial in providing working       people with a voice in the workplace and a means for       improving their families' financial circumstances. The       freedom to collectively bargain, in both the public and the       private sectors, helps reduce income inequality and assists       low- and middle-income workers in sharing in economic growth.       However, according to Bureau of Labor statistics, only 6.2       percent of workers in the private sector were union members       in 2019. Employers' hostility to union organizing is largely       to blame for the declining number of private-sector union       members. This negatively affects working families and our       nation's economic viability. The PRO Act will take several       steps to reduce the barriers to private-sector union       organizing, including:        Revising the definition of ``employee'' and ``supervisor''       to prevent employers from classifying employees as exempt       from labor law protections;        Expanding unfair labor practices to include prohibitions       against replacement of or discrimination against workers who       participate in strikes;        Making it an unfair labor practice to require or coerce       employees to attend employer meetings designed to discourage       union membership an unfair labor practice; and        Allowing injunctions against employers engaging in unfair       labor practices involving discharge or serious economic harm       to an employee.        All working families deserve financial stability and the       ability to negotiate to improve their circumstances. The       right to organize is essential to these, and to our nation's       overall economic health. We urge you to vote YES on the PRO       Act to help remove barriers to organizing in the private       sector.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,                                    National Education Association.     Mr. Chair, as a union member, I have had the benefits of  the organizing and collective bargaining power of WTA, CEA, NEA, and  SEIU 1199. But not all people work in fields with a history of  unionization. New unions need a chance to bargain with employers and  prove they are productive and skilled advocates on behalf of their  members.   For over 40 years, the National Labor Relations Board protected the  voluntary recognition process by affording a reasonable amount of time  for employers and unions to collectively bargain without fear of  decertification challenges. That rule balanced the need for stability  in labor relations with the right to have an election, while giving the  unions a chance to demonstrate effectiveness to its members.   In 2007, the Bush administration's NLRB scrapped that policy by  requiring employers to post a notice inviting a decertification  election within a 45-day window, fostering uncertainty among employees,  undermining stability in collective bargaining, and encouraging  employers to stall at the bargaining table. Although the NLRB rejected  this policy in 2011, this administration has proposed to revive it.   Unions need our support now more than ever. In 2018, Connecticut saw  a 3.5 percent decline in union membership from the previous year. Due  to this administration's attacks following the Janus Supreme Court  decision, national union membership is at 10.3 percent, down from 20.1  percent from the first year data was collected in 1983.   We should not be proposing new rules meant to antagonize and  intimidate newly formed unions or new workers advocating for their  constitutional right to organize. We should be giving new unions the  tools they need to succeed.   A nonunionized workforce means lower wages, poorer working  conditions, and reduced benefits. It means working at risk of  exploitation. It means a workforce left with no tools to advocate for  themselves in the workplace.   The PRO Act will strengthen unions formed over a century ago and  those formed today. It will bolster the power of workers and the middle  class by giving labor law teeth to prevent intimidation and  retaliation. It will strengthen Connecticut workers' rights to  collectively bargain on behalf of their members. And it will put a stop  to the blatant attacks from employers and State legislatures.   Mr. Chair, I stand with my union brothers and sisters at all stages  of the unionization process.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment ensuring new  unions are given the chance to organize without a rushed threat of  decertification.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, first, the PRO Act does not require employees  to recognize unions without first having an election. Rather, the right  of an employer to voluntarily recognize a union has been the law of  this land since 1935, when the National Labor Relations Act was  enacted.   Voluntary recognition happens with demonstrated majority support from  members by petition or union authorization cards.   Again, voluntary recognition happens with demonstrated majority  support from members by petition or union authorization cards.   The PRO Act simply strengthens employees' right to a free and fair  election by establishing more effective remedies when an employer  unlawfully interferes with an election.   Second, my amendment does not undermine the right to have an  election. It codifies a period of time during which a union and an  employer can focus on bargaining an agreement and allows workers to  exercise their constitutional right to collectively bargain. It  prevents wasteful delay tactics so both parties can get to the  negotiating table.   If we are going to protect the practice of collective bargaining, we  need to ensure there is a reasonable time period for the union to  represent employees and bargain on their behalf without fighting over  other challenges.   This time period only begins after the employees have demonstrated a  majority want to have a union. It does not stop employees from seeking  an election after a reasonable time of 1 year, provided it does not  interfere with other existing NLRB policies.   The reality is union membership is declining because of the continued  attacks on working-class Americans. Our workers are losing a seat at  the table in their own workplaces. They need us to defend their rights  and ensure they have a fair shot at negotiation.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stand up for unions and support  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
