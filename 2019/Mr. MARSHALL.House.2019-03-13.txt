 Mr. Speaker, in many parts of my district and all  across Kansas, farmer cooperatives are the foundation of a modernized  and productive agriculture industry. For decades, co-ops have been  farmers' primary business partner, supplier, and grain buyer.  Memberships have been passed down from one generation to another, and  relationships have been lifelong.   Today, our farmer co-ops are as strong and as important as ever. In  the far reaches of my district, the co-ops provide feed, fertilizer,  and fuel to farmers.   As times and needs have changed, so too have our co-ops. From online  platforms for account statements and purchasing to precision technology  that reduces fertilizer inputs and improves soil productivity,  innovation has been necessary and vital to the co-ops' success.   Kansas farmer co-ops are responsible for more than 4,600 jobs and  $1.1 billion in total economic impact, statewide. These member-owned  organizations have been and will continue to be vital to the continued  growth and success of the agriculture industry.   Farmers are facing steep headwinds, and organizations like the co-ops  are important in helping producers navigate through uncertainty in the  industry.   We often take the time to thank our farmers, but it is also important  we thank the hardworking men and  [[Page H2685]]  women of our farmer co-ops for the valuable time and expertise they put  into supporting our farmers and our agriculture industry.                         Celebrating National Ag Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of National Ag  Day, a celebration of our Nation's oldest and most important industry  and the hardworking men and women who put food on our table, clothes on  our back, and fuel in our cars.   The number of people in agriculture today is but a fraction of what  it was 100 years ago, but the impact of today's agriculture industry is  unprecedented. Today's farmer feeds about 165 people, and agriculture  remains this country's number one export.   In Kansas, agriculture accounts for nearly half the State's economy,  and, in my district, that number is more than 60 percent. For many  rural communities, farming and ranching is the sole economic driver.   Kansas is the national leader in agriculture, ranking first in the  production of grain sorghum, second in the production of wheat, third  for cattle, and fourth in the production of sunflowers. In fact, Kansas  is second in the Nation for the total number of acres farmed.                                time  1015    Winters like the one we are currently experiencing at home have  highlighted the time and dedication farmers and ranchers have to their  land and animals. In Kansas, farmers with livestock are working around  the clock to ensure the animals are healthy, warm, and well fed. That  means enduring subzero windchills, blizzard-like conditions, and  middle-of-the-night checks.   While agriculture has become a target of environmentalists who want  to discontinue life as we know it in Kansas, I am here today to testify  to the great work farmers and ranchers have done to protect and improve  our air, land, and water. Farmers are the original conservationists,  and continue to find ways to do more with less, while protecting our  most valuable natural resources.   National Ag Day is our opportunity to celebrate farmers and ranchers,  highlight the impact they have on our communities and country, and  remember the thousands of products made possible by their hard work.   Back home, it is a day to introduce thousands of grade school kids to  the agriculture industry with fun things like how to milk a cow,  gathering eggs, and even flying drones.   I encourage Members to join me today in celebration of National  Agriculture Day and take time to thank a farmer.                            ____________________
