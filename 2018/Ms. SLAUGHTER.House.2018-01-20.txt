 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, today is the 1-year anniversary of a complete Republican  control of Washington. The majority runs the White House, the Senate,  and the House of Representatives. And what do we have to show for it?   First, a tax bill for corporations and the wealthy. Now, the great  Government of the United States is closed for business.   The impacts will be severe. Just look what happened during the last  Republican shutdown in 2013, which cost our economy an estimated $24  billion:   We lost progress on reducing the massive backlog of veterans'  disability claims;   Two-thirds of the Centers for Disease Control and three-fourths of  the National Institutes of Health were furloughed;   Flu season surveillance and monitoring was severely limited, and we  are in a crisis, this year, with the flu where more than 20 children  have died;   Lifesaving FDA food safety inspections were delayed;   1.2 million private sector loans to individuals and small businesses  were disrupted;   Billions in tax refunds were delayed;   Head Start centers serving 6,300 children were closed; and   120,000 private sector jobs were destroyed.   Why is the government shut down today?   Because the majority was so obsessed with handing out tax breaks to  the wealthy and corporations that they ignored their responsibility to  the American people. They failed to renew, before they expired,  community health centers.   They failed to permanently renew the Children's Health Insurance  Program, which the CBO--Congressional Budget Office--had found would  save the government over $6 billion over 10 years.   That is despite the fact that the majority made their tax cuts for  corporations permanent.   That was a tax bill, by the way, that was sold as a middle class tax  cut. But we know today that it was anything but. It is a tax cut for  big corporations and the superwealthy, and it seems designed to target  blue States. I live in one.   Action on these items shouldn't be some extraordinary exercise.  Republicans and Democrats agree that we need to address them. But the  majority has been missing in action.   All the while, we have been forced to limp along, funding the  government in month-long tranches. That is no way to run a business,  and it is certainly no way to run the Government of the United States  of America.   President Trump tweeted last May: ``Our country needs a good  `shutdown.'''   In 2011, years before he assumed office, President Trump said, during  an interview, as another Republican shutdown loomed: ``If there is a  shutdown, I think it would be a tremendously negative mark on the  President of the United States. He's the one that has to get people  together.'' We would like to have him do that and play that role now.   The President should not treat this like a reality show, and the  majority should stop treating government like a game where the truth is  so easily discarded.   The majority's short-term CR failed last night in the other body  because it didn't get the job done. It was written behind closed doors  without a single bit of input from the minority party.   Democrats weren't alone in making clear that this continuing  resolution was unacceptable.   Members of the majority's own conference voted against it on both  sides of the Capitol.   If I were in the majority's shoes with 51 seats in the other body,  and I had to get to 60 votes, I would want Democrats to be in on it  with me. To do that, we need to be in on it at all steps, not just at  the time of the vote.   The majority is quick to invoke the name of my State Senator--that I  think will not cross my lips because of what we just went through--but  let me say that that Senator from the State of New York earned perfect  scores on his SATs, was heard one Saturday morning on NPR on two  different subjects, and I don't believe anyone could honestly say that  he ever misunderstood what the President said during a meeting, or that  he would leave a meeting in any way confounded or confused.    They were apparently close to a deal to avert a shutdown.   The problem is that this President apparently thinks one thing at 10  a.m. and another one at noon--somewhat like Alice in Wonderland--and  that makes reaching an agreement extraordinarily difficult.   Even the Senate majority leader from my other home State of Kentucky,  Senator Mitch McConnell, said this week: ``I'm looking for something  that President Trump supports. And he's not yet indicated what measure  he's willing to sign.''   So the majority in both Chambers should try something new for a  change: we call it bipartisanship.   I am here today ready to craft a compromise that addresses the needs  facing the American people. So are my Democratic colleagues.   To the majority, I say this with all of my heart: Work with us for  the good of this country, and let us end this shutdown before Monday.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is day one of the Trump shutdown. What a sad day it  is for this institution and what an incredibly sad day this is for our  country.   This Republican-controlled government is incompetent. It takes my  breath away. You control the House, the Senate, and the White House,  and this is what we get, one continuing resolution after another, and  now a Trump shutdown. You should be fired. This is so incredibly wrong.   You say you want Democrats to support your spending bills, yet you  won't work with us, you won't even talk to us. Negotiating bills in  back rooms with only Republicans is not how you get a bipartisan vote.  This my-way-or-the-highway approach undermines our democracy and  results in lousy bills that do not serve the interests of the American  people.   The Republican leadership promised regular order. They promised to  respect the views of everybody, including the views of the minority.  They promised a more open process. That has turned out to be a big, fat  lie.   I hear from my Republican friends that they care about the DREAMers.  We all know that if the Dream Act was brought before this House, it  would pass with a bipartisan vote, but the Republican leadership around  here is so pathetically terrified by the most hateful, xenophobic, and  bigoted elements of their base that they would rather shut down the  government than put a bipartisan bill on the floor.   I would have thought that once the Republican leadership got the one  thing that gets them out of bed in the morning--massive tax cuts for  hedge fund managers and multinational corporations--that they would be  willing to actually govern. I guess not.   We need a permanent fix to CHIP, which has been expired for 112 days  because the Republicans have refused to reauthorize it, but we need to  fund community health centers, medical research, and veterans' health.  We need funds to deal with the opiate crisis. We need to support our  men and women in the armed services. We desperately need to invest in  our aging infrastructure.   What we don't need are more and more short-term CRs that fail to  address so many urgent needs in this country.   My colleagues, today, millions of Americans, led by fed up women, are  marching in cities and towns all across the country and they have a  message. They don't like the way you are governing and they are not  going to take it anymore.   So to my Republican friends, ask yourselves if you want to keep  following Trump and the most extreme elements of your party off a  political cliff, because that is where they are taking you. If you keep  following them, history will not be kind.   So stop the nonsense, stop the obstructionism. Do your job and work  with Democrats for the good of our country. The American people are  watching.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised to direct their remarks  to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I am sorry that the majority leader didn't mention it, but were there  any Democrats in those meetings in his office?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Vermont  (Mr. Welch), a former member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 1\1/2\ minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 1\1/2\ minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oregon does not know  what the Health and Prevention Fund is all about. It is more than  children's health. It is vaccines; it is insulin; it is lead paint  protection programs. Know what it is. This is the majority who has  spent the better part of the year decimating an Affordable Care Act and  not caring a wit about what was happening to children and their  healthcare.   We do not fund community health centers, and children who are  eligible for CHIP will not be able to get the help they need because  they can't go a community healthcare center. And if you are really  concerned about the children of this Nation and their healthcare, bring  a clean CHIP bill to this floor and let's make it permanent. Don't  hide. Don't hide behind the children of this country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Polis), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Polis), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 4871, the Pay Our  Military Act, to guarantee pay and death benefits for our military.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum) to discuss our proposal.   Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, the failure of President Trump and the  Republican-controlled Congress to do their work on time and in good  faith has serious consequences for our country and for our national  security.   The Republican approach of governing by short-term continuing  resolution deprives our military of long-term budget certainty that  they need to keep our country safe.   President Trump's Secretary of Defense has warned of the severe harm  operating under continuing resolutions and the harm that it has done to  our military readiness.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for the President and for Republicans to end  this chaos and to work with us on a long-term budget deal that reopens  our government, adequately funds our military, and upholds our  commitments here at home.   Sadly, the government shutdown that began at midnight means that  hundreds of thousands of government employees who serve in critical  roles keeping us safe will now be forced to work without pay. We all  thank them for their service.   As the President himself has acknowledged, the Republican-inflicted  shutdown means that our active military will not get paid, causing  serious repercussions for their families.   I grew up in a military family and I understand the sacrifices our  servicemembers and their families make. And I know all of us, as  Democrats and Republicans, agree that it is just plain wrong to ask our  servicemen and -women in uniform to put their lives on the line without  pay.  [[Page H597]]    That is why we have introduced the Pay Our Military Act of 2018. This  bill provides for both pay and death benefits for our servicemen and - women during this government shutdown. It includes pay and support for  the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and the Coast Guard. This bill  ensures that our military is able to perform their duties during any  shutdown this fiscal year without worrying about the financial security  of their families.   Should one of our servicemen or -women take and make the ultimate  sacrifice, this bill ensures that their family will be taken care of by  our country. That is the least we can do.   There is a strong precedent for this bill. This House passed similar  legislation unanimously--unanimously--during the last government  shutdown in 2013. This morning, President Trump tweeted that our  country needs to do even better by our military. The Pay Our Military  Act fulfills this mission.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question so we can bring up this  bill and pay our troops.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, maybe my good friend was not able to  keep his eyes awake last night to see that a bipartisan group of  Members in the other body voted resoundingly to defeat this  insignificant and this shallow CR that you sent to the other body.  Maybe you were not able to see that.   So what I will say to you is that I join with my whip in a 4-day CR,  because maybe you have just forgotten the fact that the most  catastrophic storm hit Texas, and then others went on to Puerto Rico  and the Virgin Islands and Florida.                                time  1800    No one has heard one word about those who are suffering with housing  that still looks like this, or those houses that are under water. Maybe  you don't know that the children who need children's health insurance  need the clinics that you gutted.   I would ask you, if you really have any kind of compassion, to read  Mr. Steele's comments, who indicated, as a former chair of the  Republican National Committee, that those who are at fault for shutting  down the government is a Republican President, Republican House, and  Republican Senate.   You can't do your job. Democrats are trying to do their job for the  American people. You shut the government down. Worry about those who  are suffering from hurricanes.   Where is your compassion?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Once again, the Chair reminds Members to  please address their remarks to the Chair and not to one another.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Al Green).   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to explain why there is a  government shutdown.   There is a government shutdown because the self-proclaimed great  dealmaker breaks more deals than he makes. Just ask the Americans who  are going to pay for the wall he said Mexico would pay for. Just ask  the Senators who took him the deal that he asked for.   Mr. Speaker, when you break more deals than you make, you are not a  great dealmaker; you are a great deal breaker. We have a great deal  breaker in the White House. That is why we have a shutdown.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the minority leader and our  great friend and a woman we are very happy about.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, what we are witnessing here today  on the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration is a  complete failure by the majority in leadership and governance.   For the first time ever, we have a shutdown where one party controls  the White House and both houses of Congress, and Federal employees will  risk being sent home and losing pay.   Not a surprise, given the twisted, upside-down priorities that  dominate the Republican agenda.   Instead of expanding health coverage, Trump and Republicans have been  focused on taking it away. Instead of providing responsible tax relief  focused on America's middle class, Republicans passed a huge tax scam  that produced handouts to corporations and the wealthy and explodes the  deficit.   Now, rather than passing a responsible long-term spending plan, we  have another shortsighted budget Band-Aid and the historic Trump budget  shutdown.   Our colleagues have clearly been reading from their alternative facts  dictionary today, because it does not pass the straight-face test in  any corner of this country that Republicans actually care anything  about people's healthcare. Please, give me a break.   Let's end the Trump shutdown by working together and focusing on  bipartisan progress. Americans deserve at least that much from this  body.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price).   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, we are 3\1/2\ months into  the fiscal year without a budget. Republicans are proposing to lurch  along another month with no resolution in sight and no commitment to  address critical investments. Democrats will not be a party to further  delay.   It is not a great mystery how to deal with this. We have done it each  of the last 4 years. We must have a year-long budget in place with a  bipartisan agreement to adjust the defense and nondefense caps so that  we can pass our 12 appropriations bills. Democrats have been willing to  enter into such agreement for at least 6 months.   Republican leaders need to reject their Tea Party extremists and  conclude a budget agreement across the aisle.   We also must be assured of progress toward resolving the status of  DREAMers, the 800,000 young people who were brought here as children  and have known no other country. President Trump created a crisis in  removing the DREAMers' protection. He asked Congress to devise a long- term solution; he then blew up the solution. They are dangerously  exposed. We must address their dilemma.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is the fifth Republican government shutdown in the  last 30 years. It is the first shutdown in modern history when one  party held the House, the Senate, and the White House.   During the 2013 government shutdown, the economy lost $1.5 billion a  day. I am sure it is even more now.   We need to work across the aisle, and the majority needs to work with  us, and let's solve this problem.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question and the  rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption of the resolution.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 224,  nays 180, not voting 26, as follows:                               [Roll No. 41]                                 YEAS--224       Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Curtis      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
