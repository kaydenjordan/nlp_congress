 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his  leadership and for allowing me to come here and speak in support of the  TRID Improvement Act and the other bills that are in this package.   Madam Speaker, we have seen countless examples of overregulation and  regulatory mission creep by many agencies, and especially of the CFPB.  But one of the things the CFPB should be doing is making sure that  consumers have the right information when closing on a home.   Unfortunately, the CFPB's 2015 mortgage disclosure caused many home  buyers to not have an accurate disclosure of their title insurance  premiums. The commonsense bill proposed by my colleague, Mr. Hill, will  make sure that home buyers know exactly the cost of their title  insurance, not two different prices from a loan estimate and a closing  document.   I also strongly support several other pieces of legislation that have  been included in this package. Mr. Ross' bill, the FSOC Improvement  Act, will make regulation of large financial institutions much smarter  and more effective.  [[Page H1163]]  Instead of only focusing on punishing companies for violations of  rules, regulators should also focus on what should be the real purpose  of financial regulations, which is reducing risk.   Mr. Ross' bill will also allow nonbank financial companies the  opportunity to reduce any risky activities before they are designated  as systemically important. This will help financial regulators to  achieve their intended purpose rather than simply being a gotcha game  on regulated companies.   All of these bills we are considering today received overwhelming  bipartisan support in the Financial Services Committee, and I urge all  of my colleagues to support this legislative package.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to  whether or not the chairman has more speakers?
