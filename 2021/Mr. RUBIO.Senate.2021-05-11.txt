 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in December of 2019, as a new virus was  emerging on the opposite side of the world, I spoke at the National  Defense University, and the title of the speech I gave was called  ``American Industrial Policy and the Rise of China.''   The reaction of many people to that at the time was skepticism--from  Wall Street investors who, frankly, saw no problem with the status quo  on China; from these think-tank experts who mocked my claim at the time  that our country relied too much on China economically in our supply  chain; and from tech giants in Silicon Valley obsessed with access to  the Chinese marketplace.   But the problem I pointed to at that time in that speech, almost 2  years ago--a year and a half ago--was that for over a quarter century,  our economic policies have been mostly about one thing: how American  investors and companies can make money by doing business with China. In  that vein, it didn't matter if making money meant allowing China to  steal our intellectual property, it didn't matter if making money meant  stable American jobs kept disappearing, and it didn't matter if making  money meant investing in Chinese companies developing technologies to  help defeat our country in a future war.   Finally, Americans are waking up to what a mistake that was. It was a  bipartisan consensus that was flawed.   The 21st century will be defined by the relationship between China  and the United States. Frankly, I believe that this is our last chance  to make sure that it is a balanced relationship.   What we do not have time for are China bills or a China bill that is  a collection of half-measures and studies. Instead, an actually  meaningful China bill is what we need. I believe most Members here want  it, and I believe we can get to it in a bipartisan way. But, to do so,  I think it has to have six things. If you want a meaningful bill on  China, it must touch on six things.   The first is like I said in December of 2019: We need to identify  industries which are critical for our future, and we must spur  investment in these key industries. We have to remember that we are not  in a strategic competition with foreign Chinese companies. We are in a  strategic competition with the world's largest and second wealthiest  nation-state.   There is no way to compete with China by relying only, solely on  private investment, not while the Chinese Communist Party subsidizes  and cheats to boost its favorite companies. From industrial corporate  giants to small businesses that make up our supply chain, the private  sector is the most important area of this competition. We can encourage  them to step up, just like we did for semiconductors with the CHIPS  Act.   Frankly, the way we developed the vaccine with Operation Warp Speed  is an example of a targeted industrial policy in which government  partners with the private sector to solve a big problem. You can say  what you want about America's response to COVID, but we have done  vaccines better than anyone else in the world--not even close--and it  is due to that partnership.   But an essential part of our strategy has to be, as a result, to  build a strong foundation through targeted and sustained Federal  funding for American research and development. The bipartisan Endless  Frontier Act is a nod in that direction. Right now, that bill makes the  National Science Foundation the lead Agency in directing $100 billion  in government investment. The problem is that is the same Agency that,  time and again, has had the research we fund stolen by professors and  graduate students who are on the payroll for China.   DARPA and other advanced research Agencies within government have a  much better record of protecting research and, I believe, would be a  far better choice to administer these investments, instead.   The second thing a real China bill must do is communicate that while  we do not seek an armed confrontation with China, we will confront any  military aggression, we will maintain our defense commitments with our  allies, and we will win any conflict China starts.   We must never do anything that leads Beijing to doubt our commitment  to Taiwan, and we must never accept the Chinese Communist Party's  illegitimate claims on the world's most important shipping lanes in the  South and East China Seas. The Strategic Competition Act we recently  passed out of the Foreign Relations Committee is largely silent on this  topic, but Chairman Menendez has pledged to work with me to include my  South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act in any final bill that  we take up here on the floor.   The third thing a real China bill must do is fix broken international  and domestic trade laws. The World Trade Organization is failing  miserably, and it must be reformed. And China's flagrant intellectual  property theft, industrial espionage, and massive subsidies to Chinese  companies can no longer be ignored and they must be addressed. My Fair  Trade with China Enforcement Act would help protect critical industries  in America from Chinese influence and possession and recover the lost  value of secrets and technologies that they have stolen.   The fourth area of focus of any real China bill must be making sure  China doesn't control our medicines and/or our medical technology and  patient data. Last year, panic over masks and ventilators was a wake-up  call for our medical dependence on Beijing.   From blood thinners to acetaminophen, which is the ingredient in  Tylenol, we have allowed China to dominate the pharmaceutical  manufacturing market. It is dangerous leverage over America and  Americans. We should be able to make medicines here. This will not only  make us safer; it will create well-paying, stable jobs for American  workers. My Medical Manufacturing, Economic Development, and  Sustainability Act would do exactly that and should be included in any  real China bill.   As I said in September of 2019, we must immediately enact stricter  guidelines to make sure that public funding never contributes to  Chinese genomics efforts and beats them in that R&D race. If we allow  China to dominate genetic data and that field of medicine, Americans  will one day find themselves begging Chinese companies, and even the  Chinese Communist Party, for access to future lifesaving treatments.   The fifth area a real China bill must address is our capital markets.  Our  [[Page S2436]]  stock market is the most open, liquid, and profitable in the world, and  it is being used by the Chinese Communist Party to fund its military  and to fund their companies. Any meaningful China bill must cut off the  tap and prohibit American money from being invested in communist  China's military companies.   We need to start requiring more transparency from Wall Street when it  comes to investing in China and Chinese Government-controlled  companies. My American Financial Markets Integrity and Security Act  needs to be part of the solution   How can we claim to be dealing with Chinese manipulation of our  capital markets if we don't ban Chinese companies exploiting our own  stock market to hurt us? Beijing long ago figured out how to get rich  and powerful Americans to use their influence in American politics.   Allowing Wall Street and Big Finance to enrich themselves by hurting  Americans may make a lot of money in the short term for those  individuals, but it is hurting America in the long run. It is national  economic suicide.   The sixth area any real China bill must address is genocide. Today,  in China, nationless corporations, cooperating with the Chinese  Communist Party, force Uighur Muslims to make clothing and shoes and  even solar panels. Sadly, without knowing it, you may have very well  purchased a product made partially or entirely by slave labor in  Xinjiang.   These companies partnering with China are complicit in these crimes.  The Chinese Communist Party's reduced labor costs mean increased  profits for these corporations. While they lecture us about social  justice in America, these companies are making billions off of slavery  in China.   My bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act has almost half the  Senate as cosponsors. We must take it up and pass it out of the Foreign  Relations Committee as soon as possible.   Last year, we saw companies like Nike, Apple, Coca-Cola, and even the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbying against this bill. Well, soon we are  going to find out what holds more power in our country: corporations  making billions off genocide and slavery or our basic sense of right  and wrong.   The good news is that, today, we have finally awoken to the reality  of how wrong the old consensus on China was. But we woke up almost too  late. We don't have time for half-measures. We must address the  dangerous growing imbalance between America and China comprehensively,  decisively, and swiftly, or we will live to see a future in which the  world's most powerful nation is a totalitarian, genocidal, communist  dictatorship and our country is relegated to the role of a once-great  nation in decline.   No part of our lives will go unaffected in a world like that. We can  see the shadows of it even today. American movies today are free to  portray their own country here, the United States, as racist, as  bigoted, anything they want, but they automatically self-censor their  own movies to make sure they meet China's standards so they can show  those films there.   American corporations threaten States whose democratically elected  leaders pass laws they object to. They have every right in our  democracy to object, but they will fire American employees and ban  messages that risk getting their corporation kicked out of the Chinese  market.   And American teenagers are already turning over valuable personal  data to the Chinese Government on an hourly basis in exchange for the  ability to watch what I will admit are clever videos on TikTok.   Yet, this is nothing compared to the world that awaits if we do not  take action, and on this the lessons of history could not be clearer.   Athens emerged from the second Persian war a great power, but their  greatness made them decadent and complacent. They thought nothing would  ever change, that they could ignore important problems, that they could  focus on the trivial. So when conflict finally came, initially they  used their superior navy to attack Sparta and retreat behind the safety  of the city's walls.   That worked for a little while. Then a plague decimated the city, and  more enemies of theirs sensed their weakness and joined the fight  against them. Then Athens fell.   Like Rome and Britain later, the end of Athens' golden age came as it  always does for a great power. It doesn't come from the outside in; it  always comes from the inside out.   Now, from across the centuries, the lessons of history cry out for  our attention. Our politics are broken. We fight over the trivial  because we think the past is irrelevant, because we think our place in  the world will never change, and because we think the future will  always belong to us automatically. We hide behind our own version of  the walls, two vast oceans, believing, ultimately, we are safe from  everything outside.   We should not repeat the errors of the great powers of the past. My  friends, we don't have time for studies and strategy statements. We  need big changes and decisive action. We need to prove that our  democracy can work again, that our system of government can function,  and that it can solve big problems in big ways.   If we succeed, I truly believe a new American century lies ahead. If  we fail, it is a century of humiliation that awaits us.   I yield the floor    Mr. President, I recognize Jim Cameron, who served  Volusia County and its residents, as the senior vice president of  government relations at the Daytona Regional Chamber of Commerce. After  38 years of service, I thank Jim for his years of work and wish him  well as he retires.   In its 101-year history, Jim holds the longest tenure at the Daytona  Regional Chamber of Commerce. As Vice president of government  relations, he understood local, State, and Federal economic issues  facing Volusia County. Throughout his tenure, Jim's professional  relationships with some of Florida's most influential political and  business leaders bettered his community.   In 1985, Jim's was working to receive approval from the State  legislature to utilize hotel bed tax revenues towards financing a  county-run convention center. After a span of 5 years, Volusia County  opened the Ocean Center Convention Center in Daytona Beach Center due  in part to his efforts. This is just one of many career highlights that  Jim is proud of.   Jim's more recent community accomplishments include advocating for  SunRail's extension in Volusia County, helping the Hard Rock Hotel  establish a resort in Daytona Beach, and working with Space Florida to  recruit aerospace manufacturing to Volusia County. Simultaneously, he  was also instrumental in important State legislative matters and  advocating for pro-job policies.   Jim is fond of the professional relationships he has formed  throughout his career, with many evolving into close friendships. His  personalized approach to government relations is best seen on his  guarantee to pay $1,000 if he does not return your call within eight  business hours.   Jim grew up in Montgomery, AL, graduating with a double major in  history and political science from the University of Alabama. After  graduation, he was appointed to the Calhoun County Chamber of Commerce  in Anniston, AL, to oversee industrial and public affairs. He later  moved to Daytona Beach, where he began working at the Daytona Regional  Chamber in 1983.   I am grateful for Jim's decades of faithful and dedicated service to  our State and for his work with my office. I extend my best wishes to  Jim, his wife Rita, and to his family on a well-earned  retirement.                            ____________________
