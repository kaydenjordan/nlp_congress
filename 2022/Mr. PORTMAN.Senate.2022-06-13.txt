 Mr. President, are we in legislative session?    Mr. President, for the 15th straight week, while the  U.S. Senate has been in session, I come to the floor to talk about what  is going on in Ukraine. This is the war that Russia continues to wage  against the people of Ukraine. I am going to talk about what has  happened in the last week--some of it is very concerning--but also  about what we can do right now to help more, to help our ally Ukraine,  to help President Zelenskyy and his duly elected government, and to  help the people of Ukraine.   Last week, I talked about a grim milestone, 100 days of this war. It  is becoming a war of attrition. The Russians expected a quick victory,  you remember. That didn't happen. Now they are grinding it out in one  area called the Donbas region. And unfortunately, they are making some  incremental progress there. In a minute, I will have a map here to show  you where the  [[Page S2916]]  Donbas region is. But that is where the focus is right now. That is  where the Russians are grinding it out.   The fate of Ukraine, its future, may be decided here in the next few  months or maybe even weeks, given what is happening in the Donbas. The  Russians have regrouped, and they are using their superior weapons,  particularly long-range artillery. The Ukrainians, although they are  fighting valiantly, just don't have that longer range artillery to be  able to counteract what Russia is doing. So the Russians are sitting  back with this long-range, more accurate artillery. They are hitting  Ukrainian positions, taking out Ukrainian cities, flattening them. And  then the Ukrainians can't reach them because they don't have artillery  that is long range.   There has been some Ukrainian progress in the past week. If you look  at this map, you can see that in the northeast, around Kharkiv--up  here, you see this light blue--Ukrainians have made some progress. In  fact, in one case, they actually pushed the Russians back to the  Russian border.   They also made some progress here in the south. And you see the city  of Kherson, that was one of the first big cities that the Russians took  during this most recent attack. The Ukrainians are now moving toward  that area. That is positive news.   But, frankly, one reason they are making the progress is the Russians  are all focused right here. This is the Donbas region we talked about  earlier, and this is where the Russians are making incremental progress  and killing, frankly, a lot of Ukrainian civilians but also Ukrainian  soldiers.   Russia is grinding it out, as I said earlier, meaning that they are  using their superior artillery fire. They have more troops. They have  more weapons. But the Ukrainian defenders are fighting hard. They are  making the Russians pay for every single inch of territory that is  being taken. This is particularly true in Severodonetsk, which is right  in here.   In Severodonetsk, there is an ongoing battle tonight as we talk. The  Russians are engaged in urban combat there, and the Ukrainians have  fiercely defended their homeland. But I will say, the Russians are  still advancing bit by bit, in some cases kilometer by kilometer, every  day, because they have the firepower, especially the longer-range,  accurate, and deadly artillery.   Reports yesterday indicate that unless Ukrainians can get access to  that long-range artillery themselves, Severodonetsk and the entire  Luhansk region could fall to Russia soon. Possibly within weeks. This  should alarm all of us. It should alarm the administration; it should  alarm the Congress. Because every time Russia gains more territory,  they reduce it to mostly rubble, destroy it, and then they dig in,  making it twice as hard to get that territory back.   Because the Russians have more artillery than the Ukrainians and  their weapons have longer ranges, the Russian forces concentrate their  massive firepower on Ukrainian positions from a distance, as I said,  which the Ukrainian forces cannot reach. And then they move in.   They destroy the territory. They occupy it. This disparity in the  quality and quantity of artillery has put Ukraine at a distinct  disadvantage. The good news is that we can fix this problem. We can  level this playing field and address this disparity. America and her  allies have the ability to do it, and it is urgent that we do it now.   In our inventory, we have hundreds of what are called High Mobility  Artillery Rocket Systems or HIMARS. It is an advanced system that is  actually superior to the Russian artillery in almost every way, more  mobility, faster reload time, more accuracy, and--more importantly-- more range.   Getting these systems, these HIMARS systems to Ukraine could be a  game changer. It could save so many lives. With these systems in the  arsenal, the Ukrainians could turn the tables on the Russians here in  the Donbas region.   They could grind the Russian advance to a halt and maybe even push  the Russian forces back, as they are doing in Kharkiv up here or down  here in the south.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration has been unwilling to act  quickly on these HIMARS. Two weeks ago, after weeks of Ukrainian  requests, echoed by some of us here in the U.S. Congress, President  Biden announced that he would provide Ukraine with some of these  systems. I was really pleased we were finally taking that step.   However, according to the Department of Defense, I now learned that  the administration is only sending four of these systems--four. The  administration has said that it is only providing Ukraine with mid- range missiles as well, meaning Ukrainian troops will need to fire from  closer to Russian positions and put themselves at greater risk.   That announcement of our decision to send four systems will be 2  weeks old on Wednesday. We were told these systems require almost 3  weeks in training to be able to operate. That means, at best, Ukraine  will have four U.S. artillery systems operational sometime late this  week or maybe next week.   Ukraine has been fighting for its life for weeks along a massive  front line, this front line all along here. And the Biden  administration is only now sending this military support; and, frankly,  it is just not enough. Combine this with the public reporting that the  M777 howitzer promised to Ukraine months ago back in mid-April are  arriving very slowly, and you have a picture that shows that we are not  responding with urgency to the situation in Ukraine.   You don't have to take it from me. Listen to the military advisor and  President Zelenskyy's chief of staff Oleksiy Arestovych: ``If we get 60  of these [rocket artillery] systems,'' that is the HIMARS I am talking  about, ``then the Russians will lose all ability to advance anywhere,  they will be stopped [dead] in their tracks. If we get 40, they will  advance, albeit very slowly with heavy casualties; with 20, they will  continue to advance with higher casualties than now.''   So he is talking about the need for 60 or at least 40; 20 won't be  enough. Unfortunately, we are talking about four. To their credit, the  British announced last Tuesday that they will send something similar to  these multiple launch rocket systems to Ukraine. It is a larger  version, actually, of the HIMARS rocket artillery system that they are  sending. I appreciate that. However, the BBC reports that they are now  only sending three, at least initially.   The world looks to America for leadership, and if America leads with  only four rocket artillery systems, the rest of the world is going to  follow with similarly modest support. I hope this will change. I hope  we will see that these numbers improve. I would like to be proven wrong  that those artillery systems are already on their way. I hope they are,  but the best information we have is that is not true.    It has been months now, and the Ukrainians cannot afford to have  imprecise and low-level assistance from the world's most powerful  military. This Congress sent $40 billion in aid to the Ukrainians, $21  billion of that was military assistance. I think we should expect and  demand that the administration utilize that funding as much as possible  and provide Ukraine with the precise and powerful military equipment it  actually needs to be able to fight this war, to stop the bloodshed, by  pushing the Russians back, $21 billion is a lot of money, let's be sure  it is spent properly.   Another Ukrainian official, Vadym Skibitsky, Ukraine's Deputy head of  Military Intelligence, told a British outlet: ``Everything now depends  on what [the West] gives us. Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to  15 Russian artillery pieces.''   Ukrainians need our help. And Congress has done its job in an  overwhelming, bipartisan fashion. We should not be tentative now--not  now. Russia's brutal unrelenting rocket and missile attacks throughout  Ukraine, including attacks on schools and churches, hospitals and  apartment buildings, have killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian  civilians and soldiers, while entire cities have been laid to rubble by  the Russian barrages. While the media coverage has waned significantly  here in the United States, the people of Ukraine are still feeling the  effect and the terrible impacts of this bloody and illegal invasion of  their homeland in so many ways. One is the blockade of Ukraine's Black  Sea ports.  [[Page S2917]]    Since the war began, Russia has put this blockade in place preventing  the export of millions of tons of grain and other agricultural products  desperately needed, by the way, in Africa, in the Middle East, and  other developing countries.   Just this past Saturday, Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotsky  reported that 300,000 tons of grain were destroyed when Russia shelled  a warehouse near one of these ports.   So Russia is actually shelling grain bins to destroy the grain. Let  me be clear: Food should never be a target and should never be used as  leverage in negotiations. Malign actors around the world have used food  as a weapon--the Houthis in Yemen, Assad in Syria, and now Russia in  Ukraine.   Russia has the rest of the world hostage with its barbaric food  blockade. President Putin recently suggested that he would lift his  stranglehold on Ukraine's Black Sea ports, including Odesa, but he said  he would only do so if all the sanctions were lifted on Russia. In  other words, Russia would like to be rewarded for releasing the hostage  it has taken.   Russia must release its blockade immediately, without any conditions.  Millions of lives depend on it. I would expect the administration and  allies--including Turkey--to come up with contingency plans now, if  they don't have them already. This impacts nations in Africa, the  Middle East, East Asia, and particularly, again, these poor countries  in Africa depend on the Ukrainian grains, otherwise there will be  massive food shortages.   In Turkey, President Erdogan continues to negotiate an exit corridor  for Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea. I thank him for doing that.  He should continue to do so. And even in China--no friend of the United  States and a very good friend of Russia right now--President Xi Jinping  has warned of a bad winter wheat harvest. I hope he can persuade  Vladimir Putin that needlessly causing a global hunger catastrophe will  not do him any favors.   The dire warnings of global food insecurity and price hikes if this  blockade continues should concern everyone in this Congress, everyone  in America, and everyone in this administration, certainly.   The world is looking to our leadership to help solve this problem.  What we need is a creation of a humanitarian corridor that can go out,  at least through the port at Odesa through which Ukrainian agricultural  products can reach the world market.   Until then, other avenues have to be explored. When I was in Romania  2 weeks ago, the prime minister there told me that they intend to boost  their road and rail and canal infrastructure to the port in Romania to  help export as much Ukrainian grain as possible. This would help, and I  appreciate--really appreciate--the Romanian effort, but it can't match  the capacity of Odesa or these other ports in Ukraine.   At a security conference in Singapore on Sunday, Ukraine's deputy  foreign minister announced that Ukraine will, indeed, try to export its  grains through Romania as well as through Poland, as well as any place  they can get it out.   They are looking for a third route as an example through the Baltic  States, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. That is a desperate attempt by  Ukraine to try to get this grain out, but, again, it can never match  the huge volumes that can go by ship from its own ports.   As the head of the Ukraine Grain Association said last week:         I can tell you we won't find a solution [for] exports       [without Black Sea port access].    Unfortunately, I think he is right. It is clear that Russia is trying  to starve the world into pressuring Ukraine to surrender. Meanwhile,  Russia's crimes within Ukraine continue. A few days ago, Ukrainian  prosecutors announced that eight more war crimes have been filed  against Russian soldiers. These cases are part of a more than 16,000  investigation that Ukraine has opened into possible war crimes  committed during the war, according to Ukraine's prosecutor general-- 16,000 investigations right now into war crimes.   In the past war crimes trials, two captured Russian soldiers were  each sentenced to 11\1/2\ years in prison in late May after pleading  guilty to shelling a town in Eastern Ukraine. And a Russian soldier was  handed a life sentence for shooting a 62-year-old Ukrainian civilian in  the head.   These heinous acts of violence are going to continue unless Ukraine  has the ability to push back. We do need more of these sentences of war  criminals to try to act as a deterrent to stop the further Russian  barbarity in Ukraine. Maybe some officers, maybe some officials in the  Kremlin looking at these war crime convictions will say, you know what,  maybe we shouldn't be attacking our peaceful neighbors and killing them  and raping them and terrorizing this country.   There is another important issue I want to mention, one that is worth  the world's attention: Ukrainian orphans. Unfortunately, there are  hundreds of Ukrainian orphans who are stuck in Ukraine or elsewhere in  Europe. A lot of these orphans have ties to America and unique ties to  about 200 American families who are ready, willing, and able to host  these children. These families have been in the process of adopting  these children for a long time, from before the invasion. Many of these  children have actually previously visited the United States to meet  with their soon-to-be adopted families.   Unfortunately, many of these children returned right before the  invasion and are unaccounted for now. Many have lost contact with their  soon-to-be families. I have constituents in Ohio, and I know hundreds  of other families across the country ready to welcome these children  into their homes.   In March, along with 26 colleagues, I wrote to the State Department,  I have yet to hear back from that letter, but we asked for two things:  one, to help identify these children, this needs to be done in  collaboration with the Ukrainian government, of course, and U.S.-based  organizations; and, two, my letter urged the administration to issue  travel visas to allow adoption-eligible kids to come live with their  American host families now.   The State Department should use its powers under the law to  immediately process nonimmigrant visas that will allow these kids with  in-process adoptions to travel to the U.S. and stay with their host  families in the United States instead of requiring these children to  remain in other locations for displaced persons in Europe or in  Ukraine.   Many of these children may be given refuge in neighboring countries.  However, I believe in the unique circumstances where children already  have established relationships with these families in the United  States, they should be able to come here and be with their host  families who can ensure the child's safety and stability.   At the same time, we could continue to work with the Ukrainian  government, which has been open to finalizing the adoptions that were  in process before the war began.   I will close with this: I have now come to the floor every week since  just before President Putin began this illegal and unprovoked invasion  against the people of a democratic Ukraine who just wanted to live in  peace with their neighbors--including Russia.   This is the fight during our generation where democracy is on the  line. I am not surprised, because I have seen the spirit and bravery of  the Ukrainian people firsthand in my many trips to Ukraine, including  meeting with Ukrainian troops on the front line before this latest  invasion. I am not surprised that they have held off Russia so far.  Their strength and resiliency is a marvel.   Again, it is not what Vladimir Putin expected. It is, frankly, not  what our own U.S. military expected. They have fought hard, and they  continue to every day. But they need more help.   Last week, I met with a great fighter in this cause, my friend Andy  Futey from Ohio, who leads the Ukrainian World Congress for the Ukraine  diaspora all over the world. He has been a strong and consistent  advocate for Ukraine and joined me at a rally, actually, at the White  House with hundreds of Ukrainian Americans a couple months ago.   When I met with Andy last week and other members of the Ukrainian  World Congress who had just returned from Ukraine, they spoke with  passion about the destruction they had seen in Ukraine, about the steep  price that the Ukrainian people have paid and continue to pay to be  able to remain free and independent.   With them was a young woman from Ukraine who was very emotional in  her  [[Page S2918]]  appeals, with tears, saying, America needs to do more during this hour  of need. As they made the case passionately that the U.S. needs to  continue sending weapons and artillery and sooner not later, they  talked about the need for these long-range weapons we talked about  tonight, so the Ukrainians have a fighting chance.   Every day the United States fails to sufficiently support Ukraine  only serves as a detriment to the Ukrainians, who need us to lead the  free world in helping them win this war. Brave Ukrainians are dying  every day. We just can't afford to delay.   My colleague Senator Dick Durbin and I cochair what is called the  Senate Ukraine Caucus, which we founded back in 2015. Later this week,  we will bring the caucus together to meet with the leaders in the  Ukrainian parliament, the Rada, who are here visiting Washington to  urge greater support in America for their country. We are eager to hear  what they have to say.   Many of us here in this Chamber get it. We know that America can't  afford to stay on the sidelines and be a spectator in this conflict. At  this crucial time in the battle for freedom, democracy, and the ability  for countries to have their territorial integrity respected, at this  critical hour, America cannot afford to be tentative.   We must remember the lessons of the late 1930s: that appeasing  tyrants will not satiate their desire to violently conquer and  subjugate their neighbors. Some folks in this town may not understand  that, but Ukrainians understand it. They know what it is like to live  under the thumb of authoritarians, and they broke away from that and  toward democracy, first in 1991 and again in 2014.   I was in Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity, in 2014, where  Ukrainians decided for themselves that they wanted to turn away from  Russian domination and turn to us and to Europe and to pursue a hopeful  future of democracy and freedom. Now, President Putin is trying to  extinguish that hope. We must not let him.   One question that many of us have of the administration is: What is  the end goal here? Is our objective to help Ukraine grind down Russia's  military so that for some number of years it is unable to undertake  another violent campaign like this? Is our objective to topple  President Putin's regime? Or is our objective to help the Ukrainians  expel the Russian invaders from their sovereign Ukrainian territory,  including Crimea and the Donbas?   The administration dodges these questions by saying: It is up to the  Ukrainians to decide.   I understand that, but the Ukrainians have already decided. They want  their sovereign territory back--all of it. I have discussed this at  length with Ukrainians, and they have consistently said what I have  heard from their parliamentary leaders in the past and will again this  week: Nothing less than the full restoration of Ukrainian sovereign  territory is their goal.   Saying that we support Russia walking away with any Ukrainian  territory would just embolden Russia in this conflict and embolden  aggressors and authoritarians in the future.   It has now been 110 days of unrelenting Russian attacks on our ally  Ukraine, and it has been 110 days of pushing the administration to help  more. This happened with Russian oil, Russian gas exports. It happened  with trade and banking sanctions and various kinds of military  assistance. Now it is the HIMARS. They need these weapons.   America has made its stand. We are on the side of freedom over  tyranny, democracy and self-determination over authoritarianism and  conquest. The countries of the free world are with us, but more so when  we lead. Now is not the time to be tentative or equivocal. At this  critical juncture, let's work with allies to provide our democratic  brothers and sisters in Ukraine what they need to protect the homeland  and defend democracy.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
