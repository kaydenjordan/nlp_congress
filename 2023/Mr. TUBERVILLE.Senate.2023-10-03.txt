 Mr. President, although she is just 25 years  old, Specialist Rachel Roney-Rivera's life has been all about breaking  barriers. A native of Beauregard, Rachel enlisted in the U.S. Army on  her 18th birthday, using her interests to become a paralegal for the  National Guard.   After finishing her military service as an E-4 specialist, Rachel  decided to use her experience to pursue a career in law enforcement.  She graduated top of her class at the police academy before  [[Page S4915]]  joining the Chambers County Sheriff's Office. Rachel has proven to be a  vital part of the force, including becoming the first woman to be  selected for the SWAT team. She now serves as a sex crimes  investigator, helping families during some of the most difficult times  in their lives. Chambers County Sheriff Jeff Nelson says that Rachel,  ``puts 110% into every case to bring resolution and justice.''   Rachel's presence in the community extends far past her investigative  work. She also serves as a self-defense instructor, where she helps  empower women in East Alabama with confidence and defense training  techniques. But that is not all--Rachel is also preparing to graduate  with her bachelor's degree in psychology from Columbia Southern next  spring. She is studying for the LSAT, hoping to become an attorney one  day. In addition to being a full-time deputy and student, Rachel is  also a proud full-time mom to a 4-year-old daughter.   Her story inspires Alabamians young and old about what can be  accomplished with hard work and determination. I am honored to  recognize Rachel as the October Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
