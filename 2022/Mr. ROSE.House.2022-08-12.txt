 Madam Speaker, Tennesseans are hurting from the  skyrocketing cost of living everywhere they turn. Now, it seems as if  the United States has entered into a spending-induced recession caused  by the irresponsible fiscal policies of President Biden and  congressional Democrats.   Instead of focusing on passing meaningful and impactful legislation  to help lower the cost of living, we are voting on a bill that spends  hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars.   The bill will do nothing to help ease the pain my neighbors in  Tennessee are experiencing and, in fact, is likely to increase  inflation even more and push prices on everything even higher.   It gives a tax break to wealthy Americans who can already afford to  purchase expensive electric cars. It also increases taxes amidst a  recession, which will only make it worse, and it allows the IRS to hire  an army of 87,000 new Federal agents to go after the middle class.   Madam Speaker, I will be voting ``no,'' and I urge my colleagues to  do so as well.                                time  1400
