 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2528, the STEM  Opportunities Act of 2019. As a cosponsor of the legislation with  Chairwoman Johnson, I am pleased the House is taking this up for  consideration today.   H.R. 2528 continues the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's  long history of bipartisan support for STEM education.   The United States is in a race to remain the world's leader in  science and technology. The only way we will win is by utilizing  America's most valuable resources--our people. This means developing a  diverse, STEM-capable workforce at every education level and from every  background.   The administration has recognized this need, and the President's 5- year STEM strategic plan specifically calls for an increase of  diversity, equality, and inclusion in STEM programs.  [[Page H8010]]    This legislation supports and builds upon that plan, authorizing  activities at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy  and the National Science Foundation.   The U.S. invests over $1 billion a year in Federal STEM education  programs, but we have not made enough progress in growing a STEM- capable workforce. One of the key provisions of H.R. 2528 is a  requirement for more comprehensive data collection and analysis on the  students, researchers, and faculty receiving Federal science grants.   This data will help us identify and reduce the barriers that prevent  underrepresented groups from entering and advancing in STEM. It will  also help us measure the success of Federal STEM programs.   The bill also includes a provision directing NSF to support computer  science education through the existing Tribal Colleges and Universities  Program.   Access to computer science resources and the development of computing  skills is critical in today's economy. STEM employment in the U.S.  continues to grow faster than any other sector. Employers in all  sectors, including agriculture, energy, healthcare, and defense, are  desperate for workers with STEM skills. In order to meet this demand,  the development of talent from all groups is essential.    H.R. 2528 takes important steps to ensure we are fully engaging  America's entire talent pool and maintaining our global leadership in  science and technology.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the ranking member, and the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Johnson), the chairwoman, for introducing  this great bill.   Today, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2528, the Science,  Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Opportunities Act, introduced  by those two great colleagues.   STEM fields provide a great opportunity for academic and professional  advancement. According to the Department of Commerce, STEM occupations  are projected to grow by close to 9 percent, compared to approximately  6 percent for non-STEM occupations.                                time  1315    On average, students with a STEM degree are expected to have greater  job prospects and to earn close to 12 percent more in wages than their  non-STEM counterparts.   We should expect this growing trend to continue, and, therefore, we  need to ensure we bolster STEM capabilities in education and in the  workforce to meet the demand for STEM professionals and remain at the  forefront of scientific endeavors.   H.R. 2528 helps guarantee that the STEM community is diverse and  representative of women, minorities, rural students, students with  disabilities, and other underrepresented groups.   Specifically, this bill directs the Office of Science and Technology  Policy to develop best practices on how to support STEM researchers who  are also caregivers, how to best reduce the impact of bias in the  review of grant proposals, and how to better identify cultural and  institutional barriers at science agencies and Federal labs.   It also requires Federal science agencies to collect demographic  information on grant proposals, awards, and faculty, and it directs the  National Science Foundation to support the research and dissemination  of best practices to increase recruitment, retention, and advancement  of underrepresented groups in STEM degree programs and research  careers.   Puerto Rico has a strong STEM academic and professional sector as  well. We even created a caucus with universities--the Arecibo  Observatory, among others--to help bolster this area. I, myself,  graduated from a STEM school. We have remarkable STEM students and  researchers who are engaged with their communities and are ready to  contribute to their fields by producing innovative work for the benefit  of the island and for the Nation.   The objectives of this bill are key to increasing the scope of the  scientific population and meeting the current demands and challenges in  STEM.   I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, and I would like to thank  Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for their leadership, not  just in this area, but on many other important issues, and I encourage  my colleagues to vote in favor.   I would also like to thank them for their leadership on the Committee  on Science, Space, and Technology and for helping me and helping us  harness the capabilities of the Federal Government for the advancement  of science and technology on behalf of the American people.   Unfortunately, I will be parting with the committee. However, I look  forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on  science and many other issues in the future.   I commend them both and their staffs for all their assistance during  these months, and I wish them all the best as they continue their great  work. I really enjoyed my stay with that committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First, let me take a moment to note that the gentlewoman from Puerto  Rico will indeed be missed on the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee.   The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology--and I think I can  say this about the beloved chair--is a committee that still reflects  many of the traditions of this House: working together for the common  good, trying to drive this great Nation and all of our good citizens  forward.   So, hopefully, at some future time, the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico  will have the opportunity to come rejoin us, and I look forward to that  very day.   That said, in my closing remarks, I would like to thank Chairwoman  Johnson and her staff for working in a bipartisan fashion on this  legislation and for incorporating our feedback and ideas. I look  forward to continuing to work with her to advance STEM education  efforts in this Congress that will support, encourage, and develop the  next generation of STEM workers.   Maintaining our global leadership in science and technology is  critical to our economic and national security. We will not be able to  lead without a STEM-capable workforce for the 21st century.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 2528, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative Mast's bill, H.R.  335, the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2019.   This bill tasks the interagency task force on harmful algal blooms  and hypoxia to provide an integrated assessment on the causes and  consequences of HABs, along with potential mitigation options in south  Florida.   Additionally, the task force will look at the current status of  research and identify gaps in research, monitoring, and management  efforts. This will lead to the development of an action plan for  reducing, mitigating, and controlling HABs and hypoxia.   Although this bill is focused on the south Florida region, these  harmful algal blooms have become an environmental problem in all 50  States, even in the freshwater of landlocked States like Oklahoma.   With the passage of this legislation, we will gain more knowledge of  the dangers associated with HABs as well as potential mitigation  strategies that could be applied to every State and region.   I want to thank Representative Mast and Representative Waltz for  encouraging this interagency collaboration to conduct research that  will protect our environment and health.  [[Page H8012]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast), who has worked so diligently on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Waltz), a member of the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee who also is very focused on these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 335 provides critical research on the harmful algal  blooms and hypoxia in southern Florida and will develop an action plan  to mitigate and control this environmental threat.   I thank Representative Mast, and my Science, Space, and Technology  Committee colleague, Representative Waltz, for their leadership on this  bill. I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H8013]]
