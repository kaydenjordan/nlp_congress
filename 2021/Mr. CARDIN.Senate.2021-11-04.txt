 I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take a  tremendous toll on our Nation. Healthcare workers have valiantly served  our communities throughout the crisis. Still, we face unprecedented  challenges, and this moment calls for historic action.   The pandemic laid bare the gaps in our healthcare system and  magnified longstanding inequities. Health inequities have been eating  away at our communities for many years, which is why I have fought for  policies to reduce economic and social inequalities overall--in short,  access to nutrition, education, and housing, and increased funding for  social and mental health services.   Earlier this year, Congress enacted some of those reforms in the  American Rescue Plan Act, which is bringing much-needed help to  Marylanders and Americans across the country. It was a strong  investment to complement ongoing efforts to curtail the rapid spread of  the virus, particularly as we grapple with more contagious variants,  such as the Delta variant. Now, we have the opportunity to enhance that  effort through the Build Back Better Act.   Even with the significant investments in healthcare over the last  year and a half, Americans are struggling to pay for their basic  healthcare needs, like prescription medications and mental healthcare.  Waiting lists for home- and community-based services so individuals can  age in place with dignity are in the thousands or tens of thousands in  States around the country. In my State of Maryland, over 30,000 seniors  and individuals are waiting to get access to home- and community-based  services.   Now, we have the opportunity to make prescription drugs more  affordable, expand access to home- and community-based services, extend  enhanced financial support to individuals in the individual market, and  permanently fund the Children's Health Insurance Program--CHIP.   We have been working on these problems for years and, in some cases,  for over a decade. Congress is long overdue in acting to remedy them.   As we make these historic investments, we must also redouble our  efforts to address the longstanding gaps in healthcare access. For  instance, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make major  reforms to the Medicare benefit.   Earlier this year, I reintroduced the Medicare Dental Benefit Act,  which would add dental benefits to Medicare. It would help more than 56  million seniors and people with disabilities afford much-needed dental  care.   According to the Wisdom Tooth Project of Oral Health America, nearly  70 percent of seniors lack or have limited access to dental insurance,  and fewer than half have access to dental care each year. Those numbers  are inexcusable. We should be working to strengthen and expand access  to quality, affordable dental care for all Americans, regardless of age  or income.   That is why, today, I am introducing, along with Senator Stabenow,  the Medicaid Dental Benefit Act, which would extend comprehensive  dental health benefits to tens of millions of low-income Americans.   Currently, States have flexibility to determine whether to provide  dental benefits to adult Medicaid enrollees. Although most States,  including my State, provide at least emergency dental services for  adults, fewer than half of the States provide comprehensive dental  care.   The consequences of such haphazard access could not be clearer:  higher costs and worse outcomes.   A recent report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  found that Black, Hispanic, and low-income adults visited the emergency  room for dental care at the highest rates of any group in 2018.   Many of you have heard me speak before of the tragic loss of Deamonte  Driver, a 12-year-old Prince George's County resident, in 2007.  Deamonte's death was particularly heartbreaking because it was entirely  preventable. What started out as a toothache turned into a severe brain  infection that could have been prevented by an $80 extraction. After  multiple surgeries and a lengthy hospital stay, Deamonte passed away  nearly 15 years ago, just a few miles from this building.   It is imperative that we use this once-in-a-generation opportunity to  increase access to dental care, which will improve the overall health  of millions. To echo former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop,  ``there is no health without oral health.''   Adequate access to oral health is essential to preventing tragedies  like the death of Deamonte Driver from ever happening again. Let us  continue to build upon the progress made today in advancing access to  oral health to protect individuals around the country.   As we work to pass this legislation, let us not lose sight of what is  at stake. Just in the last few days, we have seen some of the best that  American healthcare can provide, but also some of the worst.  [[Page S7794]]    Vaccines are making a critical difference in the fight against COVID- 19, and just this Wednesday, they will be available to all ages 5 and  older. It is a momentous achievement and a great relief to families and  communities around the Nation.   At the same time, women in Texas are being denied access to  reproductive healthcare while, on Monday, the Supreme Court heard oral  arguments on two cases challenging the Texas anti-abortion law S.B. 8.  Roe v. Wade has been the established legal precedent in this country  for more than half a century, but anti-choice activists continue to  push policies like S.B. 8 that are sending this country and women's  health and well-being in the wrong direction. Women and their  healthcare should not be under constant threat. If we fail the women of  America, we fail our Nation.   Right now, we have a choice on how we as a nation want to emerge from  the pandemic. We can continue on the same course, leaving millions of  families behind, or we can answer the call of the American people and  invest in high-quality, equitable healthcare.   Let us answer the call.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Padilla, Ms.          Warren, Mr. Van Hollen, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Brown, Mr. Sanders,          Ms. Hirono, and Mr. Leahy):   S. 3177. A bill to restore protections for Social Security, Railroad  retirement, and Black Lung benefits from administrative offset; to the  Committee on Finance.
