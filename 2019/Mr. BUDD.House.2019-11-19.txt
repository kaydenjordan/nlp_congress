 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to showcase why legal immigration  makes our country great.   Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to give a keynote address  at a naturalization ceremony for new U.S. citizens. I awarded 68 new  Americans with their citizenship certificates and spoke with their  families and their loved ones. Being a part of that ceremony reinforced  my patriotism and my belief in our country.   We want the best and the brightest from around the world to come to  our  [[Page H8967]]  shores, and we want them to do it the right way. That is part of the  American story.   So let no one claim that being tough on illegal immigration has to  mean that you in any way oppose immigrants. It is actually quite the  opposite. We want people to come to the United States the American way,  the legal way, so they can pursue their American Dream.                            ____________________
