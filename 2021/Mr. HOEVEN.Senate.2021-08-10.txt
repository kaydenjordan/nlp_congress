 I call up my amendment No. 3243 and ask that it be  reported by number.    This amendment ensures we continue to support policies  that make our country an economic powerhouse, as well as keeping  heating and cooling costs low for Americans, and that means protecting  access to reliable, affordable energy.   The North American Electric Reliability Corporation recently warned  that numerous areas of the country are at an elevated or high risk of  experiencing blackouts or brownouts. This warning is not limited only  to California and Texas; it also included most of the West, New  England, and the upper Midwest.   My amendment promotes more baseload power, specifically from coal- fired and natural gas power plants with carbon capture, as well as  nuclear power.   Instead of new taxes or the Green New Deal, we should be expanding  access to power generation from resources available 24/7, regardless of  weather conditions.   We are the world's leading economy with vast energy resources, and  blackouts and brownouts are simply not acceptable.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment to keep the lights  on, energy costs low, and harness our abundant baseload resources with  improved environmental stewardship.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Mr. President, I would note that I referenced carbon  capture, as well as other environmental practices that we are taking,  to lead the world in producing not only abundant, affordable baseload  energy, but also with the latest, greatest technology in an  environmentally friendly way. I would note the good Senator has joined  with me on legislation to do that.    I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3243     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
