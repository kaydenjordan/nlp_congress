 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Julia Hamblen of  Shelbyville, Indiana, on her new role as Indiana FFA President.   A 2020 graduate of Shelbyville High School, Julia will be taking a  gap year so she can serve as President of the Indiana FFA before  attending Purdue University to study ag education.   Congratulations, Julia. You are a true role model to so many students  and you are making the Sixth District proud.                 Congratulations to Precise Tooling Solutions     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Precise Tooling  Solutions for winning the 2020 MoldMaking Technology Leadtime Leader  Award.   Based in my hometown of Columbus, Indiana, Precise Tooling strives to  create a ``Team First'' working environment that leads with customers  and quality.   I congratulate my friend, Don Dumoulin, and the Precise Tooling team  on this tremendous accomplishment.           Supporting Rural Communities' Need for Broadband Service     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support  rural communities during this difficult time.   Last week at the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee markup  of Nancy Pelosi's infrastructure bill, I offered two commonsense  amendments to enhance broadband in rural districts.   I was disappointed that the Democrats rejected these attempts to  bring the benefits of broadband service to the remote areas of our  country, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.   It is critical that every family in America have access to broadband  internet connection, no matter their ZIP Code.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the inclusion of rural  America in future legislation, because it is our duty to keep America  connected for generations to come.                      Supporting Hoosier Law Enforcement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to show my support for law  enforcement in the Hoosier State and all across America.   Hoosier law enforcement officers keep our families and loved ones  safe, and they deserve our support.   I 100 percent oppose defunding the police and limiting qualified  immunity. It is absolutely the wrong thing to do.   I support the President's executive order on Safe Policing for Safe  Communities, and I believe the right steps are being made to protect  our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the men and women who wear a badge to  protect and keep our country safe.                        Showing Up To Washington, D.C.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to show up here in Congress to work for the American  people.   Nurses, doctors, first responders, food supply workers, and so many  others are showing up to work every day. Why is the House of  Representatives not doing the same?   I am here working on behalf of the people of Indiana's Sixth  District, and I will always do so by showing up in Washington, D.C.   It is time for the House to show up right here in this Chamber.
