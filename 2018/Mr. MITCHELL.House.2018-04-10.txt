 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4921) to require the Surface Board of Transportation to  implement certain recommendations of the Inspector General of the  Department of Transportation, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4921         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``STB Information Security       Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS.         (a) In General.--The Surface Transportation Board (in this       section referred to as the ``STB'') shall develop a timeline       and plan to implement the recommendations of the Inspector       General of the Department of Transportation in Report No.       FI2018002, including improvements--        (1) to identify controls, including risk management,       weakness remediation, and security authorization;        (2) to protect controls, including configuration       management, user identity and access management, and security       training;        (3) to detect controls, including continuous monitoring;        (4) to respond controls, including incident handling and       reporting;        (5) to recover controls for contingency planning; and        (6) any additional tools that will improve the       implementation of the recommendations.        (b) Implementation.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the STB shall submit the plan and       timeline developed under subsection (a) to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce of the Senate.        (2) Report.--The STB shall report annually to such       Committees on the progress on implementation of the       recommendations until the implementation is complete.        (3) Plan implementation.--The STB shall designate an       individual to implement the plan developed under subsection       (a).       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4921, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the STB Information Security Improvement Act requires  the Surface Transportation Board to develop a timeline and plan to  implement the recommendations and improvements outlined in its  information security system.   After a concerning report from the Department of Transportation  inspector general that outlined deficiencies in the STB's information  security system, it is imperative that changes be made and there are  improvements in that system rapidly.   When the STB separated from DOT, Department of Transportation, in  December 2015, the agency gained full responsibility and control of its  IT system, and it currently lacks any meaningful or strong  cybersecurity system.   The improvements needed include basic building blocks, such as  changes to policies and procedures. The STB is encumbered by a number  of weaknesses, and its information security program has been determined  by the OIG to be at a low level of maturity according to OMB standards.   A summary of the bill is it requires the STB, the Surface  Transportation Board, to create a timeline and plan to implement  recommendations made by the DOT Office of Inspector General in their  report. Additionally, it requires the Surface Transportation Board to  annually update Congress on its progress until it has effectively been  completed and updated.   This bill ensures that the Surface Transportation Board addresses  these deficiencies so the agency can reduce the risk of an attack or  compromise to this critical information system.   I believe this bill will improve the Surface Transportation Board's  information security and is a good piece of legislation and oversight.   I again thank Chairman Shuster, Chairman Denham, and Mr. Gottheimer  for working with me on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the bipartisan nature of the  bill. My colleague supported the bill, and Mr. Gottheimer is a  cosponsor.   I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4925) to require the Administrator of the Federal Railroad  Administration to implement certain recommendations for management and  collection of railroad safety data.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4925         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FRA Safety Data Improvement       Act''.  [[Page H3069]]            SEC. 2. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND COLLECTION OF                     RAILROAD SAFETY DATA.         (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Federal Railroad       Administration shall develop a plan, and a timeline to carry       out such plan, to implement the recommendations from the       Inspector General Report No. ST2017045 of the Department of       Transportation, issued on May 3, 2017, to the greatest extent       possible, to improve the Federal Railroad Administration's       management and collection of railroad safety data.        (b) Implementation.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit the       plan and timeline developed under subsection (a) to the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science,       and Transportation of the Senate.        (2) Report.--The Administrator shall report annually to the       committees on the implementation of such plan until       implementation is complete.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4925.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the FRA Safety Data Improvement Act requires the Federal  Railroad Administration to develop a timeline and plan to implement  improvements to its safety data collection and reporting system.   Rail safety is critical to our Nation, and in order to ensure that  regulations are rooted in accurate data, the FRA must make improvements  to its data collection system.   Safety data is important to railroad safety, and failures of that  concern us. Effective safety data collection and reporting is critical  to ensuring railroad safety.   The Department of Transportation inspector general published a report  outlining issues with the data collection and reporting for safety  data. The report made a number of recommendations to standardizing  certain procedures and implementing effective and uniform training  programs. Additionally, the report recommends the FRA update its  reporting guidance to clear up discrepancies in their reporting forms.   In summary, the bill requires the FRA, the Federal Railroad  Administration, to implement the recommendations from the DOT Office of  Inspector General report. Additionally, it requires the FRA to develop  a timeline and plan to implement the guidelines and recommendations.  The bill ensures the FRA addresses these discrepancies by a report  requiring FRA to annually update Congress on its progress until  completion.   I believe this bill will improve the safety of our railways. Rail  safety is obviously critical to our Nation and our infrastructure; and  to ensure that safety regulations are effective and clear, they must be  updated.   I again thank Chairman Shuster, Chairman Denham, and Mr. Gottheimer  for working with me, as well as my colleague, Mr. Capuano.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this bill and the previous one we  discussed reflect the bipartisan commitment to our Nation's  infrastructure and to a safe infrastructure. I appreciate my  colleagues' support in working jointly in bringing these bills forward.  I urge my colleagues to join all of us in supporting this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
