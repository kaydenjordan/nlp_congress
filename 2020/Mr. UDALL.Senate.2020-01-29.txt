 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from New Mexico.    Thank you for the recognition, Mr. Chief Justice. I send a  question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Udall's question is for the House  managers:         Please address the President's counsel's argument that       House managers seek to overturn the results of the 2016       election and that the decision to remove the President should       be left to the voters in November.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you for the question.   First, I just want to respond to something counsel just said--that 9  months is pretty fast for litigation in the courts. Sadly, I agree with  that. Nine months is pretty fast in the McGahn case, and we still don't  have a decision yet. What is more, that is the very case in which they  are arguing, as I quoted earlier, that Congress has no right to come to  the courts to force a witness to testify. So here we are 9 months later  in that litigation that they said we are compelled under the  Constitution to bring, and they are saying in court: You can't bring  this. And it is 9 months, and we still don't have a decision. I think  that tells you just where they are coming from. It all goes back to the  President's directive to fight all subpoenas, and they are.   Nixon was going to be impeached for far less obstruction than  anything that Donald Trump did.   The argument: Well, if you impeach a President, you are overturning  the results of the last election and you are tearing up the ballots in  the next election. If that were the case, there would be no impeachment  clause in the Constitution because, by definition, if you are  impeaching a President, that President is in office and has won an  election.   Clearly, that is not what the Founders had in mind. What they had in  mind is, if the President commits high crimes and misdemeanors, you  must remove him from office. It is not voiding the last election; it is  protecting the next election. Indeed, the impeachment power was put in  the Constitution not as a punishment--that is what the criminal laws  are for--but to protect the country.   Now, if you say you can't impeach a President before the next  election, what you are really saying is you can only impeach a  President in their second term. If that were going to be the  constitutional requirement, the Founders would have put in the  Constitution: A President may commit whatever high crimes and  misdemeanors he wants as long as it is in the first term. That is  clearly not what any rational Framer would have written, and, indeed,  they didn't, and they didn't for a reason. The Founders were concerned  that, in fact, the object of a President's corrupt scheme might be to  cheat in the very form of accountability that they have prescribed: the  election.   So counsel has continued to mischaracterize what the managers have  said. We are not saying we had to hurry to impeach the President before  the election. We had to hurry because the President was trying to cheat  in that election.   The position of the President's counsel is, well, yes, it is true  that if a President is going to try to cheat an election, by  definition, that is prior to their reelection; by definition, that is  going to be proximate to an election; but, you know, let the voters  decide, even though the object is to corrupt that vote of the people.  That cannot be what the Founders had in mind.   One of the things I said at the very opening of this proceeding is,  yes, we are to look to history; yes, we are to try to define the intent  of the Framers; but we are not to leave our common sense at the door.   The issue isn't whether it is his first term or his second. It isn't  whether the election is a year away or 3 years away. The issue is, did  he commit a high crime and misdemeanor? Is it a high crime and  misdemeanor for a President of the United States to withhold hundreds  of millions of dollars in aid to an ally at war to get help, to elicit  foreign interference in our election? If you believe that it is, it  doesn't matter what term it is, it doesn't matter how far away the  election is because that President represents a threat to the integrity  of our elections and, more than that, a threat to our national  security.   As we have shown, by withholding that aid--and I know the argument  is, no harm, no foul--we withheld aid from an ally at war. We sent a  message to the Russians, when they learned of this hold, that we did  not have Ukraine's back. We sent a message to the Russians, as Zelensky  was going into negotiations with Putin to try to end that war, that  Zelensky was operating from a position of weakness because there was a  division between the President of the United States and Ukraine. That  is immediate damage. That is damage done every day. That damage  continues to this day.   The damage the President does in pushing out the Russian conspiracy  theories were identified during the House proceedings--and you have  heard it in the Senate--as Russian intelligence propaganda. The danger  the President poses by taking Vladimir Putin's side over his own  intelligence agencies--that is a danger today. That is a danger that  continues every day he pushes out this Russian propaganda.   If the Framers meant impeachment only to apply in the second term,  they would have said so. But that would have made the Constitution a  suicide pact. That is not what it says, and that is not how you should  interpret it.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.    Thank you for the recognition, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr.  Chief Justice, I have sent a question to the desk. I am joined in this  question by Senators Blumenthal, Leahy, and Whitehouse.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senator Udall, joined  by Senators Blumenthal, Leahy, and Whitehouse, to the House managers:         The President's counsel has argued that Hunter Biden's       involvement with Burisma created a conflict of interest for       his father Joe Biden. President Trump, the Trump       organization, and his family, including those who serve in       the White House, maintain significant business interests in       foreign countries and benefit from foreign payments and       investments. By the standard the President's counsel has       applied to Hunter Biden, should Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump's       conflicts of interest with foreign governments also come       under investigation?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S673, January 29, 2020, second column, the following  appears: The President's Counsel has argued that Hunter Biden's  involvement with Burisma created a conflict of interest for his  father . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read:The President's  counsel has argued that Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma  created a conflict of interest for his father . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, and to the Senators, thank  you so much for that question. Let me just preface what I am about to  say with this statement: This has been a tough few days. It has been a  trying time for each of us and for our Nation.   But I just want to say this in response to the question that has been  posed. I stand before you as the mother of three sons. I am sure that  many of you in this Chamber have children--sons and daughters--and  grandchildren that you think the world of. My children's last name is  Demings. So, when they go out to get a job, I wonder if there are  people who associate my sons with their mother and their father.   I just believe, as we go through this very tough, very difficult  debate about whether to impeach and remove the President of the United  States, that we stay focused. The last few days we have seen many  distractions. Many things have been said to take our minds off of the  truth, off of why we are really here.   In my former line of work, I used to call it working with smoke and  mirrors, anything that will take your attention off of what is  painfully obvious, what is there in plain view.   The reason why we are here has nothing to do with anybody's children,  as we have talked about. The reason why we are here is because the  President of the United States, the 45th President, used the power of  his office to try to shake down--I will use that term because I am  familiar with it--a foreign power to interfere into this year's  election. In other words, the President of the United States tried to  cheat and then tried to get this foreign power, this newly elected  President, to spread a false narrative that we know is untrue about  interference in our election.   That is why we are here. And it really would help, I believe, the  situation if the Attorney General, perhaps--the Department of Justice  has been pretty silent--would issue a ruling or an opinion about any  person of authority, especially the President of the United States,  using or abusing that authority to invite other powers into interfering  in our election.   So, Mr. Chief Justice, I will just close my remarks as I began them.  Let us stay focused. This doesn't have anything to do with the  President's children or the Bidens' children. This is about the  President's wrongdoing.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from Idaho.
