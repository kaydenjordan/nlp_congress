 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 844 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 844         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 2546) to designate certain lands in the State       of Colorado as components of the National Wilderness       Preservation System, and for other purposes. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the bill and amendments specified       in this section and shall not exceed one hour equally divided       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on Natural Resources. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Natural Resources now printed       in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-50 shall       be considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of       the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as the       original bill for the purpose of further amendment under the       five-minute rule and shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall       be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such       further amendment may be offered only in the order printed in       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 79) removing the deadline for the ratification of the       equal rights amendment. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the joint       resolution shall be considered as adopted. The joint       resolution, as amended, shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the joint resolution,       as amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the joint resolution, as amended,       and on any further amendment thereto, to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2)       one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 3.  House Resolution 842 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 4.  On any legislative day during the period from       February 14, 2020, through February 24, 2020--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 5.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 4 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 844, providing for consideration of  two measures, H.R. 2546, Protecting America's Wilderness Act, and H.J.  Res. 79, Removing Deadline for Ratification of Equal Rights Amendment.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2546 under a structured  rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking member of the Committee on Natural Resources. It makes in  order 12 amendments and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 79 under a closed  rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary and provides one  motion to recommit.   The rule deems as passed H. Res. 842, a resolution to clarify that a  simple majority is needed for passage of H.J. Res. 79.   Finally, the rule provides for standard district work period  instructions from February 14 through February 24.   Madam Speaker, it has been almost 100 years since the equal rights  amendment was first introduced in Congress. It has been 45 years since  it was passed by Congress. In this year, as we celebrate the 100th  anniversary of women winning the right to vote in this country, it  defies logic that we are still in a holding pattern when it comes to  recognizing the equal rights of women under the United States  Constitution.   Therefore, I am proud to oversee the rule for H.J. Res. 79, which  will remove the questionable deadline for the ratification of the equal  rights amendment.   When Alice Paul, Crystal Eastman, and other suffragists and women's  rights pioneers set out to pass the equal rights amendment, they knew  they had a long and fierce battle ahead of them. The first version of  the ERA was introduced in 1923, and it took almost 50 years for both  the House and the Senate to approve it. When the amendment was finally  approved in 1972, the preamble to the amendment contained a 7-year  deadline for ratification.   Thirty-five of the 38 required States ratified the ERA in their State  legislatures during that initial 7-year timeline. The ERA had broad  bipartisan support from Members of Congress and Presidents Nixon,  Carter, and Ford but was unable to cross the finish line in the brief  time allowed.   Why the ERA did not become a constitutional amendment in the  seventies is up for debate, but it was in large part due to vicious,  antifeminist rhetoric and actions by conservative activists who sought  to trample on the rights of all women to work for an equal wage, to  control their own reproductive health, and to participate as equal  members of our society, in the name of protecting the traditional  values of a privileged few.   In the years that followed, courts have recognized and protected  various aspects of women's equality under the law through  interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. But as  even Justice Antonin Scalia famously recognized, nothing in our  Constitution, as currently written, forbids discrimination on the basis  of sex.   Therefore, final passage and ratification of the ERA is critical in  guaranteeing equal rights to me, to you, to my daughter, and to all  women and girls across this country. We will not go back.  [[Page H1025]]    The equal rights amendment would permanently and explicitly prohibit  discrimination on the basis of sex. Laws change, as do the people  interpreting them, but we are a Nation governed by our Constitution.  The rights given to us through the Constitution are inalienable, and  the protections they provide us with are invaluable.   We hear from the other side of the aisle that discrimination against  women is already illegal. This argument might be more persuasive if it  was not being presented by a party that is, if anything, less diverse  than it was in the 1970s. When a party reflects a predominantly White,  male, and conservative voter base, it is easy to see why that party  might not understand the need for basic additional constitutional  protections.   Women continue to face obstacles to full equality, including unequal  pay, pregnancy discrimination, sexual and domestic violence, and  inadequate healthcare access. One in three women experience sexual  violence in their lifetimes; one in five women are sexually assaulted  on college campuses; and 56 percent of girls in grades 7 through 12 are  sexually harassed in any given school year. Moreover, 60 to 70 percent  of women face sexual harassment during their careers, with Black and  Brown women disproportionately impacted.   Women are paid less than their male counterparts for equal work.  Women are treated differently in job interviews and can be determined a  burden for a company if they are pregnant or planning on becoming  pregnant. These indiscretions are only compounded when we look at women  of color and women with disabilities.   Women in general in this country make 80 cents to a man's dollar.  Women with disabilities make about 65 cents to a man's dollar and 7  cents less than a man with disabilities. Black women make about 63  cents on a White man's dollar; Native women make about 57 cents; and  Hispanic women make approximately 54 cents on a White man's dollar. The  wages for trans women fall by nearly one-third after transitioning.   A woman who works full-time year-round typically loses $430,480 in a  40-year work-life period. That means this woman would have to work  nearly 11 years longer to make up this lifetime wage gap.   This also has a serious financial impact on retirement. The average  Social Security benefit for women 65 and older is about $13,867 per  year, compared to $18,039 for men of the same age.   So, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: If paying  women less than men is already illegal, if treating women differently  in the workplace and other professional settings is already prohibited  by existing law, why does it still happen?   The answer is simple: because it is relatively easy to navigate  around existing laws to protect women. It is easy to treat women  differently in a way that is legal and in line with the law.   That is unacceptable, and that is why we need the equal rights  amendment.   When women earn less for equal work, families earn less for equal  work. If you choose to deliberately shortchange the American family and  deny them financial security, then, clearly, we have different values.   Although the ERA was passed with bipartisan support, and strong  support from Republican women, we saw in the Rules Committee last night  and in debate about this rule and bill that the spirit of the late  Phyllis Schlafly has overtaken today's Republican Party, which now  seeks to cloak deep-seated misogyny in anti-choice rhetoric.   Passing the equal rights amendment is long overdue. I am excited to  be part of a Democratic majority that will remove this arbitrary  deadline for ratification and finally allow States to exercise their  constitutional authority to pass this critical and fundamentally  American amendment.   This rule will also provide for consideration of H.R. 2546, the  Protecting America's Wilderness Act. This is a package of public lands  bills from the Natural Resources Committee that will designate more  than 1.3 million acres as wilderness or potential wilderness areas,  preserving those public lands for generations to come.   Few things in the United States are as universally cherished by  Americans as public lands. Our country is home to more than 111 million  acres of designated wilderness, and these lands help us to combat  climate change, provide for an array of ecological diversity, and offer  recreational activity to Americans, young and old.   As we continue to endure devastating and worsening effects of climate  change, providing for millions of additional acres of wilderness allows  for these areas to continue to serve as critical carbon sinks to  capture and mitigate carbon dioxide in our atmosphere.   Additionally, wilderness areas are some of our most naturally  resilient landscapes. This allows them to endure periodic wildfires and  other disturbances, like floods, with relatively little human impact or  intervention. This helps save the government money, as opposed to a  more active style of forest management.                                time  1230    This legislation not only helps to combat climate change, it also  supports access to clean water, protects pristine wildlife habitats,  and bolsters the outdoor recreation economies of Colorado, California,  Washington, and more.   The Protecting America's Wilderness Act was crafted in direct  coordination with the stakeholders and local voices that it will  impact. I thank Chairman Grijalva, Congresswoman DeGette, and the  members of the Natural Resources Committee for the lengths they went to  in order to make this bill a success and one that will preserve and  protect pristine wildlife habitats, clean water, and access to outdoor  recreational opportunities.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, certainly we see a laundry list of  reasons for opposition to this bill.   We hear that it is unconstitutional. Although, in fact, nothing in  the Constitution speaks to deadlines that Congress may set.   We usually hear our colleagues from across the aisle invoking Justice  Ginsburg to argue that for some reason we should start over with this  century-long process.   Justice Ginsburg has obviously been a champion on these issues, and  to the extent that remarks that she has made are being quoted, I  understand that they were expressing a personal view about the ideal  circumstances in which the ERA could pass, not a legal view about what  is required.   It is probably better to remember that Justice Ginsburg has been a  champion for the ERA since it was approved by both Houses of Congress  in a bipartisan way in the 1970s. And as she reiterated just yesterday,  ``The union will be more perfect when that simple statement--that men  and women are persons of equal citizenship stature--is part of our  fundamental instrument of government.''   Please note, this is a tactic of distracting and dividing. Last night  I asked our colleague if he would be willing to vote for the ERA if, in  fact, we were to start over, which he said he would not. And we  certainly do not see members of the Republican party saying that they  would vote for the ERA if it would be reintroduced.   What we are seeing here is simply an effort to quash the ERA, to end  it, to put it to rest, to not have it be made part of our Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. DelBene).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I include in the Record a January 15 New York Times article,  entitled: ``Why the Equal Rights Amendment is Back.''                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 15, 2020]                   Why the Equal Rights Amendment Is Back             (By Patrick J. Lyons, Maggie Astor and Maya Salam)         Of all the laws the Virginia legislature may pass now that       Democrats have won control of it, none have been so long in       the making as the Equal Rights Amendment. First proposed       almost a century ago and passed by Congress in 1972, the       E.R.A., which would add a provision to the Constitution       guaranteeing equal rights to men and women, could have       sweeping implications if it takes effect.        Both houses of the Virginia Legislature approved the       ratification resolution on Wednesday. Supporters hope that       will lift the amendment over the threshold to become part of       the federal Constitution. But there is considerable dispute       over whether the state's action will have any legal effect or       merely be symbolic.        Here's what it is all about.      What does the amendment say?        The E.R.A. is three sentences long, and the key one is the       first: ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied       or abridged by the United States or by any State on account       of sex.'' The other two are about putting it into effect.        By some estimates, 80 percent of Americans mistakenly       believe that women and men are already explicitly guaranteed       equal rights by the Constitution. But it currently does so       only for the right to vote. The amendment is intended to       remedy that omission.        Supporters say adopting the E.R.A. would, among other       things, sweep away discrimination in the workplace; help       women to achieve pay equality and allow men to get paid       paternity leave; require states to intervene in cases of       domestic violence and sexual harassment; and guard against       discrimination based on pregnancy and motherhood. It may       bolster protections for gay and transgender people as well.        Opponents have argued that the amendment would, among other       things, undermine family structure; intrude on religious       practice; and lead to the outlawing of separate men's and       women's bathrooms, single-sex college dormitories and other       accommodations. Some also argue that the E.R.A. is       unnecessary because the 14th Amendment already guarantees       everyone the ``equal protection of the laws.'' The Supreme       Court has indeed read the 14th Amendment to ban many forms of       sex discrimination. But supporters of the E.R.A. say there       are still gaps in existing laws, both at the federal and       state level, that need to be addressed comprehensively.      How did the amendment stall, and come back to life?        Amendments to the Constitution require the assent of three-      quarters of the states--these days, 38 out of 50--to take       effect. When Congress passed the amendment in 1972, it set a       deadline for reaching that goal--originally 1979, later       extended to 1982. But only 35 states ratified the amendment       in time, in large part because of an opposition campaign led       by Phyllis Schlafly, a proudly anti-feminist Republican.        There the issue lay until 2017, when a Democratic state       senator in Nevada, Pat Spearman, persuaded the Legislature to       ratify the amendment, even though the deadline had long       passed. That move revived interest across the country, and       Illinois followed suit in 2018. An effort in Virginia fell       short a year ago, but after Democrats won in November, they       promised to try again.      Is Virginia's assent enough to get to 38 states?        That's a bit cloudy. Virginia is the 38th state to approve       the Equal Rights Amendment, but over the years, five of those       states--Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, South Dakota and       Tennessee--have voted to rescind their ratifications, and it       is possible that opponents would challenge the amendment on       that basis.        They would not have precedent on their side. After the       Civil War, several states tried to take back their       ratifications of either the 14th or 15th Amendments, but they       were counted in the Yes column anyway, and all of those       states later re-ratified the amendments.      What about the deadline?        That is the big question now. It could be repealed, or       challenged in court, or both.        Most amendments to the Constitution have not had explicit       ratification deadlines. The most recent one, the 27th, had       been pending for more than 200 years before it was finally       ratified in 1992.        Supporters argue that the deadline for the E.R.A. is       unenforceable because it is stated only in the preamble to       the amendment, and not in the amendment itself.        The Supreme Court said in 1921 that amendments had to be       ratified within a reasonable time after passage, and that       Congress had the authority to set a deadline, as it has       almost always done since then. But in 1939, the court ruled       that the question of whether ratification of an amendment was       timely and valid was ``non-justiciable''--in other words, it       was up to Congress, and none of the courts' business.        Congress extended the deadline for the Equal Rights       Amendment once--by three years--and supporters say it could       do so again, or repeal the deadline entirely. A bill to do       that was introduced in the Democratic-controlled House in       April and attracted broad support. It would also have to pass       the Republican-controlled Senate, where its prospects are       less clear, though it has sponsors there from both parties.        Legal experts disagree, however, on whether Congress has       the power to remove the deadline retroactively, and that       issue could land in court.     Madam Speaker, for nearly a century, advocates have  tried to add a provision to the Constitution guaranteeing equal rights  to men and  [[Page H1028]]  women. By some estimates, 80 percent of Americans mistakenly believe  that women and men are already explicitly guaranteed equal rights by  our Constitution, but it currently does so only for the right to vote.  The equal rights amendment will help remedy that omission.   It is necessary that Congress consider this amendment to the  Constitution to help women achieve pay equality, require States to  intervene in cases of domestic violence and sexual harassment, and  guard against discrimination based on pregnancy and motherhood.   Contrary to the arguments we are hearing today, this is not an  abortion amendment; this is equal rights for women.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire if the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko) is prepared to close. We are prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentlewoman  from Arizona is prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, H.J. Res. 79 is a long-overdue, bedrock civil rights  effort, while the Protecting America's Wilderness Act is an effort that  took input from a broad coalition of stakeholders to end up with a bill  to positively impact local communities and further our national  interest in preventing climate change.   As Members of Congress, we have a duty to uphold and protect the  Constitution and the charge of our Founders to continue to form a more  perfect Union. Passing the equal rights amendment is truly  representative of that oath to ensure that all Americans are treated  equally and afforded equal rights under the law.   I would like to recognize some of the women in organizations who have  gotten us to this point: Alice Paul, who graduated from college in my  district; Crystal Eastman; Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott,  who issued the first public call for women's equality at Seneca Falls  in 1848; the National Organization for Women and the League of Women  Voters, which organized and activated so many Americans of both parties  in support of this movement; and so many of the other countless  advocates who have fought tirelessly for women's equality.   This resolution is for all of them and for all the women and girls  seeking to further advance equality and fighting for a more just  America.   This resolution is a bold step forward in the ongoing fight for equal  rights. I recognize that I would not be here without the sacrifices  made by the women who came before me. Their passion and strength paved  the way for me and for so many of my colleagues to get to where we are  today.   But the battle is not yet won. Let's pass this rule, pass this  resolution, and show our children that all Americans deserve equal  rights and protection under the Constitution.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 844         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the resolution       (H. Res. 659) affirming that States should maintain primacy       for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing for oil and       natural gas production on State and private lands and that       the President should not declare a moratorium on the use of       hydraulic fracturing on Federal lands (including the Outer       Continental Shelf), State lands, private lands, or lands held       in trust for an Indian Tribe unless such moratorium is       authorized by an Act of Congress. The first reading of the       resolution shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the resolution are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the resolution and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural       Resources. After general debate the resolution shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the resolution are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the resolution       back to the House with a recommendation that the resolution       be adopted, the previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the resolution and amendments thereto to adoption       without intervening motion. If the Committee of the Whole       rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the       resolution, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the resolution.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 659.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
