 Madam Speaker, where there is an abundance of energy,  there is prosperity. Energy made in America creates jobs, lowers energy  costs for American families and small businesses, and enhances our  national security.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration is working overtime to undo  all the progress made during the previous administration towards energy  independence. They have banned new oil and gas leases on public lands  and cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline--killing thousands of American  jobs and increasing our Nation's dependence on foreign countries.   Now, the liberals in Congress hope to pass their $4.3 trillion tax  and spend spree that includes their radical new tax on natural gas.  Natural gas, by the way, is the primary reason why carbon emissions  today are substantially lower.   This extreme partisan provision will not only decimate American  energy, but it will kill thousands of good-paying jobs, burden families  with higher utility costs, and make the United States more dependent on  our adversaries, whose economies produce dramatically more carbon than  the United States.   While President Biden promised not to raise taxes on middle-class  American families, this assault on fossil fuels breaks his promise in  the form of higher energy costs on families who are already feeling the  impacts of sky-rocketing inflation.   The Colonial Pipeline cybersecurity attack that took place earlier  this year underscores the need to invest in a more robust and secure  energy future. With the pipeline transporting nearly half of the East  Coast's fuel supply, gasoline shortages threatened millions of  Americans. This caused long lines at the pump and, in many cases, such  as in North Carolina, no fuel at the vast majority of gas pumps. This  is the perfect example of why we need more opportunities for reliable  energy--not less.   As I stated at the outset: where there is an abundance of energy,  there is prosperity. And instead of attacking American energy  producers, this administration and Congress should be working to ensure  our energy supply is more resilient--not more vulnerable.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker,  where there . . . should be working to ensure our energy supply is  more resilient--not more vulnerable. ---------------------------- ----ENROLLED BILL SIGNED Cheryl L.
