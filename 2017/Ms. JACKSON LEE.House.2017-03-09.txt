 Mr. Speaker, as we speak, 24 Members, Democrats,  have been sitting with our Republican friends in Energy and Commerce  for more than 24 hours, hunkered down on a bill that no one has seen,  no one has read, or no one knows what it is about. Contrast that to the  Affordable Care Act with over 79 hearings, over a 2-year period,  hundreds and hundreds of hours of hearings, 181 witnesses from both  sides of the aisle, ongoing interaction with the American people. And  what did we get? Over 20 million people, lower costs in Medicare,  Medicaid, and employer coverage.   What are we getting now in this document that is called a healthcare  bill? Loss of coverage with 15 million Americans kicked off of health  insurance, 73 million Americans may lose their health insurance,  undermining employer-sponsored coverage that more than 177 million  individuals would be jeopardized, no CBO assessment of what it is going  to cost, how many jobs will be lost, and you will be paying more for  your insurance and getting less. And the loved ones that you have in  nursing homes that are dependent upon Medicaid, even though they  worked, may be kicked out as we speak.   Go forward on the D.C. 24 #ResistRepeal.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to Rules  Committee Print 115-5 of H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action  Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017,  which is a radical measure that would overturn centuries of American  law.   This committee print buries the ``Furthering Asbestos Claim  Transparency Act of 2017,'' crammed through committee on a party-line  vote, within the overarching legislation intended to effectively  obliterate class actions in America, H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class  Action Litigation Act of 2017.   I oppose this two-for-one bill combination because it will, in sum,  undermine the enforcement of this Nation's civil rights laws and upend  decades of settled class action law.   The fact that the House would even consider such sweeping, reckless  legislation without holding a single hearing is an outrage.   This poorly drafted legislation will create needless chaos in the  courts without actually solving any demonstrated problem.   Class action lawsuits are among the most important tools to enable  injured, cheated, and or victimized individuals and small businesses to  hold large corporations and institutions accountable and deter future  misconduct.   H.R. 985 would eviscerate that tool.   Let me remind my colleagues that class actions are critical for the  enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing,  education, and access to public areas and services.   As the Supreme Court has recognized in Amchem Products, Inc. v.  Windsor, class actions provide ``vindication of the rights of groups of  people who individually would be without effective strength to bring  their opponents into court at all.''   Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997). Courts  have interpreted Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the  federal class action rule, over decades and the Advisory Committee on  Civil Rules has, through its deliberative process, reviewed and amended  the rule to ensure its fair and efficient operation.   No further revisions are needed at this time.   Civil rights injuries are never identical and are already subject to  rigorous judicial review.   H.R. 985 imposes a new and impossible hurdle for class certification.   This alone would sound the death knell for most class actions.   It requires that the proponents of the class demonstrate that each  class member has suffered the same type and scope of injury.   At this early stage of a civil rights class action, it is frequently  impossible to identify all of the victims or the precise nature of each  of their injuries.   Classes inherently include a range of affected individuals, and in no  case does every member of the class suffer the same scope of injury  from the same wrongful act.   But even if this information were knowable, class members' injuries  would not be the same.   As a simple example, those overcharged for rent will have different  injuries.   In an employment discrimination class action, the extent of a class  member's injuries will depend on a range of factors, including their  job position, tenure, employment status, salary, and length of exposure  to the discriminatory conditions.   For this reason, nearly forty years ago, the Supreme Court developed  a two-stage process for such cases in International Brotherhood of  Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.S. 324, 371-72 (1977).   In the first stage, the court determines whether the employer engaged  in a pattern or practice of discrimination.  [[Page H1981]]    If the employer is found liable, the court holds individual hearings  to determine the relief (if any) for each victim.   The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the use of the Teamsters model  for discrimination class actions in part because of the individualized  nature of injuries.   In the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 366  (2011).   Thus, this bill would overturn the approach established four decades  ago to permit a class of victims of discrimination to seek effective  relief.   Certainly, many civil rights, discrimination and employment class  actions, including cases involving refusals by companies to properly  pay workers, would not satisfy these criteria.   Some provisions would make it even more difficult to bring race and  gender discrimination class actions.   Other provisions would have a dramatic impact on cases against toxic  polluters.   For example, arbitrary and unworkable standards for attorneys' fees  undermine civil rights enforcement.   If a case is successful, the judge awards a reasonable fee based upon  the time that the advocates have spent working on the case.   This method of determining attorneys' fees provides for consistent  and predictable outcomes, which is a benefit to all parties in a  lawsuit.   H.R. 985 would entirely displace this well-settled law with a  standard long ago rejected as arbitrary and unworkable.   Under the bill, attorneys' fees would be calculated as a percentage  of the value of the equitable relief. Sec. 1718(b)(3).   But how is a judge to determine the cash value of an integrated  school, a well-operating foster care system, the deinstitutionalization  of individuals with disabilities, or myriad other forms of equitable  relief secured by civil rights class actions?   Asking judges to assign a price tag in such cases is an impossible  task and would lead to uncertainty and inconsistency.   Non-profit organizations cannot bear the risk of these long and  expensive cases if, at the end, their fees are calculated under this  incoherent and capricious standard.   Indeed, the bill creates an incentive for defendants to prolong the  litigation so as to make it economically impossible for plaintiffs'  attorneys to continue to prosecute the litigation.   In addition, by considering this bill now, Congress is circumventing  the process that Congress itself established for promulgation of  federal court rules under the Rules Enabling Act, bypassing both the  Judicial Conference of the United States and the U.S. Supreme Court.   Civil rights class actions are often about systemic reforms that  benefit the most vulnerable.   Interference with the proper federal court rules process is reckless  and irresponsible, particularly when this proposal is so damaging to  victims.   Mr. Chair, the only beneficiaries of the so-called FACT Act, are the  very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed or  seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and  workers.   The FACT Act would force asbestos patients seeking any compensation  from a private asbestos trust fund to reveal on a public web site  private information including the last four digits of their Social  Security numbers, and personal information about their families and  children.   In fact, not a single asbestos victim has come forward in support of  this legislation.   Worse, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be  further victimized by requiring this information about their illness to  be made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the  Internet.   For example, the bill requires all payment demands, as well as, the  names and exposure histories of each claimant--together with the basis  for any payment the trust made to such claimants--to be publicly  disclosed.   This sensitive information must be posted on the court's public  docket, which is easily accessible through the Internet with the  payment of a nominal fee.   Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this information  would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and other  entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with  compensation for asbestos exposure.   Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, and predatory  scam artists as well as the victim's neighbors would have access to  this information.   Many of the people who would be hurt by the FACT Act are veterans,  who are disproportionately affected by asbestos disease.   To address this serious failing of the bill, I offered an amendment  which would ensure that the quarterly reports required under the FACT  Act, contain only aggregate payment information.   My amendment also deletes the bill's burdensome discovery  requirement.   As noted by the widow of our former colleague Congressman Bruce Vento  who passed away from asbestos-induced mesothelioma, the bill's public  disclosure of victims' private information: ``could be used to deny  employment, credit, and health, life, and disability insurance.''   Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims ``would be more  vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of  predators.''   Supporters of this legislation say that Bankruptcy Code section 107  will prevent such results.   But, they are wrong; this provision only permits--it does not  require--the bankruptcy court to issue a protective order.   In fact, such relief may only be granted for cause if the court finds  that ``disclosure of such information would create undue risk of  identity theft or other unlawful injury to the individual.''   What this means is that an asbestos victim would have to retain  counsel and go to court in order to prove cause to obtain relief.   And, even though Bankruptcy Rule 9037 does require certain types of  personal information to be redacted from a document filed in a  bankruptcy case, said Rule would be overridden by this legislation, as  written.   Accordingly, for these reasons and more, I oppose this harmful  legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I think the question is: Is there any  collegiality and respect for the Federal judicial system?   Let me read a letter in reference to the underlying bill:         We strongly urge Congress not to amend the class action       procedures found in rule 23 outside of the Rules Enabling Act       process.    It goes on to talk about an advisory committee, but I don't know any  sentence more clear than that. I know that as a parent raising a child,  ``do not'' and ``no'' are very clear, yet we maintain this debate on  the floor of the House.   Let me also mention a debate that is tomorrow, but I think it is  relevant to my amendment, LARA. This is a rule that was in in 1983. In  1993, it was thrown out because it had a deleterious effect on  meritorious civil rights cases, employment cases, and others. The  Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, that is tomorrow. The courts also don't  want you to do that, and most of the courts say it is a waste of  resources.   My amendment is going to help us solve the problem for this bill,  H.R. 985. It would improve the rules of the committee print by  replacing the substantive text of the bill with a requirement that the  bankruptcy asbestos trust report quarterly an aggregate list of demands  received and payments made. Specifically, the Jackson Lee amendment  protects the privacy of asbestos victims from overly broad and invasive  disclosure requirements by striking from the bill's text personal  information disclosure mandates.   Mr. Chairman, the only beneficiaries of the so-called FACT Act are  the very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed  or seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and  workers--it is the defendants. And, no, it does not provide for a  safety for the trust.   Worse, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be  further victimized by requiring information about their illness to be  made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the  internet. Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this  information would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and  other entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with the  compensation for asbestos exposure.   Why do these people have to be doubly, triply penalized? They are  already dying, many of them.   Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, predatory scam  artists all have access to these unsuspecting and devastated families  or victims. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense Jackson Lee  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I wish to thank the Chair and Ranking Member of the Rules  Committee for making the Jackson Lee Amendment in order.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment to Rules Committee Print 115-5 of H.R. 985, the ``Fairness in  Class Action Litigation And Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act  of 2017.''   My amendment would improve the Rules Committee Print 115-5 to H.R.  985 by replacing the substantive text of the bill with a requirement  that the bankruptcy asbestos trust report quarterly an aggregate list  of demands received and payments made.   Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment protects the privacy of  asbestos victim plaintiffs from overly broad and invasive disclosure  requirements, by striking from the bill's text personal information  disclosure mandates.   Mr. Chair, the only beneficiaries of the so-called ``FACT Act,'' are  the very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed  or seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and  workers.   In fact, I am unaware of any asbestos victim who supports this  legislation.   Worse yet, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be  further victimized by requiring information about their illness to be  made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the  Internet.   For example, the bill requires all payment demands, as well as, the  names and exposure histories of each claimant together with the basis  for any payment the trust made to such claimants to be publicly  disclosed.   This sensitive information must be posted on the court's public  docket, which is easily accessible through the Internet with the  payment of a nominal file.   Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this information  would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and other  entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with  compensation for asbestos exposure.   Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, and predatory  scam artists as well as the victim's neighbors would have access to  this information.   To address this serious failing of the bill, my amendment would  ensure that the quarterly reports required under the ``FACT Act,''  contain only aggregate payment information.   My amendment also deletes the bill's burdensome discovery  requirement.   As noted by the widow of our former colleague Representative Bruce  Vento who passed away from asbestos-induced mesothelioma, the bill's  public disclosure of victims' private information: ``could be used to  deny employment, credit, and health, life, and disability insurance.''   Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims ``would be more  vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of  predators.''   I am sure that the supporters of this legislation will say that  Bankruptcy Code section 107 will prevent such results.   But this provision only permits--it does not require--the bankruptcy  court to issue a protective order.   In fact, such relief may only be granted ``for cause'' if the court  finds that ``disclosure of such information would create undue risk of  identity theft or other unlawful injury to the individual.''   What this means is that an asbestos victim would have to retain  counsel and go to court in order to prove ``cause'' to obtain relief.   And, even though Bankruptcy Rule 9037 does require certain types of  personal information to be redacted from a document filed in a  bankruptcy case, said Rule would be overridden by this legislation, as  written.   Accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment to ensure that the privacy of asbestos victims is protected.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on my side?    Mr. Chairman, let me say whose side I want to stand  on, and that is the side of Mrs. Vento, the widow of our former  colleague, Representative Bruce Vento, who passed away from asbestos- induced cancer.   The bill's public disclosure of victims' private information could be  used to deny employment, credit, and health, life, and disability  insurance. Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims would be more  vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of predators.   There is no reason for this bill. Not only is the Judicial Conference  of Federal Judges against it, but victims are crying out: Stop it, and  stop it now.   Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a StarTribune  article.  [[Page H1992]]                                [From the StarTribune]      Stand With Families Affected by Asbestos, and Help Kill FACT Act         My husband was the late U.S. Rep. Bruce F. Vento, who       served for almost 24 years in the House of Representatives       representing Minnesota's Fourth Congressional District. He       died from mesothelioma in 2000 within eight and a half months       of being diagnosed.        Mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer caused by asbestos       exposure. Bruce was exposed while working his way through       college as a laborer, years before he became involved in       public life.        With his death, our country lost a hardworking and humble       public servant years before his time. Bruce's parents,       siblings, children, grandchildren and I lost so much more.        Since his death, I have worked with asbestos patients and       family members from across the country to fight for a ban on       asbestos and to protect the rights of people whose lives have       been forever affected by this terrible poison.        I have recently been involved in the effort to stop the so-      called ``Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act,'' or       FACT Act, which would obstruct justice for victims dying from       asbestos-related diseases while giving a handout to the very       corporations that knowingly poisoned and killed them.        The FACT Act would require that the personal information of       sick and dying asbestos patients and their families be posted       on a public website, including names, addresses, medical       diagnoses, financial compensation received and the last four       digits of our Social Security numbers.        This is precisely the kind of information that law       enforcement officials tell the public we should not share on       the Internet because it leaves us vulnerable to identity       thieves and con artists.        The House could be considering a vote on this bad       legislation in the coming weeks, making it all the more       urgent that we act now to protect the privacy of asbestos       victims and their families.        Supporters of the FACT Act are the corporations that       exposed innocent workers, consumers and their family members       to asbestos, while concealing what they knew about this       dangerous poison. They claim that this gross violation of our       privacy is necessary in order to protect asbestos patients       from fraud against the asbestos trust funds that were set up       to compensate asbestos victims and their families. Yet, not a       single instance of fraud against the trust funds has been       identified.        What is worse, while the bill's supporters claim that they       are doing it for asbestos victims, not one victim of asbestos       exposure or an affected family member has been allowed to be       heard on this legislation. The only people who would be       directly affected by the bill have been completely shut out       of the process.        The FACT Act would also bog down the asbestos trust funds       in endless paperwork to respond to information requests from       asbestos companies. This would drain the funds of money that       is desperately needed to compensate sick and dying victims.       As the victims get more and more desperate, they will be       willing to settle cases for pennies on the dollar, taking       needed compensation away from families and leaving it in the       pockets of the responsible companies.        I recently traveled to Washington, D.C., and met with Sens.       Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Betty McCollum, all of       whom committed to work with asbestos patients and family       members to stop the FACT Act from becoming law. I hope that       we can count on the rest of Minnesota's congressional       delegation to stand with asbestos patients and families and       against the FACT Act.     Mr. Chairman, without having the ability to hear my  colleague's opposition, I know that the supporters of this legislation  will say that Bankruptcy Code section 107 will prevent these  devastating results, but it is not true. This provision only permits  it. It does not require the bankruptcy court to issue a protective  order.   My amendment protects these vulnerable victims against the release of  their data, making them, in addition to the devastating disease that  they got from asbestos--and our good friend Bruce Vento, many of us  knew Congressman Vento, we knew his wife, and we knew that his death  was both untimely and devastating, and now you are saying to victims  like him: Release all the data. Open yourself up to more. Open your  families up to more.   The Jackson Lee amendment is a commonsense amendment that will  provide for an asbestos trust report quarterly, an aggregate list of  demands received and payments made. As well, it would protect the  privacy of asbestos victim plaintiffs from overly broad and invasive  disclosure requirements by striking down the bill's text about personal  information disclosure mandates. No matter what my good friend from  Texas says, he does not have an answer to protecting the privacy of  these victims.   I ask our colleagues to support a commonsense response. Stop it now.  The courts don't want it, and it is horrible for the victims. It is  doubling down on people who have lost loved ones and victims who are  suffering from asbestos-induced cancer. I ask my colleagues to support  the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
