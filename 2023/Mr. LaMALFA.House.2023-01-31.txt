 Madam Speaker, our Nation is currently $31 trillion in  debt. Unfunded liabilities, meaning debt we can't fund, are almost $124  trillion.   For the past 2 years, Democrat majorities have added $300 billion in  new extra Federal spending. This level of spending is actually driving  inflation. It is fueling runaway inflation that is driving up the price  of everything from gasoline--we have known about that for a long time-- to eggs, which seems to be a more recent phenomena.   Why do we have to keep doing this? We shouldn't. America is the land  of plenty. America is the land of innovation. We can produce anything  we want. We can innovate new and better ways to do it in this country.  We are being hampered by government, regulations, lack of planning.  Overspending by government has taken away the initiative of people to  be able to do things on their own instead of being harmed by government  spending and regulation.   We have to address Washington, D.C.'s, reckless spending, which is  driving inflation and a massive amount of debt. If the interest rates  keep going up, we won't even be able to service the debt the way we  should.                            ____________________
