 Mr. Speaker, this week the American people saw the first  public impeachment hearings in a generation. These hearings are  happening after weeks of a sham process where witnesses auditioned,  questions were rehearsed, and testimony was selectively leaked by  Democrats as they tried to craft their narrative.   Unfortunately, despite the start of public hearings, Democrats are  continuing to audition witnesses, holding two more secret depositions  in a SCIF this week.   This sham impeachment of President Trump is continuing despite four  undeniable facts that the Democrats have ignored since day one:   One, the transcript of the phone call shows there was no discussion  of conditionality;   Two, both President Trump and President Zelensky said there was no  pressure;   Three, Ukraine didn't know the military aid was being withheld; and   Four, the aid was ultimately released, and Ukraine didn't have to do  anything.   There is no ``there'' there. It is time to move on and work on things  that will benefit the American people, like passing the USMCA, truly  bipartisan prescription drug reform, fully funding our military, and  taking care of our veterans.   Let's move past this partisan process and get to work on the issues  that will benefit every American family.                            ____________________
