 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express  my full support for H.R. 1759, the BRIDGE for Workers Act, led by  Representatives Murphy, Walorski, LaHood, and myself.   Mr. Speaker, my State of New Mexico continues to suffer from one of  the highest unemployment rates in the country. In one county in my  district, the unemployment rate is 17 percent.   As lawmakers, we must prioritize policies that will help counties  across the Nation like Luna County combat systemic problems that are  preventing a swift return to the workforce.   Research shows that the longer workers are out of work, the harder it  can be to maintain their skills and the more likely workers will fall  out of the labor force entirely.   When I was in college, my dad lost his job to funding cuts. My  parents and I had just taken out loans so that I could go to college. I  remember sitting in class, worried. I was homesick, and I felt  powerless to do anything to help my family through that difficult time.   My dad is one of the hardest working people I know. On his own, he  got the training he needed to find a job in our hometown, but it took  years. We all made sacrifices in the meantime.   I worked multiple jobs, and I graduated in 3 years to help limit that  debt, and I took on my parents' loan payments to help out.   Now my dad is a schoolbus driver, and the kids he drives to school,  the colleagues he serves as a union president, and our community are  all better because of the work that he does. I just wish he had found  his second calling earlier.   This bill will help. The earlier we retrain people, the earlier they  find new careers. This helps people in their most vulnerable moments.  It supports families, and it builds stronger communities.   That is why I am proud to help lead the BRIDGE for Workers Act, which  will help unemployed individuals find a job faster so that they can  provide for their families and get back on their feet as soon as  possible.   This would fix a flaw in the current law that limits reemployment  services to only those expected to remain unemployed after their  benefits run out.   Reemployment services are essential, as they give people without a  job the tools they need to get back to work through programs offering  targeted job search assistance, career counseling, and interview and  resume workshops. With greater access to these services, unemployed  individuals will be more likely to find a job faster and rejoin the  workforce.   This bill is also cost effective. Since it allows States to use their  reemployment services grants more effectively, individuals will return  to work quicker, which will generate more savings for our government.   When Americans who want to work hard get the support they need to do  just that, we all succeed. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to support this legislation and help unemployed Americans  across our Nation get back on their feet.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  First Lieutenant James Clayton Flowers and wish him a very happy 103rd  birthday.   Born on Christmas Day in 1915, Mr. Flowers has seen our great Nation  through a century of progress, conflict, and change.   Enlisting in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II,  Mr. Flowers was one of the few African American soldiers chosen to  train as a Tuskegee Airman.   After World War II, Mr. Flowers started a family with his wife,  Evelyn Flowers, and began teaching for New York City public schools,  where he was a leader in the United Federation of Teachers.   When he and his wife retired, they found their new home in southern  New Mexico. Even in retirement, Mr. Flowers continued to work for the  betterment of his community. Leading by example, he taught future  generations to serve their communities by building houses with Habitat  for Humanity. He also invested in the local chapters of the NAACP and  the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.   Madam Speaker, please join me today in thanking First Lieutenant  James Clayton Flowers for his service to our Nation and wishing him a  happy 103rd birthday.                            ____________________
