 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of a  great Kansan, Jack Vanier, who died at the age of 94 last month, as  well as his late wife, Donna.   Jack was born in Salina, where he was raised to love agriculture and  the conservative Kansas values of faith, hard work, freedom, integrity,  family, and personal responsibility. These are the values that make our  State so special, and Jack embodied them. He was an unassuming and  humble servant leader with a long list of accomplishments, but he  didn't make his life about himself; he made his life about others.   Jack had a larger-than-life personality, but he didn't want the  spotlight. He wanted to make a difference in his community, his alma  mater K-State, and the lives of the people around him.   Jack was a hero of Kansas agriculture. He painstakingly operated the  CK Ranch in Brookville, Kansas, once the largest producer of purebred  Hereford cattle in the United States. He brought commonsense leadership  to the American Hereford Association, Kansas Livestock Association,  National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and Archer-Daniels-Midland.   He was a generous, philanthropic visionary for Kansas State  University.   Most importantly, alongside his late wife, Donna, he raised his  family on faith.   Jack's wife, Donna, who passed away on May 23, 2020, was larger than  life in her own right. Donna was a generous and hardworking  philanthropist who always put her family first. She was the driving  force behind the Donna L. Vanier Children's Center in Salina, which has  now been open for 11 years, and she was a proud K-State supporter who  built deep, long-lasting relationships with athletic directors and  students alike.   Donna and Jack were servant leaders through and through, and they  were recognized together as a couple as the Kansan Humanitarians of the  Year in 2018.   What a legacy this great couple leaves behind for their children and  grandchildren to emulate and remember them by, and what a blessing for  Jack to join his wife, Donna, to rest with our Lord.   To Mary, Marty, John, and their children, and to all of Jack and  Donna's family who were blessed by the love of this great couple, my  thoughts and prayers are with you all.                 Honoring the Life and Legacy of Mark Fowler     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of a  great Kansan, Mark Fowler, and to mourn his untimely passing at the age  of 52 at his home in Manhattan on February 20.   Mark grew up on his family's farm near Emporia, Kansas. He earned a  bachelor's degree in Milling Science and Management from Kansas State  University, and later returned to complete a master's degree in  agricultural economics. He began his career as a flour miller, first  for Cargill, and then Seaboard.   In those roles, Mark ran flour mills, which worked on projects in  several developing countries, including Ecuador, Guyana, and Haiti, and  worked as a technical director of the African Division within  Seaboard's Overseas Group in Durban, South Africa.   Mark was the president and CEO of Farmer Direct Foods, a farmer- owned, flour milling company in New Cambria, Kansas, after which he  moved into his most recent role at U.S. Wheat, where he originally  served as vice president of overseas operations.   Mark once said that he wanted to advance the U.S. wheat export market  development mission because, through his work overseas, he experienced  the global impact of wheat milling.    Mark's dedicated service helped hungry people all over the world, and  he will be sorely missed.   To his colleagues and friends, his widow, Courtney, his daughters  Piper and Paige, his mother Ruth Fowler, and his sisters Rhonda and  Amy, you are in my thoughts and prayers as you mourn Mark's passing.                 Honoring the Life and Legacy of Andy McCurry     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  a  [[Page H1156]]  great Kansan, Andrew J. McCurry, who passed away on February 12 at his  home in Burrton, Kansas, surrounded by his loving family.   Andy was born in 1950 in Hutchinson, Kansas. After studying animal  science and industry at Kansas State University, he and his wife, Mary,  started their registered Angus operation Marands Angus, which later  became McCurry Angus Ranch.   As third- and fourth-generation Angus breeders, Andy and his family  built a legacy all their own while carrying on the traditions of their  ancestors.   Andy spent a lifetime pounding posts by hand, making a suitable place  for hosting cattle sales, chuckwagon cookouts, livestock judging teams,  and visitors from across the U.S. Ultimately, he built a place to raise  both his family and world-class Angus cattle by the sweat of his brow.   Andy's gift was the ability to meet people from all walks of life and  spend time getting to know them, and his network of friends was  nationwide.   Later in life, Andy pursued another career as a pharmacist. He  attended the University of Kansas School of Pharmacy, graduated in  1990, after which he worked as a pharmacist in the Hutchinson, Kansas,  area for 30 years, retiring on his 70th birthday in 2020.   Because of his career-change experience, Andy was able to come  alongside young people and help them find direction in their lives. He  encouraged so many.   To Andy's wife, Mary; his son, John; his daughter, Emily; and all his  grandchildren, you have my prayers as you gather together to remember  Andy's loving impact.   Andy's legacy lives on in so many ways, especially in the cattle his  family still produces. I know the first bull sale without Andy will be  a tough one, but what a way to honor his legacy by continuing on the  tradition he loved so much.   I will be praying for you tomorrow during the sale that your family  would have peace, Andy would be honored, and that the bulls would set  new records.                            ____________________
