 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to two El  Monte police officers, Corporal Michael Paredes and Officer Joseph  Santana, killed in the line of duty on Tuesday night. The two officers  were fatally injured while investigating a domestic violence call.   Corporal Paredes started his career with the El Monte Police  Department as a full-time officer in July 2000. Prior to being  appointed corporal, he worked on specialized assignments. Corporal  Paredes is survived by his wife, daughter, and son.   Officer Santana began his law enforcement career with the San  Bernardino County Sheriff's Department as a deputy sheriff. After 3  years, he accepted a position as a police officer in the city of El  Monte, allowing Santana to serve his hometown. He is survived by his  wife, daughter, and twin boys.   Our hearts are filled with deep sadness today as we mourn the loss of  these brave officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice while protecting  our community. Their dedication will never be forgotten.   Our heartfelt prayers and condolences go out to the officers'  families and all of the friends and loved ones in the El Monte  community.                            ____________________
