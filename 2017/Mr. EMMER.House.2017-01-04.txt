 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the first time in the 115th  Congress to recognize the brave servicemen and -women who tirelessly  defend our great Nation.   Every day, our men and women in uniform make tremendous sacrifices to  protect the many freedoms we enjoy both at home and abroad. They spend  time away from their families, miss birthdays, anniversaries, and  funerals, and are frequently required to put themselves in harm's way  to fight for this great Nation.   In particular, I would like to recognize Jason Braun, who will be  deploying to the Middle East in the coming  [[Page H60]]  days. A Minnesota resident, Jason is a member of the West Metro Fire- Rescue District and is a dedicated husband to my director of operations  and scheduler, Kate Braun.   I want to thank Jason; his wife, Kate; and all of the members of our  Armed Forces and their families for their continued sacrifice and  service to our country. Their dedication to freedom is what makes this  country great. I wish all of our servicemembers overseas a safe and  speedy deployment.                            ____________________
