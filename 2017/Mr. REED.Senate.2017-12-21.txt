 Mr. President, yesterday, we saw a very unusual celebration  at the White House as Members of Congress took turns exalting the  President and speaking in glowing terms about the tax bill they had  passed. There appeared to be quite a contrast between the celebration  at the White House and the reaction by working Americans.   Why weren't working middle-class Americans celebrating so vigorously?  Why does poll after poll find that this is the most unpopular tax bill  since the 1980s, in fact, including tax hikes by Presidents George  Herbert Walker Bush and President Bill Clinton? This bill is even less  popular than those tax increases.   Speaker Ryan seems to think the Republican tax bill is unpopular  because Americans don't know what is in it. He is wrong. The American  people are smart. They get it. They don't like this tax bill because  they do know what is in it: lots of goodies for President Trump and his  family and very little for theirs.   This tax bill isn't popular with working people because they know  that if Republicans really wanted to give them a tax break, Republicans  would have given it to them directly and not to corporate executives.  Middle-class  [[Page S8228]]  Americans remember the corporate excesses that led us to the terrible  losses of the great recession. They sacrificed and worked hard to help  the economy recover. They remember the tough choices we had to make in  order to get our economy working again, and they don't want to see that  progress turned back. But the recovered economy President Trump  inherited from President Obama is in danger of backsliding under this  trickle-down approach, with Republicans once again breaking the Federal  bank to give huge tax breaks to the wealthy.   Middle-class Americans weren't popping champagne bottles yesterday  because they know that they will be on the hook again when reality sets  in on the massive deficits and irresponsible excesses of the Trump  economy. The real economy isn't a chart or a graph to them; it is their  ability to put food on the table, send their children to college, and  plan for retirement. Republican economics have not historically worked  out well for them. The economy created over 11 times as many jobs under  President Clinton as it did under President George Herbert Walker Bush.  It created over 10 times as many jobs under President Obama as  President George W. Bush. Today, U.S. job openings are nearing all-time  highs and 15 million Americans have gained employment since 2010.   We have much, much more work to do to address issues like  underemployment, labor force participation, and wage growth, but the  economy Republicans are gambling with today is one that middle-class  families worked hard and sacrificed to create. Moreover, middle-class  Americans are not easily fooled when it comes to their bottom line. It  will take more than focus groups and political publicity stunts to  convince them that this Republican bill was written with their  interests in mind.   Many Americans opened their paper this morning to read that major  corporations like Wells Fargo and others were boosting U.S. investment  or providing bonuses in the wake of the huge tax breaks provided to  them by the Republican legislation. It is certainly a good thing that  many of these companies are considering greater investments in their  American workforce, but the relationship between these tax breaks and  higher pay or bonuses seems to fall apart under scrutiny. Some  companies, like Wells Fargo, have already admitted that these pay  raises were preplanned and not the direct result of the tax bill.  Indeed, this coordinated announcement appears more intended to appeal  to the Trump administration than to prove anything about the  effectiveness of the Republican tax bill for American workers.   Moreover, it appears the real problem many Americans have with the  Republican bill is that they believe it will balloon the public debt in  order to disproportionately benefit the rich. Based on every credible  analysis of the bill to date, they are very likely correct. So, rather  than watch for publicity stunts, Americans should, in the coming weeks,  watch how much corporate executives take in bonuses. They should look  at the more than $70 billion in share buybacks that major corporations  have announced since the Senate passed the Republican tax bill. Once  corporations got the clear signal that this legislation would likely  pass, their reaction was not to raise wages, not to stabilize the  pension funds, but to buy back their shares, which is a double benefit  for the managers of these companies and for the shareholders.   First, it typically raises the price of the stock on the market,  which makes the value go up and gives direct benefits to shareholders.  For the managers, most or much of their pay is related to their  shareholdings. By the way, they are usually incentivized to increase  share price, so their other pay is increased. So it is no surprise that  this is the reaction of most corporations. It is quite telling that  some company executives have made it clear that their plan for the  funds released by this tax bill will be devoted to share buybacks. It  is, in fact, ironic because many of these companies were having to pay  an effective tax rate of less than 10 percent, much less than the new  statutory rate. Does that mean they are going to give even higher  wages? If a company was paying an effective tax rate of 8 percent and  wasn't significantly raising the wages of their workforce, what does  the new statutory rate of 21 percent do to their incentive? Nothing at  all.   Americans can and will also consider the fact that 35 percent of  American company stock is owned by foreign nationals, who are projected  to pocket a $48 billion windfall by 2019 as a result of corporate tax  breaks. Yes, this tax bill will incentivize corporations to buy back  stock, a significant amount of which is owned by foreign entities,  individuals, and corporations. So $48 billion of these funds will go  overseas; it won't be devoted to salary increases, wage increases, R&D  it won't even be devoted in some sense to the United States because it  will flow overseas.   They should ask: In light of these historically huge gains for the  corporate investor class, how many of these corporations will make sure  their pension funds, for example, are fully funded? There is no  requirement that would prevent a company from buying back stock even  while its pension fund is not actuarially sound. That has happened in  the past. That is likely to happen in the future. So you have to ask  yourself, as working families are: If I have a company that is giving  its shareholders and management huge benefits, and my pension is  questionable--it is not fully funded--is that right? I think the answer  is, honestly: No, that is wrong.   How many companies will ship jobs overseas because they will see a  financial advantage? In fact, corporate executives will feel a  fiduciary duty to the shareholders to do that. How many companies will  continue to replace their workers with contractors who may have no  healthcare from the company and no pension benefits? Jobs that could be  filled and were filled in the past by real employees with real benefits  will now be shipped away from the company to contractors.   I supported efforts by several of my Democratic colleagues to place  conditions on these massive corporate tax breaks so that there would be  at least some requirement that American workers share in this  multitrillion dollar giveaway, but all of these proposals were rejected  by our Republican colleagues. I believe they will have to explain to  the working men and women of America why shareholders are getting huge  benefits and they don't have a fully sound pension fund. Why are  additional Americans being laid off by these corporations at the same  time they are providing huge buybacks of their stocks to their  shareholders? These are a series of questions I think American working  families and the middle-class will continue to ask.   They are already aware this bill was not designed for them. It was  designed for the wealthiest corporations and the wealthiest individuals  in America and, indeed, globally. When the evidence mounts, it will  further confirm those views. I think they are very, very accurate.   I know Americans will continue to work hard. They will continue to  try to build this economy. But with the passage of this bill, this is  clearly now President Trump's economy. All of the sacrifice and effort  to build jobs under President Obama, which cut the unemployment rate  from double digits down to 4.5 and 5 percent--all those could be  jeopardized by what has transpired here, and the President owns it.   As we go forward, I think we have to realize this legislation is not  going to help working families.   I have heard my colleagues, very sincerely and very eloquently, talk  about some of the challenges we face, like job training. We are facing  a situation in which many experts predict that within the next 12  years--by 2030--we will lose one-third of the jobs in the United  States. They will go away because of technology and because of  artificial intelligence. What is going to happen to the 30- or 40-year- old working man or woman? What does one do when a job he or she has  prepared well for, and done very well, is suddenly taken over by a  machine? Will one turn to private corporations and ask, please, help  me?   I know what the answer will be: Not our responsibility. We only have  an obligation to our shareholders--to enrich them. That is all we do.  Thank you very much.   They will turn to the government. What will we do? We will say: We  are sorry. We are already $1.5 trillion in the hole. Because of the tax  bill, we can't afford any job training, career  [[Page S8229]]  transition, long-term unemployment sustainment, which we will need to  allow people to make this transition. Oh, by the way, as to those  retirement benefits that are under huge pressure, we cannot help you.  We have the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, but that is so  underwater. Sorry.   By the way, with natural phenomena--the floods that are coming--we  are currently talking about a disaster relief bill. In this Chamber, we  are all aware that our National Flood Insurance Program is in a deep  hole. It is--no pun intended--underwater. Where are we going to get  this money to pay for the obligations we have already put on our books  for the National Flood Insurance Program? What are the cities and  communities going to do when we say we don't have it anymore, that we  gave the money away?   We are now facing very difficult situations--we know they are  coming--with unavoidable costs. There is our national defense. We have  to rebuild our nuclear triad, our submarines, our bomber fleets, our  land-based systems. Over several years, that will be hundreds and  hundreds of billions of dollars. We know we have to do it.   Instead of doing that, yesterday, we decided to give $1.5 trillion or  more in deficit spending to the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest  corporations. I don't think it makes good sense. I think working  Americans and middle-class Americans understand that very well--in  fact, better than we do, collectively. What they have done,  essentially, and what they are saying to anyone who would ask is, this  is a terrible piece of legislation. Why did Congress pass it?   That is a question that will reverberate throughout this year and  next year and, unfortunately, I think, for a long time because it will  take us time and effort and sacrifice and tough votes, as we had in the  nineties and again in 2009 and beyond, to get back on track for working  families.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). The Senator from South Dakota.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rhode Island  Fishermen's Fairness Act along with my colleague, Senator Whitehouse. I  am also pleased that my colleagues, Representatives James Langevin and  David Cicilline, will be introducing a companion measure in the House  of Representatives.   Our legislation will give Rhode Island voice and voting  representation on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC),  which manages some of the most important fish stocks for our State's  commercial fishing industry--chief among them squid. Indeed, the  National Marine Fisheries Service reported that Rhode Island led  Atlantic States in the harvest of squid in 2016, bringing in 22.5  million pounds and helping make Point Judith, Rhode Island one of the  most productive and valuable commercial fishing ports in the United  States. For years now, Rhode Island's landings of stocks managed by the  MAFMC have outpaced the landings of those managed by the New England  Fishery Management Council, where Rhode Island is represented.  Moreover, Rhode Island has a larger stake in the Mid-Atlantic fishery  than many of the States that currently hold seats on the MAFMC.   Because so much is at stake for our State in every decision the MAFMC  makes, our bill would expand the MAFMC by two seats in Order to ensure  that Rhode Island will have the minimum number of seats guaranteed to  other States on the council. It will allow Rhode Island to continue to  have representation on the New England Fishery Management Council,  where it still has significant interests. This proposal is not  unprecedented. In fact, it is modeled on a provision of the 1996  Sustainable Fisheries Act that added North Carolina to the MAFMC in  1996 while allowing it to retain its membership on the South Atlantic  Fishery Management Council.   Mr. President, this is a commonsense proposal and one that my  colleagues and I will be working to advance either on its own or as  part of the reauthorization the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation  and Management Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Ms. Harris, Mr. Merkley, Ms.          Klobuchar, Ms. Murkowski, and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 2270. A bill to make improvements to the account for the State  response to the opioid abuse crisis to improve tribal health; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators  Collins, Cochran, Gillibrand, and Murkowski in introducing legislation  to renew the law that expands the reach of libraries and museums and  enables them to better serve their communities. These vital  institutions educate, inform, engage, and connect people from all walks  of life.   In 1996, Congress passed the Museum and Library Services Act,  establishing the Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS, to  house our Nation's library and museum programs together for the first  time. My predecessor, the late Senator Claiborne Pell, a great champion  for expanding educational and cultural opportunities to all  communities, was instrumental in passage of this law. The Senate  Committee report for this bill noted the ``great potential in an  Institute that is focused on the combined roles that libraries and  museums play in our community life, in support of research, learning,  and entertainment, and in support of American culture and history.''   Over the last 21 years we have seen IMLS, with a relatively modest  Federal investment, build the capacity to support and expand access to  library and museum services at the State and local levels. IMLS has  been the source of major Federal support for nearly 120,000 libraries,  including public, academic, research, special, and tribal libraries,  and 35,000 museums, including art, history, science and technology,  children's, historical societies, tribal, planetariums, botanic  gardens, and zoos. We have seen access to libraries and museums  increase, and these institutions continue to evolve as community hubs,  advancing the growth and vitality of the areas they serve.   In Rhode Island, IMLS funding for the grants to States program under  the Library Services and Technology Act, LSTA, has supported improved  online resources; literacy initiatives, including a summer reading  program; and the provision of talking books to residents with visual  impairments and disabilities. Providence Public Library was awarded a  recent grant to provide underserved teens with learning opportunities,  leading to digital credentials, academic credit, exposure to work, and  entry into education and career pathways. IMLS has also supported and  elevated the work of Rhode Island museums. For instance, the Tomaquag  Museum in Exeter was one of ten recipients nationally to be recognized  with a 2016 National Medal for Museum and Library Service. The  Providence Children's Museum and the Preservation Society of Newport  County also received grants to support their work in recent years.   I have been proud to continue the work of Senator Pell in supporting  robust funding for libraries and museums and authoring the last two  renewals of the Museum and Library Services Act. I have seen firsthand  the impact libraries and museums have had on our communities in Rhode  Island and the residents and visitors they serve, making our State  stronger because of the services and experiences that these  institutions provide.   The museum and library communities have provided invaluable input in  helping us craft this bipartisan legislation. I would especially like  to thank the Rhode Island library community for hosting me at libraries  across the state and convening a roundtable discussion last year to  delve deeper into the programs libraries are providing and ways to  improve how they serve their communities.   In response to the input and insight offered by the library and  museum communities, the bill we are introducing today, the Museum and  Library Services Act of 2017, strengthens the use of data-driven tools  to measure the impact and maximize the effectiveness of library and  museum services and better tailor local services to address and meet  community needs. The legislation provides for technical support and  assistance to improve data collection. It also enhances IMLS's  collaborative efforts with an expanded number of Federal agencies in  order to fully leverage the benefits libraries and museums provide to  Americans.   This legislation also amends LSTA to highlight the role of libraries  as community hubs, equipped to provide services and programming in such  areas as literacy, education, lifelong learning, workforce development,  economic and business development, digital literacy skills, critical  thinking, financial literacy skills, and new and emerging technology.  The bill provides greater emphasis on recruiting and training the next  generation of library and information science professionals from  diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. Additionally, it focuses  leadership grant funds on activities that serve a range of library  types and geographically diverse areas; have evaluation, analysis, and  dissemination components; and involve, impact, or have future  applicability in libraries. And, in the aftermath of this past year's  devastating hurricanes and wildfires, the bill clarifies that grant  funds can be used to help libraries get resources back online as  communities face the challenge of recovering from a disaster.   The Museum and Library Services Act of 2017 also builds on the over  40-year legacy of Federal support for improving and expanding access to  museum services. It addresses the critical need for professional  development and recruiting and preparing the next generation of museum  professionals, emphasizing diversity so that museums better reflect the  communities they serve. The legislation also highlights the educational  role of museums and the diverse ways that museums engage their  communities, and it encourages partnerships with other agencies,  professional networks, and community-based organizations to expand and  enhance access to museum services.   The Museum and Library Services Act of 2017 will continue our  tradition of supporting our communities through their museums and  libraries, while looking ahead and providing flexibility for these  vital institutions to respond to changing demands and missions. Our  bill has the support of the American Library Association and the  American Alliance of Museums and many of their affiliated associations.  I thank my colleagues for supporting this endeavor  [[Page S8263]]  and look forward to more joining us as we work together to urge swift  action to adopt this important legislation.
