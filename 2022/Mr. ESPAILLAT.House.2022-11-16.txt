 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life and  legacy of the legendary Reverend Dr. Calvin O. Butts III. As the pastor  of the Abyssinian Baptist Church for 50 years, Reverend Butts  understood his role as a leader went beyond the faith community.   Witnessing the racial strife of the late 1960s, Reverend Butts became  an ardent protector of Harlem, particularly the Black community, and  often pushed for projects and policies that would increase access to  dire needs like housing and education.   Reverend Butts led projects that included raising and investing $1  billion in housing and commercial development in Harlem through the  Abyssinian Development Corporation and creating the Thurgood Marshall  Academy for Learning and Social Change.   Reverend Butts preached a message of faith and education, and he  motivated each of us through his teachings to be an active and  exemplary member of Harlem, uplifting communities while giving back  through service, engagement, and social reform.   A dear friend and icon of Harlem, may he rest in peace, and may his  legacy be cherished and never forgotten. Keep the faith.                            ____________________
