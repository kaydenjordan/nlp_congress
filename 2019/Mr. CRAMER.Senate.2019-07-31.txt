 Mr. President, I rise in support of America's  Transportation Infrastructure Act, a bill we on the Environment and  Public Works Committee passed today with broad bipartisan support.   Our bill contains the largest funding commitment in highway  authorization history. It grows our economy, enhances roads and  bridges, improves transportation safety, provides funds for necessary  projects, eliminates burdensome regulation, promotes innovation, and  invests in our Tribal lands.   Our EPW chairman said the bill would ``enhance quality of life for  the American people.'' Our ranking member believes it ``can endure the  test of time and keep up with the evolving demands of a 21st century  global economy.'' I agree with their assessments, and as a member of  EPW, I want to thank them for listening to our priorities and  collaborating with each of us.   Since joining the Senate, I have expressed my belief that divided  government presents an opportunity for us to achieve mutually  beneficial goals and shared priorities. President Trump, myself, and my  colleagues in Congress agree on the importance of investing in our  Nation's infrastructure. This bill is proof that we can work together  in a bipartisan manner on behalf of the American people.   More important to me than anything else, our bill also reflects the  needs of my great State of North Dakota. As a large, rural State built  on agriculture and natural resources, we are heavily dependent on our  extensive infrastructure to get our goods to market.   With that in mind, I reached out our stakeholders at the very  beginning of this process to glean their perspective. We received input  and comments from city, county, and State leaders all across North  Dakota, expressing their desire for a highway bill reauthorization that  works best for our State.   Their feedback and priorities are very important to me. While not all  of their requests were met, I want them to know their voices were  heard. I therefore ask unanimous consent for the letters they sent us  to be printed in the Record following my remarks. Full versions of each  of these letters can be found on my official website.   I would also like to take a moment to highlight some of the bright  spots in this legislation.   First, at $287 billion, this is the largest highway bill in history.  North Dakotans made it clear: They want a real, long-term  reauthorization that does more than the status quo and actually invests  in our Nation's roads and bridges.   Second, 90 percent of these funds will be distributed to the States  via formula. That is incredibly important to large, rural States like  North Dakota. The main point for the formula is that it is not  discretionary, so it is stable, predictable funding. We have vast  stretches of highway system that contribute greatly to our Nation's  economy and interstate commerce. Despite our low population, rural  States contribute much more to the highway  [[Page S5233]]  trust fund per capita than the rest of the country. In fact, North  Dakota contributes the second-highest amount in the country, roughly  three times more than the national average. Maintaining the current  formula ensures that our State's contribution is acknowledged and paid  back to us in a consistent, unbiased manner, giving North Dakota steady  funding and flexibility to prioritize our State's transportation needs.  Under this bill, transportation funding has increased by 27 percent,  and North Dakota will receive nearly $1.6B over the next 5 years, which  is welcome news to communities back home.   Third, America's Transportation Infrastructure Act cuts duplicative  bureaucracy and delays. For example, it establishes a 2-year goal for  completing environmental reviews, a 90-day timeline for related project  authorizations, and an accountability system for these projects. The  days of half-finished, never-ending projects must come to an end. This  bill acknowledges that. In addition, it creates incentives to lessen  carbon emissions and reduce methane and energy waste.   Lastly, this bill includes multiple provisions I have cosponsored.  The bipartisan USE-IT Act, which incentivizes carbon capture and  sequestration technology, is included in this package; as is the  Addressing Underdeveloped and Tribally Operated Streets Act, also known  as the AUTOS Act. The AUTOS Act, sponsored by my fellow North Dakota  Senator John Hoeven, would enhance the safety of roads on Indian lands  by streamlining existing federal procedures and increasing funding to  repair roads and bridges in Indian country.   These just a few of the many aspects of our bill that I support. As I  have demonstrated, this is an economically and environmentally  responsible bill. It is a win for both sides of the aisle and a win for  our country. I am grateful our committee was able to take this first  step today. I encourage my colleagues in the House to be proactive and  to avoid procrastinating until the last minute. Let's work together in  a timely fashion to deliver a significant investment for the  constituents we serve.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        North Dakota                                    Department of Transportation,                                    Bismarck, ND, February 19, 2019.      North Dakota Priorities for the Next Highway Reauthorization           Bill.       Hon. Kevin Cramer,      U.S. Senator,      Washington, DC.        We appreciate the opportunity to offer input on State       Priorities for the Next Highway Reauthorization Bill. Below       are some key points that are vital to transportation funding       in North Dakota:        Good infrastructure, including highways, is important for       North Dakota and the National Economy.        This allows us to efficiently move agricultural,       manufactured goods, and energy resources to the World       Markets.        Increases personal mobility.        Promotes safety.        Legislation must provide North Dakota a share of Federal       highway and transit formula programs at least as high as it       receives today.        Current level of fuel tax is not keeping up with current       needs.        Allows states the flexibility to efficiently plan for       projects.        Disruptive technologies (such as autonomous, hybrid, and       electric vehicles) are having an impact on the amount of       revenue generated for transportation.        Congress should continue the distribution of highway and       transit program funds by formula.        Historically, North Dakota has not been very successful       with the competitive grant programs such as TIGER and INFR.        Maintain the current Federal share of project cost--80/20        Public Private Partnerships do not work well in rural       states.        The volume of traffic in rural states is not sufficient to       attract private investments in roadway infrastructure       (Example: tolling).      Thomas K. Sorel,        Director.      Doug Burgum,        Governor.                                   ____                                      Associated General Contractors                                                 of North Dakota,                                    Bismarck, ND, February 22, 2019.      Hon. Kevin Cramer,      U.S. Senator,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cramer: Thank you for the opportunity to offer       input from our industry's perspective for the next Highway       Reauthorization Bill. We applaud the EPW committee for       beginning these discussions in advance of the 2020 expiration       of the current act.        A strong federal program is extremely important for a       geographically large, yet sparsely populated state like North       Dakota. We simply do not have the critical mass to fund the       transportation needs on the state/local level. The current       administration seems to favor more local participation but       we'd caution the utilization of that to areas where it is       feasible and not a detriment. Maintaining the 80/20 federal/      state split is imperative in a state like North Dakota.       Private Public Partnerships work well in higher populated       areas but they are not feasible in North Dakota. Being rural       and sparsely populated make the interest of private entities       nearly impossible.        Funding solutions for the Highway Trust Fund is long       overdue and the user fee of the federal motor fuel tax has       not generated enough revenue to fund the program for many       years. It needs to be addressed and soon. The 18.4 cent per       gallon user fee has not been adjusted since October 1, 1993.       The decline in buying power is obvious and better fuel       economy of vehicles adds to the issue. Adjusting it upward       makes sense to us. Looking at any other funding options       should also be considered. In our previous Congressional       visits, AGC of ND representatives have provided an outline of       various funding options. We'd be happy to provide them again       if interested.        With an extremely short construction season in our state,       it is imperative the ND DOT have certainty for federal       funding payments. Too many times, there have been delays in       sending the appropriations which lead to delayed bid       lettings. This is a significant issue in North Dakota. Even a       one month delay can cause huge issues in completing projects.        Those are but a few of our suggestions for the next federal       highway act. Again, we appreciate the opportunity to submit       them and are available for any subsequent deliberations.            Sincerely,                                                       Russ Hanson,      Executive Vice President.                                   ____                                         Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan                                          Council of Governments,                                           Fargo, ND, March 6, 2019.      Subject: Reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Bill           (Highway Bill).       Senator Kevin Cramer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cramer: The Fargo-Moorhead Metropolitan       Council of Governments (FM Metro COG) is very grateful for       the opportunity to share our input about the surface       transportation reauthorization bill. Metro COG serves as the       Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for all       jurisdictions within the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area,       including the North Dakota jurisdictions of Cass County,       Fargo, Horace, and West Fargo, which are all in our       designated urbanized area, and Casselton, Mapleton, and       Harwood in our metropolitan planning area. In Minnesota, our       urbanized area includes Clay County, Dilworth and Moorhead,       and our metropolitan planning area includes Glyndon, Hawley,       Sabin, and Barnesville.        On behalf of the local jurisdictions, Metro COG administers       the federal transportation and transit planning funds       received by our metropolitan area and carries out the       required planning and programming activities to ensure a       continuing, cooperative and comprehensive transportation       planning process. Our Policy Board, made up of local elected       officials and planning commissioners, represents citizens       throughout the metropolitan area.        Our input on reauthorization of the surface transportation       bill is as follows:        Retain the Transportation Management Area population       threshold of 200,000. The Highway Bill establishes the       population threshold of 200,000 as the point when an MPO may       choose to become a Transportation Management Area (TMA). Our       metropolitan area has exceeded this threshold, and will       officially exceed it as part of the 2020 Census. Local       leaders have been looking forward to becoming a TMA and       carrying out planning efforts that will ensure we are in good       standing to meet TMA requirements when the time comes. We ask       that the threshold remain at a population of 200,000.        Retain local flexibility in the use of Highway Funds. The       FAST Act allowed our local leaders a certain amount of       flexibility in the use of Highway Funds to help update our       transit vehicle fleet, thus keeping the fleet in manageable       condition from a maintenance standpoint. This flexibility has       been seriously considered and put to good use in our       metropolitan area, and we request that this type of       flexibility be retained, and even increased in the       reauthorization bill.                                   ____                                                The City of Fargo,                                           Fargo, ND, March 1, 2019.      Re Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill (Highway           Bill).       Senator Kevin Cramer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cramer: I sincerely appreciate the opportunity       to weigh in on the next surface reauthorization bill. The       City of Fargo has benefitted tremendously from the current       Highway Bill and I strongly support future appropriations.       Previous allocations have allowed the City of Fargo, and the       North Dakota Department of Transportation, to construct and       maintain high quality, long lasting infrastructure projects       by allocating upwards of $10-$12 million annually. Without       these necessary funds, our citizens and businesses would be       burdened with  [[Page S5234]]       higher taxes that would undoubtedly stifle our growth.        As Fargo continues to grow and moves closer to becoming a       TMA (Transportation Management Association) long term,       sustainable funding sources will become even more important       to ensure that Fargo remains an economic engine in the Upper       Midwest. For this reason, among many others, I strongly       support the reauthorization of the next surface       transportation bill.            Sincerely,                                              Brenda E. Derrig, PE,      City Engineer.                                   ____                                              City of Valley City,                                     Valley City, ND, March 4, 2019.      Hon. Kevin Cramer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cramer: Please accept this letter as an       expression of support on behalf of the City of Valley City,       North Dakota for the reauthorization of the FAST Act. In my       role as Mayor, I can attest to the fact that infrastructure       funding in this critical piece of legislation is a key       priority for our community.        At the local level, the City of Valley City funds       transportation infrastructure projects through special       assessments and the local renew and replacement fund (R&R)       which uses sales tax and utility fees. To fund critical       infrastructure projects, voters passed a half percent sales       tax in 2007 and an additional half percent sales tax in 2010       for a total of 1 percent dedicated for infrastructure.        At the state level, legislators are currently debating a       bill commonly referred to as ``Operation Prairie Dog'' which       is designed to provide and increase in infrastructure funding       to townships, cities, and counties throughout North Dakota.        Despite significant efforts on the local and state level to       fund infrastructure needs, federal funding can often be the       determining factor as to whether or not many projects come to       fruition. Uncertainty of federal funding after the FAST Act's       expiration in 2020 would jeopardize many needed       infrastructure projects in our community and state. Many       communities, like the City of Valley City, rely on the       certainty provided by an entirely funded and planned federal       highway bill. A reauthorization would mean more projects in       North Dakota and the City of Valley City can proceed, much       like those successfully funded by the current FAST Act and       other authorizations preceding it.        Our community has seen success through critical programs       such as the Transportation Alternatives (TA) program and the       Urban Grant Program (UGP), and we urge you to consider those       programs favorably throughout the legislative process.        Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to       contact me via telephone at (701) 845-8126 or email at       [email protected].            Sincerely,                                                     Dave Carlsrud,      Mayor, City of Valley City.                                   ____                                              City of Grand Forks,                                 Grand Forks, ND, February 27, 2019.      Re Grand Forks comments on Federal Transportation           Authorization.       Senator Kevin Cramer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cramer: Thank you for this opportunity to       provide comment on the reauthorization of Federal Surface       Transportation bill and, particularly, your personal interest       and involvement through the Senate Environment and Public       Works Committee. We support the committee's current strategy       and timeline of reauthorization and we thank you for your       work and support.        Infrastructure needs are a national issue and we support       ongoing efforts that ensure transportation programs are       right-sized to meet the needs of all cities, particularly       those of the size and needs of North Dakota cities.        I would also like to take this opportunity to express how       very fortunate we are to have such solid partners in the       NDDOT and we continue to strive to maintain this productive       partnership that best coordinates resources from federal,       state and local partners.        Our comments will follow three key themes: 1) Continue to       deregulate and encourage further confluence of programs to       provide for effective and efficient use; 2) Continue and       expand funding and funding flexibility that best leverages       federal, state and local--as well as private Investment. 3)       Continue focus on local transit solutions that promote a       state of good repair and levels of service necessary to North       Dakota communities.        1) Continue to deregulate and encourage further confluence       of programs to provide for efficient use.        We applaud the streamlining policy changes of the current       bill, Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.       These include environmental review deregulation efforts that       reduce project costs and the consolidation of ``siloed''       programs that enables more effective flexibility.        Deregulation can go further, for example, by providing for       categorical exclusions for projects under $5M, which would       cover a significant number of projects in cities across North       Dakota.                                                  Michael R. Brown,      Mayor.                                   ____                                               City of West Fargo,                                  West Fargo, ND, February 27, 2019.      Re Surface Transportation Reauthorization.       Hon. Kevin Cramer,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cramer: It is with great pleasure that I write       to you to share the City of West Fargo's thoughts related to       the reauthorization of the next Highway Bill. Of course       funding to continue to support our residents and the great       amount of commerce coming out of our City is important, but       we'd like to inform you of items within the current bill that       we'd like to improve upon.        Increased Emphasis on Land Use: Planning funds are under       tremendous scrutiny by the Federal Highway Administration.       The City feels strongly that land use decisions are closely       tied to transportation and the use of Consolidated Planning       Grants (CPG) in transportation studies should reflect this.       We believe that by decreasing the focus and weight on levels       of service of roadways and increasing the focus on adjacent       land use and increased connections will result in a more       reliable transportation network.        Increased Funding Opportunities for Infrastructure       Preservation, Replacement and Maintenance: The City believes       that although growth requires extending infrastructure, it is       the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of existing infrastructure       that will burden our citizens. Increasing funding       opportunities will help strengthen our City and allow us to       thrive into the future.        Continue Accelerated Project Delivery: The FAST Act helped       streamline the environmental review process. The City       recommends that this continue and that any opportunity to       improve upon this may be explored under the reauthorization.        We thank you for your time and consideration and offer our       assistance in any way we can as your work on this Committee.            Sincerely,                                               Bernie L. Dardis,                                     President of the Board of City,      Commissioners.                                   ____                                  Memorandum                                          Cass County Government,                                  West Fargo, ND, February 25, 2019.      Re FHWA Reauthorization Bill for the FAST Act.       Senator Kevin Cramer,      Washington, DC.        Senator Cramer: As the Cass County Engineer, I am writing       to request your support for the reauthorization of the FAST       Act. Across the country our counties face infrastructure       challenges every day. In North Dakota, our counties have       varying issues from traffic around key hub cities, oil       impacts, and agricultural impacts. On top of these issues, we       face aging infrastructure with deficient bridges and roads       designed to the safety standards of the 1960s. To improve our       aging roads and bridges, I support our National Association       of Counties and Association of County Engineers in these       three core areas:        Ensure that the federal highway program dedicates funds for       rural secondary infrastructure, particularly bridges.        Make the federal permitting process simpler and more       streamlined.        Ensure the long-term certainty and solvency of the Federal       Highway Trust Fund.        I have also been working with our neighboring counties       across the Red River for a critical bridge replacement       project. We have three bridges along the Red River in eastern       North Dakota/northern Minnesota have fallen into severe       disrepair, and our county will need help to procure funds for       the building new structures. Our group of counties applied       for a federal grant through the Competitive Highway Bridge       Program. I ask for your support in innovative project       delivery through project bundling and other FHWA Every Day       Counts Initiatives.        If you have questions, please call Jason Benson.            Sincerely,                                                Jason Benson, P.E.,      Cass County Engineer.                                   ____          American Council of Engineering Companies of North Dakota,                                 Bismarck, ND, February 28, 2019.       Re Highway Bill Input Request.       Hon. Senator Kevin Cramer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cramer: We appreciate the opportunity to       outline our industry priorities for the reauthorization of       federal surface transportation programs. We are very pleased       that your seat on the Senate Environment & Public Works       Committee gives you a strong position to advocate for our       state's needs.        As you know, in December 2015, Congress passed and the       President signed into law the Fixing America's Surface       Transportation (FAST) Act, providing five years of increased       funding to support highway and transit projects, while       including new reforms to enhance program efficiency. The       American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) at both the       state and national levels strongly supported this landmark       legislation, and now urges Congress to remain focused on       adopting long-term, sustainable funding mechanisms to support       the nation's transportation needs.        ACEC North Dakota represents the consulting engineering       firms in the state by assisting members to provide better       consulting  [[Page S5235]]       engineering services for their clients while protecting the       public welfare and safeguarding the ethical standards of       consulting engineers in private practice. We strive to       cooperate with public bodies and other organizations in       matters of common interest. In addition, ACEC North Dakota       acts as a resource among our members to provide cooperative       services and support the advancement of the science and       practice of engineering.        We believe that infrastructure is the backbone of the       United States economy. A modern and efficient transportation       system is critical for protecting public health and safety,       promoting commerce, and providing mobility. It enables       manufacturers to get their products to market, farmers to get       their goods to stores, and workers to get to jobs.        Unfortunately, our nation's infrastructure remains severely       deficient and underfunded. According to the U.S. DOT,       improving the condition and performance of highways and       bridges requires $142 billion annually from all levels of       government; we currently invest approximately $105 billion.       North Dakota faces a $2.5 billion shortfall from 2018 to       2023.                                   ____                                                     Bismarck Mandan                              Chamber  EDC       Hon. Senator Kevin Cramer,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cramer: Please accept this letter as an       expression of my personal support for the reauthorization of       the FAST Act.        In my role as President of the Bismarck Mandan Chamber EDC,       I actively advocate for probusiness policies on behalf of the       organization's more than 1,200 members. Recently, those       efforts have focused on infrastructure funding.        At the local level, voters in the City of Bismarck recently       passed a half-cent sales tax increase dedicated to arterial       roadway construction. And at the state level, legislators are       currently debating a bill dubbed ``Operation Prairie Dog''       designed to provide even more infrastructure funding to       townships, cities and counties around North Dakota.        However, there is concern among all of the aforementioned       political subdivisions regarding the uncertainty of federal       funding after the FAST Act's expiration in 2020. That's       because while we can attempt to fund projects to the best of       our ability at the local and state level, the federal match       for some projects can mean the difference between them       happening or not.        The certainty provided by an entirely funded and planned       federal highway bill means more projects in Bismarck-Mandan       can proceed. As a result, we provide badly needed       infrastructure improvements for our residents and continued       opportunity for our businesses.        Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to       contact me via telephone at (701) 223-5660 or email at       [email protected].            Sincerely,      Brian Ritter.                            ____________________
