 Madam President, with my fellow Members of Idaho's  congressional delegation Senator Jim Risch and Representatives  Mike  Simpson and Russ Fulcher, we pay tribute to veteran and tireless  veterans' advocate, Robert ``Bob'' Jones. Bob passed away on July 8,  2023, after a long battle with cancer and heart disease. Bob's service  in the U.S. Air Force, as a leader of the Veterans of Foreign Wars,  VFW, and as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  has left an indelible mark.   Bob dedicated his life to God, country, and community. He served in  the U.S. Air Force for 20 years, retiring as a lieutenant colonel; his  service included commanding logistics squadrons supporting combat units  in the Vietnam war, serving as chief of supply for the Presidential  Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, and serving at the Pentagon as a senior  staff officer with the U.S. Air Force. Bob earned 24 medals for his  distinguished service that include the Vietnam Service Medal with three  oakleaf clusters, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, the Vietnam  Gallantry Cross with Palm, the Korean Defense Service Medal, and the  Bronze Star.   After his military service, Bob's civilian career included working as  vice president of a defense firm in Saudi Arabia, where he met the love  of his life, his wife of 40 years, Carmelita. They made their home in  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for 13 years before moving to Rexburg in 1995.  Bob and Carmelita owned the Arctic Circle Franchise in Rexburg and an  independent family restaurant called Timber's Edge in Island Park for  several years.   Bob translated his immense experience to support and advocate for his  fellow veterans. He served in many VFW leadership positions that  included his service as a VFW All-American past state commander and  national legislative committee member for Idaho. He and Carmelita have  been so dedicated to helping improve the lives of servicemembers,  veterans, and their families that they traveled to Capitol Hill twice  per year to advocate on their behalf, and Bob stayed involved despite  his battle with cancer. We have always valued the time spent with Bob  and Carmelita as they thoughtfully explained the need for Federal  policy changes to better support military families. The Major Richard  Star Act, to provide combat-injured veterans with less than 20 years of  military service their full benefits, is just one example of the  legislation they worked to advance as they helped make clear the  personal costs of war. Bob said, ``It is our duty and obligation to see  that they are cared for and not forgotten.''   Bob was also a precinct committeeman and a member of the Madison  County Republican Central Committee and military liaison board member  of the Rexburg Area Chamber of Commerce among his many efforts to serve  the community. He understandably received numerous honors for this  local and statewide service. Governor Brad Little presented Bob with  the 2019 Idaho's Brightest Star Award for exemplary volunteer service  to the State of Idaho and fostering an ethic of service in others. He  was also a recipient of the 2020 Spirit of Freedom award for his  extensive, extraordinary career of service to our country and his  fellow veterans. He was recognized with the 2022-2023 VFW National  Legislative Service Award at the VFW Legislative Conference on March  14, 2023, for his tireless efforts on behalf of our Nation's veterans,  and he was honored with the 2022 Presidential Award by the Chamber of  Commerce at the 84th Annual Farmer Merchant Banquet on April 17, 2023,  for his outstanding achievements and contributions to the success of  Rexburg, to name just a few of his many honors.   Bob's obituary aptly describes his service-focused mindset: ``He  wanted to leave this world a better place than he had found it and pay  forward for all the many blessings and opportunities with which he was  blessed with.'' We offer our sincerest condolences to Carmelita and his  many friends and loved ones, including their children, grandchildren,  and great-grandchild. Bob is deeply missed and leaves a lasting legacy  of admirable service to our country, State, community, fellow veterans,  and so many others. We are fortunate to have known him and benefited  from his vision, dedication and advocacy.                            ____________________
