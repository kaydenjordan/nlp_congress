 Madam Speaker, well, here we are again, and I talked on  this before.   I am from the State of Arizona, so border security is top and center  of the discussion in Arizona and it has, quite frankly, been for years.   We have all known there has been a crisis at our border for many,  many years, and that is why I am at least hopeful and inspired a little  bit that my Democratic colleagues are actually admitting--finally--that  there is a crisis at our border. So that is good.   The thing that is bad about this rule today is that I just don't  understand. I guess some of my Democratic colleagues are just being  stubborn because, on the one hand, you have the Senate that already  passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, where Senator Schumer voted  for it. You have a President who said we are not in favor of this House  version of the bill.   So here you have a President who, seemingly, is willing to sign the  Senate bill; you have a Senate bill that has vast bipartisan support,  even with the  [[Page H5239]]  top leadership in the Democrat Party; but, yet, here we are in the  House, and I guess Members just want to make sure they have what they  want in their bill, even if it is not going to pass and even if the  money isn't going to actually get to solving the problem.   And so I ask my Democrat colleagues to put your stubbornness a little  bit aside, because if we all have the goal, as has been said on both  sides, to help solve this problem, to help with the children who are  dying at the border, you know--what was it? Yesterday we saw the  picture of the father and the daughter, and then June 14, we had a  story in Arizona of a young 7-year-old girl who died, and the Arizona  Air National Guard helped find and rescued other members of the party.  I think we are united in trying to solve the problem, and I am glad  that my Democrats finally say there is a crisis, to have acknowledged  it.   But if you really want to help, let's stop this. Okay. Let's stop  what you are doing, because I don't think you are going to win. You  have the President on one side, the Senate on one side with bipartisan  support, including Mr. Schumer, and yet we are here today, right before  the July Fourth recess, and instead of giving in and saying let's just  put up the Senate bill that we know is going to pass, that we know is  going to help, you continue to, I guess, try to make a point.    Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope the Members have made  their points, have made their talking points. Now let's get down to the  business of doing what we are supposed to do in Congress: Pass a bill,  pass the bipartisan Senate bill, but, also, let's work together on  actually reforming our immigration laws, the root of the problem that  is causing this problem, so we are not back here in 6 months or 1 year  doing this again.                                time  1300
