 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of  a devoted veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard, VADM John Currier, who  passed away in March of 2020. I would like to take the time today to  reflect on his service, courage, and tenacity as the hangar at the U.S.  Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City is dedicated in his honor.   Born and raised in Westbrook, ME, Vice Admiral Currier began his  career in service as a police officer. Further expanding his devotion  to serve, Vice Admiral Currier commissioned from Officer Candidate  School as a naval aviator in 1976. He was first assigned to U.S. Coast  Guard Air Station Cape Cod, where a few years later, his skills and  commitment to protect were tested.   On a snowy late October evening in 1980, the Coast Guard received a  distress call from the TERRY T., a burning and sinking fishing vessel  in 30 foot seas. Winds were gusting over 60 knots and visibility was  cut to three-quarters of a mile from heavy rain, according to reports.  Currier, unfaltering in his duty to be Semper Paratus, was able to  maneuver his aircraft into position based only on voice commands by the  hoist operator. He had rescued eight of the crew when two men were  swept off the deck and were in the water. He was able to fly the  aircraft into position in order to get the rescue basket beneath the  drowning crew members and brought them on board.   Vice Admiral Currier was awarded the Harmon International Aviation  Trophy, but his accolades and awards for rescue missions do not stop  there. The Alaska Air Command SAR Pilot of the Year Award, American  Helicopter Society, Fredrick L. Feinberg Award, and the Naval  Helicopter Association SAR Aircrew of the Year, all have been awarded  to Vice Admiral Currier for various hazardous rescue missions  throughout his career.   During his career, Vice Admiral Currier stood the watch at six Coast  Guard air stations, from Alaska to Florida. He was designated as an  aeronautical engineer in 1982, and after a few years in Alaska, Vice  Admiral Currier was assigned to Air Station Traverse City in 1985.   Other assignments have included deputy program manager for the Coast  Guard and Navy HH-60H/J joint helicopter acquisition at the Naval Air  Systems Command, and chief of SAR operations and directory of auxiliary  for the Ninth Coast Guard District. Vice Admiral Currier then served as  commanding officer of Air Stations Detroit and then Miami, which was  then the world's busiest air-sea search and rescue unit. An alumnus of  the University of Southern Maine, he held a master's in business  administration from Embry-Riddle University. He was a 1996 graduate of  the U.S. Air Force Air War College and held a level III acquisition  program manager certification.   Subsequently, he was assigned as Pacific area chief of operations,  then area chief of staff, and was appointed commander of the 13th  District, which covers the Pacific Northwest. He assumed the duties of  the Coast Guard's chief of staff in 2009, later transitioning that  position to the service's first deputy Commandant for Mission Support.  Vice Admiral Currier assumed duties as the 28th Vice Commandant in May  2012, during which time he was awarded the title of Ancient Albatross  of the Coast Guard, until his retirement in May of 2014.   Vice Admiral Currier was a devoted military man and was supported by  an incredible spouse--his wife of 45 years, Mary Jane Currier. They  were known for their hospitality and for throwing spectacular parties  for fellow Coast Guard members, family, and friends. Mary Jane and John  had two sons, Benjamin and Andrew. John was a devoted father who spent  countless hours coaching Little League and teaching his two sons  woodworking and auto mechanics. In his retirement, Vice Admiral Currier  and Mary Jane enjoyed boating on Lake Michigan with their four  grandchildren.   Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to join me in  celebrating the life and service of Vice Admiral John Currier. As we  remember Vice Admiral Currier's life, I have no doubt his surviving  wife, children, and family have found comfort in the precious moments  they shared and in the love he showed them. With the U.S. Coast Guard  Air Station Traverse City hangar now dedicated in his memory, I hope  those who had the honor of serving beside Vice Admiral Currier remember  his legacy when they enter it and that future Coast Guardsman are  inspired by his devoted and honorable career.                            ____________________
