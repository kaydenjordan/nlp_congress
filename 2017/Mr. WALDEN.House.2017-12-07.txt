 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman of the  Appropriations Committee from New Jersey for his great work on this and  so many other issues.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the continuing resolution and  especially to highlight a very important short-term provision in here  that provides certainty for children, families, and States that rely on  the Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP.   This adjustment, which was introduced by Mr. Costello from  Pennsylvania and Mr. Emmer from Minnesota, will provide the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services with greater flexibility over existing  dollars so that the agencies can ensure that CHIP programs across the  country, including now in my home State of Oregon, can continue to have  vital Federal funding that they need this month to continue CHIP.   This emergency funding will help families and States while Congress  finishes the job of providing funding for children's health insurance,  public health priorities, our community health centers, Medicare  extenders that seniors rely on. All that work needs to get done.   It is important to note, we did not arrive at this place of needing a  stopgap funding resolution because this House failed to act. We acted.  We did our part. We did our part. I am disappointed that the House has  passed CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, which passed this Chamber a couple  months ago with bipartisan support, has yet to be hammered out in the  Senate. Of course, over there they need 60 votes to get anything done.  So a minority of the minority can lock things up, which they have done.   What makes the inaction on CHIP even more frustrating is that the  House-passed bill mirrors the bipartisan policy framework that was  voted out of the Senate Finance Committee under the able leadership of  Chairman Hatch more than 2 months ago. Unfortunately, though, again,  Democrats over there have failed to agree on how to fund these  programs. That is different than what we did.   Here in the House, the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act delivers high- quality healthcare, peace of mind to millions of Americans, providing 5  years of funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which is  one of the longest extensions ever for the program.    Mr. Speaker, it would mean continued access to healthcare  for approximately 9 million children across the country who are  enrolled in CHIP, another 122,700 in Oregon alone.   Our House bill was fully funded. We did the heavy lift. We funded it  through responsible reforms like asking seniors who make $40,000 a  month, that is $480,000 a year, to pay about $135 more for their  Medicare. Rich seniors pay a little more, and I am sure these  grandmothers and grandfathers would do that to help kids afford their  health  [[Page H9738]]  insurance, and that is what happened here.   Mr. Speaker, we paid it. It is ready to go. We need the Senate to  act. I commend the Appropriations Committee and the leadership there  for putting this provision in so we won't let kids fall through the  gap.                                time  1515
