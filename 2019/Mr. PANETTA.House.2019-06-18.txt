 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for this  opportunity.   I rise today in support of the funding in this appropriations bill  for flood and storm damage reduction in economically disadvantaged  areas.   Included in this bill, thank goodness, is $15 million for Army Corps  of Engineers projects in communities that have previously experienced  devastating floods and where the per capita income is less than half of  the State and national averages.   This type of funding, as we can tell, is critical for economically  disadvantaged communities across our country to not only recover from,  but prevent, destructive and deadly floods.   One of these areas is the Pajaro Valley in my district on the central  coast of California, an area where flooding has consistently hit it for  the past 25 years and caused millions of dollars of damage to the  surrounding agriculture crops. But it has also displaced hundreds and  hundreds of residents, many of whom work in those fields.   That is why this bill is very important, because it can provide  important funding for projects that protect the people who need it the  most, for businesses that need it the most, in my community and in  communities all across this country.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this funding bill, and I  thank Chairwoman Kaptur for this time.
