 Mr. Speaker, during my ``Freedom Fridays'' series, each  week I highlight burdensome regulations that limit American freedom.  This week, my focus is on the Obama administration's net neutrality  policy.   The internet is one of the greatest innovations ever. This has  largely been possible because of the Federal Government's regulatory  absence from the industry. Yet the Obama administration, in one of many  cases of overregulation, took a radical step to inappropriately insert  government interference.   In 2015, the FCC adopted a rule to reclassify internet service  providers as ``common carriers'' under title II of the Communications  Act of 1934. This reclassification caused undue burdens for American  ISPs and consumers.   The Trump administration has been supportive of rolling back the  Obama-era regulation. Now Congress needs to limit the authority of  Federal bureaucrats and preserve a free and open internet. We should  repeal the 2015 rule and prevent the FCC from issuing a similar rule.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in restoring  internet freedom.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse), and I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important  issue.   I am an Arizona native. I grew up in southern Arizona, and trips to  the southern Arizona border were not infrequent and not unusual. I have  gone from San Luis to Naco, to Nogales, to Agua Prieta. I have been  along the border many times, most recently just a couple months ago,  and during that time, I used it as kind of a fact-finding expedition. I  wanted to know what people who live right along the border talk about  and think about as we in Congress consider things like a Presidential  promise to build a wall, even in this bill, a partial wall, a good  start.   I will tell you what I know is that the number one drug and human  smuggling corridor in the United States of America is through the  Tucson sector. That is right through the heart of the Arizona-Mexico  border. It impacts, literally, 75 to 80 miles into the border. Where we  have wilderness preserves, our agents can't go in, they don't go in,  and yet roadways are cut in this pristine desert by those who enter  from the cartels, cutting roads with their vehicles that they know that  our agents cannot traverse.   So I am familiar with the area. I am familiar with the issue.   I had the privilege of talking to Border Patrol agents over the last  few years, but in particular the last time I was at the border, and I  talked to a  [[Page H6488]]  number of them. I wondered what the men and women think who actually  service the border for us. I asked them whether they supported a wall.  It was 100 percent, it was unanimous: they want a wall. They want  additional infrastructure. They want a road that parallels that wall so  they can have access to that wall and make the apprehensions that they  need to.   I talked to ranchers and farmers. It was unanimous then as well.  Everyone wanted that wall, all recognizing the need for additional  infrastructure of a roadway.   When you go to various portions of the border now, it is a single  strand of wire. You can step over it. We had one of the ranchers, an  81-year-old gentleman, demonstrate how he crawls underneath the wire at  81 years of age.   Where there are small areas of fencing outside Nogales, either side  from Nogales, that has cut down the number of folks who come that way;  but since that fence only goes about 3 or 4 miles onto each side of the  city, what happens is there is a flood of people who come around that  fence.   A border wall is important. It is imperative. Those of us who feel  the direct brunt of the influx of people who come across the border,  whether for hostile or benign intentions, we feel very strongly that a  border wall would benefit our State.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this initiative, and I can tell  you that my constituency also supports this initiative. With that, I  urge everyone to support this initiative.
