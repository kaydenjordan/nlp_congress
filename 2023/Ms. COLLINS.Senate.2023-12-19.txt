 Mr. President, our colleagues are aware that there is a  group of Senators who are meeting with the administration officials to  try to carefully craft an urgently needed solution to the border  security crisis. I rise today to discuss the urgent need for bipartisan  solutions to address that crisis.   Yesterday set a new record that demonstrates the magnitude of our  border security crisis. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers  encountered a record 12,381 foreign nationals who were entering the  United States along our southwest border without authorization.   So far this fiscal year, we are averaging nearly 8,500 encounters per  day, and, this month, the average is nearly 10,000 per day. That means  that for the month of December, we are likely to reach a record of more  than 300,000 people crossing the southwest border without legal  authorization. At the current rate, we are on pace for more than 3  million encounters in fiscal year 2024, which would shatter the  previous high set last fiscal year.   To put this in perspective, that is more than twice as many  encounters at the southwest border as there are people in the entire  State of Maine, and these enormous numbers do not include what Border  Patrol agents describe as the ``got-aways''--in other words, those who  do not turn themselves in and, instead, elude capture.   These numbers have grown dramatically in the past 3 years. Since  fiscal year 2021, we have seen almost 6.6 million encounters and are on  pace to see nearly 9.7 million individuals by the end of fiscal year  2024. Jeh Johnson, who served as Secretary of Homeland Security under  President Obama, once said that, when he was Secretary, a thousand  migrant encounters a day overwhelms the system. So just think what  10,000 individuals crossing does to the system.   And this problem is not limited to the southwest border, even though  that is where the problem is most acute. We are increasingly seeing  surges of migrant encounters along our northern border, including the  State of Maine. According to Customs and Border Protection, migrant  encounters at the northern border increased 73 percent in fiscal year  2023 over the previous year and a staggering 700 percent over fiscal  year 2021 levels.   In the State of Maine, encounters have increased over 450 percent  since fiscal year 2021. Increasingly, what we are seeing is that  migrants are flying to Canada, knowing that they will have an easier  time crossing the enormous 5,525-mile northern border.   Just recently, the U.S. Border Patrol encountered a group of 20  Romanians illegally crossing into the United States near Houlton, ME,  in northern Maine. Two of these individuals were flagged as  ``transnational criminal organized crime'' matches and detained for  expedited removal proceedings. The remaining 18 were simply released  into the local community.  [[Page S6039]]    Communities in Maine and throughout our country are struggling to  absorb this influx of people who are being released into the interior.  The majority of migrants are released pending an adjudication of their  asylum claims. But that is a process that can take years.   In Portland, ME, a city of 68,000 residents, more than 1,600 asylum  seekers have arrived since January.   Sanford, ME, which has a population of only 22,000, has had  approximately 400 migrants arrive since May. Over the past 6 months,  the city of Sanford has spent $1.3 million to provide food, housing,  and other required assistance to asylum seekers and their families.   Now, the irony here is these asylum seekers are not allowed to go to  work immediately upon filing their asylum applications. I have  introduced a bill that could help lessen the impact on local  communities by helping asylum seekers support themselves, as they want  to do. And employers in Maine want to hire them while they await their  immigration proceedings.   Specifically, my bill would shorten the waiting period for asylum  seekers who come through legal ports of entry to apply for employment  authorization, provided that their applications are not frivolous, that  they are not detained, and that their identities have been verified  with their names run through the Federal Government's Terrorist  Watchlist.   An out-of-control border, which is what we have now, poses a very  real threat to our homeland and our people. This is a national security  challenge for our country.   Since fiscal year 2021, 294 individuals who were apprehended by  Border Patrol at the southwest border were on the Terrorist Watchlist.  That compares to only 11 such individuals in the previous 4 years  combined. And just think how many others are part of the ``got-aways,''  those who did not turn themselves in or were not apprehended by our  Border Patrol.   There are also tens of thousands of migrants arrested at our southern  and northern borders who have criminal convictions or who are wanted by  law enforcement, such as the two Romanians recently encountered in  Maine.   Not only has the failure to control our border led to unchecked  migration, but it has also contributed to the serious illegal drug  crisis that is affecting communities throughout our country.   Mexican drug cartels are using the chaos at the southern border to  facilitate their trafficking operations. They are sending record  amounts of fentanyl into this country, enough to kill every American  many times over.   Maine, like so many States, has seen record increases in recent years  in the number of overdose deaths, nearly 80 percent of which are  fentanyl related. We lost 513 Mainers in the first 10 months of 2023 to  fatal overdoses, and 373 of these deaths were fentanyl related.   In addition, the Mexican cartel used the chaos and the uncontrolled  southern border for human trafficking.   This is a crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis, and it is a national  security crisis. And we cannot allow it to continue.   I have long supported creating legal immigration pathways with  appropriate guardrails. Immigrants contribute to our great country and  our communities in so many important ways. However, it is clear that we  must act to address the ongoing and ever worsening crisis at our  borders, which adversely affects communities throughout our country.   We cannot delay any longer. I am a strong supporter for continuing to  provide assistance to Ukraine to repel Russian aggression. Make no  mistake about it, Putin will not stop with Ukraine. He will go on to  re-create, if he possibly can, his vision of, once again, having the  old Soviet Union. I believe that if he is successful in Ukraine, he  will next seize Moldova. He then will begin to menace and threaten our  NATO allies--the Baltic States, Poland.   So far, we have been able to assist Ukraine without one American  soldier losing his life or her life. We should continue to do so.   We need to help our greatest ally, Israel, in its fight against the  terrorist group Hamas.   These, in many ways, are border disputes as well, but we cannot  ignore the border crisis that we have in our own country. And that is  why we need to work on all of these issues and bring them together in a  supplemental funding bill.   The time to act is now. It is unfortunate that the administration has  been so late to these negotiations, but I still have hope that we can  put together a package that will address all of these crises: the  border crisis in our own country, the border crisis in Ukraine, the  border crisis in Israel with the terrorist attacks from Hamas, and the  coming border crisis that we are going to see, I fear, with China  increasingly threatening Taiwan. All of those issues need to be  addressed in the supplemental. Let's get the job done.                            ____________________
