 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today in opposition  to the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. I am  truly disappointed that my Republican colleagues have chosen to ram  through this partisan nominee in the middle of a pandemic when an  election is underway and tens of millions of Americans have already  cast their ballots.   The Senate should be focused on a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package  to help Granite Staters and Americans  [[Page S6566]]  across this country who are struggling to pay the bills and put food on  the table during this pandemic. Instead, Leader McConnell's only  priority has been to push through a nominee who will fundamentally  alter the balance of the Court and affect the lives of generations of  Americans, all just days before ballots will be counted to decide the  next President of the United States and the makeup of this very body.  The stakes in this nomination could not be higher.   I want to read an excerpt from an email I received from a  constituent. This is from Dave in Portsmouth, NH. Dave writes:         What is at stake with the Supreme Court nomination . . .       among the topics that have stricken the deepest sadness,       pain, and fear in eyes, minds and hearts are the goals of       this administration to dismantle . . . the Affordable Care       Act . . . A woman's right (and only her right) to make       decisions about her body and her life . . . and the rights of       the LGBTQ community.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the full text of this  email to be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Hello Senator Shaheen,        These past months I have looked into the eyes of many of my       friends and family and have seen extreme sadness, pain and       fear. To enumerate the many causes would be redundant . . .       but with express concern is what is at stake with this       Supreme Court nomination. Among the topics that have stricken       the deepest sadness, pain and fear in eyes, minds and hearts       are the goals of this administration to dismantle . . . The       Affordable Care Act . . . A woman's right (and only her       right) to make decisions about her body and her life . . .       and the rights of the LGBTQ community.        Before you cast your vote for this nominee, try to       distinguish between her legal pedigree and her crystal clear       biases for which she has often been on record. Her       evasiveness during questioning before the Judiciary Committee       played perfectly into her chosen role of political pawn of       the Trump administration. This Supreme Court . . . my Supreme       Court . . . your Supreme Court . . . The Supreme Court of the       United States of America must remain untainted from the       rampant political posturing of this 2020 election cycle.        What will be your legacy? In recent days some of the GOP       members of the Senate have . . . through short public       statements . . . been trying to distance themselves from       Donald Trump. With this vote . . . you have the power to       actually do it. To turn away from hypocrisy and years of       blatant lack of integrity. You owe it to America, to       yourself, to your family, to my family . . . to take a moment       to look at the sadness, pain and fear in the eyes of America       today.        And yes . . . I am speaking to you all . . . including some       who have tried to push through this quagmire with an eye       toward how the world and history will judge us all . . .       including you Sen. Romney . . . and yes . . . you Sen. Sasse       . . . and Senators . . . Collins, Murkowski, Gardner,       McSally, Fisher and so on. I am pleading with you . . .       imploring you to do the right and just thing and vote NO on       this confirmation.        You know what is right. You will know it when . . . as I       have . . . you look in the eyes of good and decent Americans       . . . who are desperate for real leadership . . . and you see       the sadness, pain and fear that has been sowed by this       administration and which continues to be sown with this       confirmation process. It has been a rushed, politically       motivated and politically charged Supreme Court nomination       being transacted while the American people are voting RIGHT       NOW to steer the course of this country . . . this Senate       chamber . . . and this country's highest court.        Step up and do what is right.            Thank you,                                                   David J Cummins,                                                    Portsmouth, NH.     The President and his allies here on Capitol Hill are  trying to tear down the healthcare law that has helped provide millions  of Americans with coverage in the middle of the greatest public health  crisis in a century. They pressed forward with this reckless attempt,  even though they don't have a plan for what to do when as many as 23  million Americans--and in New Hampshire, more than 100,000 Granite  Staters--would lose their healthcare coverage.   I want to repeat that.   This administration and congressional Republicans have no plan for  what to do if millions of Americans lose their healthcare coverage if  the Affordable Care Act is overturned.   For the last 6 years, we have seen congressional Republicans try to  repeal the ACA numerous times, and they have failed every time because  the American people have raised their voices and made it clear that  they want to keep the Affordable Care Act and strengthen it, not repeal  it. Now we are seeing the administration and congressional Republicans  try to do in the courts what they were not able to get done in  Congress--to overturn the Affordable Care Act.   We have also seen with Judge Barrett that she has made her feelings  very clear about the ACA. She disagreed with decisions to uphold the  ACA the last two times it went before the Supreme Court, and she  wouldn't answer questions about the healthcare law during her  confirmation hearing.   Striking down the ACA would deal a crushing blow to our most  vulnerable populations during this pandemic. If the Court strikes down  the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, Granite Staters and Americans  across the country will lose access to Medicaid expansion. Medicaid  expansion is a critical source of coverage for millions of Americans  and, in New Hampshire, for thousands of Granite Staters who have lost  their jobs during this pandemic. In fact, since the start of this  pandemic, what we have seen is that enrollment in Medicaid expansion in  New Hampshire has increased by more than 11,000 enrollees as we have  seen job losses mount.   For these individuals and all of the more than 60,000 Granite Staters  who are covered through Medicaid expansion, the loss of the ACA in the  Supreme Court--the Supreme Court's overturning the ACA--would eliminate  a critical lifeline for coverage during this public health crisis. In  New Hampshire, if we lose Medicaid expansion, we will also lose our  most important tool for combating the opioid epidemic.   Without the ACA, we will go back to a time when insurance companies  had sweeping power to undercut coverage. They will be allowed to charge  women higher premiums than men for the same coverage. The health  insurers will be able to remove essential health benefits like  prescription drugs or maternity care. They will also be allowed to jack  up premiums or deny coverage altogether for individuals with  preexisting conditions.   More than 8 million Americans, including nearly 10,000 Granite  Staters, could be denied coverage because they have previously  contracted COVID-19, which could now count as a preexisting condition,  and without the ACA, seniors could, once again, find themselves stuck  in Medicare's doughnut hole for prescription drug coverage at a time  when we are seeing drug prices soar.   In her confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett even refused to say  whether the Medicare Program was constitutional. With Judge Barrett on  the Supreme Court, the health coverage that the ACA, Medicare, and  other Federal programs provide will be under a constant threat.   Sadly, women's reproductive rights are also on the line with Judge  Barrett's nomination. When he ran for President in 2016, Donald Trump  said that he would appoint judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Well,  we are seeing that very clearly with Judge Barrett's record. It shows  that President Trump is trying to do just that--overturn Roe v. Wade.   Amy Coney Barrett's dissenting opinions, while serving on the Seventh  Circuit, show that she is comfortable with laws that make it difficult  or nearly impossible for a woman to exercise her right to make her own  reproductive health decisions. Judge Barrett has even publicly  supported an organization that is opposed to in vitro fertilization,  which is a procedure that has helped millions of American couples start  families.   Almost 50 years of precedent of upholding a woman's right to control  her own body are in jeopardy because the Republicans are playing  politics with the Supreme Court and packing the Court with extreme  Justices.   There are nearly 20 abortion-related cases that are currently one  step away from reaching the Supreme Court. A partisan Court would  likely disregard longstanding precedent in these cases and put a  woman's health and well-being at risk. Let's be very clear: Repealing  Roe v. Wade is not going to reduce the number of abortions. If history  is any indication, what it will do is increase the number of abortions  in the country.   Unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act and women's reproductive  rights are just two of the many areas of American life that a partisan  Supreme Court could dramatically alter.  [[Page S6567]]    Equality for LGBTQ Americans is another major concern. Millions of  gay and lesbian Americans have been married since the Supreme Court  legalized same-sex marriage, but in a recent dissent penned by Justices  Thomas and Alito, these Justices challenged the constitutionality of  that decision and called for it to be revisited. When asked in her  confirmation hearing about the precedent of the Supreme Court decision  to legalize same-sex marriage, Judge Barrett was evasive. So you can  understand the anxiety and fear that same-sex families are experiencing  as they watch the Republican-led Senate rush this nomination.   The stakes are also incredibly high for voting rights, for worker  protections, for commonsense gun laws, and for so many other issues  that are in jeopardy with the appointment of Judge Barrett.   Now, I know the die has been cast. We saw that yesterday with the 51- to-48 cloture vote, but I believe this effort to politicize the Supreme  Court is a decision that those who care about our democratic  institutions will come to regret for many decades to come. If today's  vote is the same as yesterday's--51 to 48--this will be the closest  vote for a Supreme Court Justice in our Nation's entire history. We  should not be doing this today. We should be focusing on what the  American public is most concerned about--help with the coronavirus   I yield the floor.
