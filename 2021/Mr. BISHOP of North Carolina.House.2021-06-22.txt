 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today makes a small but significant  change to the Federal fraud statutes to protect veterans from criminals  who seek to steal their benefits. It does so by inserting a new  provision into the criminal code to complement the mail and wire fraud  statutes.   Unfortunately, there have been reports in recent years of criminals  entering nursing homes in search of elderly veterans with the intent to  defraud them of their Federal benefits.   Like many crimes of fraud, these fraudsters present themselves to  their victims as a helping hand in a time of need. This is a truly  despicable crime worthy of this body's attention.   This legislation has passed this House three times by overwhelming  margins, including a vote of 417-0 last Congress.   Our men and women in uniform have sacrificed much for us. They have  earned our gratitude, our respect, and our protection.   Mr. Speaker, there is little, in my mind, more contemptuous than  someone who tries to defraud a veteran of what they have earned in  defense of our country. We must put an end to this fraud.   I urge all my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2694, the Criminal Judicial  Administration Act of 2021.   This bill strengthens existing laws that provide for the  transportation and subsistence for indigent criminal defendants when  they are brought to court proceedings.   H.R. 2694 also allows a magistrate judge to finally decide post- judgment motions in a misdemeanor case where that magistrate judge was  the judge who handled the underlying case.   This provision will improve the efficiency of our court system by  allowing our courts to manage caseloads in a more economical manner.   I thank the bipartisan sponsors of this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  improve the administration of justice through our court system by  supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2922.   The Elder Abuse Protection Act builds on President Trump's strong  record of protecting America's seniors and responding to elder abuse in  America. In 2017, President Trump signed into law the Elder Abuse  Prevention and Prosecution Act to improve the justice system's response  to victims of elder abuse and exploitation cases.   In 2018, President Trump signed an executive order that established a  task force within the Justice Department that placed a new emphasis on  the growing problems of cyber fraud and fraud targeting the elderly.  Attorney General Barr appointed a National Elder Justice Coordinator to  oversee the Department's work to combat elder fraud.   Because of the Trump administration's work, all 94 U.S. Attorney's  offices now have a prosecutor dedicated to focus on the most pressing  elder justice issues in each jurisdiction.   The Department also established an Elder Justice Initiative to  support and coordinate the Department's enforcement and programmatic  efforts to combat elder abuse, neglect, and financial fraud cases and  scams that target our seniors.   This bill codifies the Trump administration's Elder Justice  Initiative as a program within the Department of Justice. President  Trump and his administration led on protecting American seniors. The  bill before us today will make permanent the thoughtful and successful  initiatives implemented by President Trump and Attorney General Barr.   I am pleased that my colleagues across the aisle recognize the  leadership of President Trump and Attorney General Barr in these  important areas. I thank the sponsor and cosponsor of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 961, the Justice for Juveniles  Act. This bill eliminates some of the administrative hurdles for  juvenile prisoners seeking relief in Federal court.   Juvenile offenders often lack the knowledge to pursue and exhaust all  the complex administrative rules and grievance procedures in  correctional facilities. H.R. 961 will address that problem by  providing juvenile offenders with quicker access to courts when they  feel they are being abused or mistreated.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I take a moment to note my agreement with the  gentlewoman from Texas' point, that the cognition of juveniles is not  fully developed and that they should not be called upon to make  unalterable, lifelong decisions under those circumstances.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3239 introduced by my friend  from Wisconsin, Representative Fitzgerald.   Public Law 111-350, which was signed into law on January 4, 2011,  enacted title 41 of the United States Code by restating existing laws  relating to public contracts. H.R. 3239 makes clarifying and technical  improvements by updating statutory references to title 41. Article I,  Clause 18 of the Constitution tasks Congress with making all laws  necessary and proper for carrying into execution its vested powers.   The clarity of legislation is imperative for the other branches to  implement and the citizen to follow. The Office of the Law Revision  Counsel prepares the titles of the U.S. Code and other technical  updates to the Code by combining enacted laws by the same subject  matter.   H.R. 3239 is a product of that effort. Providing clarity in the  Federal Government public contracting process allows for transparency  and lowers potential barriers to entry, which will give more businesses  the opportunity to compete in the bidding process.   I appreciate the work of OLRC and Representative Fitzgerald on this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3241, introduced by  Representative Bush, which makes technical changes to title 54 of the  United States Code relating to National Park Service and related  programs.   Title 54 was enacted by Public Law 113-287 on December 19, 2014. Laws  to codify titles of the Code do not create new law. They simply restate  the many laws that Congress has already created in a more organized and  readable manner.   After codifying a new title in the Code, often other technical  corrections through the rest of the Code are needed to update cross  references to that new title. This bill does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3241, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 704, the Artistic Recognition  for Talented Students Act, or ARTS Act.   The Constitution authorizes Congress to promote the progress of  science and the useful arts by securing, for limited times, to authors  and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and  discoveries.   Our copyright system is designed to help fulfill that mandate by  promoting the work of authors, musicians, artists, and other creators.  Creative industries contribute hundreds of billion of dollars to the  U.S. economy each year.   This bill makes it easier for some of our brightest, young creators  to obtain copyrights on their award-winning work. Promoting and  encouraging the next generation of American creators ensures that our  creative economy will remain strong for decades to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join in me supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2571, the Advancing Mutual  Interests and Growing Our Success Act, or the AMIGOS Act.   The bill makes nationals of Portugal eligible for E-1 and E-2  nonimmigrant visas, as long as Portugal allows reciprocal visas for  U.S. nationals. E-1 visas are temporary visas available for treaty  traders, and E-2 visas are available for treaty investors.   As stated in the Immigration and Nationality Act, these visas are  available to aliens who are ``entitled to enter the United States under  and in pursuance of the provisions of a treaty of commerce and  navigation between the United States and the foreign state of which the  alien is a national, and their spouse and children solely to either  carry on substantial trade, including trade in services or trade in  technology, principally between the United States and the foreign state  of which the alien is a national, or to develop and direct the  operations of an enterprise in which the alien has invested a  substantial amount of capital.''  [[Page H2983]]    Alien employees of treaty traders and treaty investors may receive  visas if they are coming to the United States ``to engage in duties of  an executive or supervisory character; or, if employed in a lesser  capacity, if they have special qualifications that make the services to  be rendered essential to the efficient operation of the enterprise.''   E-1 and E-2 visa holders may be admitted initially for a period of 2  years, and can apply for extensions in 2-year increments.   The U.S. has entered into treaties of commerce since at least 1815,  when we entered into a Convention to Regulate Commerce with the United  Kingdom. Currently, the nationals of 82 countries are eligible for E-1  and/or E-2 visa status.                                time  1645    During fiscal year 2020, almost 26,800 E-1 and E-2 visas were issued,  down because of the pandemic from roughly 50,000 during fiscal year  2019.   While the AMIGOS Act passed the House last Congress, the version we  are considering today is somewhat different. The updated text includes  language, added at the request of Senator Lee from Utah, aimed at  preventing abuse of the E visa program whereby an individual  essentially purchases citizenship in a U.S. trade treaty country simply  to be eligible to get a U.S. E visa. Specifically, the language  requires that an alien be domiciled in the U.S. trade treaty country  for at least 3 years before the individual can apply for an E visa.   I thank Senator Lee for his commitment to ensuring the integrity of  our visa programs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 1340 will improve judicial economy by redefining the  judicial districts of my home State of North Carolina.   Fort Bragg, which is located in North Carolina, is one of the U.S.  Army's largest military installations. It spans six counties and is  approximately 250 square miles large. Fort Bragg is located in two  judicial districts, the middle district and the eastern district of  North Carolina. This has led to inconvenience for both defendants and  the courts system.   S. 1340 redefines the judicial districts so that Fort Bragg and a  sub-installation, Camp Mackall, are located in a single judicial  district, the eastern district. This change will streamline and improve  judicial administration and efficiency.   I want to thank Senator Tillis and Senator Burr for their work on  this bill. I also want to thank the former member from North Carolina,  Mr. Holding. And I also want to thank my law school classmate,  Representative Ross, for sponsoring and the rest of the North Carolina  delegation for joining me in cosponsoring the House companion, H.R.  2746.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is sensible and  prudent to the administration of justice in my home State.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2679, the Foundation of the  Federal Bar Association Charter Amendments Act of 2021.   The Federal Bar Association was founded in 1920 as a nonprofit  organization seeking to strengthen the Federal legal system and  administration of justice. In 1954, Congress chartered the Federal Bar  Association as a congressionally chartered organization under title 36  of the United States Code.                                time  1700    The FBA serves the Federal legal community and public by promoting  standards of professional competence and ethical conduct, providing  educational programs, and facilitating the administration of justice.   The FBA is also committed to bringing civics education programs to  classrooms across the country. As a congressionally chartered  organization, it takes an act of Congress to make changes to the FBA's  charter. The FBA has not amended or updated its charter since 1954.   H.R. 2679 amends the FBA's current charter to allow the organization  to choose the location of its principal office, restrict its officers  from engaging in political activity, and change its charter language to  conform with language used in other congressional charters. In  addition, this legislation will allow the FBA to make simple changes to  its bylaws without an act of Congress.   I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Chabot from Ohio, for his diligent  work on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting  this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
