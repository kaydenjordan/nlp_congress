 Madam President, 2 days ago, I visited the community of  Sutherland Springs, TX, which is a small, rural community about 35  miles from San Antonio, TX. We all remember the terrible shooting that  occurred there just over a week ago at the First Baptist Church, an  event that those in Sutherland Springs and across Texas and maybe even  across the Nation will never forget. I hope we never forget it because  I believe that those events were, by and large, preventable, and I will  explain more about that in a moment.   What I saw during my visit and what I found to be so remarkable is  that the community has already started the healing process. Already,  the church building that was riddled with bullets and the bodies of  people who were killed and injured has been turned into a memorial  which will forever mark the terrible events of that day and honor the  lives of those who lost their lives.   After an excruciating trial that the rest of us cannot even begin to  comprehend, the attitude in Sutherland Springs is incredibly hopeful  and resilient. First Baptist held its Sunday service just 7 days after  the congregation lost 26 of its members. Can you imagine that--just a  week later, showing up for another church service a week after a gunman  shot up the church, killing 26 people and injuring 20 more.   I went there for no other purpose than to lend a shoulder to the  mourning and to try to offer what little encouragement I could.  Strangely, what happened is that the reverse occurred: They gave me  more hope and inspiration than I ever could have imagined. This shows  how the shooter's ultimate plan failed. Evil never triumphs.   Just ask Pastor Mark Collins, who pointed out that the First Baptist  Church has been open for nearly 100 years but that on Sunday, the  congregation smashed its alltime attendance record.   Ask Pastor Frank Pomeroy, who lost his 14-year-old daughter in the  attack but was already back doing the Lord's work of consoling other  members of his church when he himself lost his own 14-year-old  daughter. Pastor Pomeroy said: ``We have the freedom to choose, and  rather than choose darkness, like the young man did that day, we choose  the light.'' He said: ``Love never fails.''   It was an emotional service, to be sure. It was an honor and, as I  said, an inspiration to join the Sunday worship service and to visit  the church that has been transformed into that stunningly beautiful  memorial to commemorate the victims.   The day before, I had had a chance to visit with a number of  victims--and their family members--who are recovering in local area  hospitals. We cannot forget them as they continue to heal or forget the  rest of the 20 who were wounded by the gunman that day--a man who was  clearly deranged, was a convicted felon, someone who had been  hospitalized for mental illness and had escaped, and someone who had  been found guilty of domestic violence against his wife, including the  fracturing of his infant stepson's skull.   We now know that when it comes to the shooter, there were plenty of  warning signs. The gunman's former colleague has said that he was  always on  [[Page S7196]]  edge and that he scared her both while he was in the Air Force and  through disturbing social media posts afterward. There were multiple  red flags along the way--school suspensions, threats of killing his  superiors, depression, the abuse of animals, choking his wife, as I  said, fracturing his stepson's skull, and doing time in a military  prison. One thing is abundantly clear: We can do more when it comes to  spotting these flags, including in the military.   Where the law currently provides that an individual who is convicted  of a felony or convicted of domestic violence or somebody who has been  found to be mentally ill by a court--we can make sure and do better to  make sure that those individuals do not purchase a firearm. Current law  disqualifies them, but unless the results are uploaded on the FBI's  background check system, there is no way to catch them when they lie.  They are asked when they purchase a firearm at a firearms dealer: Have  you ever been convicted of a felony? Have you ever been convicted of  domestic violence? Have you ever been committed for mental illness? If  they lie and the background check system is simply silent, then there  is no way to know and no way to stop them, and that is what happened to  this shooter.   We know now that the Air Force and the other branches of the military  are considering what additional steps to take to make sure this never  happens again. I appreciate their prompt response, but it should never  have come down to this.   Now we have to do our part to ensure that this sort of preventable  disaster never happens again. Don't get me wrong--I don't believe we  can somehow wave a magic wand or pass a law that will prevent manmade  disasters in every instance in the future, but this one could have been  prevented. We could have kept this shooter from buying a firearm  through a legal firearms dealer. If the background check system had  been accurate, he would not have been able to do so.   Today, I plan to introduce legislation to ensure that Federal  agencies report and upload criminal records onto the background check  system--records that are already required to be so but often that are  not. As we know, this was a major problem that led to the rampage in  Sutherland Springs. My bill would also reauthorize the two primary  grant programs that help the States report and upload their own records  and incentivize States to improve overall compliance.   We know that just down the road in Virginia a few years ago, the  records of a young man who had been adjudicated as mentally ill by the  State of Virginia had never been uploaded into the background check  system. Like this shooter in Sutherland Springs, when he went to  purchase a firearm, there was never a hit on the FBI's background check  system, and he simply lied about his mental health record.   It has been estimated that some 7 million records--including at least  25 percent of felony convictions and a large number of convictions for  misdemeanor domestic violence--have not been posted on the background  check system. That is outrageous. I doubt that any of us knew this  beforehand, but we know it now, and it is within our power to fix it.  We can all agree that this has to change and that this cannot stand.   Let me be clear. I think that law-abiding gun owners, under the  Second Amendment, can and should be allowed to purchase and possess  firearms. As somebody who enjoys hunting and sports and shooting, I  believe that every law-abiding American should possess the same right  that I have to purchase firearms for recreation, for hunting, or for  defending our families or property. In fact, that is what happened in  Sutherland Springs. Sutherland Springs proves why guns can save lives  when in the hands of law-abiding citizens. But if you have a long,  documented history of dangerous behavior, if you are convicted of  committing violent acts, under the law, you are not allowed to have  guns. Today, we have to ensure that those laws will be enforced, and my  bill will help to do that.   This is really an incredible story. When I went to Sutherland  Springs, I learned more about Stephen Willeford, whom I have spoken  about before. Stephen Willeford lived about a block from the First  Baptist Church, and he heard the shooting. I think it was his daughter  who alerted him to it. He got his AR-15 out of the gun safe in his  home, and he ran about a block away while barefoot. He saw the shooter  exit the church. He, in turn, decided that it was up to him because  there was not anybody else to stop him.   Mr. Willeford, fortunately, is an NRA-certified shooting instructor  and an expert marksman, and he shot and wounded the person who  committed this mass atrocity, who then dropped his firearm, got in a  truck, and led him on a high-speed chase. Thanks to Mr. Willeford and  another Good Samaritan, they chased that shooter until ultimately the  shooter took his own life. That shows you what can happen when law- abiding citizens--gun owners--can come to the aid of others. When the  police are not present and there is nobody else around, Good Samaritans  can help save lives.    Mr. President, I have one request for a committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:           Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs    The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is  authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Tuesday,  November 14, 2017, to conduct hearing on the nomination of Kirsten M.  Nielsen, to be Secretary of U.S. Department of Homeland Security.                            ____________________
