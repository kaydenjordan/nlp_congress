 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and commend the  Pinole Valley High School Spartans football team upon winning the 2022  Division 7 California State championship. This outstanding achievement  marks the first high school State football title secured by the West  Contra Costa Unified School District.   This accomplishment would not have been possible without the tireless  dedication of Pinole Valley players, coaches, parents, students, and  educators. The Spartans' unwavering commitment to their craft and their  remarkable teamwork represent the very best of our students, athletes,  and schools.   This championship title demonstrates both the talent of the Spartans  football team and their discipline. They exemplified the character,  steadfastness, and capability that is cultivated at Pinole Valley High  School.   On behalf of the constituents of California's Eighth Congressional  District, I congratulate the Pinole Valley High School Spartans  football team for achieving this championship title and reassert my  continued support and pride for all of our student athletes.                            ____________________
