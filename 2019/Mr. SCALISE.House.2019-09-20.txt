 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for going through the  schedule.   I know the gentleman joins me in extending our sincere condolences to  our friend, my counterpart as the majority whip of the House,  Jim  Clyburn, on the loss of his wife, Emily. They were married for 58  years, and were a wonderful family.                                time  1115    I know she had been battling for awhile and she is in a better place,  but for our friend, I know it is a tough time.   I got to know his daughter Mignon, who served on the FCC for a number  of years during the Obama administration, and she definitely learned  from her mom and dad, just a wonderful person.   So, I am sure my friend would join me to extend our sincere  condolences and our heartfelt prayers to our friend  Jim Clyburn and  his whole family during this difficult time with the loss of his wife.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, our hearts will be with him during that  ceremony and service, and we will all be there for him to lean on us  during these next months. At times it is going to be difficult, but we  appreciate the fact that he is going to continue to be with us, but  probably be leaning on us even more.   A wonderful, wonderful family.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to shift gears and ask the gentleman about  the USMCA trade deal. I know there have been some more negotiations  with Ambassador Lighthizer, and just last week, he had sent a letter in  response to some of the issues that were raised by the Speaker and her  team that is working on USMCA. I know he worked in those weeks after  the initial requests were made to try to see how each of those can be  addressed, hopefully in a way that allows us to move forward with an  actual vote on the House floor on USMCA.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to inquire if the gentleman has any  timetable or update on where we are in those talks.  [[Page H7854]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I would just encourage those talks to move  as quickly as they can, because as we share the interest of making sure  that not only do we have better agreements, which this USMCA deal that  was negotiated with Mexico and Canada does have better provisions for  the United States, we need to make sure that there is proper  enforcement, because if somebody doesn't follow through, then we need  to make sure we can hold them accountable.   While I am confident that there are already enforcement provisions in  the agreement, if they can be made stronger, I know Ambassador  Lighthizer is working to find a way to do that, but also in a way that  doesn't start the whole process over, where we don't have to open the  entire agreement up and then Mexico, which has already ratified it,  would have to go back. Canada stands waiting to move on it as well, but  right now, we are the holdup.    There are a lot of jobs at stake, over 160,000 jobs. Our farmers are  counting on this. So many other manufacturing sectors in our economy  are counting on this.   So, hopefully, we can move quickly to work through these and then  ultimately get it passed and move to the next countries that want to  enter into agreements with the United States, and ultimately to  confront China, to resolve the differences that we are having with  China.   But I know the gentleman is working on his side. And, again, I would  just encourage that we do that as quickly as possible and expedite it  and then get it passed, but we will continue working on that.   Something else we would like to work on in a more bipartisan way is  drug pricing.   The President has been very clear that he wants a bipartisan bill  that is worked out here in Congress to lower drug prices. There have  been many efforts made and, in fact, positive steps taken by the Energy  and Commerce Committee to pass a package of bills out of committee  unanimously to lower drug prices.   Unfortunately, the Speaker took a different turn and, yesterday, had  a press conference and then ultimately filed a bill last night, H.R. 3,  which was written in secret. Many Democrats don't even know what is in  it.   But no Republicans were consulted and involved in the process, and it  ended up becoming a very partisan bill, much to the socialist left,  which wouldn't solve the problem and, more importantly, wouldn't get to  the President's desk because it is not an effort that involved any  bipartisan cooperation.   Again, I point out there was a package of bills that passed  unanimously out of Energy and Commerce that would lower drug prices.  Both parties agreed. Every single member on the Energy and Commerce  Committee agreed. Unfortunately, that was shelved in lieu of this  partisan approach.   I would hope that we take it more seriously than that and actually  work together to get a bill that the President can sign to lower drug  prices as quickly as possible. The approach that was taken yesterday  does not answer this call, and I would hope we would do better.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, there are a number of items to address  there.   First, clearly, there is kind of a recoil that seems to happen by Mr.  Hoyer and a number of others on the other side when the term  ``socialism'' is used to identify the policies that are being--    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    First of all, I haven't seen the ad the gentleman is  referring to. But if he wants to start going through ads and he wants  me to send him some ads where people on his side lie about positions  that Members on our side have taken, I will be happy to give him a  litany of false ads, misleading ads, then we can go back and forth on  that.   But if he is trying to hide from the term ``socialism'' when he  promotes socialist policies, we can have a debate about what socialism  is. It is an ideology, it is not a word that is thrown around, and it  involves government control of your life.   So when you move bills like the Green New Deal or when you see a  Presidential candidate on your side running around saying he is going  to go to people's houses and take their guns--that is a candidate for  President of the United States on your side--those are socialist  policies. If the gentleman doesn't want the term applied, then don't  promote that ideology, don't embrace that ideology, reject the  ideology. But he won't.   You want to try to play it both ways. You want to try to act like you  are going to impeach the President, but say you are not going to  impeach the President. You want to promote the Green New Deal, but you  don't want to bring it to the floor, so your Members don't have to be  exposed to the vote.   But, ultimately, as long as the gentleman is going to embrace and  allow socialist ideas to come forward, people are going to call it for  what it is. And if the gentleman doesn't agree with socialism, then  just stop embracing the ideology and the actual policies.   So when the gentleman talks about a bill where the President said-- and he read it and I will read it again--let's get it done in a  bipartisan way; the bill that was filed by Speaker Pelosi yesterday was  not a bipartisan bill, it was a hyperpartisan bill. So we are talking  about the House bill. The Senate bill is still a work in progress. And  we all know how the Senate works. Maybe they produce a bill and maybe  they don't, but it is not a final product.   The bill that was filed on your side, yesterday, is a bill that most  of your own Members haven't even seen, because it was written in secret  only from a very far left approach. When Speaker Pelosi, yesterday, was  asked if she is willing to negotiate a bill that doesn't allow the  government to negotiate prices, she said, ``no, absolutely, positively  no,'' so she is not even willing to negotiate.   That is not bipartisan. That is not an approach that is going to get  a bill signed into law to lower drug prices. You want to lower drug  prices. We worked together.   By the way, Ranking Member Walden was not even consulted, but Ranking  Member Walden worked with Chairman Pallone to bring bills out of Energy  and Commerce, for example, to stop a process that currently is legal  that allows drug companies, right before the patent expires, when the  drug is about to become available for generics, companies, of course,  go and make the generic drug. And, right now, the process of the FDA is  for a period of time, usually a rolling 6 months, one company is given  the exclusive rights to provide the generic for a period of time.  Ultimately, other companies are allowed in. But for the first period of  months and months, it could be years, only one company has the  exclusive right to do the generic. And the drug companies are allowed  to pay the generic company not to sell the product. So you only have  the original drug. You don't have the generic available because the  companies can pay the company not to make the generic.   We have a bill called No Pay for Delay. We make it illegal for the  drug companies to pay the generics not to make generics. That will  lower drug prices.   We also improve the process where you can get the drugs to the  generic companies earlier so they can make the product. For the  companies to actually make a generic, you have to have available the  details of what is in the drug so you can make the generic. And, a lot  of times, the companies don't give that information to the generic  company, so it is harder to get generics, which are lower prices.   It is not the government coming in saying, if you think you know what  a drug price should cost, or any product should cost, good luck out  there in the marketplace. But if you want to stifle innovation, if you  want to stifle the ability to actually go and invest and have companies  come up with lifesaving drugs, it costs billions of dollars. If you  want to lower drug prices, work with us to reform the FDA process so  that it doesn't take 10 years and $5 billion to develop a drug.   There are real things that can be done in a bipartisan way to address  that, and yet the gentleman's party won't do that. They want to sit in  a room and come up with a bill that nobody else has seen, that no  Republicans were allowed to be a part of, that is not going to become  law. So there is a way to lower drug prices.   And, again, there was a package of bills passed out of Energy and  Commerce, every single Member, Republican and Democrat, voted for it.  That is the path right there to get something done and you shelved the  bills. You threw poison pills on the bill, so they won't become law.   Why not work with people who have the expertise and come to an  agreement? That bill could be signed by the President today. People  could be paying lower prices for drugs today, but you won't bring that  bill to the floor. Why not bring that package of bills to the floor?   If you want to come up with other ideas to lower drug prices in other  ways, great, let's work on that, too. But, at a minimum, bring the  bills that already came out of committee unanimously, that absolutely  everybody agrees, Republican and Democrat, will lower drug prices, and  you refuse to bring that bill to the floor, that package. Why not do  that?   Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman consider bringing that package of  bills that was unanimous out of committee to lower drug prices? Every  Republican and every Democrat agreed on the committee of jurisdiction  that these things will lower drug prices, and we can't get a vote on  that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I hope the gentleman is not going to try to  use the VA as the standard of care that every American should get. We  saw the scandals at the VA, veterans dying waiting to get care.   We actually passed legislation this Congress that got signed into law  last Congress to allow veterans to go to another hospital that can  actually treat them if the VA is not doing the job. And I know a number  of people in the gentleman's party oppose that, but our veterans  appreciated it. While you might be able to get good care at some VA  hospitals, there were--and the scandals, you have seen the ads, those  aren't false ads--veterans literally dying waiting to get into VA  hospitals, and the VA was telling us there was no secret list when, in  fact, there were secret lists that were not allowing these veterans to  get proper care.   So the VA CHOICE Act was passed specifically to address that problem  and, ultimately, allow our veterans to be able to go to another  hospital if the VA isn't properly taking care of them. Our veterans  deserve the best care. If a VA hospital can't provide it, then someone  else should, and, in fact, now other hospitals are. Our veterans have  asked for that and now have that ability.   But if the gentleman wants to talk about bipartisanship, again, I go  back to the bills that passed out of committee unanimously. When those  bills came to the floor, they were changed to make them partisan. And  if he thinks 5 Republicans out of 197 is bipartisan, I think he needs  to go and look back at what, ultimately, is going to allow a bill to  become law. To become law, it is going to have to have a lot more  support than that, which means the games have to stop being played. The  poison pills can't be put in a bill and then expect that to become law.  You can pass it out of the House, and it will never become law.    So the ultimate goal, I would hope, would be for us to come together  to get a bill to the President's desk. The bills that came out of  committee unanimously could have absolutely gotten to the President's  desk and would be lowering drug prices. Once you start adding things to  them--maybe you get a few Republicans here and there--but ultimately  you took an unanimous bill and made it a partisan bill and it is not  going anywhere.   So there is a path, if you want to get it back on track, to get a  bill to the President's desk. You can make statement, or you can make  law, and I would hope we do both. I hope we actually work together to  make something come together that not just can pass the House and  barely get it across the finish line, but where we can get overwhelming  support. The ability is there.   And those bills, by the way, took years to come together, just like  the 21st Century Cures Act, a bill that took a long time to put  together when we were in the majority, but, ultimately, got to the desk  of Barack Obama, and he signed it. It is great law. It is something  that, ultimately, is going to help us cure major diseases, and we came  together to get that done. It is law. It wasn't just a bill that we  passed out of the House in a partisan way. We worked with Democrats and  we got it done. It is on the books now.   So I would hope, if we are looking at models to use, that we look at  the models of those bills that have actually made it all the way  through the process where we worked with people on both sides and  solved real problems. That should be the objective. Not to make a  statement and just work with a few people here and there when you have  a roadmap for something that can be overwhelmingly passed out of this  House and then get to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.                                time  1145     Mr. Speaker, I ask the gentleman: What was the question?  I yield to the gentleman.    Well, clearly, as the gentleman talks about the Grassley  bill that is moving through the Senate, let them do their work. Let  them find a way to come together with their 60-vote rule and produce a  bipartisan bill. I encourage them to do that. They haven't yet, but I  encourage them to do that.   When the gentleman talks about the ACA, let's be clear, because the  vast majority of people on the gentleman's side now--especially in the  Presidential campaign, the Democratic candidates for President--are not  talking about the ACA anymore. They are talking about what is referred  to as Medicare for All.   I will yield in a moment, but if the gentleman read the bill,  Medicare for All, number one, it gets rid of the private insurance  marketplace. Over 180 million people lose that healthcare. Then, if you  look at Medicare Advantage, an incredibly popular and successful part  of Medicare is gone. It goes away.   So 200 million people lose what they have now that they like, and  everybody is placed in Medicare, which, as we all know, pays below- market rates. Most rural hospitals said they will close. If that bill  passes, they can't even operate. They will close because they can't  continue to run and make any kind of profit. They lose money, and they  ultimately close down. They have said it.   People know, people understand, how the healthcare marketplace works.  Know that if you get rid of the private insurance market, that is what  is paying for Medicare and Medicaid today.   Medicare for All, which, again, is the catchphrase that is being used  by every Presidential candidate on the gentleman's side, and maybe they  all want to have their own version of it, is a far different place than  even the ACA.   We can continue and will continue to have a debate about the best way  to fix our broken healthcare system, and focus on lowering prices and  protecting people with preexisting conditions, but in a way that you  can actually let people choose their own plans and buy whatever they  want from wherever they want it.   That is how people get all other products. Healthcare, for various  reasons, doesn't work that way. But, clearly, on the drug-pricing side,  there have been a lot of good ideas that came together that would be  proven to lower drug prices.   If we want to get into the high cost, which I agree is a problem,  let's look at the fundamental reasons why it costs billions of dollars,  instead of maybe hundreds of millions of dollars, to create a new  lifesaving drug.   There are reasons that the cost is so high to bring a drug to market.  Thank goodness there are companies that are out there that are willing  to invest billions of dollars. Sometimes they don't succeed, by the  way, and they have to eat that cost. But if they do succeed in finding  a new drug that will save lives, it typically costs billions of dollars  and years and years of bureaucratic red tape and other processes that  they have to go through to finally bring that drug to market.   That is where we should focus our energies, on compressing that  process so it can happen quicker, addressing other problems within the  way that a drug comes to market so that it doesn't cost billions of  dollars, and we can have more lifesaving drugs at lower costs.   If we are going to ignore that side of the equation and say: Here, we  are just going to set the price without addressing the fundamental  problems that are leading to such high costs, then all that is going to  happen is that nobody is going to make the investment to go find the  next lifesaving drug.    You will never know what could have happened. We see every day there  are amazing breakthroughs in medical technology, and we want to  continue encouraging that.   Something like the 21st Century Cures Act actually achieves it.  Again, we came together to put that bill into law to now allow for  lifesaving drugs, especially in areas like cancer, Alzheimer's, and  ALS. We are going to get real big breakthroughs. There are already some  big breakthroughs because of that.   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I know we will have more debates next week  over the limited number of items coming to the floor. Hopefully, some  of these other items can get addressed in a bipartisan way, but I know  there are other battles ahead, and we will do our part to try to come  together to address these problems.   If the gentleman has nothing else, then I yield back the balance of  my time.                            ____________________
