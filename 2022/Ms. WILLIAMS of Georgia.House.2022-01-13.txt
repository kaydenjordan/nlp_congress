 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to share the words  of my constituent, Yolanda Renee King, that I received this morning:   ``I am 13 years old and the only grandchild of Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King. When I was just 5 years old, in  2013, the Supreme Court undid the Voting Rights Act that my  grandparents and so many in their generation fought and died for.   ``When I was 12, in 2021, the Supreme Court further weakened the law  until there was almost nothing left.   ``States like my home State of Georgia were ready and waiting. They  immediately passed laws that make it harder for people to vote, make it  impossible to protect elections, and even criminalize the act of  passing out food and water to people who wait in long lines.   ``That means I and my peers have fewer rights today than we had the  day we were born. I can only imagine what my grandparents would say  about that. We must pass Federal voting rights legislation now to  ensure democracy for all Americans. We cannot wait.''    Madam Speaker, I rise to announce it is  finally infrastructure year for Georgia's Fifth Congressional District.   I have seen firsthand how the infrastructure bill will transform the  entire Fifth Congressional District in Georgia. To share just a few  projects: We are going to repair crumbling bridges in the city of South  Fulton; extend the Peachtree Creek Greenway in Brookhaven; make Forest  Park a more pedestrian-friendly city; and maintain Hartsfield-Jackson's  title as the world's busiest airport. We are delivering for the people.   I am especially proud that the infrastructure bill includes the  Reconnecting Neighborhoods Program, based on legislation that I wrote.  This program will reconnect neighborhoods like the Sweet Auburn  district that was intentionally divided by the construction of Federal  interstates.   This is a matter of racial justice because far too often, it was  Black neighborhoods that were divided. I have met with community  leaders to hear what they need from the program, and I will continue to  be their voice in Washington as they build back better.    And I almost forgot. While we are making these decades-overdue  investments in infrastructure, we are going to also create millions of  good-paying, union jobs. Democrats have delivered for the Fifth  District and our country, and we are not done yet.                            ____________________
