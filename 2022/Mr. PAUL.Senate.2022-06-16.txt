 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, for a year  and a half, we have been offering my colleague a compromise in the  passage of this bill. We could pass this bill today, immediately. All  we have been asking is that it not only protect Federal judges but  protect Members of Congress as well. I haven't heard a cogent or even  any argument for why it couldn't.   It is a very simple compromise. To pass things unanimously takes  compromise. It takes people coming together and people agreeing. But  there hasn't been any movement; there hasn't been any compromise; and I  am still open. We can pass this today to include Members of Congress.   If recent years have taught us anything, it is that members of the  legislative branch need protection as well as those in the judiciary.  That was clear in 2011 when Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was tragically  shot while she was doing the most important part of her job--meeting  with constituents. Words cannot express how happy and inspired I was to  see that Congresswoman Giffords was in the Chamber with her husband,  Senator Kelly, when he was sworn in as a Member of this body. Well,  words also cannot express the pain felt by the families of the people  who were killed that day and wounded. That should have been a wake-up  call to protect Members of Congress and, in doing so, to better protect  the people around them.   Yet, just a few years later, a shooter nearly killed Congressman    Steve Scalise during a practice for the charity baseball game. I was  there. A young man was shot 10 feet from me. I said at the time that  our lives were saved by the Capitol Police. Had they not been there,  things could have been much worse.   Extending the provisions of this bill to Members of Congress would  better protect us and our families and our constituents. I have been  offering this for 2 years. My amendment, which I will offer through  unanimous consent, simply extends the same protections that it would  offer to the judicial branch to the legislative branch.   This is not a new request. In December of 2020, when we discussed  this bill on the floor, I offered this compromise. I said I would work  together with the other side to try to get a bill that we could pass.  But we haven't gotten anywhere. If we want this to pass, let's  compromise. Let's come together and figure out a way that we can get  this to pass.   I know of no argument or no constituency that is coming to  Washington, saying: We don't want Members of Congress to be protected.  There is no such constituency. There is no such argument, and there is  no reason we couldn't pass this today. It has been almost 2 years.  Let's pass this bill today. As I have said over and over again, I  support this bill and the provisions, and I don't believe it ought to  be blocked merely because Members of Congress also need protection.   With that being said, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify  his request to include my amendment to the Menendez substitute  amendment, which is at the desk; that the amendments be considered and  agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time  and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, we have  been trying for a year and a half. Our staff has offered to meet with  the opposition's staffs. We have not had one meeting. They have not  accepted a meeting much less a compromise--a year and a half.   This could pass today by simply accepting this. There is a promise to  do it at a later date when we have waited a year and a half? A year and  a half went by because no one would meet with us. We have not had one  meeting. We have offered to meet with the staffs of both of the authors  of this, and we have not been granted a meeting. There has been no  discussion of this between staff and no discussion of a compromise.   We would take a compromise. I don't understand. There has been no  argument made today as to why Congress couldn't be added to this bill.  They could have added this to the bill or talked to us over a year and  a half. No one has talked to us. Other than to come for the public  theater, no one has tried to get this thing passed.   I object.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Beans Cafe and Bakery of Dry Ridge, KY, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   The road to entrepreneurial success is rarely a straight and narrow  path, as Richard Hayhoe and his wife could tell you. The couple moved  to northern Kentucky from Canada in 2010, intent on flipping houses for  a living. However, their dream of entering the housing market did not  turn out as imagined and in 2011, opportunity presented itself. As  Richard looked around his adopted hometown, he saw a struggling  doughnut shop with a big ``For Sale'' sign posted, and decided to act.  Thus, Richard Hayhoe's Beans Cafe and Bakery was born.   Opened in late 2011, Beans Cafe and Bakery offers some of the finest  confections available in Kentucky. Between fresh donuts, muffins, and a  variety of other pastries, customers are not left wanting, as his store  provides just about any morning pick-me-up one could hope for. In  addition to keeping their ovens busy, Beans Cafe of course keeps their  coffee pots full so that their regular customers can enjoy a fresh cup  on their morning commute. Despite their name, Beans Cafe and Bakery is  not just a popular breakfast site; it is a one-stop shop for any meal:  breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. Beans Cafe boasts a delicious  menu of sandwiches on their signature bread, wraps, soups, and salads.  Beans Cafe and Bakery also has plenty of options for dessert, including  ice cream and hand-spun milkshakes perfect for a warm summer evening  spent with family and friends.   Soon after Beans Cafe and Bakery opened their doors, residents of Dry  Ridge came in droves. Oftentimes, Richard found their reputation  preceded them, as local hotel and bed-and-breakfast owners insisted  their travelers make time for Beans Cafe. When the Ark Encounter  exhibit opened nearby in 2016, that new flood of visitors helped to  propel an already growing business into a new phase of expansion,  moving to a different location right off the highway. Beans Cafe and  Bakery has only continued to grow since then, even opening up a  separate kitchen space in order to meet the ever-growing demand for  their delicious baked goods.   In addition to their excellence in the kitchen, Richard Hayhoe has  made Beans Cafe and Bakery a place for community involvement, hosting a  monthly get-together for Christians wanting to engage in the realm of  public policy and local government. Beans Cafe and Bakery also offers  classes for junior bakers, providing a fun and educational atmosphere  for young children to learn about the baking craft.   When Richard Hayhoe came to Kentucky, he ventured south from his  native land to pursue a career that he soon realized was not all that  it was chalked up to be. Instead of giving up on Dry Ridge or Kentucky  entirely, he stayed and made his home by opening a business that caters  to its residents. Richard Hayhoe is the embodiment of the type of  perseverance inherent to small business owners. That is why Beans Cafe  and Bakery has seen such success; it is led by a dedicated and hard- working team who know how to treat their customers right.  Congratulations to Richard and the entire team at Beans Cafe and  Bakery. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in  Kentucky.                            ____________________
