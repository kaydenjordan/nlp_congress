 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The President's reckless behavior unnecessarily escalated an already  simmering conflict with Iran. The assassination of General Qasem  Soleimani, without consulting Congress, led us to the brink of war.   While we have taken a step back from the ledge, the President's  actions had severe and fatal consequences. Fifty of our brave  servicemembers suffered traumatic brain injuries, and 176 innocent  civilians on a commercial airline were tragically killed by retaliatory  missile strikes.   Now is the time to reduce tensions and engage in good faith  diplomacy. The American people have made it clear that we do not want a  war with Iran.   It is long past time for Congress to reclaim its constitutional  authority over the power to wage war. I urge my colleagues to do this  by passing the No War Against Iran Act.
