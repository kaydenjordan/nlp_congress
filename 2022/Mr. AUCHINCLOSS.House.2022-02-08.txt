 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career  of Tom Brady.   As the Congressman for Foxborough, Massachusetts, I represent the  home of the New England Patriots. For 20 of his 22 seasons in the  National Football League, Mr. Brady was a Patriot. He brought pride and  six Super Bowl victories to my district and to the fans of New England.   Mr. Brady embodies excellence. He is the greatest football player of  all time, and his final MVP-worthy season is an indication that he was  still getting better when he retired.   He won 35 playoff games throughout his career. That is more than  double the second-place quarterback. Even down by 25 points with little  more than 15 minutes on the clock in the biggest game, he never gave up  on his team.   Indeed, teamwork was Tom Brady's top talent. He elevated others  through his team-first ethic and his competitive drive. From the sixth  round to seven Super Bowls, the GOAT was always focused on the team,  not himself.   On behalf of two decades of Foxboro Faithful, I thank Tom Brady for  the memories.                            ____________________
