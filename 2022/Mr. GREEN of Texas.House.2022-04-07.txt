 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. And still I rise  to be grateful to the Honorable Nydia Velazquez and Earl Blumenauer for  what they have done to bring this bill to the floor.   And still I rise for this job protections bill. This bill will not  only protect jobs for restaurants; it also protects jobs in the $1  trillion supply chain. It will protect jobs for those distributors to  restaurants. It will protect the jobs for those who transport to the  distributors. It protects jobs for the farmers who produce the produce  that we have in the restaurants.   There is a right time for all things. This is the right time. This is  the right place. We are the right people to do the right thing and  protect small businesses and, more importantly, protect the jobs that  fuel America, the engines of opportunity.
