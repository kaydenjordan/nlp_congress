 Madam Speaker, I stand before you as a Representative of  New Mexico, a place where we believe in dignity and respect for all. In  Congress, I have been fighting for them. We have been working to make  healthcare more affordable, education accessible, and move our country  forward for the people.   But today, this President has forced us into a serious debate. We are  talking about a President who used the power of the Presidency for his  own political gain, risking our national security, and putting the  integrity of the next election at risk.   It is a sad day when a President shows complete disrespect for  Congress as a coequal branch of government and for the American people  who elected us.   We collected the evidence, and the facts are indisputable. We all  took an oath to protect and defend our Constitution. We have the solemn  responsibility to hold this President accountable because it is our  job.   I urge my colleagues to live up to our responsibility and show our  fellow Americans that no one, not even the President, is above the law.
