 Mr. Speaker, we are seeing a wave of voter suppression  efforts show their ugly heads across this country, a crisis of  unprecedented proportion that is cracking at the very foundation of our  democratic process.   Republicans have continued to push lies and conspiracy theories to  depress voter turnout and sow mistrust in our elections at the highest  levels.   It is time that we choose: the filibuster or our democracy. We cannot  allow arcane Senate rules to stand in the way of this Congress  upholding its most basic constitutional responsibilities, at one of the  most critical junctures in our history.   It is incumbent on us to restore the voting rights protections that  our Nation's civil rights leaders bled to secure.   This Congress can and will fight against these draconian measures, to  restore and expand the sacred right to vote.   History will remember anyone who stands in our way.                            ____________________
