 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to conclude my comments before the vote.    Madam President, I rise today to once again urge my  Senate colleagues to take the bipartisan, practical pro-manufacturing  step of providing advice and consent to ratifying the Kigali Amendment.   Each of the four previous amendments to this treaty, the Montreal  Protocol, have enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate,  and Kigali should be no different.   Our companies are clear. They want us to approve this treaty so that  they can maximize their export potential of cutting-edge chemicals that  they have pioneered. They want us to approve the treaty. It will  generate billions of dollars in economic activity and create thousands  of jobs here at home in the United States.   They are also clear that if we fail to ratify, they stand to lose.  They will be locked out of export markets in key products. American  workers will suffer, which is why the National Association of  Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and impacted industries  all support the action we are prepared to take.   Now, I have heard the concerns that some colleagues have raised about  China and how it benefits from its antiquated status as a ``developing  country'' under the Montreal Protocol. Frankly, it is a fair point to  raise, but it should have no bearing on whether we join Kigali.    The simple fact is, whether we join Kigali or not has no impact on  whether China is treated as a developing country--none. On the other  hand, ratifying Kigali will have a major positive benefit for us  because China has doubled down on yesterday's chemicals, and we, the  United States, lead on all the alternatives. Joining Kigali will turn  the world away from China and its companies and towards our competitive  strength. It is good for the United States and our businesses, and it  is bad for China. However, I also recognize the plain fact that China  is no longer a developing country, and I agree that it should not enjoy  advantages under the Montreal Protocol that it received because of  decisions made more than 30 years ago.   I have been a steadfast champion of addressing the challenges China  presents as they are, not as we hope for them to be. I led passage of  the Strategic Competition Act and my Taiwan Policy Act, which was  recently voted out of the Foreign Relations Committee on an  overwhelming bipartisan basis. So I have no problem acknowledging that  China should no longer qualify as a developing country, and for that  reason, I support the Lee-Sullivan amendment.   The Senate's constitutional role on treaties is both unique and  vital. What we are doing today will directly, positively--if we adopt  ratification--impact American workers, American businesses, and  American consumers. It will meet our challenge against China. It will  create greater security at home. It will create great prosperity. There  are few things that we do in the Senate that can improve our economy,  create jobs, and meet the challenge of China in this one dimension.   For all of those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support providing  advice and consent for the Kigali Amendment after the Sullivan  amendment is considered.                            ____________________     I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today in support of Amanda  Bennett to be the Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. State Agency for  Global Media.   When autocrats around the world have been cracking down on  independent media; when regimes silence opposition with repression and  fear; when they shut down the internet, as we have seen in countries  like Cuba and Iran; when they actively target the United States and  like-minded democratic nations with disinformation campaigns, it is  critical for the United States to have a champion of democracy and free  speech leading the U.S. Agency for Global Media, someone who can meet  the challenge posed by the spread of digital authoritarianism around  the world.   Ms. Bennett is prepared to take on that task. She has over two  decades of experience in journalism, including as the director of Voice  of America. For 23 years, she worked at the Wall Street Journal,  including as a correspondent in Beijing, where she came face-to-face  with China's authoritarianism. She has seen how their state security  forces watch and detain journalists to suppress the truth.   As a former director of Voice of America, she understands the  importance of the U.S. Agency for Global Media's networks and American  public diplomacy efforts.   Over the course of her career, she served on the boards of the  Lenfest Institute and Committee to Protect Journalists.   In short, Ms. Bennett is without a doubt the right person for this  position. She will be a tireless advocate for the journalists working  at USAGM and an effective steward of its operations. She will also be  an invaluable ally to USAGM's independent partners, including Radio  Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. She will defend the  importance of Radio and TV Marti. And she will be accountable to  Congress in these efforts.   It has been almost 2 years since the Agency has had a Senate- confirmed CEO at the helm. It is in dire need of steady leadership that  supports independent media.   I enthusiastically support Ms. Bennett. I respectfully urge my  colleagues to support her confirmation as well.                          Treaty Document No. 117-1    Madam President, finally, before I yield the floor, I would also like  to celebrate the Senate's historic vote today to approve the Kigali  Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.   In approving the Kigali Amendment, the Senate took an important step  that will have enormous economic and trade benefits for American  manufacturing and jobs, but it was also the single most important  climate action the Senate and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  have taken in more than 30 years. As wildfires ravage the West,  hurricanes devastate Puerto Rico, and catastrophic flooding inundates  the Midwest, strong action to fight climate change has never been more  urgent.   By voting for the Kigali Amendment today, we voted for maintaining a  livable planet with clean water to drink. We voted for a stable food  supply for all of humanity. We voted, in a strong bipartisan coalition,  to keep American innovation and business at the forefront of the  transition to clean energy.   Finally, I want to express my gratitude for the support and  cooperation of the Foreign Relations Committee's ranking member, the  senior Senator from Idaho, Senator Risch. His partnership and the  tireless efforts of his staff were essential in the Senate's success on  Kigali.   I want to thank my staff on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:  Damian Murphy, staff director; Andrew Keller, chief counsel; Josh  Klein; Josh Kretman; Julia Greensfelder; and Megan Bartley. They were  essential in getting it to the committee and making us successful.   I urge a positive vote.   I yield the floor.
