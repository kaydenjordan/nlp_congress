 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Roy, my great friend from  Texas. I appreciate the sacrifices that he has made on behalf of this  great Nation.   If you know me, you know I am a fan of books because I think, in this  transient, throwaway society, they are a record of things that happened  in the past. So, like I said, if you know me, you know I love books.  They never asked me, because I am not running for President, what books  do you recommend? But if I were running for President and they ever  deigned to ask me, this would be one. This is by a guy named Alexsandr  Solzhenitsyn. It is called ``Warning to the West.'' It is hard to come  by. It is a little expensive, but it is well worth the effort. I just  want to read an excerpt to you where he is thinking about the West as  he sits in a Russian gulag.   ``We contemplate the West from what will be your future, or we look  back 70 years to see our past suddenly repeating itself today. And what  we see is always the same as it was then: adults deferring to the  opinion of their children; the younger generation carried away by  shallow, worthless ideas; professors scared of being unfashionable;  journalists refusing to take responsibility for the words they squander  so easily; universal sympathy for revolutionary extremists; people with  serious objections unable or unwilling to voice them; the majority  passively obsessed by a feeling of doom; feeble governments; societies  whose defensive reactions have become paralyzed; spiritual confusion  leading to political upheaval. What will happen as a result of all this  lies ahead of us. But the time is near, and from bitter memory, we can  easily predict what these events will be.''    I certainly will.    It was a guy who lived it, who saw it happen, who lived  under the oppression of a Russian gulag, imprisoned for decades, and  watched the West, watched 66 million souls exterminated on the border  of Russia and Europe, and Europe did nothing about it.   We are in this Capitol today, as Chip has already said, surrounded by  razor wire and fences. Free speech, they are saying: Well, you have  free speech. The government is not censoring you. The government is not  canceling you.    Well, in this age where Google, Facebook, these platforms have 95, 99  percent market share, whatever the heck it is, when you are taken off  that, your free speech is taken away, effectively.   We are not here to talk to just each other. Free speech means you can  talk to each other, everybody else. So it is not about being able to  just have a conversation with yourself in a cell. Free speech is about  discussing ideas, and some of them are going to be unpalatable.   There were book burnings back at this time because they wanted to  destroy ideas. We are not afraid of ideas. We are afraid of the advent  of communism and socialism in our country, but we are not afraid to  discuss it because we know that our ideas will win.   What we are afraid of is not being able to discuss it, and that is  what is happening. That is happening all across America, whether you  are Project Veritas, whether you are President Trump, whether you are  Marjorie Taylor Greene and you say the wrong thing. You say the wrong  thing, and it is not about disagreement for the other side; it is about  obliteration of your thought.  [[Page H709]]    This is a very, very dangerous precipice that we stand on, and we  know the outcome. Solzhenitsyn, even though he was discredited-- imagine, discredited by the Soviet Union and the Russians. But he came  to America, and he tried to tell us over and over and over again.   Many people know, but my good friend from Texas talked about the  concern the American people have. They are scared.                                time  1930    They are not scared of their neighbor. They are not scared of a  Democrat. They are not scared of a Republican. They are scared of their  government. This is a government of and for the people, by the people.  This is our government. The government doesn't own us; we own it. The  government is supposed to fear us.   You know, I tell people, it didn't end or it didn't begin with gulags  and slave labor work camps where people died of exposure, starvation,  exhaustion. It didn't start with that. It started with what we are  talking about right now, with razor wire and fences around your Capitol  and the inability to say what you want to say. That is where it starts.   We don't have to ask: Well, where does it end?   We know where it ends.   I thank the good gentleman from Texas for this opportunity. You know  that we will stand right with you in this crusade to keep America free  and to keep speech free.
