 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the inequalities  that persist in COVID-19 assistance distribution.   Back in March, House Democrats recognized the global health crisis  was causing an economic crisis. As Americans struggled, we provided  them with stimulus checks to help them make ends meet during these  uncertain times.   However, not everyone who was entitled to these checks received them.  The Senate wrongfully included a provision in the CARES Act that  prevented families with only one American citizen parent and another  who is a tax-paying immigrant with an ITIN from receiving this  financial assistance.   Let me repeat this. Citizens of the United States are being prevented  from receiving stimulus checks because of whom they love.   This blatant discrimination must be corrected. We need to help people  like Lacey, an amazing, hardworking citizen who works for the State  government and isn't able to receive a stimulus check. Lacey and her  spouse have been together for 14 years and were married in 2010. They  have raised six beautiful children, all of whom are U.S. citizens.   For the past 7 years, Lacey has worked at the Illinois Veterans Home  in Quincy, Illinois. She works long hours to make sure her veteran  residents are safe, healthy, and happy, and in March, this job made her  an essential, frontline worker.   Lacey loves her job and loves her residents like they are her own  family. Since the onset of COVID, she has continued her hard work and  dedication to her job. Lacey has picked up overtime shifts to cover for  coworkers who are sick and has worked hard to ensure the standards of  care at the facility remain high. She is a United States citizen who  works every day to care for our Nation's veterans.   Despite her service to our country and the fact that she and her  children are American citizens, her family did not receive a check, all  because her spouse is an immigrant using an ITIN and they file their  taxes jointly.   She has done everything in her power to speak out and advocate for  herself and has connected with others like her in the Facebook group  Mixed-Status Families United.   She told me: ``I am being punished for who I married. My husband and  I work and we pay our taxes. Why are we being treated like second-class  citizens?''   Her words resonate, because she is right. She is being treated like a  second-class citizen.   I ask you, during a period of unprecedented challenges, when  Americans are facing more than one crisis, when we are depending on  essential workers more than ever, is it right for our country to treat  people differently based on the immigration status of their loved ones?   As a country, I believe we can and should do better. There is no  scenario in which citizens should be denied the help they are entitled  to. Likewise, tax-paying immigrants who are paying their fair share  should not be denied assistance, left out on their own.   I am pleased that the HEROES Act, which the House passed more than  100 days ago, rectifies this issue and makes all tax-paying individuals  eligible for a check.   While I believe all taxpayers should receive a stimulus check  regardless of their citizenship status, at the very least, we need to  ensure that all U.S. citizens receive a check regardless of who their  spouses are, and underscore the necessity of including a fix that  corrects this provision retroactively and for any additional stimulus  checks provided moving forward.   We must stand with mixed-status families and continue to fight for  them and their rights. Now, more than ever, we need to provide for  people who are suffering due to this pandemic.   I urge my colleagues to join me in taking swift action to resolve  this issue.                            ____________________
