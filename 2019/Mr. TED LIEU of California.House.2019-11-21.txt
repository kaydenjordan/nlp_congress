 Madam Speaker, the House of  Representatives this year has had one of the most productive sessions  in U.S. history. We have passed over 275 bipartisan bills to the United  States Senate. Let me just say that again: We have passed over 275  bipartisan bills to the United States Senate.   Unfortunately, the Republican-led Senate has not gotten around to  letting these bills go for a vote.   Some of these bills include commonsense legislation such as the  Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, the Save the Internet Act,  Securing America's Federal Elections Act, the Gold Star Family Tax  Relief Act, the Climate Action Now Act, the Paycheck Fairness Act, and  the Raise the Wage Act. It is time for the do-nothing Republicans to  start doing their jobs.                            ____________________
