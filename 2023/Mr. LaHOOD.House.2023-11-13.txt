 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Jim  DeRose on his retirement as Bradley University's men's soccer coach  after 28 successful seasons.   Beginning his career in 1996 at the age of 28, and as the youngest  coach in NCAA Division 1 men's soccer, Jim quickly emerged as a  dominant figure in college soccer.   Under Jim's leadership, Bradley's soccer program reached new heights  and resulted in a 2007 run to the NCAA Elite Eight, where Jim was  chosen as the National Coach of the Year.   During his tenure as head coach, Jim held the record of 267 wins, 227  losses, and 66 ties, with seven NCAA tournament appearances, the  highest of any coach in Bradley University athletics history.   In addition to his accomplishments on the pitch, the success of his  players in the classroom and postgraduation are a testament to his  ability to grow his players into successful young men.   Jim has been an integral part of the growing game of soccer  throughout central Illinois and in college soccer, and his legacy will  last for years to come.   It is my privilege to congratulate Coach Jim DeRose on his retirement  after 28 years with Bradley University. We wish him, his wife, Robin,  and his two children, Raleigh and J.R., all the best.                            ____________________
