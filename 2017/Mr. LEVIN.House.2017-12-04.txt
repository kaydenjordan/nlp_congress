 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the committee says: Come together.   You have done it alone. You have snubbed your nose at the American  people as well as the process of this institution.   The GOP tax bill combines the Republicans' long-term faith in  trickle-down economics with a new, brazen disregard for the facts that  have become the hallmark of the Trump Presidency.   This bill is mostly about cutting taxes for the very wealthy, not the  middle class. Making the very wealthy even richer is not the path to  broad-based economic prosperity and growth. Tax cuts for the very top  do not pay for themselves; instead, they increase the debt. These are  the facts that have been presented by the Joint Committee on Taxation,  and so many others have called the Republican bill a boondoggle and  delusional.   Republicans say the facts be damned as they rush this legislation out  of desperation, not deliberation
