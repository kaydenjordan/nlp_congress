 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the assault  weapons ban.   I live very close to Highland Park, Illinois, and I have heard from  literally hundreds of people and met with hundreds of people--students,  teachers, parents, small businessowners, and, yes, even law enforcement  officials--who demand that we pass an assault weapons ban.   Today's vote would not be possible without the fearless and tireless  work of advocates and survivors. This day is for them. I think that  there is no rational reason that we would allow these weapons of mass  destruction that ravage our families, our communities, and even our way  of life to be on the streets of our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote to ban assault weapons.
