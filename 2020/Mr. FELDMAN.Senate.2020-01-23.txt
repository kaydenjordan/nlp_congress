 The Framers reserved impeachment for       situations where the President abused his office, that is,       used it for his personal advantage. And, in particular, they       were specifically worried about a situation where the       President used his office to facilitate corruptly his own       reelection. That's, in fact, why they thought they needed       impeachment and why waiting for the next election wasn't good       enough.    Professor Feldman's testimony is grounded in the records of the  Constitutional Convention.   There, William Davie warned that a President who abused his office  might spare no efforts or means whatever to get himself reelected and,  thus, to escape justice.   George Mason built on Davie's position, asking: ``Shall the man who  has practiced corruption, and by that means procured his appointment to  the first instance, be suffered to escape punishment by repeating his  guilt?'' Mason's concern was straightforward. He feared that Presidents  would win election by improperly influencing members of the electoral  college.   Gouverneur Morris later echoed this point, urging that the Executive  ought therefore to be impeachable for corrupting his electors.   Taken together, these debates demonstrate an essential point: The  Framers knew that a President who abused power to manipulate elections  presented the greatest possible threat to the Constitution. After all,  the beating heart of the Framers' project was a commitment to popular  sovereignty.   At a time when democratic self-government existed almost nowhere on  Earth, the Framers imagined a society where power flowed from and  returned to the people. That is why the President and Members of  Congress must stand before the public for reelection on fixed terms,  and if the President abuses his power to corrupt those elections, he  threatens the entire system.   As Professor Karlan explained in her testimony:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Professor KARLAN. [D]rawing a foreign government into our       elections is an especially serious abuse of power because it       undermines democracy itself. Our Constitution begins with the       words ``We the people'' for a reason. Our government, in       James Madison's  [[Page S492]]       words, derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the       great body of the people, and the way it derives these powers       is through elections. Elections matter, both to the       legitimacy of our government and to all of our individual       freedoms, because, as the Supreme Court declared more than a       century ago, voting is preservative of all rights.    Mr. Manager NADLER. Professor Karlan is right--elections matter. They  make our government legitimate, and they protect our freedom. A  President who abuses his power in order to kneecap political opponents  and spread Russian conspiracy theories--a President who uses his office  to ask for or, even worse, to compel foreign nations to meddle in our  elections--is a President who attacks the very foundations of our  liberty. That is a grave abuse of power. It is an unprecedented  betrayal of the national interest. It is a shocking corruption of the  election process, and it is without a doubt a crime against the  Constitution, warranting, demanding his removal from office.   The Framers expected that free elections would be the usual means of  protecting our freedoms, but they knew that a President who sought  foreign assistance in his campaign must be removed from office before  he could steal the next election.   In a last-ditch legal defense of their client, the President's  lawyers argue that impeachment and removal are subject to statutory  crimes or to offenses against established law, that the President  cannot be impeached because he has not committed a crime. This view is  completely wrong. It has no support in constitutional text and  structure, original meaning, congressional precedents, common sense, or  the consensus of credible experts. In other words, it conflicts with  every relevant consideration.   Professor Gerhardt succinctly captured the consensus view in his  testimony.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         COUNSEL. Now, Professor Gerhardt, does a high crime and       misdemeanor require an actual statutory crime?
