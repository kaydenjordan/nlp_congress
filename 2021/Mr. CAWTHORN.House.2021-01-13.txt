 Madam Speaker, today represents a unique opportunity in  our Nation's history, an opportunity to put America first, to put her  people first. Today is a moment for Members of Congress to put aside  partisan politicking and place people over power.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this divisive impeachment and  realize that dividing America will not save this Republic. I urge my  colleagues to not simply vote for what feels good.   Of course, it feels good for the Democrats to have a united  constituency for a few more days, but I was elected to come here and  vote for things that actually do good, to bring much-needed help to the  American people.   I am willing to take the first step and extend my hand across the  aisle to say: Vote against impeachment; vote in favor of a unified  nation; and I will forsake partisanship and work with you, no matter  who you are or what party you come from.   Madam Speaker, I urge that we all vote to finally put America first.
