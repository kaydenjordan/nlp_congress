 Madam President, in reserving the right to object, this       bill seeks to continue ill-advised efforts to fund and build an       ineffective border wall. I agree certainly that we need to have strong       border security, but we need to have smart and cost-effective security       measures, not a wall that experts have repeatedly deemed ineffective.       There is no one-size-fits-all approach to this very complex issue, and       a wall is not the most effective way to secure our borders.        I have long advocated for additional technology, personnel, and       resources to help secure the border, which are more cost-effective.       This is not a State-by-State issue. We need a whole-of-government       approach in securing our borders and addressing the arrival of       migrants. We need to move forward with smart, bipartisan investments       that secure all of our borders instead of wasting more taxpayer dollars       on a costly and ineffective wall.        I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided bill; therefore, I       object.         I object.         I object.
