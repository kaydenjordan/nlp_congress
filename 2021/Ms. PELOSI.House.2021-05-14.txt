 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the recognition  and for his leadership, and that of the committee in bringing this  important bipartisan legislation to the floor.   I salute the gentleman; I salute Jerry Nadler, an author of this  legislation, the chair of the Committee on the Judiciary; Mr. Katko for  his lead cosponsorship; among other Republican members, to make this  strongly bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I am excited about this legislation as a mother of five  children--four daughters, one son--nine grandchildren. This is about a  recognition of being family-friendly in our legislation, as more women  are a part of the economic success of our country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, a  strong bipartisan step to ensure that women are no longer forced to  choose between maintaining a healthy pregnancy and paycheck--a choice  that, for many, has serious health consequences.   This landmark legislation advances the health of women and children,  the financial security of families, and, really, the dynamism of our  American economy. And its passage--while long overdue--is particularly  urgent, as the lives and livelihood of so many are under threat from  the coronavirus.   Again, I thank the chairman and Mr. Katko, Mr. Nadler, and so many  others for their leadership in passing this bill. And I thank all the  cosponsors.   Again, as a mother of five, I am especially proud to support the  bill. And I want to salute all the mothers and women who have spoken  out, often risking professional retaliation, to end pregnancy  discrimination in the workplace.   This is what this means: It means that too often when a pregnant  worker asks for a temporary job-related accomodation, she will be fired  or pushed onto unpaid leave, deprived of her paycheck and health  insurance when she needs them most.   This is particularly true in many physically taxing jobs, which tend  to be low wage and traditionally dominated by women. And that is why we  must pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, putting in place a clear,  explicit pregnancy accommodation framework, similar to the standard  that has been in place for decades for workers with disabilities, which  I was proud to be part of. Our distinguished leader, Mr. Hoyer, has  been a major leader in that regard.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is also a matter of justice. As nearly  300 groups from the ACLU to Zero To Three recently wrote to Congress-- from A to  [[Page H2342]]  Z--``Discrimination affects pregnant workers across race and ethnicity,  but women of color and immigrants may be at particular risk.   ``Latinas, Black women and immigrant women are more likely to hold  certain inflexible and physically demanding jobs that can present  specific challenges for pregnant workers. . . . This can make  reasonable accommodations on the job even more important, and loss of  wages and health insurance due to pregnancy discrimination especially  challenging.''   I think it is important to note that this legislation is important  also from the standpoint of hiring. We want to make sure that employers  who are hiring someone know there is a level playing field should the  woman of childbearing age--or even already blessed with a pregnancy-- that this is a positive initiative for their workplace and their  treating that person with respect is not placing them at any  disadvantage if the playing field is level.   This comes at a time when--I mentioned about the pandemic--around 2  million women were pushed out of the labor force. One out of four women  report they are still worse off financially than a year ago. Studies  show it will take 18 months longer for the women's employment to  rebound from the pandemic than for men's. And the reduction of women's  work hours and labor force participation is said to erase tens of  billions of dollars from our economy.   American women are part of the engine of America's economy and the  key to building back better after this crisis. And again, as we all  say: When women succeed, America succeeds.   And we can apply that to say: When women of childbearing age succeed,  America certainly succeeds.   And for mothers and women who are pregnant, the challenges are even  graver because our Nation still lacks sufficient workplace protections  against pregnancy discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, that is why this legislation is so very important and is  consistent with what we pledge--liberty and justice for all women.   I am very excited about this because, as we all know, pregnancy is a  blessing to any family, and we do not want any intervention that can be  avoided in terms of accommodating the needs of women who are pregnant.   Mr. Speaker, I salute all of you. I am very excited about this  legislation and I am so glad it will have strong bipartisan support.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and some emotion that  I rise to honor an outstanding and longstanding member of my staff who  has been a pillar of my office for nearly 15 years, my Senior Advisor  and Director of Member Services, Michael Long.   To Members of Congress and all who work and serve in this Chamber,  the name Michael Long is synonymous with excellence.   Michael is a coalition-builder and a communicator, a liaison and a  leader with an extraordinary talent for forging enduring, effective  connections, both within and outside the Capitol. I have watched him  with great pride over the years as he welcomed young people to the  Capitol, including the Boy Scouts, as an Eagle Scout himself, showing  his leadership from early on, whether it is his communication with his  many friends and admirers in the Congressional Black Caucus or with the  Members across the Congress on both sides of the aisle.   We all know and are grateful for his unwavering patience and  perseverance and his remarkable ability to anticipate and meet the  needs of Members.   Michael comes from a family that is committed to the civil rights  movement. He has it in his DNA, although he is younger than the  movement.   For this and other reasons, many of us were privileged that Michael  came with us, under the leadership of Karen Bass and the Congressional  Black Caucus, to Ghana.   Mr. Whip, you were a leader in that delegation, and you know how  moving it was.   But Michael brought, in his DNA, the spirit of his father, Isaac, who  was watching down from Heaven and saw Michael be part of that historic  trip. The whole time, he wore Isaac's cufflinks as Isaac looked down  with pride, and his mother, Naomi, and sister, Veronica, looked on with  love from here, taking great pride in Michael.   Mr. Whip, it is such an honor that you are in the Chair as I pay  tribute to Michael, a real tribute to him and his work.   Michael has been a tremendous asset to the Speaker's Office and my  leadership team over the years, and to the entire Democratic Caucus and  the entire Congress, ensuring that we can deliver progress For the  People.   He can take pride, as I do, in knowing the key role that he has  played in our passing legislation to lift up working families across  America. That happened because of his leadership.   While Michael's trusted presence on this floor and on Capitol Hill  will be missed, we are grateful for his service, as well as for his  work as a mentor and leader to forge a path for others to follow.  Indeed, his tenure has been both historic and impactful.   On behalf of the House of Representatives, I thank Michael Long and  wish him the best in the next stages of his journey.   With great admiration and appreciation, thank you, Michael Long.                            ____________________
