 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  participants of the 2019 PITTchFEST, which was held in conjunction with  this year's Showcase for Commerce in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.   The event is designed to support the next generation of great ideas  in Cambria County and the Allegheny region. The Shark Tank-style  competition was created as a way for local entrepreneurs to present  their innovative ideas and creations to potential investors. Programs  like these are essential to attracting new businesses and a skilled  workforce to our region.   One of the competition's categories is specifically for students at  the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown. These students are a part of  the summer accelerated program with PITTchFEST, which is used as a  launchpad for their work.   This year's top student entrepreneurship teams included  Smarchitecture, led by Alex Schork. This team project provides  architects, designers, and artists the ability to render digital  imagery that can be instantly shared and edited with clients in real  time.   Skill Spirit was led by Ben Wargo. This team developed an incremental  learning app that provides incentives and rewards for learning new  languages.   Supernal Siesta was led by Laura Johnson. Laura's team focused on  helping women manage hot flashes and the effects of menopause by  creating a fashionably created mattress with the technology to cool and  provide for a full night's sleep.   For the third year, PITTchFEST also included the social  entrepreneurship category, which highlights incredible efforts and  ideas for building vibrant communities. The top teams in this category  included the Conemaugh Valley Conservancy team, which is developing  plans to expand the Path of the Flood Trail, which would be the first  safe and easily followed bicycle route from downtown Johnstown to the  historic Little Conemaugh River gorge.   The Central Park Square/Gallery on Gazebo team aims to promote the  arts in downtown Johnstown.   The Friends of the Inclined Plane Trails team is planning the  Inclined Plane Riverside Park, which will include zip lines and a  downhill mountain-biking course.   The three finalists in each category received a cash award that  supports their innovations. The judges for PITTchFEST represented  various aspects of the community, including social agencies, private  industries, advocacy groups, and higher education.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the sponsors of  PITTchFEST who made the event possible, including Ben Franklin  Technology Partners, Cambria Regional Chamber, Community Foundation for  the Alleghenies, Croyle-Nielsen Therapeutic Associates, Enterprise  Venture Capital Corporation of PA, Entrepreneurial Alchemy, JARI, JWF  Industries, and the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown.   PITTchFEST was a tremendous success, as it showcased the community  spirit and the innovative minds of the greater Johnstown region.   As their motto proclaims, they are: ``Growing Great Ideas Right in  Our Backyard.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Religious Freedom Week  began on Saturday and runs through June 29.   Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right and is protected by  our Constitution. The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,  along with freedom of speech and freedom of the press. This affords us  the opportunity to have open and thoughtful debates on the floor of the  House each and every day.   The United States is a place where people of all faiths can peaceably  practice their religion without fear of persecution, which is something  we have recognized since our founding. The very foundation of our  Nation, a place of freedom and liberty for all, was conceived by  individuals in search of religious freedom.   Mr. Speaker, the United States of America will always be a beacon of  light in the world, and we will always protect our fundamental, unified  commitment to religious freedom. It is a central part of what makes  America exceptional. It affords our citizens the right to live in a  free society, because no person should live in fear for their beliefs.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, I urge the Speaker and  Majority Leader to immediately schedule a vote to protect born-alive  infants of failed abortions.
