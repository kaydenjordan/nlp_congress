 Mr. President, my State proudly calls itself the Land of  Steady Habits. Some people in Connecticut think it is kind of a funny  thing to be proud of--being resistant to change--but honestly, in the  Northeast, in the crucible of America, we know there is real value to  consistency and tradition.   A nation as unique as ours--multicultural, democratic, ever expanding  in scope and ambition--we probably can't hold together unless there is  some agreement between all of our different peoples about the  expectations that we have for each other in the conduct of our national  business. Without tradition, our Nation's defining dynamism, it might  break us.   Yes, it is wildly old-fashioned to hold town meetings, where every  citizen has to show up on one particular day, to make decisions about  how you spend money or what rates you pay in taxes, but that way of  governing, created in New England some four centuries ago, is still the  method of decisionmaking in many of our towns. It may not be the most  efficient means of government, but tradition matters. It helps to hold  us together as a country.   I know and appreciate the value of consistency. I don't deny it. So  earlier this week, I read with interest an opinion piece, penned by one  of my friends in the Senate Democratic caucus, making the argument that  amongst the most important reasons to preserve the 60-vote threshold in  the Senate is to advance the value of consistency and tradition in  American politics.   I was glad to read it. I am proud of my colleague because for too  long, the punditry and the activists have had near exclusive domain  over the debate about the wisdom of changing the rules of this body. So  it has been strange, given how much this place means to the 100 of us  who serve here, that we have mostly left the dialogue over its future  to those who don't work inside this Chamber every day.   Yes, right now, there is a disagreement amongst Senate Democrats and  between the majority of Senate Democrats and the majority of Senate  Republicans about how the Senate should operate, but there is no merit  in hiding this dispute. There is no valor in letting others define the  terms that lay out the conflicting arguments, which I readily submit  are compelling on both sides. So let's have the debate. Let's have it  right here. No more shadowboxing. The stakes, I would argue, are too  important.   Let me start here. The argument to keep the 60-vote threshold, to  guarantee policy consistency or to uphold Senate tradition, is  downright dangerous because this argument essentially prioritizes  consistency over democracy.   At the very moment when Americans have less faith than ever before  that this place has the capacity to implement the will of the people,  the 60-vote threshold is a slap in the face of majoritarianism, which  is the bedrock principal of American democracy, the idea that the  majority of people get to  [[Page S4724]]  decide the direction of this country--not elites, not oligarchs, like  in other nations; people, regular people.   To say that Americans can have an election, choose leaders of a  particular view, and then watch while the rules of democracy  deliberately stop the voters' will from being enacted is to thumb our  noses at the American electorate--at the very moment when they are  actively considering whether American democracy has anything left to  offer them.   My colleague argues quite powerfully that the requirement to achieve  60 votes to pass legislation in the Senate guards against rapid policy  change, giving several examples, including education and environment  policy and voting rules as areas where danger might lie if one majority  imposed the policy in one Congress that would be undone by the next. I  want to walk us through this argument.   My first approach might be to postpone the harder question of whether  or not to value consistency over democracy and to simply accept for a  moment the prioritization of consistency and tradition. I do so knowing  that our Founding Fathers also prioritized consistency.   In Federalist 9 and 10, Hamilton and Madison discuss what they call  the problem of factions. Madison says that a faction is ``a number of  citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who  are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, adverse to  the rights of other citizens.'' Now, notice here that Madison doesn't  really care whether the faction represents a minority or majority of  citizens; he simply defines it by its cause's malevolence. This was and  still is tricky business--rich White men defining for everybody else  what cause is righteous and which cause is wicked. But our Founding  Fathers built a system of government to make rapid policy change--even  change supported by the majority of voters--very, very hard to  implement.   Now, how do they do this? I want to lay this out because if you do  care about preventing rapid policy shifts, it is important to  understand why the 60-vote threshold isn't necessary, is overkill given  all the other barriers our system has to prevent rapid policy shifts.   First, our Founding Fathers established a bicameral legislature as  opposed to a unicameral parliamentary system. That meant that no change  could be implemented until two different legislative bodies agreed to  the exact same text.   Second, they layered on top of that bicameral legislative structure a  unitary President with the power to veto that legislation.   Third, they put in place an unelected body, the Supreme Court, that  could invalidate any statutory changes that conflicted with the  Constitution.   Fourth, they put the House and the Senate and the Presidency all on  overlapping, conflicting election schedules, guaranteeing that it would  be 100 percent possible for the voters to sweep out all elected  officials and replace them with a new slate all at one moment.   Fifth, the Founders built a few supermajority requirements but only  for selective occasions: treaties, impeachments, constitutional  amendments--the stuff that could last forever. The Founding Fathers did  want extra consensus around that.   All of that design has lasted. It is still with us today.   There are other parts of the original design intended to protect the  value of consistency to protect against the danger of faction that have  not lasted. The Founders also believed that only White men should vote  and that citizens shouldn't be trusted to directly select the Members  of this body. That is all history because for all of the anti-faction  design that we have kept, we changed just as much, and all of that  change has moved in only one direction--toward more majoritarian  democracy.   Why? Well, because as our grand experiment--the American experiment-- matured, we saw proof of concept. The people could be trusted to govern  themselves. They could choose leaders who were more able, more honest,  more effective than any King or Queen, any Sultan or Emperor. So we  extended the franchise universally. We directly elected the Senate.   As America expanded, the new States out West gobbled up even more  democracy. The West decided to not just elect legislators but judges,  prosecutors, dog catchers and commissioners. Majoritarian rule became  addictive, and our country grew and it demanded more and more of it.   That brings us to the 60-vote threshold. The 60-vote threshold in a  country built on the strength of direct democracy stands out like a  sore, rotting thumb--this anti-majoritarian drain clog designed  intentionally to stop the majority of Americans from getting what they  want from government.   Proponents of existing Senate rules say that in the name of  bipartisanship or tradition or consistency of policy, we should  purposefully frustrate the changing will of the electorate. But why?  Why not trust voters? For instance, voters elected a President and a  Congress in 2008 that promised to enact a system of universal  healthcare. It just so happened that at that moment, for the first time  in 40 years, there were 60 votes for the party of that view in the  Senate, so a universal healthcare law was passed.   But why should it not be up to the voters and not politicians to  review the efficacy of a major policy change like that and, if they so  choose, elect leaders to rescind or revise it? I don't want the ACA  repealed, but I am deeply uncomfortable that a 60-vote threshold robs  from voters that decision.   This preference for policy consistency, intentionally blind to the  merits of policy over direct democracy, is particularly insidious at  this moment in American history, first because the 60-vote threshold is  being used in a very, very different way today than it has anytime  prior in our Nation's history.   Up until the 1970s, cloture votes were almost nonexistent in the  Senate. Legislative filibusters were used in those days mostly by  racist southern White Senators to stop civil rights bills. Beginning in  the seventies, that tactic became more widely employed but was still  used sparingly.   Consider this. In 1994, our colleague Senator Feinstein forced a vote  on one of the most controversial of all proposals that come before this  body--a ban on assault weapons. It received fewer votes than the  Manchin-Toomey background check bill did 30 years later. Senator  Feinstein's proposal got 52 votes; Manchin-Toomey got 54 votes. But the  assault weapons ban became law while the background checks bill did  not. Why? Because in 1994, many important votes, even the assault  weapons ban, were allowed to proceed on a majority-vote basis. Not so  by 2013.   I could make the argument that it was Republicans who started this  rapid escalation of the use of the 60-vote threshold, but who really  cares? It doesn't matter because today both parties use it almost  without exception in a way that looks radically different from the way  the tactic was utilized half a century ago.   I would argue that if you want to do an overview of the history of  the 60-vote threshold, it doesn't tell a story of the value the Senate  places on consistency. No, it is the opposite. Watching the way the  tactic has been used so differently over time, it demonstrates the  value the Senate places on change in practice and tradition. Reforming  this rule would, frankly, just pay heed to this reality.   The second danger of valuing consistency over democracy at this  moment lies in the signal that it sends to an American public that is  in, frankly, no mood for the choices of the elites to be continually  substituted for their own collective judgment.   Right now, Americans are in kind of a revolutionary mood, and for  good reason. More Americans today than at any time in recent history  see themselves on the precipice of financial and sometimes spiritual  ruin. They are done with economic and political elites jealously  protecting the status quo. And the election of Donald Trump, although  revealed by time to be a false prophet, was an unmistakable foot stomp  by an electorate tired of being taken for granted.   So why on Earth would our message, amidst this growing populist  tempest, be to tell voters that rules in the Senate are required to  protect them from their own bad judgment, to take from them, purposely,  the ability to change policies whenever and however they wish?  [[Page S4725]]    I submit to you that today, right now, this replacement of popular  will by anti-majoritarian rule-rigging could destroy us. Today more  than ever, voters want to know that their vote counts every election.  And continuing to give minorities here in the Senate power to stop  change is dangerously disconsonant with the current political mood of  this country. Take power away from the American people at your peril.   Finally, on this question of the value we should place on  consistency, I want to raise the problem of the city firehouse.  Firehouses are places that value consistency and tradition.  Firefighters spend a lot of time in close quarters together. When that  alarm rings, they are required to work together in precise and  disciplined unison to get out the door in seconds in order to save  lives and property. Practices change in a firehouse but carefully and  through consensus decision making. Keeping everybody together matters  when the stakes are so high.   But what would happen if inside that firehouse, a sizable group of  firefighters decided one day that the mission of the department should  no longer be to put out fires but maybe, instead, just to let them burn  a little? Wouldn't then the value of consensus decision making become a  little less important? If you were a homeowner, wouldn't you want to  make sure that the firefighters who still wanted to fight fires were  setting the rules and not the guys who are OK with the houses in the  neighborhood burning down?   I know this is a crude analogy, but to value consistency or tradition  above everything else, I think you have to be pretty certain that  everybody in your club, everybody on your team is guided by the same  foundational goal.   In the case of the U.S. Senate, our goal, our endgame has always been  simple: the preservation of American democracy, the belief that every  American should have a say in who governs, and the persons whom they  choose and no one else should be seated in power   We have had fights--often vicious in nature--over the course of our  Nation's history over how fast we should expand the vote, how quickly  we should reform our Constitution to allow for more direct democracy.  But never before has one party actively advocated for the lessening of  democracy. Never before has one party openly advocated for candidates  who receive the smaller share of the vote to be made President of the  United States.   In the last year, a democratic Rubicon has been crossed by one party,  and we can't ignore this devastating blow to our Nation. You cannot  value consistency in practice when a large faction of your group's  members don't believe in the underlying mission of your organization  any longer. The firehouse can't just keep doing the same things it  always does year after year for the sake of consistency or tradition or  consensus when two or three of the members who hop on the firetruck  when that alarm sounds aren't intending to actually put out the fire  when they arrive at the building.   Giving Republicans a veto power over legislation when they no longer  believe in the same way the Democrats do or Republicans used to in the  sacredness of the vote is to risk the voluntary destruction of our  democracy.   Consistency as a value has merit. It does. But in this business,  consistency is often put on an unhealthy pedestal. What is the value of  being consistent when all of the circumstances around you are changing?  Where is the strength in sticking to your position when everything  around you is in metamorphosis? When democracy itself is being attacked  in a brutal, coordinated, unprecedented volley of blows, what is the  good of holding to a position just for the sake of being consistent if  the primary consequence is to simply green light the assault to  continue?   Consistency and tradition and bipartisanship--they matter but not at  the expense of democracy, not in a moment when millions of voters are  questioning the wisdom of American democracy because no matter whom  they elect, nothing seems to change, and not when one party has  increasingly abandoned the joint project to which all Members of this  body swore an oath as a condition of our membership.
