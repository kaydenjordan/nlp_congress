 ``The President shall, at stated times,  receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be  increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been  elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other  emolument from the United States, or any of them.''    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        In paragraph (2) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill,       insert after ``means any rule'' the following: ``(other than       a special rule)''.        In paragraph (3) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill,       insert before the period at the end the following: ``, and       includes any special rule''.        Add, at the end of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill, the       following:        ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule that will       result in reduced incidence of cancer, premature mortality,       asthma attacks, or respiratory disease in children.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Castor) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment makes an important  exemption to the REINS Act to ensure that policies that protect  children from cancer, premature death, asthma attacks, or respiratory  disease are not delayed or denied.   For example, the Clean Air Act, which has been in place for over 40  years, and has improved our health and protected all Americans from  harmful toxic air pollution, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur  dioxide, and particle pollution, often requires updates based upon the  best science, especially when it comes to our kids.   Toxic pollutants, such as ozone, which is a major component of smog,  are linked to asthma, lung, and heart disease and result in thousands  of deaths every year and up to 1 million missed days of school. Our  kids are particularly susceptible to this type of pollution because  their lungs are still developing. On average, they take deeper breaths  and are more likely to spend long periods outdoors, placing them at  higher risk.   The American Lung Association states that inhaling smog pollution is  like getting a sunburn on your lungs, and often results in immediate  breathing trouble.   I remember very well back in the early seventies, when I was a little  girl, what the air was like in my hometown in Tampa. We had a lot of  industrial users at the port of Tampa, a lot of industrial plants. I  have seen the progress over time that the Clean Air Act has brought to  this country. We are not like other countries in the world. We are  stronger, and we are better, and we are healthier because of the Clean  Air Act.   So let's not go backwards. Let's not throw a roadblock like the REINS  Act into the mix here. But we do have to be careful because there still  are many communities in America that continue to suffer, and they are  often the underserved, economically distressed communities.   Studies have shown that working class communities often bear the  brunt of environmental pollution because the only homes they can afford  are often located near industrial sites. According to the NAACP, 78  percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of an industrial  power plant, and 71 percent of African Americans live in counties that  violate Federal air pollution standards.   In addition to that, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found  that our Latino neighbors are three times more likely to die from  asthma, often for those same reasons.   Let's not go backwards. Because here, what the REINS Act does is it  really complicates the American system of checks and balances. Let's  not go backwards. Because it is not only our families and neighbors  that would suffer. It is also our economy that would suffer as well.   This type of regulatory scheme of mirrors and false promises would  create great uncertainty for many of our businesses. The Clean Air Act  is one example. These clean air protections in the United States have a  great track record. We have grown as a country. The economic growth has  tripled. Our economic base has more than tripled. Clean air protections  and environmental protections go hand-in-hand with economic growth.   Since 1970, we have cut harmful air pollution by 70 percent, while  our economy has grown like gang busters. I know many of you are  probably going to have your eyes on the Tampa Bay area Monday night  when we have the college football championship in Tampa with Alabama  versus Clemson. I  [[Page H138]]  want you to take a look at our clean skies, the clean air. I wish we  could all be there, but I think we are going to be back here in  Washington, D.C. But just know, it hasn't always been that way. When  you see the beautiful sunset across Tampa Bay with clear skies, that  has been because of the Clean Air Act.   But if you bring a regulatory scheme, like the REINS Act, that says  you have to come back to Congress for every single little new policy  that is based on updates and new science, that is going to complicate  everyone's lives. I worry at the outset of this new Congress, because  the first bill passed yesterday was one that short-circuited public  participation, and now this bill today appears to be a late Christmas  gift to corporate polluters who put profits over people. We are better  than that. You can prove me wrong, though, by supporting this  amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, of course, this legislative body  has all the power to go back to policymaking after an administrative  agency makes a determination, but we are not micromanagers. We are  legislators. And I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Castor  amendment to protect children's health.   If you won't create an exception for children's health, I wonder, you  are not willing to really recognize the fundamental constitutional  basis of this government. It is one that relies on checks and balances  as the basis of our government.   I urge my colleagues then to also support the Castor amendment but  oppose the REINS Act in the end.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
