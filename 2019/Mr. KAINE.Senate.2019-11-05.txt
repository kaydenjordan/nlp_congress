 Madam President, I want to wish a happy 25th  anniversary to North of the James magazine and congratulate it on  reaching this milestone. I want to thank editor Charles McGuigan and  all who worked tirelessly to make the publication what it is today. The  magazine started off in a garage in Richmond's North Side neighborhood.  It has been exciting to see the news outlet grow and become an integral  part of the community it serves. North of the James has served as a  unique, hyper-local voice that Richmonders can relate to. This is  evident by the loyal readership in the area throughout all these years.   I am proud that this year, Charles McGuigan was awarded first place  for the feature writing portfolio by the Virginia Press Association. He  also was awarded second place for the feature titled ``Kaity Kasper:  Blazing into that Good Night.'' I was proud to be featured by the  magazine in 2012, and I was humbled to be among great Virginians, like  Oliver Hill, who have been on the cover over the years.   Local news is a vital part of our communities. Whether it is keeping  readers informed about art exhibits and food or shining a spotlight on  Virginians, we are grateful for North of the James' dedication to  serving Richmonders for the past 25 years. I know they will keep up the  great work.                            ____________________
