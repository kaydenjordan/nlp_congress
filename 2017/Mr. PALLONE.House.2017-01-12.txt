 Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority has declared its  intent to immediately pass legislation to repeal the Affordable Care  Act without a replacement. That means millions of Americans with health  insurance today will lose their coverage.   That is people like Michelle from New Brunswick in my district who  recently wrote to me and said: ``As a survivor of childhood cancer, I  am deeply concerned about the repeal of the ACA, which could bar me  from obtaining health insurance due to my pre-existing conditions.   ``I accessed coverage from the ACA insurance exchange when I lost my  job due to a health condition in 2014-2015. Because I had affordable  coverage, I was able to obtain the necessary care needed to recover  from the long-term effects from cancer. Now, I'm back on my feet,  working, and contributing to the American economy.   ``I urge you to please defend the ACA and help the 335,000-plus  cancer survivors in New Jersey who depend on it.''   Mr. Speaker, the public deserves thorough and complete information on  how working families will fare compared to today if the law is  repealed.   Health care means life or death for American families. It is also  nearly 18 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product. Often a  hospital or health system is the largest employer in a county or town.  We can't afford to be capricious with our approach to health care.                            ____________________
