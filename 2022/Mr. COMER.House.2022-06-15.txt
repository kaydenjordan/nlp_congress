 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the mayor of Mayfield,  Kathy O'Nan, for all she has done for her community in the wake of last  December's tornado damage.   In a nod to her recovery efforts, Mayor O'Nan was recently named  Woman of the Year by the Mayfield-Graves County Chamber of Commerce. I  can think of no one more deserving of this high honor.   When the storms hit, the mayor led by example in getting her  community back on its feet. She was there for her citizens when they  needed her the most, and she continues to work tirelessly to bring all  parties together to rebuild the proud community of Mayfield.   A role model to many, she has embodied servant leadership during her  time in office, a tenure largely defined by persevering through  tragedy.   When the eyes of the world were on Mayfield, Kentucky, Mayor O'Nan  stepped up to the plate and delivered the leadership and empathy that  west Kentucky needed. I am proud to represent her in Congress, and I  look forward to working with her as Graves County rebuilds.  [[Page H5593]]                                ____________________
