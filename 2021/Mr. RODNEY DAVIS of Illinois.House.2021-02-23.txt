 Madam Speaker, coming from Illinois, it  is often a question I get here in this Chamber, why do you have a pin  of the State of Louisiana on your lapel?   I have the pin on my lapel because there is a void, a void in this  institution because one of our colleagues wasn't able to get sworn in.  Luke Letlow would have made a tremendous Member of this institution.  And I want to thank my colleague,   Mike Johnson, and the entire  Louisiana delegation, and what would have been his freshman class, for  honoring him tonight in a Special Order.   Like Luke, I was a district staffer for years, trying to make this  House be a better place for every single American. I was looking  forward to serving with him. Unfortunately, tragedy took his life, and  we are without his service.   My heart goes out to his wife, Julia, and their two kids, and the  entire State of Louisiana, and this institution, for not having the  opportunity to see the true leadership of Congressman Luke Letlow.                            ____________________
