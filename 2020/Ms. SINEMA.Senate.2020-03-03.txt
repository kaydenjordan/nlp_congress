 Madam President, I rise today to honor the esteemed  career and public service of Dr. William Wallace Covington, who is  retiring as regents' professor of forestry at Northern Arizona  University, NAU.   As founder and director of NAU's Ecological Restoration Institute,  Dr. Covington's research has substantially contributed to our  understanding of the conditions necessary to maintain healthy forest  ecosystems. His demonstrations that selective thinning and controlled  fires may mitigate more intense, destructive fires have undoubtedly  helped save significant swathes of southwestern ponderosa pine forests,  including those found in Arizona.   Dr. Covington was recognized as an Outstanding Teaching Scholar by  NAU, and received the Biswell Lifetime Achievement Award from the  Association for Fire Ecology, has testified before both congressional  and State natural resource committees and advised a former Chief of the  U.S. Forest Service and former Secretary of the Interior. Dr.  Covington's dedication to novel research and evidence-driven outcomes  has been essential in safeguarding our communities from uncontrolled  fires.   I thank Dr. Covington for his years of dedicated work and public  service on behalf of Arizona, the Southwest, and the American people.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from  Bruce Babbitt recognizing Dr. Covington.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   January 26, 2019.      Hon. Kyrsten Sinema,      U.S. Senator,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Martha McSally,      U.S. Senator,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Sinema and Senator McSally: I write to support       Congressional recognition of the remarkable career and public       service of Professor Wallace Covington who is retiring as       Regents Professor of Forestry at Northern Arizona University.        Professor Covington's work came to my attention back in       1993. At the Interior Department we were confronted with a       rapid increase in large, destructive fires in the western       ponderosa forest in the Southwest. In response to a proposal       from Covington, the Department dedicated an extensive forest       tract at Mt. Trumbull north of the Grand Canyon for large       scale experimentation, and we began to fund his work.        What emerged from the Mt. Trumbull experiment was a new       understanding of pre-settlement open forests that were       maintained free of dense thickets and underbrush by frequent,       low intensity natural fires. Following European settlement,       these natural forests became overly dense as a result of fire       suppression and over grazing. With so much unnatural fuel       accumulation, forest fires have become more intense,       widespread and destructive.        Covington's work at Mount Trumbull demonstrated that these       forests could be brought back to a more natural condition by       a carefully controlled process of selective thinning and the       application of low intensity prescribed fire.        Covington has since taken his academic work to the policy       level by organizing support for large scale restoration       programs. The Congress, with leadership from Senator Kyl, has       supported creation of the Ecological Restoration Institute at       Northern Arizona University and comparable centers at       Colorado State University and New Mexico Highlands       University.        This work continues today with support from local       governments and environmental groups. An example is the 4FRI       project, a twenty year restoration project across several       million acres in northern Arizona, managed by the Forest       Service with support from the Congress and a broad coalition       of state and federal agencies, local communities and       environmental organizations.        Covington's work is an outstanding example of science in       action under leadership from a dedicated public servant,       forging consensus policy changes that are now restoring       forests, and safeguarding communities from uncontrolled       wildfire.        His work and advocacy has been of inestimable benefit to       the American people.            Sincerely,      Bruce Babbitt.                            ____________________
