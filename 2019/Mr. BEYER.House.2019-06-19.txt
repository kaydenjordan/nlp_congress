 Madam Chair, my amendment would direct $20 million from  the top line of the Aeronautics account to the Aeronautics Research  Mission Directorate 3 into ultra-efficient flight, including electric  flight.   The point of the amendment is to help us move our commercial fleet of  planes currently dependent on fossil fuels to more climate friendly  alternatives.   One key way to do that is to sufficiently invest into the work the  Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate is doing into ultra-efficient  flight, including electric flight.   In the President's FY20 budget, it specifically said ``Electric  Aircraft Propulsion is showing great potential and industry interest  and is a focus of NASA.   The NASA Electric Aircraft Test Facility is enabling full scale  ground test of high-power electric propulsion systems, and technical  accomplishments will be building blocks demonstrating progress with  integration and test.   In FY 2020, NASA will begin a multi-year effort to solve the  technical challenges of a 1MW+ power electric propulsion system.   Further, NASA will initiate new ground and flight research activities  to validate these new electric systems in flight.''   From NASA's own website, ``NASA is investing in Electrified Aircraft  Propulsion (EAP) research to improve the fuel efficiency, emissions,  and noise levels in commercial transport aircraft.''   I'm offering my amendment to ensure that we are actually investing in  the pursuit of the electrification of commercial flight.   There is potential but in order to make that potential a reality we  need to fund the work of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate  into ultra-efficient commercial vehicles, including electric fight.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
