 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, last Friday, I went to Rockford, IL, and  had a roundtable discussion about healthcare. There is a lot of debate  about healthcare in the Congress and certainly in Washington. What I  have tried to do is to take this issue home and ask the people who  actually are responsible for providing healthcare, and the people I  represent, what they think about the new Republican alternative to the  Affordable Care Act. What I found is that with virtually no exceptions,  they are all gravely concerned that the changes that are going to be  made to the healthcare system in America, which represents a dramatic  portion of our economy, could have a very negative impact on the real  lives of people across my State and across the Nation.   Hospital administrators were there to talk about this issue. Swedish  Covenant is one of the hospitals well known and respected in the area;  OSF as well, and the administrators of both of these hospitals talked  about the negative impacts of cutting back Medicaid coverage.   What the Republicans are suggesting in their proposal is that the  expansion of Medicaid to provide health insurance for low-income  Americans would continue until 2020 and then be cut off, and, they  would argue, we will make it more cost efficient. We will let the  Governors come up with alternatives. Well, the Governors aren't very  happy with this because they know the cost of healthcare continues to  go up and they are fearful that when you try to put this all together,  the net result is fewer people covered by Medicaid.   Over 600,000 people, because of ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act-- in Illinois now have health insurance. Who are they? Well, I met Ray  Romanowski. Ray, a big Polish American fellow from Chicago, is a  musician, and he has made most of his income during his life doing work  as a musician. Ray Romanowski, in his 60s today, has never had health  insurance until now. Because of the Affordable Care Act, he qualifies  for Medicaid, and because he has Medicaid--he patted his wallet and  said: I finally have that card in my wallet where I can walk into a  hospital or a clinic and get good treatment.   It is the first time in his life, and he is in his sixties.   Judy is a friend of mine in Southern Illinois, and she works at local  motels there--in hospitality--at places where they serve breakfast to  you. She gets up early in the morning. She is a hard-working lady. It  is the kind of job she has had her entire life, and she never, ever had  health insurance--not once. She worked 20, 30, 40 hours a week,  sometimes two different jobs, but never with health insurance. Now she  has it because of the Affordable Care Act, and thank goodness she does  because she has been diagnosed with diabetes and she needs that kind of  care.   So what happened before, when people like Ray and Judy got sick?  Before the Affordable Care Act, they would show up in the hospital, go  to the emergency room, and they would get treatment, but they wouldn't  be able to pay for it. What happens to those expenses at hospitals,  under the old way of doing things? They are passed along. The rest of  us pay. Anyone who has health insurance and goes in for treatment, part  of it is going to be what your treatment is or for your family; the  other part is to make up the difference for charity care, uncompensated  care.  [[Page S1759]]    Now the Republicans believe they have a new idea: Let's restrict  access to Medicaid. Let's restrict the health insurance that is  available to people like Ray and Judy. Well, they are still going to  get sick, and they are still going to come to the hospital, and their  costs are going to be passed along to others.   The Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, a neighbor from the State of  Wisconsin, said that it is all about competition and choice. Well, when  it came to competition and choice, Ray and Judy didn't have a chance.  They just didn't make enough money. But they did get coverage under the  Affordable Care Act, and they stand to see that coverage endangered, if  not lost, under this new approach.   We also had representatives of the nursing association in Illinois.  These are women and men who are the most respected medical providers.  Just take a look and ask whether people have higher respect for doctors  or whomever; it is always the nurses, No. 1, because the nurses are the  ones who are there day in and day out, hour after hour, in the hospital  rooms with the people we love who desperately need medical care. The  nurses are opposed to this Republican replacement plan as well.   The doctors--the American Medical Association and the Illinois State  Medical Society--are also opposed to it because they looked at the  Republican competition and choice alternative and said that at the end  of the day, fewer people will have health insurance and the costs will  go up dramatically for some. We had a representative of the American  Association of Retired Persons there, and they are especially opposed  to it. Why? We had a provision in the Affordable Care Act which said  that the disparity in premiums can never be more than 3 to 1. Well, the  Republicans decided as part of their replacement to make that 5 to 1.  Who is going to pay five times instead of three times the base premium?  Seniors, those over the age of 55. The Republicans built this into  their proposal, and AARP has come out against it.   The second thing to go is--the Affordable Care Act has really brought  some savings to healthcare; we wish there were more. But that savings  in healthcare is translated into 10 more years of solvency for  Medicare. Medicare is a lifeline for 40 million or 50 million  Americans. So we gave it 10 more years of solvency with the changes in  the Affordable Care Act. Now we are waiting for a score from the  Congressional Budget Office, but the early indications are we are going  to lose 4 years of solvency in Medicare because the Republicans want to  bring in ``competition and choice.'' It turns out that phrase is not  going to be good for the future of Medicare--one of the other reasons  the American Association of Retired Persons opposes the Republican  proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act.   This bill will be scored this week by the Congressional Budget  Office. It was interesting to watch the Sunday shows and watch the  procession of Republicans calling themselves fiscal conservatives who  came in and discounted any conclusions from the Congressional Budget  Office. Interesting.   When we wrote the Affordable Care Act, we waited sometimes for weeks  for the Congressional Budget Office to give us a score: Is this bill  going to add to the deficit or reduce the deficit? We had to wait to  find out. Is this bill going to cover more people with health insurance  or not? We had to wait to find out. But the Republicans went ahead with  their proposal without a Congressional Budget Office score, and what  they have done over the weekend is downplay the credibility of an  office which Democrats and Republicans have relied on for decades. It  shows that they are very concerned. I think they know what they are  going to find. They are afraid it is going to add to the deficit and it  is going to dramatically reduce health insurance for Americans.   There are some who estimate that 10 million to 15 million Americans  could lose their health insurance. That is half of all of those in the  past 6 years who have gained health insurance. It would also increase  out-of-pocket healthcare costs for the average person--the Republican  plan would--by $1,500 a year, seniors paying approximately $5,000 more  a year because of that 5-to-1 premium change that I mentioned earlier.  It would basically end Medicaid as we know it.   The Governors are telling us that this is a bad idea because it would  shift the cost onto the families and to the Governors to find ways to  save money.   It would shorten the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 4 years.   It would allow insurers to once again charge older people  significantly more than younger people for health insurance.   And--Republicans added a little grace note there--they defund Planned  Parenthood and cut 12 percent of the funding for the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention.   Here is something my colleagues may not know. Because of family  planning efforts in America, in the last 30 years, we are now at the  lowest point in teenage pregnancies and the lowest point in unplanned  pregnancies. So information and education are paying off to reduce  unwanted pregnancies, unplanned pregnancies, and, I might add, the  likelihood of abortions. So now, as the Republicans say we are going to  defund Planned Parenthood for hundreds of thousands of women, that  means stopping their access to the healthcare they trust across  America. So in the name of choice, the Republican plan reduces choices  for women when it comes to healthcare by defunding Planned Parenthood.   To top it off, the bill cuts taxes for the very wealthy. Those making  over $1 million a year in income get a $50,000 tax cut because of the  Republican proposal for this new health insurance approach. If you  happen to be in the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans, the average  tax cut is nearly $200,000. They just can't help themselves.   We put together a revenue source so that we could dramatically expand  health insurance coverage in this Nation. We now have the lowest  percentage of uninsured Americans in our history, and the Republicans-- because they are opposed to it--have said: We are going to cut the  taxes that help people pay for their health insurance, and we are going  to reduce the options that are available to them. So for Americans, it  means less coverage, higher costs.    We will see when it goes to the House of Representatives on the  floor. The most conservative Republicans don't like it; certainly the  Democrats don't like it. The question is whether Speaker Paul Ryan has  enough votes. It has united America. The Republican approach has united  America, in opposition. I don't know of a major health-providing group  that supports it--not one; not doctors, not hospitals, not clinics, not  AARP. Patients' groups all say the same thing about TrumpCare.   The American Medical Association said:         We cannot support the [bill] as drafted because of the       expected decline in health insurance coverage and the       potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient       populations.    The American Medical Association goes on to say:         We are concerned with the proposed rollback of the Medicaid       expansion. . . . Medicaid expansion has proven highly       successful in providing coverage for lower income       individuals.        The AMA cannot support provisions that repeal the       Prevention and Public Health Trust Fund . . . and we cannot       support provisions that prevent Americans from choosing to       receive care from physicians and qualified providers . . .       [including] those associated with Planned Parenthood       affiliates.    The American Medical Association is saying to the Republicans that  they reject their proposal for healthcare and is warning them not to  cut off funding for Planned Parenthood.   What does the American Hospital Association say?         We cannot support the [bill]--    the Republican bill--       in its current form.        In addition to the lack of a CBO score, we have some       additional policy concerns with the proposal.        For example, it appears that the effort to restructure the       Medicaid program will have the effect of making significant       reductions in a program that provides services to our most       vulnerable populations.    That is from the American Hospital Association. They estimate that in  our State of Illinois, we could lose up to 90,000 jobs by repealing the  Affordable Care Act without a suitable substitute--90,000 jobs in my  State. President Trump made a lot of news when he went to visit one of  the manufacturing companies after he was first  [[Page S1760]]  sworn in and saved a couple hundred jobs. Well, I am glad he saved  those jobs. I hope he saves a lot more. But if he is going to eliminate  90,000 jobs in my State--people who work at hospitals, some of the  best-paying jobs in downstate communities--for goodness sake, that  isn't hiring American. It isn't really focusing on creating jobs in  this country. It is just the opposite.   Here is what the American Nurses Association says about the  Republican bill:         [The bill] threatens health care affordability, access, and       delivery for individuals across the nation. . . . [T]he bill       changes Medicaid to a per capita cap funding model,       eliminates the Prevention . . . Fund, restricts millions of       women from access to critical health services, repeals income       based subsidies that millions of people rely on. These       changes in no way will improve care for the American people.    What about the U.S. Conference of Mayors? Here is what they said:         States will be forced to end coverage and eliminate health       care for low-income seniors, people with disabilities,       children, and working families.        The GOP plan is bad for cities, bad for people who live in       cities and bad for people who provide healthcare in       cities.   It is interesting. We had a representative at a Rockford meeting of  the disabled community. They are scared to death of this Republican  alternative because these folks many times are in serious need of very  expensive healthcare. If they are pushed off into these so-called  money-saving insurance plans that really are empty inside and don't  provide coverage, it could be devastating to these families. They have  been through it over and over.   The American Association of Retired Persons said:         This Republican bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal       sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for       Americans aged 50-64 and put at risk the health care of       millions of children and adults with disabilities, and poor       seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term       services and supports.        It could hasten the insolvency of Medicare by up to 4 years       and diminish Medicare's ability to pay for services in the       future.    I remember when Candidate Donald Trump was telling us he would do  nothing to hurt Medicare. Now the first major piece of legislation that  comes up threatens the solvency of Medicare.   Here is what the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and  Medicare said:         [We] oppose the . . . bill to repeal the Affordable Care       Act because it would weaken Medicare's solvency . . .       threaten access to Medicaid long-term care benefits, and       require ``near seniors'' to pay more for less health care       coverage. The . . . bill puts seniors and people with       disabilities at significant risk of ending up uninsured or       losing access to needed care.    In my own State, the Illinois Health and Hospital Association says:         [This organization] has serious concerns with the direction       of the [bill]. It would cut coverage for hundreds of       thousands of Illinoisans and impose a cap on . . . federal       Medicaid funding--our state is unable to absorb funding cuts       without impacting healthcare for all patients.    I was surprised last week when the Republican Governor of Illinois,  Bruce Rauner, said of the Republican plan: ``My first blush read is  Illinois won't do very well under the changes that they're  recommending.''   He is very careful not to say things about Federal legislation. This  he understands: Cutting back on Medicaid is going to impose a new debt  on our State and reduce coverage for hundreds of thousands of people in  our State.   So we said to the Republicans: You want to repeal the Affordable Care  Act; you have been dead set on doing this for 6 years. Please come up  with an alternative that at least expands the coverage of health  insurance and makes it more affordable. They tried, and they failed.  But now they are going to push it through as a matter of showing  political purity. They don't care that there is not a single group of  medical providers in this country who support their plan. They  obviously don't care that the American Association of Retired Persons  believes this is not good for seniors across the board.   I heard the Director of OMB say: Oh, that group--they are going to  end up opposing this and then they are going to ask people to donate.  Well, it is true that they live on donations. But they are taking a  bold position in saying that the Republican approach is going to hurt  seniors across America. Talk to the disability community, and you will  hear exactly the same thing. Talk to the advocates for children.   I am really looking for the first group to stand up and say that this  new Republican approach is good for this country or good for people  when it comes to the cost or availability of health insurance, and I  haven't found it yet. I don't know what they are waiting on, but they  can't produce it.   What we are looking for is just the opposite. If you will take repeal  of the Affordable Care Act off the table, I will pull up a chair. It is  not perfect, it can be improved, and I am ready to sit down and do it  on a bipartisan basis. But it is ``our way or the highway'' when it  comes to the Republican majority on this bill. I hope we can do better.  I think the American people expect us to do better.   At the end of the day, they want a better healthcare system, not one  that is worse--not one that supposedly gives them ``competition and  choice,'' yet they have less coverage in their insurance policies and  end up paying more for it.    I announce that the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Peters) is  necessarily absent.
