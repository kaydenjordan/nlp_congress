 Mr. President, President Trump nominated Stephen  Vaden to be General Counsel for the Department of Agriculture. In that  role, Mr. Vaden will oversee all of the legal services for all  operations and programs of the Department and 250 attorneys nationwide.   Most of Mr. Vaden's experience is not in agriculture or natural  resources issues. Much of his work at the law firm Jones Day focused on  election law, and during the 2016 election cycle, he coauthored amicus  briefs in States where State legislatures had enacted discriminatory  voting laws designed to suppress minority votes following the Supreme  Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder which gutted the Voting Rights  Act of 1965. State legislatures in North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia  took full advantage of the Shelby County ruling that removed previous  preclearance requirements.   In North Carolina, the legislature passed a law changing various  State voting procedures. The legislature utilized racial data on voting  practices in drafting the law, and where they saw voting practices that  were predominately utilized by African American voters, they changed  those voting practices.   Mr. Vaden was one of three attorneys who submitted an amicus brief in  support of the State of North Carolina, for Senators Tillis, Graham,  Cruz, Lee, and the Judicial Education Project. The Jones Day amicus  brief argued that ``North Carolina's race-neutral regulations of the  time, place, and manner of its elections do not violate Section 2 [Of  the Voting Rights Act].'' They further wrote, ``Quite to the contrary,  North Carolina allows all citizens to vote. Although members of  minority races may disproportionately choose, for socio-economic or  other reasons, not to take advantage of this equal opportunity, North  Carolina's practices are not the proximate cause of this phenomenon.''   In its published opinion, the U.S. Court of Appeals strongly  disagreed with that argument and found that the North Carolina State  election law ``targeted African Americans with almost surgical  precision.'' The court further stated, ``We cannot ignore the evidence  that, because of race, the legislature enacted one of the largest  restrictions of the franchise in modern North Carolina history,'' and  ``Faced with this record, we can only conclude that the North Carolina  General Assembly enacted the challenged provisions with discriminatory  intent.''   At the November 9, 2017, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry hearing to consider Mr. Vaden's nomination, I questioned him  about his role in the amicus brief in the North Carolina voting rights  case. I am a firm believer in the right to vote and deeply troubled by  the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals findings that the North Carolina case  involved voter discrimination.   I did not find Mr. Vaden's answers to my questions to be sufficient.  When I asked him if the Judicial Education Project paid Jones Day in  full for their work on the North Carolina case, he simply said, ``As an  associate I did not have access, nor did I participate in the billing  function of the firm.'' I find this answer insufficient.   Also, I noted in my questions to Mr. Vaden that, in my experience as  having been an associate at a law firm, if an associate indicated to a  partner that they did not want to participate in a case, the firm would  certainly defer to their wishes. When I asked Mr. Vaden if he expressed  any concern with participating in the voting rights cases to his  partners at Jones Day, he replied that he did not.   I also note Mr. Vaden's lack of experience in the area of  agriculture. Prior to joining USDA last January, Mr. Vaden had no  particular involvement in any agriculture-specific issues or any  agriculture-specific clients during his tenure at Jones Day. His  nomination is a significant departure by the Trump administration from  the background and experience of previous USDA General Counsel  nominees, Republican or Democrat. For example, during the Obama  administration, Jeff Prieto was a longtime attorney at the Justice  Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division before becoming  USDA General Counsel. His predecessor, Ramona Romero, was an attorney  with a major U.S. agribusiness company involved in a wide range of  agricultural policy and legal issues. Going back to the administration  of George W. Bush, Nancy Bryson was a long-time environment and natural  resources attorney both at the Justice Department and in private  practice.   I am also troubled to learn that the American Federation of  Government Employees, AFGE, came out in opposition to Mr. Vaden's  nomination, citing that one of Mr. Vaden's first official acts at USDA  was to terminate the labor contract between the office and its staff of  250 lawyers and legal professionals nationwide. In their statement, the  AFGE stated that, due to his lack of collaboration and partnership with  Office of General Counsel workers, they believe he will ``continue  creating an agency culture that results in even more unprecedented  levels of poor worker morale, with the potential to negatively impact  the quality of services provided to virtually all Americans.''   For these reasons, I opposed Stephen Vaden's nomination for General  Counsel of the Department of Agriculture.                            ____________________
