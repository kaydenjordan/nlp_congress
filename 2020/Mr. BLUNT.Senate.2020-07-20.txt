 Mr. President, today I stand to recognize a  historic milestone for the U.S. Navy and for the remarkable city of St.  Louis, MO. I am proud that the brandnew USS St. Louis (LCS-19) will be  commissioned August 8, 2020, and begin service as the Navy's newest  littoral combat ship.   The USS St. Louis will be the seventh U.S. Navy ship named for the  city of St. Louis, which is known as the Gateway to the West and serves  as an enduring symbol of our country's westward expansion. From the  early days of American expansion through the Cold War, ships carrying  the name St. Louis have supported U.S. naval operations in many major  conflicts. Historic ships named for the city of St. Louis include an  ironclad gunboat in the Civil War, a troop transport and protected  cruiser during World War I, a light cruiser during World War II, and an  amphibious cargo ship during the Cold War era.   It seems only fitting that the very first USS St. Louis, which dates  back to 1828, was a sail-powered sloop-of-war designed to protect the  United States in its littoral zone. Similarly, today's USS St. Louis, a  Freedom-Class littoral combat ship, boasts the unique capability to  operate in near-shore littoral environments as well as blue-water  missions. In addition to her operational flexibility, the USS St. Louis  has reconfigurable payloads known as mission modules that can be  quickly changed to adapt to shifting requirements. These mission  modules, in combination with crew detachments and air assets, make  littoral combat ships like the USS St. Louis the Swiss Army knives of  the Navy. This ship's innovative technological advances will enhance  our Navy's ability to project power into the littoral regions of the  world in defense of U.S. interests. President Truman, a Missouri  native, once said, ``Carry the battle to them. Don't let them bring it  to you.'' The USS St. Louis will enable the Navy to do just that.   The USS St. Louis also reflects the extraordinary amount of time,  expertise, and craftsmanship necessary to produce this great marvel of  technology and symbol of American freedom. The defense industrial base,  [[Page S4263]]  which employs countless hard-working Americans, is a critical component  of our national defense. Each day that the USS St. Louis sails in  support of her missions around the world will serve as a testament to  the hundreds of thousands of hours necessary to manufacture such an  advanced, impressive ship. Without the contributions of the industrial  base, our Navy would not be able to build the fleet it needs to  confront today's challenges and prepare for future threats.   For decades to come, the USS St. Louis will represent the people of  St. Louis and the Show-Me State of Missouri around the world. I am  proud of the role she will play in defending our Nation and  safeguarding freedom across the globe. I congratulate the ship's  sponsor, Barbara Broadhurst Taylor, along with the Navy and the  officers and crew of the USS St. Louis, on this historic occasion and  wish them all the best as the USS St. Louis enters service.                            ____________________
