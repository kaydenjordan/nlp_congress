 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 7) commending the bravery, courage,  and resolve of the women and men of Iran demonstrating in more than 133  cities and risking their safety to speak out against the Iranian  regime's human rights abuses, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution, as amended, is as follows:                               H. Con. Res. 7         Whereas, on September 16, 2022, 22-year-old Mahsa Amini       passed away in the custody of Iranian ``morality police''       following a 3-day coma due to wounds, including bone       fracture, hemorrhage, and cerebral edema consistent with       severe beating, inflicted by the police for purportedly       wearing a hijab improperly;        Whereas, on September 16, Iranians gathered in the streets       of Tehran to protest the killing of Mahsa Amini;        Whereas demonstrations have since spread to more than 133       cities and 130 universities in Iran, where women are removing       or burning hijabs, cutting their hair, and dancing in front       of Iranian security forces, joined by their fellow Iranian       citizens;        Whereas Iranian security forces have responded to such       demonstrations with violence and detentions, including       detentions of journalists and activists for covering the       protests;        Whereas the security forces have reportedly killed more       than 450 protestors, including at least 58 children; however,       the number of injuries and deaths is likely higher but       unobtainable due to internet blackouts;        Whereas at least 18,000 Iranians have been arrested across       Iran according to official sources, and many thousands more       have been detained according to independent reports;        Whereas videos, images, and demonstrations have spread to       social media platforms and are an important way for the       voices of the Iranian people to be heard;        Whereas internet monitoring groups have reported that the       Iranian regime has--        (1) caused near-total disruption of internet connectivity       in parts of Iran and partial disruptions in city centers; and        (2) blocked WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, Facebook,       Instagram, and video games with chat functions;        Whereas common protest chants include--        (1) ``Women, life, and freedom!'';        (2) ``Iranians die but will not be suppressed!''; and        (3) ``Death to the dictator Ayatollah Ali Khamenei!'';        Whereas the Iranian regime has a long history of structural       and legal discrimination against women, including barriers       for women seeking justice against domestic violence and       criminal prohibitions against women singing or showing hair       in public and studying certain technical subjects;        Whereas the Iranian regime approved of ``depriving one       social right or more'' for any woman who posts an unveiled       picture of herself on social media, and, in August 2022,       approved of enforcing mandatory hijab laws through facial       recognition;        Whereas, through misogynistic criminal statutes, the       Iranian regime for decades has detained and engaged in the       ongoing persecution of women, including--        (1) Saba Kord Afshari, who was sentenced to 15 years in       prison for posting videos to social media without a hijab and       transferred into Ward 6 of the notorious Qarchak Women's       Prison, identified by the Secretary of the Treasury for gross       violations of human rights;        (2) Yasaman Aryani, her mother Monireh Arabshahi, and       Mojgan Keshavarz, who were sentenced to serve five and a half       years in prison for posting a video for International Women's       Day in 2019, during which they walked without headscarves       through a metro train in Tehran, handing flowers to female       passengers;        (3) human rights attorney Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was       sentenced in 2019 to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes for       providing legal defense services to women charged with not       wearing a hijab;        (4) Narges Mohammadi, a prominent rights advocate, who--           (A) was arrested in November 2021 on the second       anniversary of countrywide protests and is currently serving       a 2-year sentence in prison;           (B) was handed a further sentence of 15 months       imprisonment for ``propaganda against the state''; and           (C) previously, had been sentenced to 10 years in prison       in May 2015 for ``establishing an illegal group'', ``assembly       and collusion to act against national security'', and       ``propaganda against the state'';        (5) former Vice President for Women and Family Affairs       Shahindokht Molaverdi, who was charged with encouraging       ``corruption, prostitution, and sexual deviance'', a common       charge against women refusing mandatory hijab laws, and       sentenced in December 2020 to 30 months in prison for       defending the right of women to attend sporting events and       criticizing the practice of child marriage;        (6) six women who were sentenced by the Culture and Media       Court of Tehran in July 2022 to each serve 1 year in prison       for the offense of singing songs in public;        (7) Niloofar Hamedi, one of the first Iranian journalists       to report on Mahsa Amini's death, who was arrested on       September 22, 2022, and is being held in solitary       confinement; and        (8) countless other women; and        Whereas peaceful protests in Iran over the last year have       focused on grievances that include--        (1) mismanagement of the economy and national resources;        (2) prioritization of funding for terror groups and pariah       regimes over social services for the people of Iran; and        (3) widespread political corruption: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That Congress--        (1) condemns--        (A) the brutal beating and death of Mahsa Amini; and        (B) the violent suppression by the Iranian regime of women       and men participating in the current demonstrations,       including children, and calls for transparent accountability       for all killings of protesters by Iranian security forces;        (2) supports the women and men of Iran who are--        (A) participating in the current protests to defend their       fundamental human rights; and        (B) risking their safety to speak out against the human       rights abuses committed by the Iranian regime;        (3) supports internet freedom programs that circumvent the       regime and provide support for VPNs and other alternatives       that can be used to bypass attempts by authoritarian       governments to censor internet access during times of       protest, and commends private entities willing to provide       programs to circumvent such censorship;        (4) encourages continued efforts by the Biden       Administration to respond to the protests, including the       recent sanctioning of the Iranian morality police, and       further encourages the Biden Administration--        (A) to immediately impose, under existing authorities,       additional human rights sanctions on officials and entities       responsible for the repression of the current protests;        (B) to prioritize efforts to expand unrestricted internet       access in Iran, consistent with existing law; and        (C) to work to develop a strategy to prevent the Iranian       regime from obtaining and exploiting facial recognition data       and software for the use of mass surveillance and enforcement       of mandatory hijab;        (5) encourages the private sector, following the recent       clarification by the Biden Administration of sanctions       exemptions on communications technology, to work with the       Biden Administration to ensure protestors and activists have       access to tools needed to circumvent government surveillance       and repression; and        (6) welcomes the efforts of the international community to       support protestors in Iran, and calls on the international       community--        (A) to publicly condemn violence by the Iranian regime       against peaceful protesters;        (B) to speak out against violations by the regime of       fundamental human rights, including the freedom of       expression, assembly, and redress of grievances of the       Iranian people; and        (C) to impose human rights sanctions on officials and       entities that are responsible for the repression of current       protests and involved in violating the human rights of the       Iranian people.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we consider an urgent bipartisan concurrent  resolution condemning the Iranian regime for its gross human rights  abuses against protesters in Iran, who are bravely speaking out and  standing up to this terrorist regime after being brutally silenced for  two generations.   I thank my Democratic co-lead, Mr. Gottheimer, and House Foreign  Affairs Committee Chair McCaul for their support of this resolution.   While I was disappointed we were not able to get this resolution to  the floor last Congress when I partnered with former Congressman  Malinowski, I am grateful that this resolution is now  [[Page H308]]  being brought up for a vote so quickly in our new Congress and with  such broad bipartisan support.   Whether it be China, Iran, or Russia, this new House Republican  majority is ready and willing to stand up to our adversaries and  protect America's vitally important national security interests.   Since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in the custody of  Iran's religious police in September of last year, the Iranian people  have boldly taken to the streets to demand justice. Now, almost 4\1/2\  months later, Iranian men, women, and children continue to protest the  regime and its cruelty, despite the immense risk to themselves and  their families. They are literally risking their lives for a just cause  greater than themselves.   These demonstrations are the most significant popular protests  against the brutal regime's authoritarian rule since it came to power  in 1979. The response from the regime has been vicious, violent, and  vindictive, not surprisingly.   Hundreds of protesters have been murdered by regime security forces.  Thousands more have been detained on trumped-up charges. Many of those  in custody, especially women, have been subject to cruel and inhumane  torture.   The regime has unjustly executed Iranian protesters in sham trials  that lack any modicum of due process. Many dozens more face the  imminent possibility of execution.   The brave Iranian people are not backing down. In fact, they are more  resolved than ever. They are demanding a government that respects their  rights at home, stops funding terrorism abroad, and makes peace with  its neighbors. They are demanding a future built on freedom, justice,  the rule of law, and a chance at prosperity.   It is vital that we, the U.S. Representatives, a body that is among  the greatest symbols of freedom and democracy around the world, stand  with one voice to affirm our support for the brave Iranian people.   The resolution we are considering today does just this. It reaffirms  our resounding support for the brave Iranians who continue to put their  lives on the line to secure their fundamental rights and freedoms.   The resolution is a call to action. It urges the Biden administration  to do more. Instead of negotiating with this brutal regime at a moment  of weakness and true vulnerability, the Biden administration must meet  the moment and do everything in its power to stand with the Iranian  people. It must sanction those responsible for these brutal killings.  It must do everything it can to counter the Iranian regime's cowardly  attempts to restrict internet access that prevents its citizens from  sharing images and videos and communicating with the outside world.   We have the power to give the Iranian people the voice they need to  tell the truth about their oppression at the hands of the Ayatollah,  and we must exercise it.   Finally, the Biden administration must lead the effort to press our  allies and partners around the world to designate the Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization. The Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps uses terror to silence Iranian citizens at  home and targets innocent citizens abroad.   The United States rightly designated the group a Foreign Terrorist  Organization in 2019. Now, the rest of the world must join in this  noble cause. The IRGC's reign of terror must come to an end.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution says loudly, clearly, and with a strong  bipartisan voice that the American people are on the side of the  courageous Iranian people. The U.S. House of Representatives condemns,  in the strongest possible terms, the regime's horrific violence.   Finally, as we recognize the bravery of the protesters in Iran, I  also want to take a moment to remember that we have American citizens  being held hostage in Iran today. These innocent American citizens have  endured years of false allegations, wretched conditions, and separation  from their loved ones simply because they are Americans. They must all  be released. No American can be left behind.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the 60 Members who have cosponsored this  resolution, and I urge the entire House to support its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Meeks for his support, which I  greatly appreciate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, while I am pleased at the bipartisan support of this  resolution, I think it is important to reinforce that there can be no  legitimacy or lifeline for this inhumane regime; that means no  sanctions relief or nuclear negotiations.   Just a few months ago, the Biden administration was actively  negotiating sanctions relief as part of a new nuclear deal with a  regime that is detaining, torturing, and killing its own citizens.   Let me be clear, Iran did not comply with the last nuclear deal. Why  would they comply with a new deal?   The only thing a new nuclear deal could accomplish is giving the  autocratic regime more resources to attack its own people.   Mr. Speaker, I implore the Biden administration to not resume these  foolhardy efforts. We do not negotiate with terrorists, and the  Ayatollah and his regime are terrorists. They use fear, violence, and  intimidation to achieve political goals.   We must return to a position of firm pressure and strong resolve  while enhancing our deterrence in the region. Until this regime changes  its behavior, it must remain under pressure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her  strong compassion for these horrific situations in Iran and for the  women of Iran.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York also for  his compassionate remarks in support of this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Speaker McCarthy, Majority Leader Scalise, Whip  Emmer, and the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr.  McCaul, for prioritizing this important resolution and bringing it to  the floor.   The fact is that this resolution was brought to the floor so quickly  this week because the House majority demonstrates the importance of  this issue.   I want to thank Mr. Meeks for his continued support and help in  ushering through unanimous support for this resolution in the last  Congress. We are finally here getting it through, and I am grateful to  the gentleman for his leadership and also for being so supportive.   Again, I thank Mr. Gottheimer, especially, and Mr. McCaul for  cosponsoring this resolution with me and all the speakers and everyone  who have spoken in support of this resolution. It is important that we  stand as a united voice against the Iranian regime and in support of  the people of Iran.   I say to the people of Iran: We commend your bravery, we mourn your  losses, and the American people are with you as you stand up for  freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
