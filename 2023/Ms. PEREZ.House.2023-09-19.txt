 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to thank president Chris  Bailey, who is retiring after dedicating 12 years to Lower Columbia  College. Throughout his tenure, he diligently served students, staff,  and the community, transforming Lower Community College into a vital  educational hub in the region.   As a testament to Chris' leadership, Lower Columbia College developed  the Lower Columbia Regional Center, enabling folks to work and access  higher education pathways. Chris was pivotal in introducing the  college's first two bachelor of applied science degrees, as well as a  vocational skills center, reflecting his commitment to expanding career  opportunities for those at the college.   We have been lucky to have a leader like Chris at Lower Columbia  College. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chris for his dedication and wish him all  the best in a well-deserved retirement.                          Recognizing Mallonee Farms     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mallonee Farms, a  family-owned dairy farm in my district. A few weeks ago, I was able to  visit the farm in Curtis, Washington, where I met the farm's owner,  Maynard Mallonee. Maynard is a third-generation dairy farmer and a  member of the Organic Valley co-op.   During my visit, I toured their farm, saw their new robotic milkers,  and heard how Congress can support small, organic farms. Maynard is  passionate about working for something bigger than himself. He works to  be a good steward of his land, and he is already taking steps with his  son, Jack, to ensure that the family farm continues for generations to  come.   Everyone at Mallonee Farms is fighting hard for their farm, and I am  grateful to be in this fight with them. My focus is to ensure that  Federal policy supports small, family farms like theirs.           Cowlitz Complex Fires in Gifford Pinchot National Forest     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the Cowlitz Complex  fires in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. Thirty fires might sound  like a bad movie plot, but with 695 acres in flames and 342 hardworking  folks trying to keep it all under control, it is the reality of our  community.   To the diligent task forces--the California Incident Management Team  13 and Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team 2--patrolling and  monitoring the fires, especially around Pothole, Jackpot, and the Adams  Fork regions--your steadfastness does not go unnoticed.   We are thankful that potential threats, like the heat near Pothole,  turned out to be benign. The task forces' preemptive actions are the  backbone of our community's safety.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the folks working these fires. Their tireless  efforts protect our homes, our forests, and our future. Their  commitment to contain these forests showcases the resilience of our  community.         Honoring a Dedicated Public Servant, Sergeant Richard Kelly     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated  public servant and cherished member of our community, Sergeant Richard  Kelly.   On August 10, we lost Sergeant Kelly unexpectedly due to a medical  emergency while in the line of duty. He was only 54.   Sergeant Kelly's commitment to safeguarding our community was  unwavering. He served the Battle Ground Police Department since 2005,  where he ultimately rose to the rank of sergeant in 2019.   Not only was he an officer of the law, he was a husband, father,  brother, and a pillar of our community. He was respected and loved by  all who had the privilege of knowing him.   I personally recall his attentive presence at my Battle Ground  townhall, a testament to his deep sense of duty and connection to the  people that he served. His loss leaves a void in our community and in  the hearts of all who knew him.   Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and  service of Sergeant Richard Kelly. Our thoughts and prayers are with  his family, his colleagues, and the entire Battle Ground community  during this time. May his dedication serve as a lasting inspiration to  us all.      Remembering and Honoring Corporal Zachary ``Zac'' Clayton Merrill     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor Corporal  Zachary ``Zac'' Clayton Merrill, who passed away on August 20.   After graduating from college, Zac joined the Army, distinguishing  himself as captain of the 82nd Airborne and leading an explosive  ordnance team in Afghanistan.    His commitment and valor earned him the Bronze Star, among other  commendations. After the Army, Zac's call to service led him to the  Vancouver Police Department, where he became an integral member of the  crisis negotiation team and was eventually named unit leader. However,  beyond the badges and commendations, Zac was a loving husband, son,  brother, and uncle.   He also had a profound bond with his grandfather, Stanley Merrill,  also a Korean war veteran, which speaks volumes about his deep roots in  service and sacrifice.   Corporal Merrill's legacy of service, both on the battlefield and on  our streets, will forever inspire and remind us of the sacrifices made  by those who choose to serve.   Mr. Speaker, I send my deepest condolences to his family, friends,  and all who had the privilege of knowing him.                            ____________________
