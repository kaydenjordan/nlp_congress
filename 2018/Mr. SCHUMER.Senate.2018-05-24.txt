 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this morning, I would like to address  four issues at varying lengths: recent news on the North Korea summit,  the Russia probe, the proposed recission of Ebola funding, and a word  about the upcoming Memorial Day holiday.
