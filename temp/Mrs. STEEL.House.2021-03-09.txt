 Mr. Speaker, I rise today against the PRO Act.   The PRO Act strips people of their right to work and comes at a time  when our economy has been transformed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now  more than ever, people need more flexibility and independence to work  in the capacity they see fit, not less.   Independent contractors, entrepreneurs, and small businesses in my  home State of California already understand the devastating effects AB- 5 had on their ability to provide for their families. Even in  California, they realized there needed to be exceptions for certain  industries. The PRO Act makes no such exceptions.   The blanket approach that proved to be a disaster in California is  certainly guaranteed to cause more harm to workers at the national  level.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this misguided  legislation and to preserve our constituents' rights to work.
