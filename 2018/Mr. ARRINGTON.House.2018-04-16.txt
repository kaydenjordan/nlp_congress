 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the newest  inductee to the Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame, my former  coach and dear friend, Carl Irlbeck. Mr. Irlbeck coached for 48 years,  had over 1,000 wins, and was the 1994 Texas Basketball Coach of the  Year.   But it is not his win-loss record that will be most remembered; it is  his ability to shape the character of those he coached. The best  coaches teach us how to be successful in the game of life more than any  particular sport, and he did just that for almost five decades.   He taught us that preparation and perspiration were 90 percent of  winning. He preached the importance of playing as a team, and he  modeled grace in victory as well as defeat. I still apply the  principles I learned as a Plainview Bulldog under the strong and loving  leadership of Coach Carl Irlbeck.  [[Page H3332]]    Congratulations to Coach Irlbeck on a much-deserved honor in the  Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame.   God bless the Irlbeck family.   Go Bulldogs, and go west Texas.                            ____________________
