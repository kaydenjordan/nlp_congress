 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Service  Organization Caucus, which highlights the great work of service  organizations across our country, I rise to recognize and honor the  Kiwanis Club of Warren, Pennsylvania.   This month, the Kiwanis Club of Warren is celebrating 100 years of  service. Since July 12, 1922, Kiwanis of Warren have worked toward  fulfilling the mission of Kiwanis International ``to improve the world  one child and one community at a time.''   Their work not only in Warren, but internationally, has made a  positive impact for children and families everywhere.   The Kiwanis Club of Warren has raised funds for a joint effort  between UNICEF and Kiwanis International to eliminate iodine dependency  disorder and maternal neonatal tetanus worldwide.   In addition to the club's global impact, the Warren Kiwanis Club also  makes a difference at home. In efforts to engage the next generation of  service-minded leaders, the Kiwanis Club sponsors three service  leadership programs where participants focus on leadership and  character building.   The Kiwanis Club of Warren also sponsors a variety of community  building events, like the Salvation Army bell ringing and annual blood  screenings.   I congratulate the Kiwanis Club of Warren for 100 years of service.                            ____________________
