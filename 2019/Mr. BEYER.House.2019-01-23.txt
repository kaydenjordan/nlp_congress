 Madam Speaker, my Northern Virginia district includes more  Federal workers--almost 87,000--than any other, and my people are  suffering.   This week we entered the second month of a shutdown which President  Trump began by rejecting a Republican bill which passed overwhelmingly  in the Senate after promising that he would, in fact, shut down the  government.   The undeniable fact is that if the President told Senate Republicans  today to vote for the exact same bill they already passed, the exact  same bill he promised to sign, then this shutdown would end. But he  refuses to do so because his demands are unmet.   President Trump's complaints of a crisis, Madam Speaker, are correct  in one respect: they are a crisis for the people I represent and for  people in every district across this country.   The President has said many things since he promised that he would  shut down the government, but few of his comments are directed to the  Federal workforce. I have gotten many hundreds of calls, emails, and  letters, and they are overwhelmingly opposed to the shutdown. They are  about tuition they can't pay, rent, healthcare premiums, insulin and  other drugs, and groceries.   I am particularly concerned because so many of the folks who work in  northern Virginia have security clearances, and the number one reason  people are denied a security clearance is because of a financial blot  on their record. It is the number one reason their security clearance  is taken away. If they are late on car payments and mortgage payments,  they can actually lose their jobs.   I am concerned about the impact on contractors. These are the folks  like guards at the Smithsonian or food service workers or people in  cleaning crews. They tend to be minimum wage. They tend not to have  savings, and often no benefits. They are not getting paid, and they  have nothing to fall back on. All the people who serve in our  community--waiters, dental hygienists, auto mechanics, and  hairstylists--are seeing their ability to make money day after day  disappear.   President Trump says his shutdown is about making the country safer,  but  [[Page H1008]]  that doesn't make any sense if you talk to the people who are suffering  today. I have heard from furloughed FBI agents, air traffic  controllers, State Department officials, workers at TSA, the Department  of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard, and even Customs and Border  Patrol, and they all vehemently oppose the shutdown.   Madam Speaker, we all support effective border security, but keeping  these people furloughed or making them work unpaid doesn't make us any  safer.   But on the positive side, as the pain has gotten worse for our  community, I have also seen something else, which is that communities  are coming together to make sure that no one gets left behind. Business  after business throughout the country and throughout northern Virginia  are helping with free sandwiches, free meals, and free services.   Nonprofits are stepping up their efforts to meet the worsening  conditions created by the shutdown, and government officials,  furloughed and unfurloughed, are doing everything they can to pitch in  and lighten the blow on their unpaid colleagues.                                time  1100    Yesterday, I was helping serve food to Federal employees at Chef Jose  Andres' World Central Kitchen. There was a line around the block, and  it was D.C. police officers on their lunch break who came to help  serve.   By the way, Madam Speaker, I think I handed out more than 300 meals,  and not a single person said: Open up the government. Give Trump his  wall.   We are better than this. We are good, kind, and industrious. The  American people don't deserve this shutdown.   It is axiomatic that we shouldn't negotiate with hostage takers, but  the President has taken our government hostage. If we give him what he  wants, he may well use this tactic again and again and again.   President Reagan said: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''   We say: President Trump, tear down your wall--your unreasonable  obsession with an obsolete, medieval, ineffective way to secure our  borders--and open up our government.                            ____________________
