Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the U.S. Senate,  counsel for the President.   Almost 170 years ago, Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts took to  the well of the Old Senate Chamber, not far from where I am standing.  He delivered what would become perhaps his most famous address, the  ``Seventh of March'' speech. Webster sought to rally his colleagues to  adopt the Compromise of 1850, a package of legislation that he and  others hoped would forestall a civil war brewing over the question of  slavery.   He said:         It is fortunate that there is a Senate of the United       States; a body not yet moved from its propriety, not lost to       a just sense of its own dignity, and its own high       responsibilities, and a body to which the country looks with       confidence, for wise, moderate, patriotic, and healing       counsels. It is not to be denied that we live in the midst of       strong agitations and are surrounded by very considerable       dangers to our institutions and our government. The       imprisoned winds are let loose . . . but I have a duty to       perform, and I mean to perform it with fidelity--not without       a sense of surrounding dangers, but not without hope.    Webster was wrong to believe that the Compromise of 1850 could  prevent secession of the South, but I hope he was not wrong to put his  faith in the Senate because the design of the Constitution and the  intention of the Framers was that the Senate would be a Chamber removed  from the sway of temporary political winds.   In Federalist 65, Hamilton wrote:         Where else than in the Senate could have been found a       tribal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent?       What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in       its own situation, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the       necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the       representatives of the people, his accusers?    In the same essay, Hamilton explained this about impeachment:         The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which       proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other       words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They       are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be       denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries       done immediately to the society itself.        The prosecution of them, for this reason, will seldom fail       to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide       it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the       accused . . . in such cases there will always be the greatest       danger that the decision will be regulated more by the       comparative strength of parties, than by the real       demonstrations of innocence or guilt.    Daniel Webster and Alexander Hamilton placed their hopes in you, the  Senate, to be the court of greatest impartiality, to be a neutral  representative of the people in determining--uninfluenced by party or  preexisting faction--the innocence or guilt of the President of the  United States.   Today you have a duty to perform, with fidelity, not without a sense  of surrounding dangers, but also not without hope.  [[Page S774]]    I submit to you, on behalf of the House of Representatives, that your  duty demands that you convict President Trump. Now, I don't pretend  that this is an easy process. It is not designed to be easy. It  shouldn't be easy to impeach or convict a President. Impeachment is an  extraordinary remedy, a tool only to be used in rare instances of grave  misconduct, but it is in the Constitution for a reason. In America, no  one is above the law, even those elected President of the United  States. I would say especially those elected President of the United  States.   You have heard arguments from the President's counsel that  impeachment would overturn the results of the 2016 election. You have  heard that, in seeking the removal and disqualification of the  President, the House is seeking to interfere in the next elections.  Senators, neither is true, and these arguments demonstrate a deeply  misguided or, I think, intentional effort to mislead about the role  that impeachment plays in our democracy.   If you believe--as we do and as we have proven--that the President's  efforts to use his official powers to cheat in the 2020 election  jeopardized our national security and are antithetical to our  democratic tradition, then you must come to no other conclusion but  that the President threatens the fairness of the next election and  risks putting foreign interference between the voters and their  ballots.   Professor Dershowitz and the other counselors to the President have  argued that if the President thinks that something is in his interest,  then it is, by definition, in the interest of the American people. We  have said throughout this process that we cannot and should not leave  our common sense at the door. The logical conclusion to this argument  is that the President is the State; that his interests are the Nation's  interests; that his will is necessarily ours. You and I and the  American people know otherwise; that we do not have to be  constitutional scholars to understand that this is a position deeply at  odds with our Constitution and our democracy; that believing in this  argument or allowing the President to get away with misconduct based on  this extreme view would render him above the law.   But we know that this cannot be true. What you decide on these  articles will have lasting implications for the future of the  Presidency, not only for this President but for all future Presidents.  Whether or not the office of the Presidency of the United States of  America is above the law, that is the question.   As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in his 1855 work, ``Democracy in  America,'' ``The greatness of America lies not in being made more  enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair  her faults.''   In May of 1974, Barry Goldwater and other Republican congressional  leaders went to the White House to tell President Nixon that it was  time for him to resign and that they could no longer hold back the tide  of impeachment over Watergate.   Now, contrary to popular belief, the Republican Party did not abandon  Nixon as the Watergate scandal came to light. It took years of  disclosures and crises and court battles. The party stood with Nixon  through Watergate because he was a popular, conservative President, and  his base was with him, so they were, too. But, ultimately, as Goldwater  would tell Nixon, ``There are only so many lies you can take, and now  there has been one too many.''   The President would have us believe that he did not withhold aid to  coerce these sham investigations; that his July 25 call with the  Ukrainian President was ``perfect''; that his meeting with President  Zelensky on the sidelines of the U.N. was no different than a head-of- state meeting in the Oval Office; that his only interest in having  Ukraine announce investigations into the Bidens was an altruistic  concern against corruption; that the Ukrainians interfered in our 2016  election, not Russia; that Putin knows better than our own intelligence  agencies. How many falsehoods can we take? When will it be one too  many?   Let us take a few minutes to remind you one last time of the facts of  the President's misconduct as you consider how you will vote on this  important matter for our Nation. Those facts compel the President's  conviction on the two Articles of Impeachment.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, over the past 2  weeks, the House has presented to you overwhelming and uncontroverted  evidence that President Trump has committed grave abuses of power that  harm our national security and were intended to defraud our elections.   President Trump abused the extraordinary powers he alone holds as  President of the United States to coerce an ally to interfere in our  upcoming Presidential election for the benefit of his own reelection.  He then used those unique powers to wage an unprecedented campaign to  obstruct Congress and cover up his wrongdoing.   As the President's scheme to corrupt our election progressed over  several months, it became, as one witness described, more  ``insidious.'' The President and his agents wielded the powers of the  Presidency and the full weight of the U.S. Government to increase  pressure on Ukraine's new President to coerce him to announce two sham  investigations that would smear his potential election opponent and  raise his political standing.   By early September of last year, the President's pressure campaign  appeared on the verge of succeeding--until, that is, the President got  caught, and the scheme was exposed. In response, President Trump  ordered a massive coverup--unprecedented in American history. He tried  to conceal the facts from Congress, using every tool and legal window  dressing he could to block evidence and muzzle witnesses. He tried to  prevent the public from learning how he placed himself above country.   Yet, even as President Trump has orchestrated this coverup and  obstructed Congress's impeachment inquiry, he remains unapologetic,  unrestrained, and intent on continuing his sham to defraud our  elections. As I stand here today delivering the House's closing  argument, President Trump's constitutional crimes--his crimes against  the American people and the Nation--remain in progress.   As you make your final determination on the President's guilt, it is  therefore worth revisiting the totality of the President's misconduct.  Doing so lays bare the ongoing threat President Trump poses to our  democratic system of government, both to our upcoming election that  some suggest should be the arbiter of the President's misconduct and to  the Constitution itself that we all swore to support and defend.   Donald Trump was the central player in this corrupt scheme, assisted  principally by his private attorney, Rudy Giuliani.   Early in 2019, Giuliani conspired with two corrupt former Ukrainian  prosecutors to fabricate and promote phony investigations of wrongdoing  by former Vice President Joe Biden as well as the Russian propaganda  that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the DNC in 2016.   In the course of their presentation to you, the President's counsel  have made several remarkable admissions that affirm core elements of  this scheme, including specifically about Giuliani's role and  representation of the President.   The President's counsel have conceded that Giuliani sought to  convince Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and have alleged Ukraine  election interference on behalf of his client, the President, and that  the President's focus on these sham investigations was significantly  informed by Giuliani, whose views the President adopted.   Compounding this damning admission, the President's counsel have also  conceded that Giuliani was not conducting foreign policy on behalf of  the President. They have confirmed that, in pursuing these two  investigations, Giuliani was working solely in the President's private,  personal interest, and the President's personal interest is now clear-- to cheat in the next election.   As Giuliani would later admit, for the President's scheme to succeed,  he first needed to remove the American Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie  Yovanovitch--an anti-corruption champion Giuliani viewed as an obstacle  who ``was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.''  In working with now-indicted associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman,  Giuliani orchestrated a bogus, monthslong  [[Page S775]]  smear campaign against the Ambassador that culminated in her removal in  April.   The President's sudden order to remove our Ambassador came just 3  days after Ukraine's Presidential elections in late April, which saw a  reformer, Volodymyr Zelensky, sweep into office on an anti-corruption  platform. President Trump called to congratulate Zelensky right after  his victory. He invited President Zelensky to the White House, and he  agreed to send Vice President Pence to his inauguration. But 3 weeks  later, after Rudy Giuliani was denied a meeting with President  Zelensky, President Trump abruptly ordered Vice President Pence to  cancel his trip. Instead, a lower level delegation, led by three of  President Trump's political appointees--Secretary of Energy Rick Perry,  Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and Special  Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker--attended  Zelensky's inauguration the following week.   These three returned from Ukraine and were impressed with President  Zelensky. In a meeting shortly thereafter with President Trump in the  Oval Office, they relayed their positive impression of the new  Ukrainian President and encouraged President Trump to schedule the  White House meeting he promised in his first call, but President Trump  reacted negatively. He railed that Ukraine ``tried to take me down'' in  2016, and in order to schedule a White House visit for President  Zelensky, President Trump told the delegation that it would have to  ``talk to Rudy.''   It is worth pausing here to consider the importance of this meeting  in late May. This is the moment when President Trump successfully  hijacked the tools of our government to serve his corrupt personal  interests--when the President's ``domestic political errand,'' as one  witness famously described it, began to overtake and subordinate U.S.  foreign policy and national security interests.   By this point in the scheme, Rudy Giuliani was advocating very  publicly for Ukraine to pursue the two sham investigations, but his  request to meet with President Zelensky was rebuffed by the new  Ukrainian President. According to reports about Ambassador Bolton's  account--soon to be available if not to this body then to bookstores  near you--the President also unsuccessfully tried to get Bolton to call  the new Ukrainian President to ensure he would meet with Giuliani.   The desire for Ukraine to announce these phony investigations was for  a clear and corrupt reason--because President Trump wanted the  political benefit of a foreign country's announcing that it would  investigate his rival. That is how we know without a doubt that the  object of the President's scheme was to benefit his reelection  campaign--in other words, to cheat in the next election.   Ukraine resisted announcing the investigations throughout June, so  the President and his agent, Rudy Giuliani, turned up the pressure-- this time, by wielding the power of the U.S. Government.   In mid-June, the Department of Defense publicly announced that it  would be releasing $250 million of military assistance to Ukraine.  Almost immediately after seeing this, the President quietly ordered a  freeze on the assistance to Ukraine. None of the 17 witnesses in our  investigation were provided with a credible reason for the hold when it  was implemented, and all relevant agencies opposed the freeze.   In July, Giuliani and the President's appointees made it clear to  Ukraine that a meeting at the White House would only be scheduled if  Ukraine announced the sham investigations. According to a July 19 email  the White House has tried to suppress, this ``drug deal,'' as  Ambassador Bolton called it, was well known among the President's most  senior officials, including his Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, and  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and it was relayed directly to senior  Ukrainian officials by Gordon Sondland on July 10 at the White House.  ``Everyone was in the loop.''   Although President Zelensky explained that he did not want to be a  ``pawn'' in Washington politics, President Trump did not care. In fact,  on July 25, before President Trump spoke to President Zelensky,  President Trump personally conveyed the terms of this quid pro quo to  Gordon Sondland, who then relayed the message to Ukraine's President.   Later that morning, during the now-infamous phone call, President  Trump explicitly requested that Ukraine investigate the Bidens and the  2016 election. Zelensky responded as President Trump instructed: He  assured President Trump that he would undertake these investigations.  After hearing this commitment, President Trump then reiterated his  invitation to the White House at the end of the call.   No later than a few days after the call, the highest levels of the  Ukrainian Government learned about the hold on military assistance.  Senior Ukrainian officials decided to keep quiet, recognizing the harm  it would cause to Ukraine's defense, to the new government's standing  at home, and to its negotiating posture with Russia. Officials in  Ukraine and the United States hoped the hold would be reversed before  it became public. As we now know, that was not to be.   As we have explained during the trial, the President's scheme did not  begin with the July 25 call, and it did not end there either. As  instructed, a top aide to President Zelensky met with Giuliani in early  August, and they began working on a press statement for Zelensky to  issue that would announce the two sham investigations and lead to a  White House meeting.   Let's be very clear here. The documentary evidence alone--the text  messages and the emails that we have shown you--confirms definitively  the President's corrupt quid pro quo for the White House meeting.  Subsequent testimony further affirms that the President withheld this  official act--this highly coveted Oval Office meeting--to apply  pressure on Ukraine to do his personal bidding.   The evidence is unequivocal.   Despite this pressure, by mid-August President Zelensky resisted such  an explicit announcement of the two politically motivated  investigations desired by President Trump. As a result, the White House  meeting remained unscheduled, just as it remains unscheduled to this  day.   During this same timeframe in August, the President persisted in  maintaining the hold on the aid, despite warnings that he was breaking  the law by doing so, as an independent watchdog recently confirmed that  he did.   According to the evidence presented to you, the President's entire  Cabinet believed he should release the aid because it was in the  national security interest of our country. During the entire month of  August, there was no internal review of the aid. Congress was not  notified, nor was there any credible reason provided within the  executive branch.   With no explanation offered and with the explicit, clear, yet  unsuccessful quid pro quo for the White House meeting in the front of  his mind, Ambassador Sondland testified that the only logical  conclusion was that the President was also withholding military  assistance to increase the pressure on Ukraine to announce the  investigations. As Sondland and another witness testified, this  conclusion was as simple as two plus two equals four. If the White  House meeting wasn't sufficient leverage to extract the announcement he  wanted, Trump would use the frozen aid as his hammer.   Secretary Pompeo confirmed Sondland's conclusion in an August 22  email. It is also clear that Vice President Pence was aware of the quid  pro quo over the aid and was directly informed of such in Warsaw on  September 1, after the freeze had become public and Ukraine became  desperate. Sondland pulled aside a top aide in Warsaw and told him that  everything--both the White House meeting and also the security  assistance--were conditioned on the announcement of the investigations  that Sondland, Giuliani, and others had been negotiating with the same  aide earlier in August.   This is an important point. The President claims that Ukraine did not  know of the freeze in aid, though we know this to be false. As the  former Deputy Foreign Minister has admitted publicly, they found out  about it within days of the July 25 call and kept it quite. But no one  can dispute that even after the hold became public on August 28,  President Trump's representatives continued their efforts to secure  [[Page S776]]  Ukraine's announcement of the investigations. This is enough to prove  extortion in court, and it is certainly enough to prove it here.   If that wasn't enough, however, on September 7, more than a week  after the aid freeze became public, President Trump confirmed directly  to Sondland that he wanted President Zelensky in a ``public box'' and  that his release of the aid was conditioned on the announcement of the  two sham investigations. Having received direct confirmation from  President Trump, Sondland relayed the President's message to President  Zelensky himself.   President Zelensky could resist no longer. America's military  assistance makes up 10 percent of his country's defense budget, and  President Trump's visible lack of support for Ukraine harmed his  leverage in negotiations with Russia. President Zelensky affirmed to  Sondland on that same telephone call that he would announce the  investigations in an interview on CNN. President Trump's pressure  campaign appeared to have succeeded.   Two days after President Zelensky confirmed his intention to meet  President Trump's demands, the House of Representatives announced its  investigation into these very issues. Shortly thereafter, the inspector  general of the intelligence community notified the communities that the  whistleblower complaint was being improperly handled--or was improperly  withheld from Congress with the White House's knowledge.   In other words, the President got caught, and 2 days later, on  September 11, the President released the aid. To this day, however,  Ukraine still has not received all of the money Congress has  appropriated and the White House meeting has yet to be scheduled.   The identity of the whistleblower, moreover, is irrelevant. The House  did not rely on the whistleblower's complaint, even as it turned out to  be remarkably accurate. It does not matter who initially sounded the  alarm when they saw smoke. What matters is that the firefighters-- Congress--were summoned and found the blaze, and we know that we did.   The facts about the President's misconduct are not seriously in  dispute. As several Republican Senators have acknowledged publicly, we  have proof that the President abused his power in precisely the manner  charged in article I. President Trump withheld the White House meeting  and essential, congressionally appropriated military assistance from  Ukraine in order to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the upcoming  Presidential election on his behalf.   The sham investigations President Trump wanted announced had no  legitimate purpose and were not in the national interest, despite the  President's counsel's troubling reliance on conspiracy theories to  claim the President acted in the public interest.   The President was not focused on fighting corruption. In fact, he was  trying to pressure Ukraine's President to act corruptly by announcing  these baseless investigations. And the evidence makes clear that the  President's decision to withhold Ukraine's military aid is not  connected in any way to purported concerns about corruption or burden- sharing.   Rather, the evidence that was presented to you is damning, chilling,  disturbing, and disgraceful. President Trump weaponized our government  and the vast powers entrusted to him by the American people and the  Constitution to target his political rival and corrupt our precious  elections, subverting our national security and our democracy in the  process. He put his personal interests over those of the country, and  he violated his oath of office in the process.    But the President's grave abuse of power did not end there. In  conduct unparalleled in American history, once he got caught, President  Trump engaged in categorical and indiscriminate obstruction of any  investigation into his wrongdoing. He ordered every government agency  and every official to defy the House's impeachment inquiry, and he did  so for a simple reason: to conceal evidence of his wrongdoing from  Congress and the American people.   The President's obstruction was unlawful and unprecedented, but it  also confirmed his guilt. Innocent people don't try to hide every  document and witness, especially those that would clear them. That is  what guilty people do. That is what guilty people do. Innocent people  do everything they can to clear their name and provide evidence that  shows that they are innocent.   But it would be a mistake to view the President's obstruction  narrowly, as the President's counsel have tried to portray it. The  President did not defy the House's impeachment inquiry as part of a  routine interbranch dispute or because he wanted to protect the  constitutional rights and privileges of his Presidency. He did it  consistent with his vow to ``fight all subpoenas.''   The second article of impeachment goes to the heart of our  Constitution and our democratic system of government. The Framers of  the Constitution purposefully entrusted the power of impeachment in the  legislative branch so that it may protect the American people from a  corrupt President.   The President was able to undertake such comprehensive obstruction  only because of the exceptional powers entrusted to him by the American  people, and he wielded that power to make sure Congress would not  receive a single record or a single document related to his conduct and  to bar his closest aides from testifying about his scheme. Throughout  the House's inquiry, just as they did during the trial, the President's  counsel offered bad-faith and meritless legal arguments as transparent  window dressing intended to legitimize and justify the President's  efforts to hide evidence of his misconduct.   We have explained why all of these legal excuses hold no merit, why  the House's subpoenas were valid, how the House appropriately exercised  its impeachment authority, how the President's strategy was to stall  and obstruct. We have explained how the President's after-the-fact  reliance on unfounded and, in some cases, brand-new legal privileges  are shockingly transparent cover for a President's dictate of blanket  obstruction. We have underscored how the President's defiance of  Congress is unprecedented in the history of our Republic, and we all  know that an innocent person would eagerly provide testimony and  documents to clear his name, as the President apparently thought he was  doing, mistakenly, when he released the call records of his two  telephone calls with President Zelensky.   And even as the President has claimed to be protecting the  Presidency, remember that the President never actually invoked  executive privilege throughout this entire inquiry, a revealing fact,  given the law's prohibition on invoking executive privilege to shield  wrongdoing.   And yet, according to the President's counsel, the President is  justified in resisting the House's impeachment inquiry. They assert  that the House should have taken the President to court to defy the  obstruction. The President's argument is as shameless as it is  hypocritical. The President's counsel is arguing in this trial that the  House should have gone to court to enforce its subpoenas, while at the  same time, the President's own Department of Justice is arguing in  court that the House cannot enforce the subpoenas through the courts.  And you know what remedy they say in court is available to the House?  Impeachment for obstruction of Congress.   This is not the first time this argument has been made. President  Nixon made it too, but it was roundly rejected by the House Judiciary  Committee 45 years ago, when the committee passed an article for  obstruction of Congress for a far less serious objection than we have  here. The committee concluded that it was inappropriate to enforce its  subpoenas in court and, as the slide shows:         The Committee concluded that it would be inappropriate to       seek the aid of the courts to enforce its subpoenas against       the President. This conclusion is based on the constitutional       provision vesting the power of impeachment solely in the       House of Representatives and the express denial by the       Framers of the Constitution of any role for the courts in the       impeachment process.    Again, the committee report on Nixon's Articles of Impeachment.   Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Once we strip the President's obstruction of  this legal window dressing, the consequences are as clear as they are  dire for our democracy. To condone the President's obstruction would  strike a deathblow to the impeachment clause in the Constitution. And  if the Congress cannot enforce this sole power  [[Page S777]]  vested in both Chambers alone, the Constitution's final line of defense  against a corrupt Presidency will be eviscerated.   A President who can obstruct and thwart the impeachment power becomes  unaccountable. He or she is effectively above the law. And such a  President is more likely to engage in corruption with impunity. This  will become the new normal with this President and for future  generations.   So where does this leave us? As many of you in this Chamber have  publicly acknowledged in the past few days, the facts are not seriously  in dispute. We have proved that the President committed grave offenses  against the Constitution. The question that remains is whether that  conduct warrants conviction and removal from office.   Should the Senate simply accept or even condone such corrupt conduct  by a President? Absent conviction and removal, how can we be assured  that this President will not do it again? If we are to rely on the next  election to judge the President's efforts to cheat in that election,  how can we know that the election will be free and fair? How can we  know that every vote will be free from foreign interference solicited  by the President himself?   With President Trump, the past is prologue. This is neither the first  time that the President solicited foreign interference in his own  election, nor is it the first time that the President tried to obstruct  an investigation into his misconduct. But you will determine--you will  determine--you will determine whether it will be his last.   As we speak, the President continues his wrongdoing unchecked and  unashamed. Donald Trump hasn't stopped trying to pressure Ukraine to  smear his opponent, nor has he stopped obstructing Congress. His  political agent, Rudolph Giuliani, recently returned to the scene of  the crime in Ukraine to manufacture more dirt for his client, the  President of the United States.   President Trump remains a clear and present danger to our national  security and to our credibility around the world. He is decimating our  global standing as a beacon of democracy while corrupting our free and  fair elections here at home.   What is a greater protection to our country than ensuring that we,  the American people, alone, not some foreign power, choose our  Commander in Chief? The American people alone should decide who  represents us in any office without foreign interference--particularly  the highest office in the land. And what could undermine our national  security more than to withhold from a foreign ally fighting a hot war  against our adversary hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid  to buy sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, radar and  night vision goggles, so that they may fight the war over there,  keeping us safe here?   If we allow the President's misconduct to stand, what message do we  send? What message do we send to Russia, our adversary intent on  fracturing democracy around the world?   What will we say to our European allies, already concerned with this  President, about whether the United States will continue to support our  NATO commitments that have been a pillar of our foreign policy since  World War II? What message do we send to our allies in the free world?   If we allow this President's conduct to stand, what will we say to  the 68,000 men and women in uniform in Europe right now who  courageously and admirably wake up every day ready and willing to fight  for America's security and prosperity, for democracy in Europe and  around the world? What message do we send them when we say  America's national security is for sale?    That cannot be the message we want to send to our Ukrainian friends  or our European allies or to our children and our grandchildren who  will inherit this precious Republic, and I am sure it is not the  message that you wish to send to our adversaries.   The late Senator John McCain was an astounding man--a man of great  principle, a great patriot. He fought admirably in Vietnam and was  imprisoned as a POW for over 5 years, refusing an offer by the North  Vietnamese to be released early because his father was a prominent  admiral. As you all are aware, Senator McCain was a great supporter of  Ukraine, a great supporter of Europe, a great supporter of our troops.  Senator McCain understood the importance of this body--this  distinguished body--and serving the public, once saying: ``Glory  belongs to the act of being constant to something greater than  yourself, to a cause, to your principles, to the people on whom you  rely and who rely on you.''   The Ukrainians and the Europeans and the Americans around the world  and here at home are watching what we do. They are watching to see what  the Senate will do, and they are relying on this distinguished body to  be constant to the principles America was founded on and which we tried  to uphold for more than 240 years.   Doing the right thing and being constant to our principles requires a  level of moral courage that is difficult but by no means impossible. It  is that moral courage shown by public servants throughout this country  and throughout the impeachment inquiry in the House.   People like Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch--her decades of nonpartisan  service were turned against her in a vicious smear campaign that  reached all the way to the President. Despite this effort, she decided  to honor a duly authorized congressional subpoena and to speak the  truth to the American people. For this, she was the subject of yet more  smears against her career and her character even as she testified in a  public hearing before Congress. Her courage mattered.   People like Ambassador Bill Taylor, a West Point graduate who wears a  Bronze Star and an Air Medal for valor and, his proudest honor, the  Combat Infantryman Badge. When his country called on him, he answered  again and again and again, in battle and foreign affairs and in the  face of a corrupt effort by the President to extort a foreign country  into helping his reelection campaign--an effort that Ambassador Taylor  rightly believed was ``crazy.'' His courage mattered.   People like LTC Alexander Vindman, who came to this country as a  young child fleeing authoritarianism in Eastern Europe--he could have  done anything with his life, but he, too, chose public service, putting  on a uniform and receiving a Purple Heart after being wounded in battle  fighting courageously in Iraq. When he heard that fateful July 25 call,  in which the President sold out our country for his own personal gain,  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman reported it and later came before Congress  to speak the truth about what happened. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's  courage mattered.   To the other public servants who came forward and told the truth in  the face of vicious smears, intimidation, and White House efforts to  silence you, your courage mattered. You did the right thing. You did  your duty. No matter what happens today or from this day forward, that  courage mattered.   Whatever the outcome in this trial, we will remain vigilant in the  House. I know there are dedicated public servants who know the  difference between right and wrong. But make no mistake, these are  perilous times if we determine that the remedy for a President who  cheats in an election is to pronounce him vindicated and attack those  who expose his misconduct.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, before we break, I want to take a  moment to say something about the staff who have worked tirelessly on  the impeachment inquiry and this trial for months now. There is a small  army of public servants down the hall from this Chamber, in offices  throughout the House, and, yes, in that windowless bunker in the  Capitol, who have committed their lives to this effort because they,  like the managers and the American people, believe that a President  free of accountability is a danger to the beating heart of our  democracy.   I am grateful to all of them, but let me mention a few: Daniel  Goldman, Maher Bitar, Rheanne Wirkkala, Patrick Boland, William Evans,  Patrick Fallon, Sean Misko, Nicolas Mitchell, Daniel Noble, Diana  Pilipenko, Emilie Simons, Susanne Grooms, Krista Boyd, Norm Eisen,  Barry Berke, Joshua Matz, Doug Letter, Sarah Istel, Ashley Etienne,  Terri McCullough, Dick Meltzer, and Wyndee Parker. Some of those staff,  including some singled out in this Chamber, have been made to endure  the most vicious false attacks to the point where they feel their lives  have been put at risk.   The attacks on them degrade our institution and all who serve in it.  You  [[Page S778]]  have asked me why I hired certain of my staff, and I will tell you-- because they are brilliant, hard-working, patriotic, and the best  people for the job, and they deserve better than the attacks they have  been forced to suffer.   Members of the Senate, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to close this  portion of our statement by reading you the words of our dear friend  and former colleague in the House, the late Elijah Cummings, who said  this on the day the Speaker announced the beginning of the impeachment  inquiry:         As elected Representatives, [he said], of the American       people, we speak not only for those who are here with us now,       but for generations yet unborn. Our voices today are messages       to a future we may never see. When the history books are       written about this tumultuous era, I want them to show that I       was among those in the House of Representatives who stood up       to lawlessness and tyranny.    We, the managers, are not here representing ourselves alone or even  just the House, just as you are not here making a determination as to  the President's guilt or innocence for yourselves alone. No, you and we  represent the American people, the ones at home and at work who are  hoping that their country will remain what they have always believed it  to be: a beacon of hope, of democracy, and of inspiration to those  striving around the world to create their own more perfect unions--for  those who were standing up to lawlessness and to tyranny.   Donald Trump has betrayed his oath to protect and defend the  Constitution, but it is not too late for us to honor ours and to wield  our power to defend our democracy. As President Abraham Lincoln said at  the close of his Cooper Union Address on February 27, 1860, ``[n]either  let us be slandered from our duty by false accusations against us, nor  frightened from it by menaces of destruction to the Government nor of  dungeons to ourselves. Let us have faith that right makes might, and in  that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand  it.''   Today, we urge you--in the face of overwhelming evidence of the  President's guilt and knowing that, if left in office, he will continue  to seek foreign interference in the next election--to vote to convict  on both Articles of Impeachment and to remove from office, Donald J.  Trump, the 45th President of the United States.   Mr. Chief Justice, we reserve the balance of our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess     Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, we will take a 30- minute break for lunch.   There being no objection, at 12:02 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 12:51 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will come to order.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader  McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, Senators. Thank you very much, on  behalf of all of us, for your continued attention. Today we are going  to complete our argument and finish our closing argument. We will  complete that in a very efficient period of time.   You understand the arguments that we have been making, and at the end  of the day, the key conclusion--we believe, the only conclusion--based  on the evidence and based on the Articles of Impeachment themselves and  the Constitution is that you must vote to acquit the President. At the  end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one  election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins  today in Iowa. And we believe that the only proper result, if we are  applying the golden rule of impeachment, if we are applying the rules  of impeachment that were so eloquently stated by Members of the  Democratic Party the last time we were here--the only appropriate  result here is to acquit the President and to leave it to the voters to  choose their President.   With that, I will turn it over to Judge Ken Starr, and we will move  through a series of short presentations.   Thank you.   Mr. Counsel STARR. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, Majority  Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, House impeachment managers  and their very able staff, as World War I, the war to end all wars, was  drawing to a close, an American soldier sat down at a piano and  composed a song. It was designed to be part of a musical review for his  Army camp out on Long Island, Suffolk County.   The song was ``God Bless America.'' The composer, of course, was  Irving Berlin, who came here at the age of 5, the son of immigrants who  came to this country for freedom.   As composers are wont to do, Berlin worked very carefully with the  lyrics. The song needed to be pure. It needed to be above politics,  above partisanship. He intended it to be a song for all America, but he  intended it to be more than just a song. It was to be a prayer for the  country.   As your very distinguished Chaplain, RADM Barry Black, has done in  his prayers on these long days that you have spent as judges in the  High Court of Impeachment, we have been reminded of what our country is  all about and that it stands for one nation under God. Nation is about  freedom.   And we hear the voice of Martin Luther King, Jr., and his dream- filled speech about freedom echoing the great passages inscribed on  America's temple of justice, the Lincoln Memorial, which stood behind  Dr. King as he spoke on that historic day. Dr. King is gone, felled by  an assassin's bullet, but his words remain with us. And during his  magnificent life, Dr. King spoke not only about freedom, freedom  standing alone; he spoke frequently about freedom and justice. And in  his speeches he summoned up regularly the words of a Unitarian  abolitionist from the prior century, Theodore Parker, who referred to  the moral arc of the universe--the long moral arc of the universe  points toward justice--freedom and justice--freedom, whose contours  have been shaped over the centuries in the English-speaking world by  what Justice Benjamin Cardozo called the authentic forms of justice  through which the community expresses itself in law. Authentic.  Authenticity.   And at the foundation of those authentic forms of justice is  fundamental fairness. It is playing by the rules. It is why we don't  allow deflated footballs or stealing signs from the field. Rules are  rules. They are to be followed.   And so I submit that a key question to be asked as you begin your  deliberations: Were the rules here faithfully followed? If not, if that  is your judgment, then, with all due respect, the prosecutors should  not be rewarded, just as Federal prosecutors are not rewarded. You  didn't follow the rules. You should have.   As a young lawyer, I was blessed to work with one of the great trial  lawyers of his time, and I asked him: Dick, what's your secret?   He had just defended, successfully, a former United States Senator  who was charged with a serious offense--perjury before a Federal grand  jury. His response was simple and forthright. His words could have come  from prairie lawyer Abe Lincoln: I let the judge and the jury know that  they can believe and trust every word that comes out of my mouth. I  will not be proven wrong.   So here is a question, as you begin your deliberations: Have the  facts as presented to you as a court, as the High Court of Impeachment,  proven trustworthy? Has there been full and fair disclosure in the  course of these proceedings? Fundamental fairness?   I recall these words from the podium last week. A point would be made  by one of the President's lawyers, and then this would follow: The  House managers didn't tell you that. Why not? And again: The House  managers didn't tell you that. Why not?   At the Justice Department, on the fifth floor of the Robert F.  Kennedy Building, is this simple inscription: ``The United States wins  its point whenever justice is done its citizens in the courts.'' Not  did we win, not did we convict; rather, the moral question: Was justice  done?   Of course, as has been said frequently, the House of Representatives  does, under our Constitution, enjoy the sole power of impeachment. No  one has disputed that fact. They have got the power, but that doesn't  mean that anything goes. It doesn't mean that the House cannot be  called to account in the High Court of Impeachment for its actions in  exercising that power.   A question to be asked: Are we to countenance violations of the rules  and  [[Page S779]]  traditional procedures that have been followed scrupulously in prior  impeachment proceedings? And the Judiciary Committee, the venerable  Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives--compare and  contrast the thoroughness of that committee in the age of Nixon, its  thoroughness in the age of Clinton with all of its divisiveness within  the committee in this proceeding.   A question to be asked: Did the House Judiciary Committee rush to  judgment in fashioning the Articles of Impeachment? Did it carefully  gather the facts, assess the facts before it concluded? We need nothing  more than the panel of very distinguished professors and the splendid  presentations by both the majority counsel and the minority counsel.   We asked some questions. The Republicans asked some questions. We  heard their answers. We are ready to vote. We are ready to try this  case in the High Court of Impeachment.   What was being said in the sounds of silence was this: We don't have  time to follow the rules. We won't even allow the House Judiciary  minority members, who have been beseeching us time and again, to have  their day--just one day--to call their witnesses. Oh yes, that is  expressly provided for in the rules, but we will break those rules.   That is not liberty and justice for all.   The great political scientist of yesteryear, Richard Neustadt of  Columbia, observed that the power of the President is ultimately the  power to persuade--oh yes, the Commander in Chief, and, yes, charged  with the conduct and authority to guide the Nation's foreign relations,  but ultimately it is the power to persuade.   I suggest to you that so, too, the House's sole power to impeach is  likewise ultimately a power to persuade over in the House.   A question to be asked: In the fast-track impeachment process in the  House of Representatives, did the House majority persuade the American  people--not just partisans; rather, did the House's case win over the  overwhelming majority of consensus of the American people?   The question fairly to be asked: Will I cast my vote to convict and  remove the President of the United States when not a single member of  the President's party--the party of Lincoln--was persuaded at any time  in the process?   In contrast, and when I was here last week, I noted for the record of  these proceedings that in the Nixon impeachment, the House vote to  authorize the impeachment inquiry was 410 to 4. In the Clinton  impeachment--divisive, controversial--31 Democrats voted in favor of  the impeachment inquiry. Here, of course, and in sharp contrast, the  answer is, none.   It is said that we live in highly and perhaps hopelessly partisan  times. It is said that no one is open to persuasion anymore. They are  getting their news entirely from their favorite media platform, and  that platform of choice is fatally deterministic.   Well, at least the decision of decision makers under oath, who are  bound by sacred duty, by oath, or affirmation to do impartial justice,  leaves the platforms out. Those modern-day intermediaries and shapers  of thought, of expression, of opinion, are outside these walls where  you serve.   Finally, does what is before this court--very energetically described  by the able House managers but fairly viewed--rise to the level of a  high crime or misdemeanor, one so grave and so serious to bring about  the profound disruption of the article II branch, the disruption of the  government, and to tell the American people--and, yes, I will say this  is the way it would be read--``Your vote in the last election is hereby  declared null and void. And by the way, we are not going to allow you,  the American people, to sit in judgment on this President and his  record in November''? That is neither freedom, nor is it justice. It is  certainly not consistent with the most basic freedom of ``we the  people,'' the freedom to vote.   I thank the court.   I yield to my colleague, Mr. Purpura.   Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, good  afternoon. I will be relatively brief today and will not repeat the  arguments that we have made throughout, but I want to highlight a few  things.   There are a number of reasons why the Articles of Impeachment are  deficient and must fail. My colleagues have spent the past week  describing those reasons. In my time today, I would like to review just  a few core facts, which, again, remember, are all drawn from the record  on which the President was impeached in the House and that the House  managers brought to this body in support of the President's removal.   First, the President did not condition security assistance or a  meeting on anything during the July 25 call. In fact, both Ambassador  Yovanovitch and Mr. Tim Morrison confirmed that the Javelin missiles  and the security assistance were completely unrelated.   The concerns that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman expressed on the call  were, by his own words and admission, based on deep policy concerns.   And remember, as we said before and everyone in this room knows, the  President sets the foreign policy; the unelected staff implements the  foreign policy.   Others on the call, including Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's boss, Mr.  Morrison, as well as LTG Keith Kellogg, had no such concerns and have  stated that they heard nothing improper, unlawful, or otherwise  troubling on the July 25 call.   Second, President Zelensky and his top advisers agreed that there was  nothing wrong with the July 25 call and that they felt no pressure from  President Trump. President Zelensky said that the call was ``good,''  ``normal,'' and ``no [one] pushed me.''   President Zelensky's top adviser, Andriy Yermak, was asked if he had  ever felt there was a connection between the U.S. military aid and the  request for investigations. He was adamant that ``we never had that  feeling. . . . We did not have the feeling that this aid was connected  to any one specific issue.'' Several other top Ukrainian officials have  said the same both publicly and in readouts of the July 25 call to  Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and others.    Third, President Zelensky and the highest levels of the Ukrainian  Government did not learn of the pause until August 28, 2019--more than  a month after the July 25 call between President Trump and President  Zelensky.   President Zelensky himself said:         I had no idea the military aid was held up. When I did find       out, I raised it with Pence at a meeting in Warsaw.    Referring to the Vice President.   The meeting in Warsaw took place 3 days after the POLITICO article  was published, on September 1, 2019.   Mr. Yermak likewise said that President Zelensky and his key advisers  learned of the pause only from the August 28 POLITICO article.   Just last week, while we were in this trial, Oleksandr Danylyuk,  former chairman of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council,  said he first found out that the United States was withholding aid to  Ukraine by reading POLITICO's article published August 28. Mr. Danylyuk  also said there was panic within the Zelensky administration when they  found out about the hold from the POLITICO article, indicating that the  highest levels of the administration were unaware of the pause until  the article was published.   If that is not enough, Ambassador Volker, Ambassador Taylor, Deputy  Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, and Mr. Morrison also  testified that the Ukrainians did not know about the security hold  until the POLITICO article on August 28. We showed you the text message  from Mr. Yermak to Ambassador Volker just hours after the POLITICO  article was published. You also remember all of the high-level,  bilateral meetings at which the Ukrainians did not bring up the pause  in the security assistance because they did not know about it. When  they did find out on August 28, they raised the issue at the very next  meeting in Warsaw on September 1.   This is a really important point. As Ambassador Volker testified, if  the Ukrainians didn't know about the pause, then there was no leverage  implied. That is why the House managers have kept claiming and  continued to claim throughout the trial that the high-level Ukrainians  somehow knew about the pause before late August. That is inaccurate.   We pointed out that Laura Cooper, on whom they rely, testified she  didn't really know what the emails she saw  [[Page S780]]  relating to security assistance were about.   We told you that Catherine Croft, who worked for Ambassador Volker,  couldn't remember the specifics of when she believed the Ukrainian  Embassy learned of the pause and that she didn't remember when news of  the pause became public.   The House managers also mentioned Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, who  claimed to have vague recollections of fielding unspecified queries  about aid from Ukrainians in the mid-August timeframe. But Lieutenant  Colonel Vindman ultimately agreed that the Ukrainians first learned  about the hold on security assistance probably around when the first  stories emerged in the open source.   Former Deputy Foreign Minister Olena Zerkal's claim that she knew  about the pause in July is inconsistent with statements by her boss,  the then-Foreign Minister of Ukraine, who said that he learned of the  pause from a news article, of which the August 28 POLITICO article was  the first, as well as those of all of the other top-level Ukrainian  officials I have mentioned, the testimony of the top U.S. diplomats  responsible for Ukraine, and the many intervening meetings at which the  pause was not mentioned.   Fourth, none of the House witnesses testified that President Trump  ever said there was any linkage between security assistance and  investigations. When Ambassador Sondland asked the President on  approximately September 9, the President told him:         I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.    Before he asked the President, Ambassador Sondland presumed and told  Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Morrison that there was a connection between  the security assistance and the investigations. That was before he  asked the President directly.   Even earlier, on August 31, Senator Ron Johnson asked the President  if there was any connection between security assistance and  investigations. The President answered:         No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?    Under Secretary of State David Hale, Mr. Kent, and Ambassador Volker  all testified that they were not aware of any connection whatsoever  between security assistance and investigations.   The House managers repeatedly point to a statement by Acting Chief of  Staff Mick Mulvaney during an October press conference. When it became  clear that the media was misinterpreting his comments or that he had  simply misspoken, Mr. Mulvaney promptly, on the very day of the press  conference, issued a written statement making clear that there was no  quid pro quo. Here is his statement:         Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo       between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the       2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any       money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the       server.        The only reasons we were holding the money was because of       concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns       over corruption. Accordingly, Mr. Mulvaney in no way       confirmed the link between the paused security assistance       and investigations. A garbled or misinterpreted statement       or a mistaken statement that is promptly clarified on the       same day as the original statement is not the kind of       reliable evidence that would lead to the removal of the       President of the United States from office. In any event,       Mr. Mulvaney also stated during the press conference       itself that the money held up had absolutely nothing to do       with Biden.    Now, why does this all matter? I think Senator Romney really got to  the heart of this issue on Thursday evening when he asked both parties  whether there is any evidence that President Trump directed anyone who  tell the Ukrainians that security assistance was being held up on the  condition of an investigation into the Bidens. That was the question.  There is no such evidence.   Fifth, the security assistance was released when the President's  concerns with burden-sharing and corruption were addressed by a number  of people, including some in this Chamber today, without Ukraine ever  announcing or undertaking any investigations. You have heard repeatedly  that no one in the administration knew why the security assistance was  paused. That is not true. Two of the House managers' own witnesses  testified regarding the reason for the pause. As Mr. Morrison testified  at a July meeting attended by officials throughout the executive branch  agencies, the reason provided for the pause by a representative from  the Office of Management and Budget was that the President was  concerned about corruption in Ukraine and he wanted to make sure  Ukraine was doing enough to manage that corruption. Further, according  to Mark Sandy, Deputy Associate Director for National Security, Office  for Management and Budget, we had received requests for additional  information on what other countries were contributing to Ukraine.   We told you about the work that was being done to monitor and collect  information about anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine and burden-sharing  during the summer pause. We told you about how, when President Zelensky  asked Vice President Pence in Poland about the pause, Vice President  Pence asked, according to Jennifer Williams, what the status of his  reform efforts were that he could then convey back to the President and  also wanting to hear if there was more that European countries could do  to support Ukraine. Mr. Morrison, who was actually at the Warsaw  meeting, testified similarly that Vice President Pence delivered a  message about anti-corruption and burden-sharing.   We told you about the September 11 call with President Trump, Senator  Portman, and Vice President Pence. Mr. Morrison testified that the  entire process culminating in the September 11 call gave the President  the confidence he needed to approve the release of the security sector  assistance, all without any investigations being announced.   Now, I focused so far on the House managers' allegation that there  was a quid pro quo for the security assistance. Let me turn very  briefly to the claim that a Presidential meeting was also conditioned  on investigations. Remember, by the end of the July 25 call, President  Trump had personally invited President Zelensky to meet three times-- twice by phone, once in a letter, without any preconditions. You heard  the White House was working behind the scenes to schedule the meeting  and how difficult scheduling those meetings can be. The two Presidents  planned to meet in Warsaw, just as President Zelensky requested on the  July 25 call. President Trump had to cancel at the last minute due to  Hurricane Dorian. President Trump and President Zelensky then met 3  weeks later in New York without Ukraine announcing any investigations.   Finally, one thing that the House managers' witnesses agreed upon was  that President Trump has strengthened the relationship between the U.S.  and Ukraine and has been a better friend to Ukraine and a stronger  opponent of Russian aggression than President Obama. Most notably,  Ambassador Taylor, Ambassador Volker, and Ambassador Yovanovitch all  testified that President Trump's reversal of his predecessor's refusal  to send the Ukrainians lethal aid was a meaningful and significant  policy development and improvement for which President Trump deserves  credit.   Just last week, Ambassador Volker, who knows more about U.S.-Ukraine  relationships than nearly, if not, everyone, published a piece in  Foreign Policy magazine. I would like to read you an excerpt:         Beginning in mid-2017, and continuing until the impeachment       investigation began in September 2019, U.S. policy toward       Ukraine was strong, consistent, and enjoyed support across       the administration, bipartisan support in Congress, and       support upon U.S. allies and in Ukraine itself.        The Trump administration also coordinated Ukraine policy       closely with allies in Europe and Canada--maintaining a       united front against Russian aggression and in favor of       Ukraine's democracy, reform, sovereignty, and territorial       integrity. Ukraine policy is one of the few areas where U.S.       and European policies have been in lockstep. The       administration lifted the Obama-era ban on the sale of lethal       arms to Ukraine, delivering, among other things, Javelin       anti-tank missiles, coast guard cutters, and anti-sniper       systems. Despite the recent furor over the pause in U.S.       security assistance this past summer, the circumstances of       which are the topic of impeachment hearings, U.S. defensive       support for Ukraine has been and remains robust.    And more, according to Ambassador Volker:         It is therefore a tragedy for both the United States and       Ukraine that U.S. partisan politics, which have culminated in       the  [[Page S781]]       ongoing impeachment process, have left Ukraine and its new       reform-minded president, Volodymyr Zelensky, exposed and       relatively isolated. The only one who benefits from this is       Russian President Vladimir Putin.    Those are the words of Ambassador Volker. He was one of the House  managers' key witnesses. He was the very first witness to testify in  the House proceedings on October 3. So I think it is fitting that he  may be the last witness we hear from. In his parting words, Ambassador  Volker admonishes that it is U.S. partisan politics which have  culminated in this impeachment process that have imperiled Ukraine.   In sum, the House managers' case is not overwhelming, and it is not  undisputed. The House managers bear the very heavy burden of proof.  They did not meet it. It is not because they didn't get the additional  witnesses or documents that they failed to pursue. It is because their  witnesses have already offered substantial evidence undermining their  case, and, important, as you have heard from Professor Dershowitz and  from Mr. Philbin, the first article does not support or allege an  impeachable offense regardless of any additional witnesses or  documents.   Members of the Senate, it has been an incredible honor and privilege  to speak to you in this Chamber. I hope that what I have shown has been  helpful to your understanding of the facts, and I respectfully ask you  to vote to acquit the President of the wrongful charges against him.   I yield to Mr. Philbin.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, we  have heard repeatedly throughout the past week and a half or so that  the President is not above the law, and I would like to focus in my  last remarks here on an equally important principle--that the House of  Representatives also is not above the law in the way they conduct the  impeachment proceedings and bring a matter here before the Senate,  because in very significant and important respects, they didn't follow  the law.   From the outset, they began an impeachment inquiry here without a  vote from the House and, therefore, without lawful authority delegated  to any committees to begin an impeachment inquiry against the President  of the United States. That was unprecedented in our history. The  Speaker of the House does not have authority, by holding a press  conference, to delegate the sole power of impeachment from the House to  a committee, and the result was 23 totally unauthorized and invalid  subpoenas were issued at the beginning of this impeachment hearing.   After that, the House violated every principle of due process and  fundamental fairness in the way the hearings were conducted, and we  have been through that. I am not going to go through the details again,  but it is significant because denying the President the ability to be  present through counsel to cross-examine witnesses and present evidence  fundamentally skewed the proceedings in the House of Representatives.  It left the President without the ability to have a fair proceeding,  and it meant it reflected the fact that those proceedings were not  truly designed as a search for truth. We have procedural protections.  We have the right of cross-examination as a mechanism for getting to  the facts, and that was not present in the House of Representatives.   Lastly, Manager Schiff, as an interested witness who had been  involved in--or at least his staff--discussions with the whistleblower,  then guided factual inquiry in the House.   So why does all of this matter? It matters because the lack of a vote  meant that there was no democratic accountability and no lawful  authorization from the beginning of the process. It meant that there  were procedural defects that produced a record that this Chamber can't  rely on for any conclusion other than to reject the Articles of  Impeachment and to acquit the President. And it matters because the  President, in response to these violations of the President's rights-- the failure to follow proper procedure, failure to follow the law--has  rights of his own, rights of the executive branch to be asserted. And  that is the President's response to the invalid subpoenas--that they  are invalid, and we are not going to comply with them.   And the President asserted other rights of the executive branch. When  there were subpoenas for his senior advisers to come and testify, along  with virtually every President since Nixon, he asserted the principle  of immunity of the senior advisers, that they could not be called to  testify. And the President asserted the defects in the subpoenas that  called for executive branch officials to testify without the presence  of agency counsel--all established principles that have been asserted  before.   What do the House managers say in response? They accuse the President  in their second article of impeachment of trying to assert  obstruction--that this was an unprecedented response and unprecedented  refusal to cooperate. It was unprecedented the 23 subpoenas were issued  in a Presidential impeachment inquiry without valid authorization from  the House. The President's response was to a totally unprecedented  attempt by the House to do that which it had no authority to do. They  have asserted today and on other occasions that the President's legal  argument in response to these subpoenas--they have said that it is  indiscriminate. There was just a blanket defiance. I think I have shown  that wasn't true. There were three very specific legal rationales  provided by the executive branch as to different defects and different  subpoenas, and there were letters explaining those defects. But there  was no attempt by the House to attempt an accommodations process, even  though the White House offered to engage in an accommodations process.  There was no attempt by the House to use other mechanisms to resolve  the differences with the executive branch. It was just straight to  impeachment.   Now, they asserted today and on other occasions that the President's  counsel--that I and my colleagues--have made bad-faith legal arguments.  They were just window dressings.   In an ordinary court of law, one doesn't accuse opposing counsel of  making bad-faith arguments like that, and if you make that accusation,  it has to be backed up with analysis, but there hasn't been analysis  here. There has just been accusation.   When the President asserts the immunity of his senior advisers, that  is a principle that has been asserted by virtually every President  since Nixon. Let me read you what Attorney General Janet Reno, during  the Clinton administration, said about this exact immunity. She said  that immediate advisers to the President are immune from being  compelled to testify before Congress. ``The immunity such advisers  enjoy from testimonial compulsion by a congressional committee is  absolute and may not be overborne by competing congressional  interests.''   And she went onto say: ``Compelling one of the President's immediate  advisers to testify on a matter of executive decision-making would also  raise serious constitutional problems, no matter the assertion of  congressional need.''   Was that bad faith? Was Attorney General Reno asserting that  principle in bad faith, and President Clinton?   President Obama asserted the same principle for his senior political  advisers. Was that bad faith?   Of course not.   These are principles defending the separation of powers that  Presidents have asserted for decades. President Trump was defending the  institutional interests of the Office of the Presidency and is  asserting the same principles here. That is vital for the continued  operation of the separation of powers.   The House managers have also said that, once the President asserted  these defects in their subpoenas and resisted them, they had no time to  do anything else. They had to go straight to impeachment. They could  not accommodate. They could not go through a contempt process. They  could not litigate.   The idea that there is no time for dealing with that friction with  the executive branch is really antithetical to the proper functioning  of the separation of powers. It goes against part of the way the  separation of powers is supposed to work. That interbranch friction is  meant to take time to resolve. It is meant to slow things down and to  be somewhat difficult to work through and to force the branches to work  together to accommodate the interests of each branch, not just to jump  to the conclusion of, well, we have no  [[Page S782]]  time for that. We have to assert absolute authority on one side of the  equation.   This is something that Justice Brandeis pointed out in a famous  dissent in Myers v. United States, but it has since been cited many  times by the Court majority.   He said: ``The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by  the Convention of 1787, not to promote efficiency''--so he is saying  not to make government move quickly--``but to preclude the exercise of  arbitrary power. The purpose was not to avoid friction but, by means of  the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the  governmental powers among the three departments, to save the people  from autocracy.''   That is a vitally important principle. The friction between the  branches, even if it means taking longer, even if it means not jumping  straight to impeachment, is part of the constitutional design, and it  is required to force the branches to determine incrementally where  their interests lie, to resolve disputes incrementally, and not to jump  straight to the ultimate nuclear weapon of the Constitution.   We have also heard from the House managers that everything the  President did here in asserting the prerogatives of his office--in  asserting the principles of immunity--must be wrong, must be rejected  because only the guilty will assert a privilege; only the guilty will  not allow evidence.   That is definitely not a principle of American jurisprudence. It is  antithetical to the fundamental principles of our system of laws. As we  have pointed out in our trial memorandum in Bordenkircher v. Hayes and  in other decisions, the Supreme Court has made clear that the very idea  of punishing someone for asserting rights or privileges or suggesting  that asserting the right or privilege is evidence of guilt is contrary  to basic principles of due process.   It takes on an even more malignant tenor to it when that principle is  asserted in the context of a dispute between the branches relating to  the boundaries of their relative powers, because what the House is  essentially asserting in this case is that any assertion of the  prerogatives of the Office of the President--any attempt to maintain  the principles of separation of powers of executive confidentiality  that have been asserted by past Presidents--can be treated by the House  as evidence of guilt. And here, their entire second Article of  Impeachment is structured on the assumption that the House can treat  the assertion of principles grounded in the separation of powers as an  impeachable offense.   Boiled down to its essence, it is an assertion that defending the  separation of powers--if the President does it in a way that they don't  like and in a time that they don't like--can be treated as an  impeachable offense. That is an incredibly dangerous assertion because,  if it were accepted, it would fundamentally alter the balance between  the different branches of our government.   It would suggest--and Professor Turley explained this, and Professor  Dershowitz explained it here--that, if Congress makes a demand on the  executive and the executive resists based on separation of powers  principles that past Presidents have asserted, Congress can nonetheless  say: We have decided to proceed by impeachment.   This is the principle they assert in the House Judiciary Committee's  report: We have the sole power of impeachment. That means we are the  sole judge of our own actions. There is no need for accommodation, and  there is no need for the courts. We will determine that any resistance  you provide is itself impeachable.   That would fundamentally transform our government by essentially  giving the House the same sort of power as a parliamentary system--to  use impeachment as an effective vote of ``no confidence'' against a  Prime Minister. This is not the way the Framers set up our three-branch  system of government with a powerful Executive who would be independent  from the legislature. That is why Professor Turley explained that the  second Article of Impeachment here would be an abuse of power by  Congress. It would make the Executive dependent on Congress in a manner  antithetical to the system that the Framers had envisioned.   So why is it that there are all of these defects in the House  managers' case for impeachment? Why are they asserting principles like  ``only the guilty would assert privileges''? That is not a part of our  system of law. Why are they asserting that, if the Executive resists,  the House has the sole power to determine the boundaries of its own  power in relation to the Executive? That is also not something that is  in our system of jurisprudence. And why the lack of due process in the  proceedings below?   I think, as we have explained, it is because this was a purely  partisan impeachment from the start. It was purely partisan and purely  political, and that is something that the Framers foresaw.   I will point to one passage from Federalist No. 65. There are a  number of different passages from that which have been cited over the  course of the past week, but I don't think this one has. It is just  after Hamilton points out--he warns--that an impeachment in the House  could be the result of the ``persecution of an intemperate or designing  majority in the House of Representatives.''   Then he goes on: ``Though this latter supposition may seem harsh, and  might not be likely often to be verified, yet it ought not to be  forgotten that the demon of faction will, at certain seasons, extend  his sceptre over all numerous bodies of men.''   Now, that is very 18th century language. We don't talk about demons  extending their scepters over men, but it is prescient nonetheless. We  might not be comfortable with the terms, but it is accurate for what  can happen, and that is what has happened in this impeachment.    This was a purely partisan, political process. It was opposed  bipartisanly in the House. It was done by a process that was not  designed to persuade anyone or to get to the truth or to provide  process and abide by past precedents. It was done to get it finished by  Christmas, on a political timetable, and it is not something that this  Chamber should condone. That in itself provides a sufficient and  substantial reason for rejecting the Articles of Impeachment.   Members of the Senate, it has been an honor to be able to address you  over the past week and a half or 2 weeks, and I thank you for your  attention.   I yield to Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader McConnell,  Democratic Leader Schumer, House managers, I want to join my colleagues  in thanking you for your patience over these 2 weeks.   I want to focus on one last point. We believe that we have  established overwhelmingly that both Articles of Impeachment have  failed to allege impeachable offenses and that, therefore, both  articles--I and II--must fail.   This entire campaign of impeachment--that started from the very first  day the President was inaugurated--is a partisan one, and it should  never happen again. For 3 years, this push for impeachment came  straight from the President's opponents, and when it finally reached a  crescendo, it put this body--the U.S. Senate--into a horrible position.   I want to start by taking a look back.   On the screen is a graphic of a Washington Post headline on January  20, 2017: ``The Campaign to impeach President Trump has begun.'' This  was posted 19 minutes after he was sworn in.   I also want to play a video in which Members, as early as January 15,  2017--before the President was sworn into office--were calling for his  impeachment.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate, sitting as a Court of Impeachment, stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, at 2:59 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will call the role.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Presiding Officer of the Senate be authorized to appoint a committee on  the part of the Senate to join with the like committee on the part of  the House of Representatives to escort the President of the United  States into the House Chamber for the joint session to be held at 9  p.m. on Tuesday, February 4, 2020.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the  order of January 31 to allow the Senators to have until Wednesday,  February 26, 2020--that would be the Wednesday after we come back--to  have printed statements and opinions in the Congressional Record, if  they choose, explaining their votes and include those in the  documentation of the impeachment proceedings; finally, I ask that the  two-page rule be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Tuesday, February 4; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use  later in the day; and that following leader remarks, the Senate be in a  period of morning business under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the  [[Page S806]]  previous order, following the remarks of Senators Murkowski and Cortez  Masto.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
