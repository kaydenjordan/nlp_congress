 Mr. Speaker, in 2019, Donald Trump attempted to extort  the President of Ukraine by withholding military aid unless Zelenskyy  agreed to announce a sham investigation of Joe Biden. The evidence of  Trump's impeachable offenses was overwhelming, and Trump was impeached.   In 2020, after losing the election, Trump incited a violent  insurrection against our own government. The evidence of that high  crime was witnessed by everyone in this Chamber. He was impeached  again.   In 2023, Donald Trump is once again seeking illicit help in his  campaign, this time by badgering Republicans to impeach Joe Biden. Even  with no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden, Republicans are all  too willing to do it.   There is a through line to all of this.   Donald Trump will violate the law and Constitution to gain power and  to keep it, and Republicans will enable him every step of the way no  matter how destructive the consequences to our institutions or to the  country.
