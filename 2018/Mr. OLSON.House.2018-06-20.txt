 Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this House Energy and Commerce  Special Order is to talk about America's energy dominance, especially  with natural gas.   This conversation is very important today because the World Gas  Conference happens in this town, Washington, D.C., next week. What a  difference a decade makes.   When I joined Texas Senator Phil Gramm's office in 1998, one ugly  word described American oil and natural gas. That word was peak.   Experts, here and around the world, said America had peaked in our  production of oil and natural gas.   Every year, we would buy more oil and gas from foreign sources, and  we had to buy oil from some companies that didn't like us very much and  hurt us by taking oil away.   No one cared about a group called OPEC until they stopped the flow of  oil that they had and that we needed.   OPEC was led by Arab nations who were upset that we resupplied our  best ally ever, Israel, when they were invaded by their neighbors. It  happened  [[Page H5350]]  in 1973. It happened again in 1979. Gas prices doubled overnight.   In 1979, I had just gotten my driver's license. My job was to take  our family cars and fill them with gas that had gotten down to a  quarter of a gallon in the tank. I got in line for 45 minutes or maybe  as long as an hour. We could only purchase 20 gallons of gasoline. We  could only buy that gasoline on days per your license plate. If the  last number was odd, buy gas on an odd day. Even, even day.   Heck, a guy on a lawn mower was behind me getting gas one day. That  is how bad it was just one decade ago.   But thanks to the American private sector and our ingenuity,  hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling, America has a whole new  world order for energy. We have global energy dominance, and that is  what we are here to talk about today, that special happening right now  in America.   Right now, our country, America, is the number one producer of oil  and gas in the entire world. Our natural gas increasingly powers our  homes and our businesses, making our air cleaner and our economy  stronger, especially on the Gulf Coast, where I am from.   OPEC knows their days of controlling the market and punishing people  for bad actions they perceive are over. They have right now, as we  speak, flooded the market with oil to try to keep prices low and stop  America's newfound energy dominance. They have tried and they have  failed.   We had more oil and gas than they had. We have that gas, and now we  are letting the free market take over, and we have a lot more who can  tap that in a moment's notice.   And this doesn't just mean affordable power and gasoline at home. It  also means American jobs.   One study last year said over 800,000 jobs in the gas and oil  industry came to our country for this renaissance. This renaissance,  this dominance, has allowed us to export natural gas and oil for the  first time since 1975. Over 40 years not on the market.   We are going from basically zero exports of natural gas to 10 billion  cubic feet per day in exports.   It wasn't long ago we were building terminals to import natural gas,  and now we are reversing them to export natural gas. That is what  American energy dominance looks like.   And as we say in Texas, there is a new sheriff in the global natural  gas market, and that sheriff's name is Uncle Sam.   And these huge exports of natural gas are helping America export  liquid freedom to friends we want to help, and hurt those who use  energy as a weapon to control other countries.   For too long, a former KGB spy and Russia's de facto dictator,  Vladimir Putin, has controlled nations that escaped the Iron Curtain  when the Berlin Wall fell in 1991. Nations like Lithuania, Estonia,  Poland, and Ukraine were still beholden to what Ted Poe calls the  Napoleon of Siberia, Mr. Putin.   If they did not do what Mr. Putin wanted, they lost all power.  Summers were scorching; winters were bitter cold. Comply or punish. You  are not free.   America, right now, is taking these weapons away from Mr. Putin.  Cheap natural gas takes away the hooks of tyranny.   This is important even for countries that don't buy our gas because  our gas is making the market a true market with competition and lower  prices. That market puts a lid on bad actors and what they can charge.   But sadly, this explosion, this dominance, caught the previous  administration by surprise and we were way behind the curve in getting  our natural gas on the global market.   Good news: The Energy and Commerce Committee stepped up in this  Congress to make sure we get these exports going and these projects  approved quickly.                                time  1715    We made sure they are safe, great for our environment, with minimal  impacts, and we take all of the local concerns into account. But red  tape and these silly delays hurt us. We have stopped that and have got  a free market going in so many important ways.   In this Congress, the 115th Congress, we are using this new  opportunity to expand our Nation's energy dominance with natural gas.  This means, for the whole world, cheaper, cleaner power, the jobs that  come with that, and it brings American jobs back home from overseas.   Right now, America is exporting freedom to friends and allies and  taking away a monopoly from bad actors. Get ready, world. Uncle Sam is  coming to your neighborhood, your hometown.   I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), chairman of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for his comments to  remind the American people and the entire world that this American  dominance of natural gas has made America's air cleaner for global  emissions.   As the chairman knows, America has reduced gas emissions 11 percent  in the last decade. I told that to people in India this past March and  they were stunned.   How did you guys do that? Our air is so dirty? What should we do?   It is simple: Buy American liquified natural gas.   And they are doing that right now.   The next speaker is a good friend from Ohio, a man who Mr. Putin  fears because he has control of what is called the Utica shale play in  Ohio.   A man from India, Prime Minister Modi from India, loves Bill Johnson  from the great State of Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Ohio. I also thank my  dear friend for reminding me that Utica is the Marcellus in your  district. It also reminded me over and over of the benefits the  gentleman has had in Ohio. Rough parts in the country had some bad  years, some down times. We have something that Texas called the Eagle  Ford shale play that goes down from basically San Antonio to Laredo, a  rough part of Texas, not very much growth there. When Zavala happened  back home--I was down there about 3 years ago--a man got his first  royalty check. He was thrilled. He goes to his bank to deposit, in his  Sunday best suit, and says to the guy there: Put this in my account.   His banker said: Great, I got it.   He puts it in his account. He comes back and says: Okay, that is  100,000--whoa, whoa, whoa--100,000? I thought it was 1,000.   His mind could not see the zeros, the periods, and the commas. We  changed his world with American ingenuity.   The next person up is the former leader of this committee, the  chairman, a proud Texas Aggie, and the single most strongest force to  get the crude export ban lifted that was installed in 1975, Chairman  Joe Barton from Ennis, Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from Texas. I want to  thank my dear friend for also saying the name of George Mitchell. As  you know, George Mitchell revolutionized our energy with hydraulic  fracturing, directional drilling of the Barnett shale play by Fort  Worth. It took Mr. Mitchell 35 or 36 wells to drill before the first  one came back viable.                                time  1745    That money was private sector money, not money from D.C. The private  sector made this revolution possible. I thank the gentleman for  reminding us about what happened.   By the way, people think the gentleman's car may be there, the  Corvette convertible, in the background. It looks like a 1959, maybe a  1963.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), a  good friend and also a doctor    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Johnson), my cohost, to follow up the comments of Dr. Bucshon as we  transition to going overseas.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Duncan), from the home of William Barret Travis, the commander of  the Alamo.    Mr. Speaker, since I have known the gentleman, he has been  a champion for American energy independence. Drill, baby, drill. Frack,  baby, frack.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus),  the chairman of the Environment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, this was not coordinated. We came together  with pictures of the Independence. But my friend knows this better than  I do. How many people turn out--those are ordinary people--to watch a  tanker come into port? Why are they coming out to watch that tanker? It  is because they know that tanker is their freedom from Mr. Putin and  Russia.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Colorado for his  comments. The gentleman is always welcome here. I thank my friend for  pointing out the fact that, we think oil and gas in America, we think  the coasts: the Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast, Atlantic Coast.   But my friend enlightened us. It is not just the coasts. It is the  heart and soul of America, the interior, States like Colorado, Wyoming,  North Dakota. All these States have shale plays. All these States are  booming now with American energy production.   I would like to close with a couple comments and maybe take a tour of  the world as it stands today.   We started exporting our natural gas less than 2 years ago. Right  now, 29 countries have received American liquified natural gas. Those  countries are Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, China,  the Dominican Republic, Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait,  Lithuania, Malta, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, Panama, Poland,  Portugal, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UAE,  and the UK.   American energy has touched the entire world. They are feeling our  dominance in a very healthy and great way. We are giving them their  freedom. Liquid American freedom is on the market right now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
