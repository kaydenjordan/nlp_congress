 Mr. Speaker, since his first day in office, President  Biden has actively worked to weaken our southern border through radical  open border policies that have resulted in the worst border crisis in  our Nation's history, turning every community--including mine, the  Sixth District of Virginia--into a border community.   Despite the President's and Secretary Mayorkas' desperate attempts to  downplay the crisis and tell Americans to deal with it, the facts don't  lie.   Under Biden's failed leadership, Border Patrol officials have  encountered a record high of more than 5 million illegal immigrants at  our southern border, and nearly 2 million of them have been released in  the United States by the Department of Homeland Security. At the same  time, over 1.5 million known got-aways have illegally crossed the  border undetected.   From halting construction of the border wall to reinstituting Obama- era catch-and-release policies and deciding to halt title 42, President  Biden has willingly and knowingly failed to protect the southern border  and uphold the rule of law.   Now our Border Patrol is underresourced, our national security is  jeopardized, and drug cartels are empowered to smuggle deadly fentanyl  into our interior.   In fact, Virginia communities are being overrun. According to the  Virginia Department of Health, in 2021, Virginia had a 15 percent  increase in overdoses from 2020, with synthetic fentanyl being the  leading cause of those 2,033 deaths.   This is an invasion, and it must be stopped. House Republicans know  that border security is national security, which is why we have brought  to the floor H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act.   The Judiciary Committee played a leading role in crafting this  legislation, and I am proud of the work we have done to make this the  strongest border security package that Congress has ever considered.  However, we must get it enacted.   H.R. 2 will secure America's borders by improving the asylum system,  deploying urgent resources to the southern and northern borders-- including walls, manpower, and technologies--and ending incentives for  illegal immigration.   Mr. Speaker, innocent lives are at stake. Our Nation's sovereignty is  at stake. We owe it to the American people to tackle Biden's disastrous  border crisis. That starts with passing this legislation, and I urge  every one of my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill to  address this national crisis.                                time  1045    Congratulating State Champions Glenvar High School Boys Indoor Track                               and Field Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Glenvar High  School Boys Indoor Track and Field Team on winning the combined class  \1/2\ State championship held at Liberty University.   The Glenvar Highlanders won the trophy at the 2-day meet with a score  of 58 points, a 9-point victory over the runners-up.   Glenvar's senior Heath Bowker dominated the meet, winning the boys  500-meter dash in 1:08:20.   Highlanders Jackson Swanson, Zach Curfiss, Avone Noel, and Heath  Bowker joined forces to win the 4x200 relay in 1:33:25.

Congratulating Northside High School State Championship Boys Basketball                                    Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Northside  High School boys basketball team on winning the Virginia Class 3  Basketball State Championship held at the VCU Siegel Center.   The win marked the second basketball State championship in school  history and the first since 2019.   Northside came out strong, leading by 17 in the first quarter. As the  game entered the final minutes, Northside was down by 4, but this squad  dug deep to come out with the trophy and pull out the 58-52 victory  against Hopewell.   The Vikings' final push was led by double-digit scorers, Lawrence  Cole, Cy Hardy, and Mykell Harvey, a trio that combined for the 53 of  the Vikings' 58 points.   I extend congratulations to all the players, including Cy Hardy,  Xavier Garrison, Nick Crawford, David Via, Mykell Harvey, Michael  Pankey, Kai Logan, Jamareay Lavender, Javin Gibson, Will Smith, Kavon  Brown, along with special recognition to seniors Ja'Chan Anthony,  Lawrence Cole, Jayden Smith, Elijah Trigg. Congratulations also to the  head coach, Billy Pope, and assistants Jake Paysour and Josh Malave.   Congratulations again to all the players, coaches, parents, and staff  on a historic season.
