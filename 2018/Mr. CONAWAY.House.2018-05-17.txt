 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Newhouse for his commitment to  ensuring that American farmers and ranchers maintain the tools  necessary to remain competitive on the global stage.   As you well know, trade is of immense importance to the agricultural  industry, with U.S. agricultural exports estimated at $140 billion per  year and trade accounting for one of every $5 of agricultural  production value.   Through its extensive farm bill hearing series and listening  sessions, the committee heard from every segment of the agricultural  industry about the importance of maintaining support for our trade  promotion and our market development programs, especially considering  the uncertainty in the current trade climate.   While I am confident that America's farmers and ranchers are  incredibly efficient and can compete with anyone in the world on a  level playing field, they simply cannot be expected to compete against  foreign treasuries on their own.   So in addition to maintaining and strengthening the farm safety net,  H.R. 2 restores and increases funding for the popular and successful  Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program.   This was no small feat, considering the CBO zeroed out funding for  FMD as well as the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops Program in  its most recent baseline projections.   But the committee worked together to get creative and make it happen.   I certainly wish we could have come closer to answering the calls for  doubling funding for MAP and FMD, but am proud of the work we did, and  believe that the streamlined International Market Development Program  will give the newly established USDA Undersecretary for Trade and  Foreign Agricultural Affairs the tools necessary to continue tearing  down barriers to trade and opening up new markets to U.S. agricultural  products.   That said, we can always do better, so I am committed to working with  Mr. Newhouse and my colleagues in the Senate to continue searching for  additional funding for these important trade promotion efforts while we  move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I am very appreciative of Mr. Newhouse's efforts and his  support for these important programs. I look forward to working with  him in conference when the Senate gets their work done after we get our  bill passed.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2.    Mr. Chairman, just simply, I support the gentleman's  amendment. It is common sense. It allows Alaskans to do a better job of  taking care of Alaska, and I trust them to make that happen.   Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment and urge adoption.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Tipton) having assumed the chair, Mr. Weber of Texas, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2)  to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other  programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in extreme opposition to Ms. Foxx's  amendment.   She singles out sugar, cuts its program back to where it was 33 years  ago, and denigrates the hardworking men and women who are farmers.  Those processors she mentioned are co-op-owned; they are owned by those  hardworking farmers. There is no inactivity with respect to the sugar  industry. She couldn't be more wrong or more disrespectful of them.   Her amendment would not save the taxpayer one dime. Fifteen out of  the last 16 years, the sugar program has worked. The reason we have not  changed it over all those years is because it does work. If we were to  move it under title I to treat it exactly the way the other commodities  are treated, it would cost billions of taxpayer dollars. We don't want  that, and the sugar industry is not asking for that.   This amendment will not save the consumer one penny. These large  sugar users, of whom I am a great customer, buy by the carload. When  the price of sugar dropped to half of what it should have been in 2013  as a result of Mexico cheating on the trade deal, they did not share  that profit with anybody.   Quite frankly, just to put it succinctly, if sugar was such a driving  cost in the cost of all production and the cost to all the jobs that  the gentlewoman mentioned, my diet soda would cost dramatically less  than a sugar soda. They don't. They cost exactly the same. They still  give this product away in restaurants.   So, as we go about this issue, this is about protecting American jobs  and American hardworking farmers from unfair, undue competition from  around the world.   We don't let other products come into this country at below the cost  of production. We do it when we fight steel. We had a recent fight  against Turkey over the imports of steel because it was below the cost  of production. We would protect all other products that way. We just  simply leave this one in place because it works year-in and year-out,  except for the 1 year Mexico cheated. They admitted they cheated on the  program, and that is when it cost the American taxpayers money.   So it doesn't cost, it doesn't save taxpayer money, and it doesn't  save consumers money. It is simply a windfall of some amount to the  sugar buyers and users.   I don't have a grudge against them at all. Like I said, I eat and  drink their products. I am trying to defend American farmers from  products being produced overseas by slave labor in some instances,  child labor in other instances, standards under which we don't produce.  It is dumped into these markets because those governments, unlike ours,  have a direct payment to their farmers and producers to keep them in  business.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson), who is the ranking member of the powerful  Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I point out that over half of all U.S.  sugar processing operations in the United States since 1980 have  closed.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Mr. Chairman, I would also point out the additional  closed plants and jobs lost in the sugar growing industry.   U.S.- and foreign-sweetened product manufacturers have announced 100  plant openings, acquisitions, or expansions within the United States  over that same timeframe.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is left on both  sides.    Mr. Chairman, I would point out that that hidden tax  that my colleagues are talking about will not be shared with the  consumers. It has never been shared with the price of sugar. It goes  down. It will simply shift those profits into multinational  corporations that we are defending by supporting this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chairman, the U.S. is the third largest importer of  sugar in the world, and virtually all of that comes in duty free.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from North Dakota  (Mr. Cramer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 25 seconds to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).    Mr. Chairman, I couldn't disagree more.   The savings that are touted by the folks who are in favor of this  amendment will not be shared with consumers. They will be kept by these  multinational corporations and, yes, the small sugar users across this  country. So prices will not go down.   There are no tax dollars involved, despite the rhetoric to the  contrary, except for 1 year out of 16, because this program worked.  This program was not changed in 2014 because it works. It doesn't cost  the taxpayers money, sugar prices are not distorted, and the  manufacturers will not be able to support the one instance where they  have lowered the cost of their product when sugar prices did in fact  drop as a result of the unfair, unlevel playing field, unlevel  competition around this world.   If we could talk the rest of the world into going to a free market,  to a level playing field, then I would agree completely with my  colleagues who support this amendment.                                time  1545    We are not there. We are not even headed there. We need to defeat  this amendment, protect those hardworking farmers out there across this  country. Say ``no'' to Foxx.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2 includes a substantive, enforceable  supportive work requirement for work-capable individuals 18 to 59.  Waivers and exemptions were tightened to assure little abuse in a  system currently rife with loopholes and gimmicks.   We have also heard from our conservative stakeholders that workfare  is an important tool for EP participants. Based on their feedback and  explicit examples of where this has been implemented correctly, this  amendment includes establishment of that.   It is simply good policy to send unexpended funds back to the  Treasury. This amendment does that.   Our colleagues on the other side said we did not count veteran- specific workforce development programs as a part of H.R. 2. Well, in  addition to the provisions of H.R. 2 that has permitted State-based  veteran workforce programs to count toward the work requirement, this  amendment expands to include programs for veterans run by the  Department of Labor and the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Mr. Chairman, that would have been a terrific amendment for my  colleagues to have offered in committee or on this floor, and we would  have accepted it. They chose to stay on the sidelines.   I have a great food bank in my district, West Texas Food Bank. Its  chief executive related how important it was to provide a 1-year  certification period for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for  seniors, a program currently serving seniors. This makes sense and  allows seniors easier access to this important program.   It is engagements like this that is what our process is all about,  and we have amended our bill through this manager's amendment to  include those.   Mr. Chair, we also have changes in here that strengthen our framework  for coordinating between USDA on FCA, on important operations,  broadband work that is going on across jurisdictions. We want those two  agencies to work together to better utilize the funding to make sure  that rural America gets that broadband support that we really need.  That is included in here as well.   It also allows that communities will have a better opportunity to  work for themselves rather than fighting the current bureaucracy here  in Washington, D.C.   This amendment also includes a variety of technical amendments,  corrections to the bill, that you would normally have in a manager's  amendment, and I ask my colleagues to support the manager's amendment.   Mr. Chair, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), the subcommittee chairman.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am ready to close.    Mr. Chair, the gentlewoman just previously mentioned the  increase in fruits and vegetables being eaten by children in school. I  would point out that our bill includes $1.2 billion in incentives to  help moms and dads out there who are on SNAP to buy fruits and  vegetables and dairy to get a bigger bang for their buck and thereby  hopefully increasing those commodities.   Mr. Chair, we have a good bill here, the base bill. This simply makes  it better. With that, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the former chairman of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, we have got a clear-cut choice: you either  want American producers to produce American food or you don't. That is  what this is simply about.   When I think about the farm bill, you can love it or hate the safety  net we have in place, but it works--as the chairman said, the lowest  cost price food in the developed world.   Here is why that is important. Half of America works paycheck to  paycheck. Their food budget is where they flex. Their rent doesn't  change. Their house payment doesn't change. Their car payment doesn't  change. But if something comes up in the middle of the month, it is  coming out of that food budget.    I don't want to make that mom's job any tougher than it already is by  raising the cost of food arbitrarily, capriciously, by ignoring the  vast amount of competition around this world that is fundamentally  unfair.   If we could go to that utopia that my friend from California would  like to get us to, fantastic, but we can't do that. They barely could  do it in New Zealand, for goodness' sake. We could not do that against  the rest of the world.   I would argue that U.S. production is a bit more complicated than  whatever New Zealand might or might not be doing. We have got to  compete in a world global market against foreign treasuries that are  spending stunningly more money than we are.   China spent $100 billion on three products in 1 year to subsidize  their products. Now, did that send the wrong signal to those folks?  Yes, it did. We farmers and our rice farmers and our other producers  have to compete against the prices that are depressed like that.   We can't go against the rest of the world. If the rest of the world  will go to a level playing field, I have got not one farmer out there  who would say: No, no, no, we want to keep it in place. They want to  compete in the cash market. That is where they want to make their  money. This amendment would strip them of the ability to do that. We  would go to foreign-imported food coming at us with standards that are  not remotely close to ours, labor that is not closely protected the way  ours is.   Let's defeat this McClintock amendment, show the American farmer and  rancher out there, who works as hard as anybody in this world, who  thinks a 20-hour workweek is something they do in their second or third  job in order to keep the farm going, let's show them that we support  them. Let's show them that we have got their back.   A ``yes'' vote for McClintock says: Never mind, we don't care about  you. A ``no'' vote on McClintock says exactly the message we want to  send, and I am hopeful this is a stunningly large vote so that American  producers out there, who are some of the hardest working, best people  on the face of the Earth, can understand that this Congress understands  the unfair foreign competition that they are competing with.   Vote ``no'' on McClintock.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for bringing up this important issue.   I agree with the gentleman from Alabama that our farmers and ranchers  should not be competing with the Federal Government for viable  cropland. H.R. 2 makes many changes to the CRP program, such as capping  the rental rate payment to 80 percent of the county average and  stepping this percentage down for subsequent reenrollments of the same  tract.   I understand, however, the gentleman's concerns with the increase in  enrolled acres, and I commit to working with the gentleman and his  staff on this issue during the coming conference report, should we get  there.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, Mr. Faso has my commitment to work with  him to address the Farm Bureau's concerns to get them to the point that  they are okay with this. I support the gentleman's amendment under  those terms.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Holding) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2) to  provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other  programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that during further  consideration of H.R. 2 in the Committee of the Whole pursuant to House  Resolution 900, amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 115-679 may be  considered out of sequence.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's  amendment.   This actually is America at her best. It is taking American  expertise, going people-to-people across this world, and sharing the  great techniques we are developing here. And while that might make  those host countries a little more competitive with our production of  agriculture here in America, it is the right thing to do.   Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I appreciate Mr.  Fortenberry's dedication not only to this specific issue but his  broader work across the international arena that he has shown his  expertise in.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, it is with great reluctance that I rise in  opposition to the gentleman's amendment. If it were limited to just to  Alaska, then that might be one thing, but the underlying language is  too broad.   It would allow this to happen across the United States, and I have  some concerns about food safety with respect to that.   I understand what he is trying to get at, and I agree with the intent  in making that, but I reluctantly disagree, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Hultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. McClintock, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2) to  provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other  programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Garrett) having assumed the chair, Mr. Gallagher, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2) to  provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other  programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
