 Madam Speaker, the media's daily barrage of  negative stories have undermined the public's confidence in their  reporting. The media continues to ignore positive stories about the  President's effective policies.   If the media were not so biased against the President, more of the  American people would know the following:   The 4.1 percent unemployment rate for the entire country is the  lowest it has been in 17 years;   Latino and African-American unemployment numbers are the lowest in  decades;   The stock market has broken numerous records, adding significant  value to Americans' investment and retirement accounts;   The economy is growing at 3.3 percent, the fastest in years;   Consumer confidence is at a 17-year high.   The liberal media should report the facts, even if they make the  President look good.                            ____________________
