 Madam Speaker, this July, President Trump blocked $400  million in congressionally approved aid that Ukraine desperately needed  to defend itself against Russia because he needed Ukraine to do him a  favor first. He asked the President of Ukraine to launch a public  investigation into a political rival. Military aid and other benefits  would only come after.   But this is not about a single call or a single transcript; this is  about a perfect storm, months of activity directly ordered by the  President to his senior Cabinet and political appointees, an  orchestrated plan demanding a foreign power interfere in our democracy.   President Trump betrayed his oath of office. He abused the power of  his office for personal and political gain and has refused to cooperate  with a coequal branch of government.   This is a vote for our Constitution, setting the precedent for all  future Presidents, Democrat or Republican.   Donald Trump must be held accountable for his actions. Today, we send  a clear signal to this President and all future Presidents: No one is  above the law.
