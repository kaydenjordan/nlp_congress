 Madam Speaker, Republicans won the House in  2010 in part because of the danger posed by America's 4-year string of  trillion-dollar deficits.   House Republicans sliced America's deficit to $438 billion in 2015,  but then our finances took a dramatic turn for the worse. America's  deficit surged to $585 billion in 2016 and $666 billion in 2017.  Congress is expected to soon vote on a debt junkie spending bill that  blows America's deficit sky-high by hundreds of billions of dollars in  2018 alone.   Madam Speaker, there is a narrow path between adequate national  security funding and avoiding a national insolvency that decimates our  military and risks American lives. That path is as narrow as Zion  National Park's Angels Landing Trail. One misstep left or right and you  fall hundreds of feet to your death.   The Senate spending bill is a debt junkie's dream, a nightmare, and a  misstep that plunges America into disaster. It must not pass.                            ____________________
