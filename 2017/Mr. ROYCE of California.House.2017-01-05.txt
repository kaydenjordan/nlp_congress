 Mr. Speaker, the problem with this U.N.  resolution is not simply that it criticizes Israeli actions; it is that  it is fundamentally one-sided. It is anti-Israel, and that is a  departure from longstanding, bipartisan U.S. policy.   U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334 does not address the  Palestinian Authority's failure to end incitement of hatred. Frankly,  they encourage it. The violence that we see against Israeli civilians  comes from the encouragement of PA officials. It doesn't address the  Palestinian Authority's continued payments. An incentive payment in  their budget--over $300 million a year--is paid to those who would  carry out attacks against Israeli civilians. The more mayhem you  create, the longer the term you have in prison, the larger the stipend.  That comes right out of the budget of the Palestinian Authority.   The U.N. resolution did not call upon Palestinian leadership to  fulfill their obligations towards negotiations. The Middle East Summit  is planned next month. So, first, the administration abstains on this,  and next month in France there is real concern that another damaging  Security Council resolution should follow.   That is why this dangerous policy must be rejected, hopefully  unanimously, by this House.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the remainder of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule. It is  not fair. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question  so that Mr. Price, Mr. Engel, and Mr. Connolly can bring up their  alternative to H. Res. 11.   Mr. Speaker, let me say, finally, that I am deeply concerned that the  institution of Congress has been undermined time and time again by this  tendency to be overly restrictive and outright closed. We are supposed  to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, but the problem is  we don't deliberate very much. Everything that is brought to this floor  tends to be a press release substituting for legislation.                                time  1345    There is no bipartisanship. There is none. There is no working  together. There is none. And that is unfortunate. I think one of the  messages of this last election for the American people was they want to  see things happen here. Not just whatever the Republicans want or  whatever the Democrats want, they want us to see us working together.   I served here as a staffer during a time when there was collegiality,  when Republicans and Democrats came together and passed appropriations  bills and authorization bills and passed major reform bills. That  doesn't happen anymore.   On the issue of regulatory reform, I think you can actually get a  consensus on regulatory reform. There is nobody in this House that  thinks the regulatory process is perfect. The problem is, when you  bring a bill to the floor that is so one-sided, that is poorly written,  that is impractical, we can't support it.  [[Page H121]]    On the issue of Israel, we could have come to a consensus, I think,  and spoken with one voice to show our unwavering support for the State  of Israel. But instead, we have a bill that comes to the floor that is  politically charged--I think that is very clear, based on the tone of  some of the speeches here today--but also has factual errors in it.   The frustration level has grown to the point where some of us in the  minority have taken to protesting. We had a sit-in in response to the  fact that we couldn't get legislation to the floor that said if you are  on a terrorist list, you can't fly, then you can't buy a gun, and a  bill that called for universal background checks.   We thought we had a promise to be able to bring some of this to the  floor. My friends could have voted against it. But we were told, no,  you don't even have the right to debate these bills.   I am going to say to my colleagues sincerely that, unless things  change, you are going to see the discord, the anger, and the  frustration build on this side of the aisle, and you are going to see  it build throughout the country.   There is a reason why people hold Congress in such disdain. It is  because they see this place not as an institution where we can solve  problems but as a place where it is all about obstruction or ``my way  or the highway.''   This is a lousy way to start the new year. Please vote ``no'' on the  previous question and vote ``no'' on this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  22, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 11) objecting to United Nations  Security Council Resolution 2334 as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian  peace, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the  resolution is considered read.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                 H. Res. 11         Whereas the United States has long supported a negotiated       settlement leading to a sustainable two-state solution with       the democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized,       democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and       security;        Whereas since 1993, the United States has facilitated       direct, bilateral negotiations between both parties toward       achieving a two-state solution and ending all outstanding       claims;        Whereas it is the long-standing policy of the United States       that a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian       conflict will only come through direct, bilateral       negotiations between the two parties;        Whereas it is the long-standing position of the United       States to oppose and, if necessary, veto United Nations       Security Council resolutions dictating additional binding       parameters on the peace process;        Whereas it is the long-standing position of the United       States to oppose and, if necessary, veto one-sided or anti-      Israel resolutions at the United Nations Security Council;        Whereas the United States has stood in the minority       internationally over successive Administrations in defending       Israel in international forums, including vetoing one-sided  [[Page H147]]       resolutions in 2011, 2006, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, 1997, and       1995 before the United Nations Security Council;        Whereas the United States recently signed a new Memorandum       of Understanding with the Government of Israel regarding       security assistance, consistent with longstanding support for       Israel among successive Administrations and congresses and       representing an important United States commitment toward       Israel's qualitative military edge;        Whereas on November 29, 2016, the House of Representatives       unanimously passed House Concurrent Resolution 165,       expressing the sense of Congress and reaffirming longstanding       United States policy in support of a direct bilaterally       negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and       opposition to United Nations Security Council resolutions       imposing a solution to the conflict;        Whereas on December 23, 2016, the United States Permanent       Representative to the United Nations disregarded House       Concurrent Resolution 165 and departed from longstanding       United States policy by abstaining and permitting United       Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 to be adopted under       Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter;        Whereas the United States' abstention on United Nations       Security Council Resolution 2334 contradicts the Oslo Accords       and its associated process that is predicated on resolving       the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between the parties through       direct negotiations;        Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334       claims that ``the establishment by Israel of settlements in       the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East       Jerusalem, has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant       violation under international law and a major obstacle to the       achievement of the two-State solution and a just, lasting and       comprehensive peace'';        Whereas by referring to the ``4 June 1967 lines'' as the       basis for negotiations, United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 effectively states that the Jewish Quarter of       the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall, Judaism's       holiest site, are ``occupied territory'' thereby equating       these sites with outposts in the West Bank that the Israeli       government has deemed illegal;        Whereas passage of United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 effectively lends legitimacy to efforts by       the Palestinian Authority to impose its own solution through       international organizations and through unjustified boycotts       or divestment campaigns against Israel by calling ``upon all       States, bearing in mind paragraph 1 of this resolution, to       distinguish, in their relevant dealings, between the       territory of the State of Israel and the territories occupied       since 1967'', and will require the United States and Israel       to take effective action to counteract the potential harmful       impact of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334;        Whereas UNSCR 2334 did not directly call upon Palestinian       leadership to fulfill their obligations toward negotiations       or mention that part of the eventual Palestinian state is       currently controlled by Hamas, a designated terrorist       organization; and        Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334       both sought to impose or unduly influence solutions to final       status issues, and is biased against Israel: Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That --        (1) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--        (A) the passage of United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 undermined the long-standing position of the       United States to oppose and veto United Nations Security       Council resolutions that seek to impose solutions to final       status issues, or are one-sided and anti-Israel, reversing       decades of bipartisan agreement;        (B) the passage of United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 undermines the prospect of Israelis and       Palestinians resuming productive, direct negotiations;        (C) the passage of United Nations Security Council       Resolution 2334 contributes to the politically motivated acts       of boycott, divestment from, and sanctions against Israel and       represents a concerted effort to extract concessions from       Israel outside of direct negotiations between the Israelis       and Palestinians, which must be actively rejected;        (D) any future measures taken in international or outside       organizations, including the United Nations Security Council       or at the Paris conference on the Israeli-Palestinian       conflict scheduled for January 15, 2017, to impose an       agreement, or parameters for an agreement including the       recognition of a Palestinian state, will set back the cause       of peace, harm the security of Israel, run counter to the       enduring bipartisan consensus on strengthening the United       States-Israel relationship, and weaken support for such       organizations;        (E) a durable and sustainable peace agreement between       Israel and the Palestinians will come only through direct       bilateral negotiations between the parties resulting in a       Jewish, democratic state living side-by-side next to a       demilitarized Palestinian state in peace and security;        (F) the United States should work to facilitate serious,       direct negotiations between the parties without preconditions       toward a sustainable peace agreement; and        (G) the United States Government should oppose and veto       future United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek       to impose solutions to final status issues, or are one-sided       and anti-Israel; and        (2) the House of Representatives opposes United Nations       Security Council Resolution 2334 and will work to strengthen       the United States-Israel relationship, and calls for United       Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 to be repealed or       fundamentally altered so that--        (A) it is no longer one-sided and anti-Israel; and        (B) it allows all final status issues toward a two-state       solution to be resolved through direct bilateral negotiations       between the parties.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California (Mr. Royce)  and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 30  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce).                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the esteemed Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I want to begin by thanking the ranking member, the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel). I thank him for working with me in a bipartisan  manner not just on this resolution but on the one that we worked on  late last year--a unanimous vote by this body directing the  administration not to take the steps that the administration has taken.   I appreciate the leader and the Speaker as well working with us to  ensure this resolution was brought quickly to the floor of this House.   Today, we put Congress on record objecting to the recent U.N.  Security Council resolution that hurt our ally, that hurt Israel, and I  believe that puts an enduring peace further out of reach.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, the United States has long recognized that a solution to  the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only come about through direct  bilateral negotiations between these two parties, and that is why it is  longstanding U.S. policy to veto the many one-sided, the many anti- Israel resolutions at the United Nations Security Council that violate  that principle.   But just the other week, the Obama administration broke with this  longstanding U.S. policy by failing to veto U.N. Security Council  Resolution 2334. This dangerous resolution effectively states that the  Jewish quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem and the Western Wall,  Judaism's holiest site, are, in the words of the resolution, ``occupied  territory.'' Why would we not veto that?   It also lends legitimacy to efforts by the Palestinian Authority to  put pressure on Israel through the U.N. rather than to go through the  process of engaging in direct negotiations, and it puts wind in the  sails of the shameful boycott divestment and sanctions movement.   Unquestionably, this U.N. Security Council action damages the  prospects for peace. The resolution and the bullying and harassment of  Israel that it will spur only happened for one reason: the Obama  administration let it happen--and that went against the distinct  warnings from this body.   Mr. Engel and I engaged in letters, in conversations with senior  administration officials seeking their assurance that the United States  would veto one-sided, anti-Israel resolutions. In November, the House  unanimously, all of us, passed a resolution which warned the  administration against taking such last-minute action.   With that resolution, H. Con. Res. 165, the House unanimously stated  that the United States Government should continue to oppose and veto  United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to impose  solutions to final-status issues or are one-sided and anti-Israel. Yet  the administration rejected the call from Congress and chose a course  that will bring harm for years to come by failing to veto U.N. Security  Council Resolution 2334.   If the Palestinians want a lasting peace, they must accept that  Israel, not the U.N., is their negotiating partner; and that means  ending the incitement to violence against Israelis that goes on in so  many of the mosques, that goes on in the schools, that goes on in the  newspapers and on television there. It also means ending--and I think  this is the most important fact, because leaving this out of the  resolution at the U.N. is beyond me--their pay-to-slay scheme.   You talk about a lack of balance. Here we have a situation where,  since 2003, it has been Palestinian law to reward Palestinian  terrorists--terrorists--to go out, and they are given this incitement,  this stipend for life. The more mayhem they create, the more horrific  the number of civilians they attack and, therefore, the longer the  sentence, the more they know: Well, I can serve my time, and then when  I get out, I can get this stipend for the rest of my life--and it is  larger and larger, depending upon the amount of mayhem--and if I don't  make it, or if I am a suicide bomber, my family gets the stipend.   That, by law, is the way the Palestinian Authority has engineered  this, costing the lives--and you can read  [[Page H149]]  about it every month of those civilians attacked on the streets. It is  not just Israelis, of course. Taylor Force, a U.S. Marine, was killed  simply because he was in Israel, but it was by someone responding to  the incitement.   So $300 million per year spent by the Palestinian Authority to do  that. No mention of that, of course, by the United Nations. And that is  why today's action is so important, to demonstrate our united  opposition to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, call for its  repeal, to head off any more moves the Obama administration might have  in the next few days with respect to the Paris conference next week as  well, and to provide the foundation for the next administration to move  forcefully to counteract its dangerous impact.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Engel, for yielding a  portion of his time to opponents of this resolution. I also appreciate  his willingness to work with me and other Members on our alternative  resolution that is more accurate and less divisive, a resolution,  unfortunately, the majority has denied a hearing for on the floor  today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 11. The resolution  before us today fails to credibly reaffirm our Nation's support for a  two-state solution. It provides an inaccurate accounting of the United  States' longstanding policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It  includes reckless and divisive charges regarding the recent United  Nations Security Council resolution, designed, it would appear, solely  to embarrass the outgoing administration. It falsely claims, for  example, that the Security Council resolution ``contradicts the Oslo  Accords.'' It goes so far as to link the resolution to the boycott and  divestiture movement.   Mr. Speaker, there is room for honest debate about the U.N.  resolution and about the U.S. decision to abstain, but there is not  room, there shouldn't be room, for this kind of disgraceful distortion.  H. Res. 11 doesn't really engage the issues; it obscures and distorts  them.   I would suggest that both those who support and oppose recent U.S.  actions should oppose this irresponsible and divisive resolution. It  does distort the record. In fact, during the Obama administration,  fewer U.N. Security Council resolutions related to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict have passed than under any other modern  Presidency. In fact, the December resolution is the only one that has  passed under President Obama's leadership; and if you want a fair and  comprehensive account of the thinking that went into that difficult  decision, I commend to every Member Samantha Power's statement at the  United Nations, one of the finest statements of its sort that I have  ever read.   H. Res. 11 also doesn't take into account the fact that Republican  and Democratic administrations alike have allowed Security Council  resolutions addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to pass, many  of which were opposed by Israel. The fact is H. Res. 11 runs a real  risk of undermining the credibility of the United States Congress as a  proactive force working toward a two-state solution.   In this period of great geopolitical turmoil and uncertainty, we must  reaffirm those fundamental aspects of our foreign policy, including our  strong and unwavering support for Israel, while also demonstrating to  the world that we are committed to a diplomacy that defends human  rights and promotes Israeli and Palestinian states that live side by  side in peace and security, a formulation that has characterized our  country's diplomacy for decades.   At best, Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 11 would muddy the waters of our  diplomacy and foreign policy. At worst, it could undermine our decade- long efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and  Palestinians. I can't, in good faith, support the adoption of this  resolution, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in response briefly, we did  have a substitute from Mr. Price, and we looked at that substitute, but  it did not once mention the United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334.   Mr. Engel and I have worked hard together, in good faith and in a  bipartisan manner, to develop a measure that rejects and repudiates  this dangerous U.N. resolution that was passed; and also, ours warns  the White House against taking additional measures in the last few  weeks of the current administration. I think it is important to remind  the body that this is very concerning, given the backdrop of the Paris  conference on the 15th of this month and the very real concern that the  President could take further steps at the U.N.   Again, Mr. Price's amendment did not include this urgent warning. I  want to say that I am happy to work with Mr. Price in a bipartisan  manner once the Committee on Foreign Affairs organizes, but time is of  the essence. We must act to reject United Nations Security Council  Resolution 2334, not remain silent on it, and we have got to limit the  damage that the administration has caused to prospects for a lasting  peace.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.   Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank our esteemed chairman for the  time.   This resolution, Mr. Speaker, will not undo the damage that has been  done at the Security Council, but it sends an important message to the  world that the United States Congress resoundingly and in a strong  bipartisan manner disapproves of the vote taken on Resolution 2334, and  it sends a warning to the nations that will gather in Paris next week  to discuss the peace process that there will be repercussions if there  is a move to introduce a parameters resolution before the 20th in an  effort to further isolate Israel.   Our closest friend and ally, the democratic Jewish State of Israel,  has been under constant attack by the United Nations. Abu Mazen and the  Palestinians have pushed a campaign to delegitimize the Jewish state,  to undermine the peace process, to achieve unilateral statehood  recognition. We have seen it this year at UNESCO, where that sham of an  institution voted on several occasions to deny and distance Jewish and  Christian historical and cultural ties to Jerusalem.   We have seen it at the Human Rights Council, where Israel is  constantly demonized and falsely accused of human rights violations  while the real abusers of human rights go unpunished because that body  has utterly failed to uphold its mandate. This is a body that allows  the worst abusers of human rights--like Cuba, Venezuela, and China--to  actually sit in judgment of human rights worldwide. What a pathetic  joke. Yet the only thing they can agree on is to attack Israel, the  only democracy in the Middle East and the only place in the region  where human rights are protected.    We have seen this scheme to delegitimize Israel at the General  Assembly, where, in its closing legislative session, the General  Assembly passed 20--20--anti-Israel resolutions and only 4, combined,  for the entire world.   These institutions have no credibility, and now we have the  unfortunate circumstance of the White House deciding to abstain from  this anti-Israel, one-sided resolution at the Security Council. Our  ally was abandoned, and credibility and momentum were given to the  Palestinian schemes to delegitimize the Jewish state, to undermine the  peace process.   While the damage has been done, Mr. Speaker, by this act of cowardice  at the Security Council, we will have an opportunity to reverse that  damage. In the coming weeks and months, this Congress and the incoming  administration must show unyielding support for our ally Israel and  undo the damage done.   This resolution by the chairman and the ranking member is an all- important first step that signals our intent. I urge my colleagues to  support this measure, and I look forward to working with Chairman Royce  and Ranking Member Engel in further strengthening our U.S.-Israel bond.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the longtime chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human  Rights, and International Organizations.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for  yielding and for offering this important resolution, along with the  ranking member, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.   President Obama's decision to abstain and not veto Security Council  Resolution 2334 seriously undermines the peace process, abandons Israel  at a critical hour in its life as a nation, and does serious injury to  the historical record.   The egregiously flawed U.N. text says that all Israeli settlements  after the 1949 armistice line including East Jerusalem and West Bank  have no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under  international law.   The pending House resolution repudiates 2334 and makes clear that a  durable and sustainable peace agreement between Israel and the  Palestinians will only come through direct bilateral negotiations, not  one-sided, anti-Israel U.N. resolutions.   Mr. Speaker, the U.N. resolution could open Israeli leaders and even  average Israeli settlers to criminal prosecution. Israel's enemies are  likely to exploit 2334 by seeking prosecutions in venues like the  International Criminal Court for construction activities, even though  the vast majority of this activity takes place legally, pursuant to  Israeli law.   A few hours ago, the European Jewish press reported that ``Leaders of  the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations  called for France to cancel or, at least, postpone what they called an  `ill-conceived, poorly timed and damaging' event--the Paris Mideast  conference--scheduled for January 15.''   I hope that we will also call upon our government not to go to this  right before a transition of the White House and the Presidency and  mischief that could be forthcoming from that.   They pointed out in their statement that ``Israel has long sought  direct talks'' and ``it is time for the Palestinian leaders to stop  evading their responsibility and seeking to use international fora to  avoid the only true path to a lasting peace''--and that is a negotiated  settlement.   Nathan Diament of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of  America pointed out that the U.N. has a long-established bias against  Israel. As my good friend from Florida said a moment ago, 20 anti- Israel resolutions against just 4 in 2016--a bias and a discrimination  against Israel.   President Obama's decision to abstain and not veto Security Council  Resolution 2334 seriously undermines the peace process, abandons Israel  at a critical hour in its life as a nation, and does serious injury to  the historical record.   The egregiously flawed UN text says that all Israeli settlements  after the 1949 armistice line including East Jerusalem and the West  Bank have no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under  international law.   The pending House resolution repudiates 2334 and makes clear that a  durable and sustainable peace agreement between Israel and the  Palestinians will only come through direct bilateral negotiations not  one-sided anti-Israel UN resolutions.   With over three thousand years of Jewish history bound up in East  Jerusalem and the West Bank, it is preposterous to assert that Israel  has no legitimacy in defending its connections to this extraordinary  heritage. Sadly, these kinds of prejudiced and revisionist claims are  all too common in the United Nations where UNESCO voted just a couple  months ago on measures that excise any mention of Judaism and  Christianity's ancient ties to East Jerusalem.   Mr. Speaker, the UN Resolution could open Israeli leaders and even  average Israeli settlers to criminal prosecution. Israel's enemies are  likely to exploit 2334 by seeking prosecutions in venues like the  International Criminal Court (ICC) for construction activities, even  though the vast majority of this activity takes place legally, pursuant  to Israeli law.   By calling on countries to distinguish between the State of Israel  and Israeli settlements, 2334 enables the narrative of the anti-Semitic  boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, or BDS movement, that is  aimed at delegitimizing Israel.   And in mere days, the error of 2334 could be further compounded.   A few hours ago the European Jewish Press reported that ``Leaders of  the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations  called for France to cancel or, at least, postpone what they called an  `ill-conceived, poorly timed and damaging' event--the Paris Mideast  conference--scheduled for January 15th.''   ``The international community should not plunge forward with the ill- conceired and poorly timed Paris conference,'' CPMAJO Chairman Stephen  M. Greenberg and Vice Chairman and CEO Malcolm Hoenlein said in a  statement . . . According to the Conference of Presidents, there are a  number of compelling reasons to postpone the Paris event, including the  impending transition to the Trump administration, just five days later.  ``It makes no sense that the next administration is precluded from  participating in a discussion of an essential component of U.S. foreign  policy with which it will be engaged,'' they explained.   `` `Israel has long sought direct talks, it is time for the  Palestinian leaders to stop evading their responsibility and seeking to  use international fora to avoid the only true path to a lasting peace,'  they added. Hoenlein cautioned it was possible the Obama administration  could--following the recent passage of the anti-Israeli settlement  Security Council resolution--take a `further damaging step against the  Jewish state before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.' ''   Nathan Diament, Executive Director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish  Congregations of America, wrote me a letter today and said, ``On  December 23, 2016, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2334, a  blatantly anti-Israel resolution condemning Israel's building of  settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. It has long been U.S.  policy that any progress toward an agreement in the region must be  based on direct negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders,  not a vote of third-party nations at the UN.''   ``Unfortunately the UN has a long and established bias against  Israel. In 2016 alone, the UN General Assembly adopted 20 anti-Israel  resolutions and just four against other countries: North Korea, Syria,  Iran and Russia. The World Health Organization condemned Israel as the  world's only violator of `mental, physical and environmental health,'  while the U.N. Women condemned Israel as the world's only violator of  women's rights. The International Labor Organization condemned Israel  as the world's only violator of labor rights. These same UN committees  were silent on the issue of human rights violations in China, Libya, or  the Congo.''   ``Clearly, the UN has an agenda to undermine and delegitimize the  state of Israel, and in that regard UN support for Resolution 2334 was  not surprising. What was surprising--and deeply concerning--was the  silence of the United States on this issue. Rather than exercising its  veto power, the United States chose to abstain from voting, and thereby  threatened the trust and support Israel has long placed in its most  important ally. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Obama has  repeatedly assured American Jews and others concerned about Israel's  security and welfare that his commitment to U.S. support for Israel's  security was `unshakeable.' By allowing the UN Security Council's  resolution to pass in the final weeks of his Administration, President  Obama undermined his legacy and threatened the longstanding alliance  between the United States and Israel.''   ``Whether the abstaining vote was a parting statement from the Obama  Administration or the influence of anti-Israeli forces at the UN, the  incoming Trump Administration and the  [[Page H151]]  115th Congress must make the United States' support of Israel and our  common goals of peace, democracy, and fighting terrorism--a pillar of  its foreign policy. Today's resolution condemning UN Resolution 2334  will send an important message to the world that the United States  stands with Israel and will continue to support our common goals.''   Mr. Speaker, before concluding, I would like to note that many of us  in Congress have been warning about these kinds of reckless gambits for  months. Three-hundred and eighty of us in the House signed a letter in  April to President Obama specifically calling on him to veto any one- sided resolution like 2443 if it were raised in the Security Council.  In late November, the House voted overwhelmingly for H. Con. Res. 165  further stressing the need for the United States to stand by Israel and  veto biased Security Council measures.   I urge my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 11 to denounce this  dangerous Security Council action. I look forward to working with  President-elect Trump to align U.S. policy with the overwhelming  consensus in Congress: that we are and remain committed to Israel's  sovereignty and security.                                             OU Advocacy Center,                                    Washington, DC, January 5, 2017.      Hon. Chris Smith,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Smith: On behalf of the Union of       Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (Orthodox Union)--      the nation's largest Orthodox Jewish umbrella organization--      please accept our gratitude for your support of today's       resolution opposing UN Security Council Resolution 2334, and       thank you for submitting this letter to the official record       of the House of Representatives.        On December 23, 2016, the UN Security Council passed       Resolution 2334, a blatantly anti-Israel resolution       condemning Israel's building of settlements in the West Bank       and East Jerusalem. It has long been U.S. policy that any       progress toward an agreement in the region must be based on       direct negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders,       not a vote of third-party nations at the UN.        Unfortunately, the UN has a long and established bias       against Israel. In 2016 alone, the UN General Assembly       adopted 20 anti-Israel resolutions and just four against       other countries: North Korea, Syria, Iran and Russia. The       World Health Organization condemned Israel as the world's       only violator of ``mental, physical and environmental       health,'' while the U.N. Women condemned Israel as the       world's only violator of women's rights. The International       Labor Organization condemned Israel as the world's only       violator of labor rights. These same UN committees were       silent on the issue of human rights violations in China,       Libya, or the Congo.        Clearly, the UN has an agenda to undermine and delegitimize       the state of Israel, and in that regard UN support for       Resolution 2334 was not surprising. What was surprising--and       deeply concerning--was the silence of the United States on       this issue. Rather than exercising its veto power, the United       States chose to abstain from voting, and thereby threatened       the trust and support Israel has long placed in its most       important ally. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Obama       has repeatedly assured American Jews and others concerned       about Israel's security and welfare that his commitment to       U.S. support for Israel's security was ``unshakeable.'' By       allowing the UN Security Council's resolution to pass in the       final weeks of his Administration, President Obama undermined       his legacy and threatened the longstanding alliance between       the United States and Israel.        Whether the abstaining vote was a parting statement from       the Obama Administration or the influence of anti-Israeli       forces at the UN, the incoming Trump Administration and the       115th Congress must make the United States' support of Israel       and our common goals of peace, democracy, and fighting       terrorism--a pillar of its foreign policy. Today's resolution       condemning UN Resolution 2334 will send an important message       to the world that the United States stands with Israel and       will continue to support our common goals.        Again, thank you for your support of Israel and today's       resolution. I urge all members of the United States Congress       to stand with Israel and vote in favor of the McCarthy-Royce       resolution.            Best Regards,                                                    Nathan Diament,                                                Executive Director.    Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), who has served for years as chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and  Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).   Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ed Royce  for yielding. I appreciate your leadership for peace.   I am in strong support of the House resolution, which is taking a  firm stand and clear stand objecting to the United Nations Security  Council resolution as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace.   The United States has stood with Israel against one-sided, biased  resolutions at the United Nations and in other international forums.  Additionally, the United States has been adamant that a peaceful  resolution will only come from direct, bilateral negotiations, not  addressed by an international forum. The distorted ideology of moral  neutrality is suicidal for civilization, encouraging what the chairman  correctly identified as ``pay for slay,'' as evidenced by the murder of  American tourist Taylor Force just last year.   On December 23, my constituents were shocked as the Obama  administration betrayed the people of Israel, undermining the peace  process by failing to veto the U.N. Security Council resolution.  President Obama and Secretary Kerry's actions revealed dangerous  irresponsibility, putting Israeli and American families at risk of more  terrorist attacks. Fortunately, Governor Nikki Haley, President-elect  Donald Trump's appointee, will soon be making a positive difference as  U.N. Ambassador of the United States, promoting peace through strength.   Today, I am grateful to stand strong with Israel by being an original  cosponsor of H. Res. 11. I appreciate the leadership of Majority Leader  Kevin McCarthy, Chairman Ed Royce, and Ranking Member Eliot Engel for  sponsoring this resolution. I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).   Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, I condemn U.N. Security Council Resolution  2334.   This is an outrageous attack against the State of Israel, the world's  only Jewish state and the only democracy in the Middle East. I also  condemn the Obama administration's failure to veto such a resolution,  because it betrayed Israel and it harmed our national security  interests. The Obama administration's actions, or lack of actions, were  more than just a sin of omission in that they worked behind the scenes  to move this resolution forward so that it could be voted on in the  United Nations General Assembly. That is a sin of commission.   Now, we have to be honest about how the two sides have acted in this  in putting pressure on Israel and not on the Palestinian Authority.  Remember, when you talk about a two-state solution, the Palestinian  Arabs rejected a state in 1948. They tried to wipe Israel off the map.  They tried to beat them in 1967. It has been a constant state of war,  and they have chosen to get rid of the Jewish state as something that  is more important to them than the creation of their own state, and we  have to be honest about that.   I will support this resolution. I view it as a good statement, but as  just a first step. We need something in the coming days that has teeth  to deal with the United Nations and its outrageous conduct. It has  become a hotbed of anti-Israeli activity where all of these tin-pot  countries get together and rail against the world's only Jewish state.  They did 20 resolutions against Israel at the United Nations in 2016  and four against the rest of the world.   We need to take our power of the purse and defund the U.N. until U.N.  Security Council Resolution 2334 is revoked.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to my  colleague from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Trott).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Speaker, just by way of the facts, what  this resolution attempts to do is to reject the U.N. resolution that  calls for a Palestinian state but not a Jewish state, a resolution that  opens the door for those who want to impose boycott, divestment, or  other sanctions measures against Israel or Israeli companies and, in  essence, declares Judaism's holiest site as occupied territory. That is  what is in this resolution. Those are the facts that we are debating  here. Those are the facts that need to be rejected, my colleagues.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).    I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).                                time  1830     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Taylor).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we are all friends of Israel, but that friendship  requires more than demonizing the United Nations and the Obama  administration. In fact, it requires the facing of hard truths, the  destructive effect of incitement and violence on the Palestinian side,  which the U.N. resolution explicitly acknowledges, and the threat to  peace and to any conceivable two-state solution by relentless  settlement expansion on the Israeli side, pushed by the right wing,  unchallenged by H. Res. 11.   The majority, seeking to push this resolution through, has displayed  little interest in what it would take actually to achieve peace,  choosing instead to distort the history, to impugn the motives of those  attempting to achieve peace. It is not worthy of this body. I urge its  rejection.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, in short, United Nations Security Council Resolution  2334 has harmed our ally Israel. It has harmed the prospects for peace.  It is one-sided. It is an anti-Israel resolution, the kind of which it  has been longstanding U.S. policy to veto within the U.N. Security  Council, and it is not hard to see why because this resolution opens  the door for those who want to impose boycott, divestment, or other  sanctions measures against Israel or against Israeli companies. And, in  essence, it declares Judaism's holiest site, the Western Wall, as  occupied territory.   Mr. Speaker, this is reminiscent of another action by the United  Nations, the infamous ``Zionism is racism'' resolution whose damage  took decades to undo.   Fortunately, the bipartisan rejection of the President's U.N.  decision provides an opportunity for the House to rally around a more  constructive policy and renewed U.S. leadership in the region.   I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this resolution so that the bipartisan policy of rejecting this harmful  U.N. Security  [[Page H163]]  Council resolution and encouraging direct negotiation is endorsed loud  and clear. It is far past time for the incitement to stop and the  budgeting of $300 million by the Palestinian Authority to pay people to  slay Israeli civilians be discontinued.   I yield back the balance of my time.
