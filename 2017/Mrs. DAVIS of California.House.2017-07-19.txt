 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  the all-girls robotics team from Afghanistan for taking home the silver  medal at this weekend's FIRST Global Challenge.   I speak on behalf of my colleagues who travel on our annual  bipartisan trip to Afghanistan when I say that these girls are the  embodiment of our  [[Page H5991]]  hopes and dreams for the future of their country. We have learned on  our trips that nothing is more important for global security than the  development of human capital, and what better example could there be  than these remarkable girls.   I want to echo the sentiments of Afghanistan's First Lady and say to  the girls, ``Saar Bolan demoom kar deen,'' literally, ``You make us  hold our heads up high.'' We are proud of you.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember that, when these girls were  born, women were not allowed to get an education in Afghanistan. Now,  because of the bravery of these girls and the tireless efforts of their  teachers, the rest of the world can now see how remarkable Afghan women  truly are.   Congratulations on your remarkable achievement.                            ____________________
