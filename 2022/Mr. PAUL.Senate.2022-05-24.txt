 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Druther's Restaurant of Campbellsville, KY, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week.   Steve McCarty, owner and operator of the last remaining Druther's  restaurant in the world, understands the importance of commitment and  passion when managing a business. His dad built the Campbellsville  store in 1970, originally named Burger Queen before the company's  rebrand to Druther's in 1980. It was an independent franchise fully  owned by the McCarty family. Steve developed a love for the Druther's  business at a young age, as he began working there at only 15 years  old. At its peak of success, the Druther's franchise had around 200  locations spanning from Florida to Missouri, as well as international  locations and a devoted consumer base. In light of financial woes  burdening the  [[Page S2662]]  company in the early 1990s, the owners decided to sell their business  to Dairy Queen, leaving 12 independent franchises remaining. Despite  this drastic change within the company, Steve and his family wanted to  continue the Druther's tradition and keep their independent restaurant  open. Having now worked at Druther's for over 45 years, Steve McCarty  is the embodiment of dedication and persistence as he works day in and  day out to preserve the Druther's story.   To this day, Steve will have restaurant-goers come and visit  Druther's from all over the country, seeking a taste of the classic  food they once cherished. Druther's has maintained the same menu ever  since its installation in 1970, only adding additional items to create  a wider selection for customers. Throughout its operation, Druther's  has always been and continues to be a shining example of what makes a  great restaurant: tasty food, excellent service, and an unspoken  familiarity among staff and customers. Along with its excellent food  and atmosphere, Druther's is committed to giving back to the people of  Campbellsville and the surrounding areas. Steve and his team have been  a part of several charitable initiatives, including donating to the  Toys for Tots program, sending food to Taylor County High School in  Campbellsville, and providing free hot meals to all Taylor County  residents affected by tornadoes in December of 2021.   Druther's continues to provide a sense of joyful nostalgia that their  loyal customers love. The restaurant's devotion to keeping the magic of  the brand alive is evident among their staff, as Steve works alongside  several employees who have been there for over a decade--a testament to  both Steve as a business owner and to the wonderful work environment he  has cultivated since Druther's founding.   The old-fashioned and welcoming nature of Druther's makes it the  perfect time-capsule for Kentuckians to re-live cherished memories of  days gone by. Druther's unwavering commitment to high quality and  service is the reason why people from all over the country are willing  to travel hundreds of miles to enjoy their delicious food. This  restaurant demonstrates the important role small businesses play within  a tightknit community, providing joy and support to their friends and  neighbors alike. Congratulations to Steve and the entire Druther's  team. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching their  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
