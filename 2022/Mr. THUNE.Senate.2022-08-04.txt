 Mr. President, last week, Democrats unveiled their so- called Inflation Reduction Act, a bill that will do nothing to reduce  inflation but will double down on Democrats' wasteful government  spending, along with imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax  hikes--yes, hundreds of billions of dollars in tax hikes.   Our economy has posted negative economic growth for the past two  quarters, and Democrats think it is a good idea to raise taxes on  American businesses. Perhaps Democrats think that current prices aren't  high enough or that businesses aren't struggling enough with the  inflation that Democrats helped create.   The worst part, of course, is that a substantial part of the burden  of these tax hikes will fall on ordinary Americans, Americans who are  already struggling with historically high inflation, Americans who are  seeing their grocery bills balloon and their rent skyrocket, Americans  who are paying more than $4 per gallon every time they fill up their  car.    Now, Democrats are going to pass tax hikes that will hit these  Americans hard--a tax hike on businesses that will almost undoubtedly  result in lower growth, lower wages, and fewer jobs; a tax hike on  investment--investment that we need to grow our economy and create  opportunities for American workers; and tax hikes on energy production.   That is right, tax hikes on energy production to the tune of $60  billion.   Now, as I mentioned, Americans are still, on average, paying more  than $4 a gallon every time they go to fill up their cars, as they have  been for months. Their electricity bills are up. The price for utility  gas service is up by almost 40 percent. And Democrats think now is a  good time to raise taxes on oil and gas production?   I guess maybe they are hoping that they can force Americans off  conventional energy by continuing to keep gas and energy prices high.   And in case anyone was thinking that Democrats would be content with  shutting down domestic production--with a methane tax, higher  royalties, excise taxes, and costly permitting delays--and would rather  Americans receive conventional energy from abroad, well, Democrats have  a tax hike for that too.   The Democrats' bill would impose a new tax hike on U.S. refiners  importing crude oil and petroleum products intended to make  conventional energy prohibitively expensive.   But, of course, Americans will need conventional energy, and that  will continue to be true for a while yet, no matter how much wishful  thinking Democrats engage in.   And Democrats' energy tax hikes are setting ordinary Americans up to  continue to suffer under high energy prices for the foreseeable future.   So what are all these tax hikes for? What government spending is  worth imposing tax hikes that run the risk of pushing our economy into  a longer recession or, worse yet, stagflation?   Well, let me just review some of the priorities that Democrats will  be spending that tax hike money on.   There is $1.5 billion--billion dollars--for a grant program to plant  trees, and $1.9 billion for things like identifying gaps in tree canopy  coverage. That is right, identifying gaps in tree canopy coverage.   There is $1 billion for electric heavy-duty vehicles like garbage  trucks. I am not really sure why the Federal Government is going to be  spending money on electric garbage trucks or how that is going to  reduce inflation.   There is $3 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to purchase zero- emission delivery vehicles. Quite a lot of money, I might add, for an  Agency that is supposedly self-funded.   There is funding for road equity.   All told, there is more than $60 billion in funding for  ``environmental justice''--$60 billion. That is more than the Federal  Government spent on highways in 2019.   There is also at least $30 billion in climate slush funds, part of  which is allocated for, among other things, climate-related political  activity--yeah, political activity.   So, in other words, Democrats are raising taxes on Americans so that  they can provide Federal funding for Green New Deal activism. And I  haven't even talked about all the tax credits for adopting Democrats'  preferred green energy technologies.   There are tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles and for  refitting windows and skylights and doors to meet Democrats' required  level of energy efficiency. That is right, Democrats are raising the  tax burden on working Americans to pay for tax credits for wealthy  Americans to purchase a brandnew electric vehicle or to do some home  remodeling.   Of course, these tax credits aren't officially limited to wealthy  Americans, but I am hard-pressed to think of many working families who  can afford to spend $60,000 on a new electric vehicle while inflation  is at a 40-year high.   I am a longtime supporter of clean energy. I come from a State that  is leading the way toward cleaner and more efficient energy  technologies, and I have worked with colleagues from both parties to  advance clean energy, including through the responsible use of energy  tax credits to bring clean energy technologies to the point where they  can compete on their own.   But this bill has nothing in common with the bipartisan work I and  many others have done to responsibly advance clean energy. This bill is  wasteful and irresponsible and will do essentially nothing to reduce  warming globally as others nations continue to skate by.   It will, however, waste a lot of taxpayer dollars and create a lot of  economic pain for hard-working Americans.   One think tank analyzed a plan similar to the one Democrats are  pushing and found that it would result in staggering job losses, higher  energy bills, and a tremendous reduction in economic growth.   One sensible move to advance clean energy and necessary investment in  conventional energy would be to address the arduous permitting process  which can hold up both renewable and conventional energy projects for  years. That is something we should be focused on, to promote investment  in the conventional energy we still need and in the renewable energy  technologies of the future.   Instead, we are being asked to support a bill that will squander  billions and billions of taxpayer dollars on Green New Deal activism  and road equity and monitoring tree canopies.   And we are supposed to vote for it based on the vague promise that  the Senate will consider--consider, mind you, not pass--permitting  legislation; permitting legislation that may or may not meaningfully  address the broken and burdensome permitting process or negate spurious  lawsuits from far-left environmentalists. And even if it did provide  meaningful reform, my hopes are not high that the Biden administration  would actually act on the legislation.  [[Page S4009]]    Canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project that endured a decade  of permitting, was already underway, and was to be paired with $1.7  billion in private--yes, private--investment for renewables--it doesn't  install confidence that even approved projects are safe from the  President and Democrats' Green New Deal ideology.   The Democrats' reckless $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan spending  spree helped plunge our economy into an inflation crisis that has left  Americans struggling to make ends meet. If this new, partisan tax-and- spending spree passes, Americans can look forward to a lot more  economic pain in the future. But at least they will be able to console  themselves with the knowledge that their tax dollars are going to fund  tree canopies.   I yield the floor.
