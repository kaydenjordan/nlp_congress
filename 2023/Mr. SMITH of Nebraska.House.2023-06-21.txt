 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our  bill, the Employer Reporting Improvement Act. As was mentioned, the  bill was adapted from legislation that my colleague, Mr. Thompson, and  I have been working on for years, the Commonsense Reporting Act.   The Employer Reporting Improvement Act is a strong step toward  cleaning up the complicated process employers use to report data  required by the IRS and providing employers relief.   This data is used to determine if an employee's health coverage is  considered affordable. Unfortunately, an inadvertent mistake or  omission in reporting this data can result in a financial penalty for  the employer long after the original submission. The potential  financial penalty can put a serious strain on small businesses who are  already struggling with workforce shortages and persistently high  inflation.   While the vast majority of these mistakes are ultimately corrected  without a financial penalty being enforced, employers are still forced  to navigate a complicated maze of bureaucracy to clear up these  unintentional mistakes.   The Employer Reporting Improvement Act makes simple, yet effective  changes, including codifying actions previously taken to create more  safeguards and flexibilities, improving the reporting process, and  making it less likely employers are faced with resolving reporting  problems several years after the fact.   In fact, one of the most important pieces of the bill is the creation  of a reasonable statute of limitations, 6 years, for penalties  resulting from reporting errors.   As we continue our work to improve employer reporting requirements, I  hope we can work with the Treasury Department to find a path forward on  prospective reporting, as Mr. Thompson also elaborated on.   I am glad to support the Employer Reporting Improvement Act. I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.  [[Page H3050]]
