 Mr. Speaker, State and local governments across the  country are caving to woke demands and removing statues of certain  United States Presidents from their public buildings. Last week, Thomas  Jefferson's statue--if you can imagine, Thomas Jefferson's statue--was  removed from New York City's City Hall.   Radical leftists want these statues removed because their goal is to  erase every part of our Nation's history that doesn't get their stamp  of approval. They don't want to see statues of historical figures they  don't like. They don't want you to see them, either, Mr. Speaker.   Governments can decide what they want to display in public buildings,  but what happens to the statues of Presidents they remove? Will they  get covered with a tarp or moved to a dusty corner of a basement  somewhere? Or even worse than that, will they decorate our country's  landfills?   Instead of taking up space in some storage or waste facility, statues  of U.S. Presidents that get removed from government buildings should go  to a national memorial garden. That way they can still be viewed by  people who want to see them and learn about those who led our country  in the past.   In fact, there is a pastor in my district who is a good friend of  mine; he is willing to take presidential statues that these politicians  don't want. Pastor Clarence Sexton will start the national garden  himself at Crown College in Powell, Tennessee, where he serves as  president.   Mr. Speaker, he has probably one of the best collections of United  States memorabilia that I think I have seen outside of the Smithsonian  and has letters and autographs and things from every President since  George Washington.   The far left can pretend all it wants that these figures do not  exist, but you cannot cancel history, Mr. Speaker.                      UFOs are of Great Public Interest     Mr. Speaker, last summer's UFO report from the Director  of National Intelligence was bogus. The report raised more questions  than answers about unidentified objects in the skies. It stunk of a  government coverup, Mr. Speaker.   Now the Pentagon is starting a new office to collect information on  these unidentified objects. The office is called the Airborne Object  Identification and Management Synchronization Group. I don't know where  they came up with that name. I am sure they paid somebody a lot of  money to come up with that.   I do not trust this new office, Mr. Speaker. I don't think it will be  transparent with lawmakers or the public about its findings. This is a  national security issue. Congress needs to know what is going on so we  can respond accordingly.   Today, I am requesting the leaders of this new office bring Members  of Congress in on their UFO findings. This is a matter of great public  interest and has been for a very long time to a lot of Americans. Our  government should not hide the truth from us for another second.   If this new office is to be held accountable, our country will get  more reports like the one that came out last summer or, worse, they  will be silent and hope we all just forget about the phenomena.   We do not need to fear these airborne unidentified objects. They  would have shown themselves to be dangerous a long time ago by now if  they were a threat. Our citizens and country can handle the truth, Mr.  Speaker.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am glad the gentlewoman's mama chose  life.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to be here.   Joe Biden's build back broke agenda is for the coastal elites, not  working Americans or middle class families. Increasing State and local  tax deductions benefits rich Americans living in deep blue States. We  all know the liberal media refuses to report it. This is a tax break  for the wealthy, and we all know it. Even Bernie Sanders of all people  is calling out President Biden for sneaking this into his agenda. So  much for Biden's cries for the wealthy to ``pay their fair share.''   Well, it looks like who is paying their fair share are working  Americans, once again.   There is also the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicle purchases.  Most Americans can't afford electric vehicles that cost an average of  over $55,000, but I will tell you who can; liberals in California and  New York have no problem whatsoever paying for this. It affords them  this opportunity with this enormous tax credit--or as my daughter would  say, ginormous.   Another tax benefit for the wealthy.   Heck, most Americans can't even afford to drive their regular cars  right now because gas prices are too high.   What makes Biden think we will be able to foot the bill for an  electric car?   Speaking of gas prices, build back broke ramps up the attacks on  domestic energy production. This will make us all more reliant on  foreign oil. Biden started this war on affordable energy the day he  took office, and build back broke will make it worse.
