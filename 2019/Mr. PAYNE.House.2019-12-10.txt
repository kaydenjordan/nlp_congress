 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Human Rights Day.   More than 70 years ago today, the United Nations established the  fundamental human rights to be protected for every person in every  nation, such as the right to liberty, freedom from slavery, and freedom  of opinion.   But there were rights added in 1976 that bear repeating here today:  the right to work in just and under favorable conditions, the right to  an adequate standard of living, and the right to an education.   In the last few decades, we have failed to live up to these rights.  We have allowed unions to lose their power and protect worker  conditions. We have failed to increase the Federal minimum wage. We  have failed to provide funding for higher education.   We need to get these rights back for all Americans. We can regain the  high ground in our struggle for human rights.                            ____________________
