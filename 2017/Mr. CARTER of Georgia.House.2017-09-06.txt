 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:       *ERR08*  At the end of division B (before the short title),       insert the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this division       shall be used by the Food and Drug Administration to       finalize, implement or enforce the draft standard memorandum       of understanding made available for public comment on       February 19, 2015, entitled ``Draft Memorandum of       Understanding Addressing Certain Distributions of Compounded       Human Drug Products Between the State of [insert State] and       the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my  amendment to H.R. 3354, the fiscal year '18 appropriations bill.   My amendment would withhold funding from the Food and Drug  Administration to implement a memorandum of understanding that  redefines key terms in the healthcare industry: distribute and  dispense.   Distributing and dispensing in the healthcare field are commonly  understood to be unique and distinct activities. Distributing is  understood to mean the sale or transfer of a drug without a  prescription, like between a wholesaler and a manufacturer. Dispensing  is commonly understood to mean a medicine going specifically toward a  patient.   The FDA's attempt to redefine these key terms would be especially  detrimental to compounding pharmacies. Compounding pharmacies are  desperately needed to combine or mix medicines to meet the unique needs  of particular patients.   In the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA is given limited  regulatory authority over how much a compounding pharmacy is allowed to  ship across State lines, and more specifically, over how much a  pharmacy can distribute across State lines. But since the FDA is now  attempting to redefine the word ``dispense,'' the agency is attempting  to gain more control over these pharmacies and is now limiting the  amount of medicine that can go directly toward patients.   With the FDA redefining the word ``dispensing,'' the agency is now  also limiting how much a State can dispense across State lines,  creating an unnecessary patient access problem, especially for patients  served by pharmacies near State lines.   This amendment is necessary to convey to the FDA that they do not  have the authority to go against the intent of Congress and redefine  key terms in agency documents that are directly against what Congress  laid out in the statute and the commonly understood meaning of the  industry itself.   The amendment will also enforce the directives in Congress' last two  appropriations reports that have been ignored by the FDA.   Mr. Chairman, I want to repeat that. The amendment will also enforce  the directives in Congress' last two appropriations reports that have  been ignored by the FDA, as well as language in the new FY18  Appropriations subcommittee report.   As the only pharmacist in Congress, I have seen firsthand how  important access to medications are for the people who need them. I  have also seen how important compounded medications are for the  individuals who rely on uniquely tailored medicines. It would be a  tragedy for the FDA to limit these patients' access to medications  because they redefined a term for which they would like to have more  control.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment that is crucial  for patient access to important medications and stop the FDA from  overreaching and going against the intent of Congress.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Connecticut is recognized for  5 minutes.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment because it undermines the Drug  Quality and Security Act, which we passed here in 2013 to protect  patients from contaminated compounded medications, which are drugs that  are tailored to the specific needs of an individual patient.   By the way, there is bipartisan opposition to the Carter amendment:  myself, Congressman Fred Upton, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, and  Congressman Mike Bishop. This is bipartisan opposition.   Let me be clear. The intent of the law was not to go after local  compounding pharmacies but, rather, the larger compounding pharmacies  who act as big drug companies. Traditional pharmaceutical companies  that make vast quantities of drugs are held to robust safety standards.  If these large compounding pharmacies intend to manufacture large  quantities of drugs like a traditional pharmaceutical company and ship  them across State lines, then they should be held to a similar safety  standard.   This amendment would change the law and put patients at risk. Some  people can potentially die. This is not hyperbole, given that a  meningitis outbreak in 2012 was caused by unsafe compounded drugs. That  was less than 5 years ago. I am astonished that we would entertain  further undermining of the law. The meningitis outbreak associated with  the New England Compound Center in 2012 led to 64 deaths and more than  750 illnesses across State lines.   There are inherent risks with compounding medications, and  particularly with compounded medications shipped across State lines.  That is why, in fact, we passed the Drug Quality and Security Act. By  prohibiting the FDA from implementing this law, this amendment exposes  patients to a potentially life-threatening catastrophe.   Again, as we saw in 2012, this amendment also takes away incentives  for pharmacies to register as an outsourcing facility and gives these  facilities no reason to raise their quality and safety standards and to  submit to the FDA for inspection. We owe it to the American people to  not put their health and their safety at risk. Sixty-four people died.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.   Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chair, the Drug Quality and Security Act  was passed in 2013 in response to the multistate fungal meningitis  outbreak that occurred due to contaminated compounded drug products  from the New England Compounding Center.   Drugs from a single facility in one state were shipped nationwide,  over 750 patients were affected, and 64 patients died in 20 states  across the country.   DQSA (D-Q-S-A) helps ensure that if compounders are shipping drugs  nationwide, they are doing so from states that exercise meaningful  oversight. This is an important patient safety protection in the law.   This amendment would weaken FDA's ability to implement this important  patient protection legislation by denying FDA funding to finalize the  Memorandum of Understanding Congress mandated FDA develop.   Congress must not forget the tragedy that happened just 5 years ago  by turning back the clock and remove the protections Congress itself  put in place to prevent another outbreak.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by Rep. Carter.                                time  1930    The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will  be postponed.                 Amendment No. 18 Offered by Mr. King of Iowa    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
