 Mr. Speaker, John Lewis has a true legacy of leadership  in this House, and he changed the world that we live in.   When Congressman Lewis would take the podium, everyone in this House  would fall silent and listen to him. I doubt in his long career in this  House that the Speaker ever had to hammer the House into order to  listen to John Lewis speak.   A man who fought for the Voting Rights Act, John Lewis' legacy  demands that Congress act. I call on Congress to pass and send to the  President's desk for signature the bipartisan H.R. 1799 renewing the  Voting Rights Act.   Congressman Lewis was a giant in history, but he was a humble man in  this House. He treated every Member the same and with dignity. He will  be missed.
