The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit.        Sec. 7.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 684) condemning the       actions of Governor of New Mexico, Michelle Lujan Grisham,       for subverting the Second Amendment to the Constitution and       depriving the citizens of New Mexico of their right to bear       arms. The resolution shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or       their respective designees.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), the ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I  yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on  House Resolution 712.    Madam Speaker, last night the Rules Committee met and  reported out a rule, House Resolution 712, providing for consideration  of H.R. 4365, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal  Year 2024, under a structured rule.   It provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled  by the  [[Page H4444]]  chair and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations or their  respective designees. It also makes in order 184 amendments, more than  75 percent of those eligible for consideration. Finally, it provides  for one motion to recommit.   The rule also makes in order H.R. 1130, the Unlocking our Domestic  LNG Potential Act of 2023 under a structured rule. It provides for 1  hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce or their  respective designees. It provides for one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule makes in order H. Res. 684 under a closed rule. It  provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their  respective designees.   I rise today, Madam Speaker, in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   Madam Speaker, as Members are aware, the House has previously debated  an identical rule covering H.R. 4365. This was a fulsome and passionate  debate, and I said most of what was needed to be said from my point of  view during that debate, but I will make a few key points about this  bill again now.   The bill before us provides full funding for our national defense. It  appropriates $826 billion in new discretionary spending, which is a  modest increase of $300 million over the President's budget request of  nearly $29 billion or 3.6 percent over the FY 2023 enacted level.   Madam Speaker, this truly is a good bill, one that I think the House  can and should be proud of. It makes appropriate investments in the  military and ensures that dollars are being directed where they are  needed the most. It invests heavily in our servicemembers, providing  them with a 5.2 percent pay raise. It provides continued funding for  new advanced weapons systems, ensuring that the military has the force  it needs to confront any foe anywhere in the world at any time, and it  continues to expand the Navy to protect the freedom of the seas and  invests heavily in Asia and the Pacific theater where China continues  to expand its own military might in anticipation of a confrontation  with the United States and our allies.   Madam Speaker, providing funding for our national defense is both  Congress' privilege and its responsibility. In order for our brave men  and women in uniform to do their jobs, Congress must do its job. Today,  we can take that first step toward doing so.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 1130, the Unlocking  our Domestic LNG Potential Act of 2023. This bill removes regulatory  barriers for the construction and licensing of new liquid natural gas  or LNG import and export terminals.   Madam Speaker, when the Republican majority took over in January, we  committed to unleashing America's energy potential. For too long,  regulatory roadblocks and active hostility of the Biden administration  have made it difficult to expand production of America's abundant  energy resources, but despite the Biden administration's hostility,  America is today the top producer of natural gas in the world.   From my home State of Oklahoma, this is not an academic point.  Oklahoma is the fifth largest natural gas producing State in the  country, with nearly 350,000 jobs in the State tied directly to natural  gas production. It is a critical part of my home State's economy.   In recent years, innovation and new technology have revolutionized  and expanded the production of natural gas, both in Oklahoma and in the  United States as a whole. The people of my district are very proud to  be part of that revolution. There is still more to be done, and the  passage of H.R. 1130 will help make it easier, cheaper, and quicker to  bring new LNG export terminals online.   It is no exaggeration to say that American natural gas is a critical  part of the world's energy mix, particularly in Europe, which  previously sourced much of its natural gas from Russia, and we are  capable of achieving more. The end result will be a strong future for  us as we create more high-paying jobs and maintain America's energy  independence and a strong future for our friends and allies around the  world who can source their energy needs from us rather than from  vicious dictators like Vladimir Putin.   Madam Speaker, all in all, this is a strong bill, one that I am  certainly proud to support.   Finally, the rule makes in order H. Res. 684, which condemns New  Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham for her executive order  attempting to subvert the Second Amendment rights of New Mexico's  citizens.   As Members are aware, earlier this month, Governor Grisham issued an  executive order purporting to suspend the right of New Mexicans to open  and concealed carry of firearms. Governor Grisham claimed that this was  necessary in order to deal with a public health emergency.   Of course, this claim is patently absurd, and there is not now, nor  has there ever been, a public health emergency and exception for  constitutional rights. The right of Americans to bear arms is protected  by the Second Amendment to the Constitution, and a constitutional right  cannot be subverted at the whim of an elected official.                                time  0930    Last week, a Federal judge in New Mexico agreed and issued a  restraining order blocking implementation of this patently  unconstitutional order.   Governor Grisham has rightly received condemnation on a bipartisan  basis for her actions. H. Res. 684 will give all Members of Congress an  opportunity to do so officially and on the record.   It is always appropriate for the House to take time to reaffirm our  values as a country and to protect the constitutional rights that form  the foundation of our Republic.   Indeed, I urge all Members to do so and speak with one voice,  reminding all Americans that when it comes to their constitutional  rights, the House of Representatives has their back.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support both the rule and the  underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would again return my friend's compliments. I enjoy  working with him on the Rules Committee. We have been there together a  long time. There is nobody I have a higher professional and personal  regard for than my good friend.   Now honestly, Madam Speaker, I wish I had his talent for colorful  rhetoric. I particularly like the ``Groundhog Day'' reference. I remind  my friend, while there are some similarities, the movie had a happy  ending. Everybody learned some lessons and they got to where they  needed to be. I think we may be involved in a process something like  that.   I disagree with my friend that the issues being brought up in this  bill are trivial. Defending the United States of America is not a  trivial thing. You can agree or disagree with the bill, and I will talk  about that in a minute. That is fair enough. I don't consider that  trivial.   Providing natural gas in abundance and at modest prices to Americans  and having that resource to deal with our adversaries overseas, who  often use energy as a weapon, and to be able to provide for our friends  and allies reliable energy is not a trivial matter. It is an  extraordinarily important matter.   The 10 million Americans that work in the domestic energy industry  think what we are doing here is the right thing to do. I don't consider  their interests and their views trivial. I am just very privileged to  represent many people that have that point of view and are involved in  that particular profession.   Finally, I don't consider standing up for the Second Amendment a  trivial thing. We have a Governor that issued an order that a Federal  judge immediately overturned and Democrats in New Mexico condemned-- elected Democrats, law enforcement officials. It is actually one of the  areas that is usually a contentious issue that we had really strong  bipartisan agreement. We think it is important to make my point.   My friends have a different point of view. That is fair enough. Just  express it, and we will move on. Again, we don't consider defense of  the Constitution to be trivial.   I agree with my friend about a number of things, and we have had this  discussion, frankly, as friends in the Rules Committee.   I agree with him about shutdowns. I do not think it is an appropriate  tactic, and I hope that we are able to avoid one. There will be an  appropriate time, I am sure, when we discuss with our friends how to do  that, but we need a negotiating position. We are working toward that,  and we hope we will get there.   Believe me, I am well aware that we have a Democratic Senate. This  House has done wonderful work on things like H.R. 1 to deal with  energy, H.R. 2 to deal with our border. We send them over there and  they are never picked up, never heard of again unless we can snatch  pieces out of them here or there and attach them to one of these  broader agreements, as we were able to do on the debt ceiling crisis  over permitting of facilities, both for renewable and nonrenewable  energy.   Again, it is a difficult legislative process, and I agree it is going  to be complicated, but our goal is to get to the same place; that is,  to make sure that the government is funded, and also, that we advance  shared values that we have and have an open and honest discussion with  the United States Senate. When we do that, we have been able to find  some agreement.   My friend likes to point out--all my Democratic friends like to point  out regularly--well, gosh, why are you passing appropriations bills  that are less than to the letter agreed on? Well, gee whiz, where I  come from, if you can do something for less money, that is usually a  good thing to do. I am never going to apologize. If we see a different  way to get to a policy objective that costs less money, that is a good  thing to do.   Now, I know when we discussed this last night, the Senate is  consistently appropriating above the agreed-upon number. All the  appropriations bills, or pretty much all of them that they have dealt  with so far, are at higher levels. So guess what? We will get into  negotiation. My guess is they will come down some. We will come up  some, and we will find some sort of common deal. That is just the way  politics work. I am never going to be critical of my colleagues for  trying to do something cheaper and save money.   I remind my friend of the condition in which the Democratic majority  left  [[Page H4446]]  our fiscal finances. We are running a $1.7 trillion deficit this year.  That is bigger than all the discretionary budget of the United States  of America. We have not had a Democratic President submit a budget that  comes into balance--not in a decade, but ever, since Bill Clinton.   President Obama never did. President Biden never has. I don't think  any future Democrat will.   We used to have Democrats in the 1990s that we disagreed with, that  we fought, but they said, well, let's try to get to a balanced budget  within 10 years, and they managed to do that.   My friends have basically abdicated that debate. They just let it go  on and on out to infinity. Even President Trump submitted budgets that  within a decade came into balance. I didn't always agree with some of  the decisions. I don't think either party has done a very good job.   My friend and I have had this discussion in dealing with the real  drivers of debt: that is mandatory spending; that is Social Security,  Medicaid, and Medicare. We need to have that debate. I hope the  Presidential contest has it. I note at least some of the discussions we  have been having in our caucus talk about having a debt commission  attached to some of this, so perhaps we can make some modest steps.   My friends heard me talk about my Social Security bill, which is  really modeled after what was done in 1983 by Ronald Reagan, Tip  O'Neill, and Howard Baker working together, a commission, then Congress  voting--including, by the way, the President of the United States at  that time who liked commissions, voting for the commission, for the  deal, and it worked. It improved the fiscal solvency of the country. It  extended the life of Social Security, a program I know that we both  support.   Again, you may think these are trivial issues. We don't. We think we  have a long process in front of us. These are steps in the right  direction on the appropriate end that won't be enough.   Madam Speaker, the last point I will make--and my friend and I just  disagree here--look, defense is a very different thing than any other  part of the appropriations process. Most appropriations process is  about things that are desirable and good.   I have worked pretty hard on cancer research, so my friend's points  are well made there. I think those are valuable investments.   Defense is about threats. We had a peace dividend in the 1990s. You  know why we had it? Because the Soviet Union had collapsed, and we  could prudently save money in defense.   I will tell you right now, I would go higher than the number here;  but if the number we have on defense is outrageous, your first call  ought to be to the White House because it is basically the President's  number. We actually pulled back from where our defense appropriators  wanted to go and a lot of our defense hawks wanted to go because we did  think addressing the horrific deficits that were inherited from the  last Democratic era meant we even had to make sacrifices here.                                time  0945    I am not really comfortable with it, but it is a step in the right  direction. We might not even had to have that if you hadn't, through  reckless spending, unleashed the worst inflation in 40 years. I  actually have a 40-year-old son. He had never seen anything like what  happened in the Biden administration because of irresponsibly passing  the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and another $700 billion much- misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.   We inherited a mess. We inherited inflation. We inherited record  deficits.   It is a pretty tough deal. My friends don't want to address it. Well,  this majority is going to do its best to address those issues. We do  struggle and disagree, and sometimes I get frustrated with some of my  friends on my side of the aisle about tactics.   My colleague is right about one thing, and I will agree 100 percent.  There is no objection to this rule on the basis of the rule. There is  nothing wrong with it. It has 184 amendments. You can agree or disagree  with the bill, but it is a good rule.   In my view, there is nothing wrong with the bill, other than I would  like to have spent a little bit more money. Like any bill that spends  this amount of money, everybody could do it a little bit differently.   People are trying to make other points unrelated to the bill, and I  will agree with my friend that that is unfortunate. I don't think that  is a good way to legislate. I think my colleagues should look at the  legislation in front of them. If they agree with the rule, they ought  to vote for it. If they disagree, it is fair enough to vote against it.  However, if they agree with the basic bill, don't relate it to  something else and try to use it as a weapon. We don't have many  Members who do that, but we have a few.   As my friend knows, we have a very narrow majority. He has been here  once or twice himself when they had narrow majorities. It is part of  the legislative process. We will continue to work it.   My hope today is we will advance this rule. It will open the way to  advance what I think is a good Defense appropriations bill, and we will  continue to move legislatively as rapidly as we can. We will work and,  at the appropriate time, I am sure, work across the rotunda with  Democrats in the Senate and probably in this Chamber with some of my  Democratic friends. Hopefully, we will avoid a government shutdown.   The most important thing today: Move the rule. Move the bill. That is  what we are going to try to do.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to respond to some of my good friend from Pennsylvania's  points, and some of them I agree with. I do think shutting down the  government is not an appropriate tactic. We agree on that.   You know, linking them to election results is really an interesting  exercise. The government shutdown that I think my friend thought was in  2011, if I am correct, and I may be wrong, was really the one in 2013.  We actually picked up seats in 2014. I don't think that is why we  picked up seats. My friends always forget that they shut down the  government in 2017, and they won seats in 2018. So you can pretty much  play these numbers however you want.   The important point, which my friend makes and I agree with, is that  shutting down the government is bad for the American people. It is an  abdication of our responsibility. It is something we should not do. I  have never supported it in the past. I hope we manage to avoid one now.  I think that is exactly what the Speaker is engaged in trying to  accomplish, whether my friends agree with his methods or not.   I will tell you, I am mystified by this concern about the agreement.  Again, we agreed on top-line numbers. We didn't say we are going to the  top-line numbers. This is the top-line number, and if we can do it for  less and persuade the Senate that that is a good idea, then I don't see  that as a bad thing.   If my friends are concerned about keeping agreements, maybe they  ought to call over to their friends in the United States Senate who are  producing bill after bill that are above these numbers.   Guess what? I suspect each side is positioning for a negotiation, and  magically, we probably won't be too far off, if we come to an  agreement, of the numbers that are laid out in the debt ceiling deal.   I am not telling you this is the most efficient way to legislate, but  I have seen it before, and we are seeing it from both sides right now.   In terms of the budget, I tell you what, I am interested in the  opinions my friends have on the budget because they didn't bother to do  one for the 4 years they were in the majority. I am thrilled they are  actually marking up a budget in the Budget Committee. I give Chairman  Arrington a lot of credit for doing it. It is hard to do. My friends  didn't do it for 4 years because they couldn't do it because they  couldn't come to an agreement.   As a matter of fact, I remember those 4 years I used to serve on the  Budget Committee. You couldn't get a budget out of the Budget Committee  that you controlled.   Do you want to talk about dysfunction? The Budget Committee sets the  top-line number for all spending. Maybe that is why we overspent so  much. As a matter of fact, you deemed budgets in the rule.   So I would agree with you. We should probably be sitting down and  figuring out ways to run our fiscal affairs better and particularly do  it in a more cooperative way because, as my friends point out, they do  control the United States Senate and the United States Presidency.   However, please don't lecture me on how you do budgets when you had  the House, the Senate, and the Presidency and could not write a budget  in 4 years and get it out of your own committee, let alone bring it to  this floor. Some of those years you weren't operating with a five-seat  majority. You just couldn't get the job done.    We are trying. I commend the Budget Committee. I hope they bring one  out here. I will be disappointed if they don't, but at least they are  making the effort.   Finally, again, to my friends, I can't figure out whether you want  the Speaker to succeed or not because there are lots of expressions  that you feel sorry for him in the job he has. Don't worry, he likes  the job he has. He works hard at it every day.   I think he is a good Speaker. He delivered on a debt ceiling deal  that my friends even in the end came around and voted for. He delivered  one that was a heck of a lot better because it had some genuine  concessions in it, in terms of energy production and in terms of  setting top lines.   We are on the eve of another kind of negotiation, and maybe we can  find common ground again. I genuinely, quite frankly, hope that we do.  In that process, there will be plenty of people on both sides of the  aisle who don't like what the end product is, and they will vote  accordingly. That is fair enough.   This is just kind of the way it works around here right now, and I  think the Speaker is doing a terrific job of trying to work the  process, trying to make sure legislation moves across the floor in  regular order, and trying to get to numbers that begin to bring down  this horrific deficit that my friends left the country with, with no  plan to deal with it.   Nobody in the White House has a plan. The President has never  submitted a budget that comes into balance. He won't talk about  entitlement reform. He rules it out.   Sorry, if you are serious about the budget deficit, you do control  two-thirds of this process. I know it is inconvenient when we bring up  the fact that we are spending a lot more money and you have no plan to  deal with it, but that is what we are going to do.  [[Page H4448]]    We will see. The American people can make a choice in the next  election about that, but I am not going to be critical of my friends.  Even when I am critical of their tactics, and I am sometimes, I am not  critical of people who are trying to lower the budget deficit and  trying to restore a measure of fiscal sanity to this country. That is  something the Democrats used to care about, did care about when I first  got here. They totally abandoned it during the Obama Presidency.   When my friends want to get serious, they will have a willing  negotiating partner on the budget.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Alford), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In  closing, I urge all of my colleagues to support the resolution.   The rule will make in order three bills.   First, it makes in order the Department of Defense Appropriations Act  for fiscal year 2024. It will provide full and complete funding for our  Armed Forces and Defense needs and provides the resources necessary to  defend freedom around the world.   It makes in order H.R. 1130, Unlocking our Domestic LNG Potential  Act. We think that is important.   My friend had an interesting discussion about LIHEAP. I actually  share my friend's view. It is an important program. I remember when I  chaired the subcommittee on Appropriations, I had to actually reverse a  cut ordered by President Obama of $300 million in his own budget, and  we stopped that from happening.   People throw out numbers, and then you work it through. I always call  a Presidential budget a bargaining position. I think the same thing  tends to be true of congressional budgets, but we will work that  through.   The real cause of lack of heating, though--let's be real about this-- is not LIHEAP and whether it is funded or not. It is whether or not  there is natural gas to heat it in the first place. My friends have  done everything possible to increase the cost and limit the  availability of the very product that they want to provide with a  government program.   It would be better for every single American if you would just simply  be pro-energy production in our country. It is okay to be for  renewables. I am for renewables. My State is number one or two in the  country in wind power, well ahead of a lot of other progressive States.   We just think what works is what you ought to do. We have got a lot  of wind in Oklahoma. It makes a lot of sense, so we use it, and, if it  lowers emissions, we think that is good. Natural gas, by the way, has  been the single biggest driver of lowering emissions. My friends have  done nothing but make it harder in that industry. Frankly--and I mean  this with all due respect--I hear people in that industry and companies  in that industry vilified routinely. If I said those things about  people in your respective States engaged in energy or in other kinds of  production, you would be appalled, because you know those people.   I have got millions of people in the energy industry. I have  thousands of people in my district that go out and work on rigs. They  go out and lay pipeline. They go out and find oil and gas. It is hard  work. They do that, and they give many parts of the country that don't  have energy production the cheapest energy in the world outside of a  couple of petrostates, and the most secure product, and they have  tripled production in petroleum since about 2006. Yet, the price of gas  goes up--it is a lot less here than it is almost anyplace in the  world--and then they say, oh, my gosh, they are profiteering. No, there  are market forces out there. That is off the subject.   I would just say my friends are worried about the cost of heating.  LIHEAP is a good program. I support it. I have proven that over and  over again. Please, let's make sure that we have the gas in the first  place.   Finally, my friends dismiss the importance of the Second Amendment  because they disagree with it for the most part. That is fair enough.  All we are saying is we want the opportunity to actually invest things.   My friend made a couple of other points I just want to quickly  address, because I want him to be under no--  [[Page H4451]]  and I don't think he is--under any illusion. I hold Senator Murray and  Senator Collins in very high regard. I have worked with them both. I  have worked with Senator Murray, in particular, for 8 years, either as  chair, or ranking member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies when she held the same  respective position. We came to a deal almost every year. The  gentlewoman is a good legislator, and Senator Collins is legendary.   What the Senate is crafting over there right now is well above the  agreement that my friend thinks we are violating. It is pretty easy to  declare emergencies. Yes, I would love to spend more money on defense.  I have said that on this floor. I have said that during this debate.  Let's call it emergency and heap it on.   They are laying out a negotiating position. It is fair enough. My  guess is we are going to end up pretty close to the numbers we agreed  upon.    My friends have been very critical of my leader, the Speaker of the  House, and that is fair enough. This is politics. I will tell you this:  You guys said he wouldn't get elected, and he did. You said he wouldn't  get a bill across the floor to deal with the debt ceiling and then  negotiate a deal, but he did. Let's wait and see how this plays out.   My friends need to remember, when it comes to these fiscal issues,  they are the ones that never passed a budget for 4 years. They are the  ones that left us with a $1.7 trillion deficit, and they have got the  White House and the Senate and have not produced any plan to address  it, nor have they been willing to sit down and talk to us about, in a  bipartisan way, how could we start dealing with what we all know is the  big driver, and that is entitlement programs.   We have a lot of problems in front of us. We can point a lot of  fingers. Let's do the right thing today, though, and start addressing  them.   The right thing today is to move ahead and pass this rule, get onto a  debate about what we think are important issues. Defending the country  is certainly an important issue. Securing our energy future is  important, and dealing with constitutional rights, and we will continue  to discuss and work on these other matters.   I will agree with my friend. I am not for shutting down the  government. I hope we don't get there, and I always worry about that as  we approach these kind of deadlines.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
