 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Women and  Climate Change Act of 2022. This bill affirms the U.S. commitment to  supporting a group of people who are most often negatively impacted by  climate change, yet too often left out of decisionmaking and policy  development--women. The bill creates a Federal interagency working  group, established by the Department of State, that will collect data  and develop policies and strategies to address the effects of climate  change on women both at home and abroad. Communities all across the  United States and the world are currently feeling the impacts of  climate change. The time to empower women to respond to this crisis is  now. As we commemorate International Women's Day today, we are reminded  of the important roles that women play in communities across the world  and seize this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to working  towards equity.   The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCC,  highlights that the majority of the world's poor is made up of women  who rely on natural resources in their daily lives and are least likely  to be able to respond to extreme weather events. These women  disproportionately face the brunt of climate change impacts, yet too  often have little power or say over how they, their families, and their  communities are able to combat climate change. UNFCC notes that when  women are allowed a role in developing strategies that address climate  change, it often results in great responsiveness to local needs,  enabling resilience and capacity building, and delivering peace across  communities.   The rising costs of climate change to communities at home and abroad,  both in terms of fatalities and expenses, are sobering. According to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, last year  the United States alone experienced 20 weather and climate disasters  that cost at least $1 billion each, netting a $145 billion price tag  and resulting in 688 deaths. Data from NOAA indicates a trend of  increasing billion-dollar disasters each decade since the 1980s, with  the expectation that the trend will continue.   According to Christian Aid, a relief agency in the United Kingdom  working to address poverty, the 10 worst global climate disasters in  2021 cost $170 billion. These included Hurricane Ida, which impacted  the east coast of the United States and resulted in at least 95 deaths,  flooding in Europe that caused 240 fatalities, and July floods in China  that killed over 300 individuals.   The latest report issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change, IPCC, last month highlights the consequences that the world  will face if countries do not take immediate and significant action to  address climate change. These consequences include extreme heat,  floods, wildfire, drought, and famine that could result in malnutrition  and displacement of people across the globe. The report also noted that  between 2010 and 2020, extreme weather events fueled by climate change  killed 15 times the number of people in poor countries as in wealthier  nations. The report underscores how women will continue to face  mounting challenges as the world experiences more severe and costly  climate-fueled disasters. Women play a critical role in combating  climate change--both within their communities and on a global scale. By  including them at all levels, from planning to implementation, and  providing them with the platform and support to carry out these  strategies, we have the opportunity to create fair, effective, and  sustainable solutions to respond to the climate crisis.   This bill is a companion to H.R. 260, which was introduced by my  colleague Representative Barbara Lee early last year. I thank her for  her leadership on this bill and look forward to continuing our work to  see that women all across the world are empowered to help confront this  global crisis.   Groups in support of this bill include Sierra Club, Planned  Parenthood, the Women's Environment and Development Organization,  Madre, Outdoor Afro, California Environmental Voters, Oxfam America,  League of Conservation Voters, and Schools for Climate Action.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:  [[Page S1062]]    S. 3788. A bill to address the homelessness and housing crises, to  move toward the goal of providing for a home for all Americans, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs.
