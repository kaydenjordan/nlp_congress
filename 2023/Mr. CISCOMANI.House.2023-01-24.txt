 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor James Thomas Kolbe,  an Arizonan, a decorated Navy veteran, and a patriot who faithfully  served my State and our country for most of his life.   James Thomas Kolbe always introduced himself as Jim, and that is how  he will be remembered by all those who knew him and those in this  Chamber who were his colleagues.   For 22 years, Jim also was well known in his hometown of Tucson and  here in the Nation's Capitol by the position he held--Congressman.   Congressman Kolbe died on December 3 at the age of 80. He led a long,  accomplished life, and I am honored, truly honored, to hold the House  seat he held for 11 terms.   Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege as a new Member of the United  States House of Representatives to offer this tribute to a man I  considered a friend, a mentor, and a role model.   Jim was an elder statesman of Arizona politics. He was a proven vote- getter who knew how to build coalitions to achieve real results for his  district, his State, and our Nation. He knew how to get things done in  Washington but never forgot who sent him here and why. He was a  tireless advocate for Arizona, and he brought that unique Arizona  perspective to public policy debates for which this body is so well  known.   Jim served alongside giants and, in the process, became one himself.  Barry Goldwater, Mo Udall, Ed Pastor, John McCain, Jon Kyl--Jim knew  and worked with them all. In fact, Jim got his first taste of politics  as a young man serving as a page for the legendary Senator Goldwater,  who was in his final term when the voters of what was then Arizona's  Fifth Congressional District chose Jim to be their voice in Washington.   Jim was born in Illinois, the Land of Lincoln, but became a champion  of the party of Lincoln in Arizona. He came to the Grand Canyon State  when he was 5 with his parents when he left the Midwest for a ranch in  the desert of southern Arizona, just a few miles from the border with  Mexico.   Little did Jim know back then that our country's relationship with  Mexico would become one of his signature issues as a Representative  from a border State. Jim was a celebrity in the big small town of  Tucson.   No matter where he went, everyone knew him. Folks would approach him  in the grocery store, at the gas station, or on the street. When they  stopped him and called him Congressman Kolbe, he would always make sure  to remind them, ``Just call me Jim.''   I first met Jim when I was a student at Pima Community College. He  was my hometown Representative. We continued our relationship long  after that first meeting over two decades ago.   Jim gave me wise advice when I first decided to run for his former  seat. I will always remember our regular catch-up meetings at Millie's  Pancake Haus on the east side of town.   Jim was someone who came to the House not for a big title but to do  big things, and he did just that. He was an expert on trade and became  one of the chief architects of the original North American Free Trade  Agreement, which he was convinced was a key that opened the door to  prosperity.   Fiscal responsibility was important to Jim. Our environment was  important to Jim. Water was important to Jim. He was never reluctant to  work across the aisle.   Jim was everything a Representative should be. He understood that the  word ``Representative'' was not a job title; it was a job description,  and that is why he came back to Tucson nearly every weekend to hear  firsthand what was on people's minds.    Jim, my friend, on behalf of the men and women of our little corner  of Arizona, thank you. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your  steadfast commitment to making our district, our State, and our Nation  a better place.   My prayers are with Hector and the Kolbe family.                            ____________________
