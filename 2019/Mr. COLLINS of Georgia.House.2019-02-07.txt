 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 494, the Tiffany Joslyn Juvenile  Accountability Block Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2019. The  bill reauthorizes the Justice Department's Juvenile Accountability  Block Grant--JABG--program, strengthens the program to reduce youth  crime, and contains vigorous accountability and oversight mechanisms to  ensure taxpayer dollars are efficiently and wisely utilized.   I would like to say thank you to the sponsor of this legislation,  Congresswoman Jackson Lee, for her hard work and, as she just explained  in great detail, the many things about this bill that are good for us  and why I would support this bill.   When young people commit crimes, it has a serious and long-lasting  detrimental impact. Our children represent the promise of a bright  future and the hope for continued prosperity. That means improving the  juvenile justice system and reducing juvenile crimes is crucial to  preserving and protecting the future of our children and our Nation.   The JABG program provides grants to States, Tribes, and localities to  strengthen juvenile justice systems and reduce recidivism among  offenders.   The program currently has 17 authorized purpose areas, including the  implementation of graduated sanctions for juveniles; support for  prosecutorial initiatives aimed at curbing drug use, violence, and  gangs; accountability-based school safety initiatives; the  establishment of juvenile drug courts; and bullying and cyberbullying  prevention.   The JABG has a long history of bipartisan support among members of  the Judiciary Committee and in Congress as a whole.   Again, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Jackson Lee, for her hard  work on this legislation, and I would encourage my colleagues to  support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other additional  speakers for this and would inquire of the gentlewoman from Texas if  she is ready to close on this piece of legislation.    Is it my understanding the gentlewoman is  asking for a correction to the short title? Is that what we are looking  for?    I see the gentlewoman's concern here on lines  4, 5, and 6 of the bill. I mean, are we awaiting a ruling from----     I understand.    Look, personally, from my perspective, to  continue our colloquy here, I have no problem with the name. I think it  was probably an oversight in drafting from a previous time.    But I am not sure how we would do it at this  point, unless we could agree.                           Parliamentary Inquiries     Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    From an inquiry position, is it possible here  that we could unanimous consent a change to this title?    Mr. Speaker, continuing my parliamentary  inquiry, could it also be a possibility for the gentlewoman to  understand that this is the intent, and we have this into the Record;  that if she was to move ahead with this, that I am sure this will be  probably well-respected and well-founded in the Senate; that we could  make the change in the Senate and have it back over for us so that we  could make this, and not hold up the further proceedings today?    Well, it is a proper question.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    If I hear the gentlewoman correctly, what she  is asking is continuing as we were 5 minutes ago into this process and  continuing on. Is that the gentlewoman's intention?    No, I do not.    Mr. Speaker, obviously, the gentlewoman from  Texas has ultimate passion on this bill and I would not say anything  except that we support this legislation. We look forward to moving it.  I am sure that she will be able to make any changes she needs to.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today makes a small but significant  change to the Federal fraud statutes to protect veterans from  fraudsters who seek to steal their benefits. It does so by inserting a  new provision into the criminal code to complement the mail and wire  fraud statutes.   In recent years, there have been reports of criminals entering  nursing homes in search of elderly veterans with the intent to defraud  them of their Federal benefits. Like many crimes of fraud, Mr. Speaker,  the worst part is that people often present themselves as helpful to  the veteran. This is a truly heinous crime worthy of Congress'  attention.   This legislation has passed this House twice by overwhelming margins,  and it also incorporates technical assistance from the Department of  Justice, ensuring it will be effective in practice.   This is a bill that is supported by many. My colleague, Mr. Meadows  from North Carolina, has spoken eloquently about this, and we will be  entering his message under general leave as well.   As a member of the Air Force Reserve and an Iraq veteran, Mr.  Speaker, this issue is near and dear to my heart. I have introduced  numerous pieces of legislation over the years to protect our veterans  and to expedite the benefits process.   Our men and women in uniform have sacrificed much for us. They are  entitled to our gratitude, our respect, and our protection.    As President Abraham Lincoln reminded us 156 years ago, it is our  duty ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his  widow, and his orphan.''   Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in my mind more heinous than someone  who tries to defraud a veteran of what they have earned. This is  something that we can all come around on. This is something we can all  support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I think this is something we can  all get around. I think, again, when we deal with our veterans, I have  made the comments many times before, not specifically in dealing with  this fraud and dealing with the issues here that are just heinous--and  anybody who would do this definitely would put themselves on the  margins of society--but also on a broader picture with our veterans.   I think this scenario where we can all come together--I long for a  time in which my constituents services folks back in Georgia, I long  for a time when I listen to their report each week, and I want to come  to a time when there are no veteran issues.   We should strive in our country to have a time in which no veteran  should feel the need to have to go to their Congressman to get help.  That is something that we can all shoot for. That is a worthy goal. I  would love to have that time to let them help other people and not  these men and women who have served us so proudly. Mr. Speaker, I know  you would join me in that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  507, the Put Trafficking Victims First Act of 2019.   Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery, which has taken  its toll on communities across our Nation. It is a multibillion-dollar  criminal industry that denies freedom to nearly 25 million people  around the globe.    Traffickers use violence, threats, deception, debt bondage, and other  horrendous tactics to force people to engage in commercial sex or to  provide labor or services against their will. This creates an enormous  need for expanded victims services, improved data on the prevalence and  trends of human trafficking, and effective mechanisms to identify and  rescue trafficking victims.   H.R. 507 expresses the sense of Congress that a portion of the funds  available under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act  of 2000 should be devoted to increasing the safety of victim service  providers, many of whom are threatened because of their positions. It  also promotes a trauma-informed, evidence-based, and victim-centered  approach for providing services to the victims of trafficking.   Additionally, H.R. 507 promotes the effective prosecution of human  traffickers and individuals who patronize or solicit children for sex.  It encourages States to improve efforts to identify and meet the needs  of human trafficking victims.   The bill also establishes a working group to identify barriers to the  collection of data on the incidence of sex and labor trafficking and  recommended practices to promote better data collection and analysis.   Finally, H.R. 507 will provide assistance to trafficking victims  seeking restitution, many of whom still face many obstacles in Federal  court. The bill directs the Attorney General to report on efforts to  increase mandatory restitution for victims by providing Congress with  the relevant data.   Mr. Speaker, this has been an issue in my home State of Georgia. It  is one that I am very proud to know that, under Governor Deal, our  previous Governor, and continuing under Governor Kemp, that around,  especially, the city of Atlanta, a very international city, it has  also, unfortunately, become an area in which sexual exportation and  human trafficking was something that became a scar and is still  affecting our city. We saw that around the Super Bowl and the several  arrests that took place.   This is something that needs to be erased from our vocabulary. This  is something that does not need to be talked about. Again, human  trafficking anywhere in the world is wrong and, hopefully, will be  relegated to the annals of the history books at some point.   I want to commend the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass) and also  my friend, the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), for their  tireless devotion to continuing this path and bringing this forward  each Congress.   I am looking forward to this actually becoming law during this  session, and I would urge all of my colleagues to support this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). She is someone  to whom this has been a tireless call. She has been a sponsor of this,  and outspoken on this, a fighter on this, along with the other folks  who have talked about this.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, much has been said about this bill. I think all of it is  very timely, and I think, again, as we look at this, this is a time in  which we all come together and make a very strong statement in support  of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there are so many times on this floor that we come down  here and we talk about things that divide us, but I have to say, Mr.  Cohen and I, we have had so many things that sometimes we don't see eye  to eye on, but we are still friends, and this is one of those times  where we have been pursuing this one for a long time. This is a bill  that I have been very privileged to have him be a part of and sponsor.                                time  1400    H.R. 752, the Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act, is to provide  transparency and oversight for taxpayer dollars awarded under the Equal  Access to Justice Act.   Of all the folks who have been cosponsors on this, Mr. Cohen has  stood out among all. He has been such a great supporter of this, and it  is good to have him with us managing this bill.   I also thank Representatives Cheney and Peterson for being original  cosponsors and their continued leadership on this.   Also, Mr. Speaker, because this is, I believe, something we should  have passed last Congress, we went ahead and worked it, and, today, we  are also excited to have identical legislation that has been introduced  in the Senate by Senators Barrasso and Coons.   This bill has previously passed the House unanimously. It is common  sense and restores needed congressional and public oversight.   Congress originally passed the Equal Access to Justice Act in 1980 to  remove a barrier to justice for those with limited access to the  resources it takes to sue the Federal Government and to recover  attorney's fees and costs that go along with such suits. The law was  meant to give citizens the ability to challenge or defend against  unreasonable government actions where they might otherwise be deterred  or unable to do so because of large legal expenses.  [[Page H1414]]    The Equal Access to Justice Act was intended for true David and  Goliath scenarios where a wronged citizen is facing the Federal  Government's vast resources. This law has been on the books for decades  and remains important. However, since 1995, tracking and reporting  requirements on payments under the law have been halted. Without a  comprehensive Federal report on the total amount of fees under the law,  we have fallen behind in oversight responsibilities and can't tell, in  a meaningful way, if that law is still working as intended.   In fact, a Government Accountability Office report indicated that,  without any direction to track payments, most agencies simply do not do  it. We have only anecdotal evidence about how much we are spending on  attorney's fees, the agencies paying out the fees, and what types of  claims are being covered.   The Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act reinstates needed  transparency and accountability requirements to ensure that the Equal  Access to Justice Act is helping individuals, retirees, veterans, and  small businesses as intended. It requires the Administrative Conference  of the United States to develop an online searchable database that  includes information on the number, nature, and amount of the awards;  claims involved in the controversy; and other relevant information.  Agencies would be required to provide information requested by ACUS for  the development and maintenance of the database. Importantly, ACUS  would be required to withhold information from the database if  disclosure is prohibited by law or court order.   As made clear in report language in previous years, I continue to  expect ACUS to take appropriate measures to ensure that individual  specific healthcare information, such as an individual's diagnoses and  treatments, is not contained in the database. This legislation ensures  appropriate protections are in place while facilitating critical public  and congressional oversight.   The Open Book on Equal Access to Justice Act places agency  expenditures under EAJA in view of a watchful public eye and restores  scrutiny over taxpayer dollars.   Where the Federal Government is spending money, Congress needs to  exercise oversight and ensure it is being done in accordance with the  law and congressional intent.   Tracking and reporting requirements preserve the integrity of the  Equal Access to Justice Act. They will enable Congress to evaluate the  law to make sure it is working effectively for the people it is  intended to help. We owe it to small businesses, Social Security  claimants, veterans, and similarly situated individuals who rely on the  law, faced with the daunting task of taking on the Federal Government,  to make sure that it is working.   I look forward to continuing bipartisan efforts to move this bill  forward and to the Open Book on Equal Justice Act ultimately becoming  law. The consensus behind this legislation reflects the need to address  this issue and Americans' right to know how their taxpayer dollars are  being spent. It is time we gave them that transparency.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), who is a  cosponsor and our Conference chair. She has been a great supporter of  this.   I would also be remiss, Mr. Speaker, to not say that it was her  predecessor who introduced me to this issue, Mrs. Lummis, who always  seems to be around, and she keeps this agenda in focus as well. I want  to say thank you to her for her previous work.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, this is definitely an area that I looked forward to. It  should have happened last Congress, for my good friend from Tennessee.  It is going to happen, I believe, in this Congress. We have both the  House and the Senate, and I think this is definitely something the  administration will support. I look forward to this becoming law.   This is simply a good bill that opens up transparency and allows us  to make better decisions in Congress. That is what we are supposed to  be about. Again, I thank my friend from Tennessee for being a cosponsor  on this and for being a part of that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
