 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   My fellow Americans, the Democrats are coming for your guns. This  assault weapons ban is unconstitutional because it would ban firearms  that are currently in common use, making the scope of the bill, a  semiautomatic assault weapons ban, overly broad by capturing millions  of sporting rifles, shotguns, and pistols that simply have certain  accessories and cosmetic features. In fact, the bill focuses mostly on  appearance, which would arbitrarily ban some firearm models while  exempting others with the same functionality.   This bill would not reduce violent crime, as Democrats claim. Studies  have shown that the effect of the last assault weapons ban in 1994 on  violent crime was perhaps too small for a reliable measurement.  Instead, what this bill and all other legislation from Democrats aimed  at gun control would do is directly infringe on the rights of law- abiding Americans.   They are not going to stop here. There will always be a scary-looking  gun that they think needs to be banned. There will always be another  loophole that they have created out of thin air that they need to close  with more bans.   Mr. Speaker, this document says ``shall not be infringed.'' I urge a  ``no'' vote.
