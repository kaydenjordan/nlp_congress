 Madam President, I rise today, on International  Women's Day, in support of the Women's Health Protection Act. I would  like to thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership, from my neighboring  State of Wisconsin; Senator Blumenthal for his longtime leadership of  this bill; as well as Senator Murray and so many others, including  yourself, Madam President, for your work on this. I also wanted to  mention Erin Chapman, of our Judiciary team, who is here with me, who  has worked on this as well, and my colleague Tina Smith, who is the  only Senator to have worked at Planned Parenthood in the U.S. Senate.   Last year, the Supreme Court issued a ruling shredding nearly five  decades of precedent protecting a women's right to make her own  healthcare decisions, against the wishes of 70 to 80 percent of  Americans who believe this is a decision that should be made between a  woman, her family, and her doctor.   In this past year, we heard that majority loud and clear in States  where access to reproductive healthcare was directly on the ballot.  From Montana and Michigan to Kentucky and Kansas, voters turned out to  protect a woman's right to choose. It was almost as if those who  authored some of these resolutions--like in Kansas--that tried to limit  a woman's right forgot that women were going to show up and vote; and  in Kansas they did, in record numbers, right in the middle of the  prairie.   This doesn't come down to red States or blue States or purple States.  As you know, this is about freedom. As voters across the country have  made clear, it is unacceptable for women to be left to the mercy of a  patchwork of State laws governing their ability to access reproductive  care, leaving them, as Senator Baldwin just pointed out, with fewer  rights than their moms and grandmas. That is right; my daughter has  fewer rights right now than her mom and her grandma did.   And you think about what has been happening. You think about the  heartbreaking story of that 10-year-old girl in Ohio who had to go to  Indiana after being a victim of rape and had to go to Indiana just to  get her healthcare. I remember when that story came out. People,  including news organizations--some of them said it was a hoax, and then  they had to go back. They had to go back and apologize to that little  girl because it wasn't a hoax. It really happened. And those are the  stories we are, sadly, seeing across the country.   So what can we do in the face of this threat to women's health and  freedom? All three branches of government have a responsibility to  protect people's rights. And if one branch doesn't do its job, then the  other branch is supposed to step in. That is why we are introducing  this bill. Congress must act to codify the principles of Roe v. Wade  into law, and we have the opportunity and the obligation to do that  with the Women's Health Protection Act.   We have updated this bill to make clear Congress's intent to restore  the rights the Supreme Court took away in the Dobbs decision. The bill  also protects a woman's right to travel to another State to receive  reproductive healthcare, something that I know you, Madam President,  have been leading on during this past year.   All of this comes down to one question, and I will end with this:  Who--who--should get to make these personal decisions for women: a  woman herself or politicians?   I think the answer is clear. I do not think that women making these  decisions want to see our Republican colleagues in the waiting room.  That is why I urge every Senator to get behind the majority of  Americans who support a woman's right to choose and support the Women's  Health Protection Act.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, on March 8, 2023, the Joint Committee  on the Library organized, elected a chair, a vice chair, and adopted  committee rules for the 118th Congress. Members of the Joint Committee  on the Library elected Senator Amy Klobuchar as chair and  Representative Bryan Steil as vice chair. Pursuant to rule XXVI,  paragraph 2, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I ask unanimous  consent that a copy of the committee rules be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Joint Committee of Congress on the Library Rules for the 118th Congress                      Title I--Meetings of the Committee         1.

(Paragraph 5(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the       Senate.)        3.

Any witness who is to appear before the committee in any       hearing shall file with the clerk of the committee at least 3       business days before the date of his or her appearance, a       written statement of his or her proposed testimony and an       executive summary thereof, in such form as the Chair may       direct, unless the Chair waived such a requirement for good       cause.
