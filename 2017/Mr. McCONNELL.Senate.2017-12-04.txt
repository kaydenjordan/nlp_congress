 Madam President, today the Senate will continue to  fulfill its important responsibility to confirm critical nominees for  President Trump's administration. We will do that by voting to advance  the nomination of Kirstjen Nielsen, the President's choice to serve as  Secretary of Homeland Security.   As my colleagues know, this is an incredibly important position  within our government. With responsibilities ranging from  cybersecurity, to protecting our borders, to the continued recovery  efforts of the recent natural disasters, the Department of Homeland  Security requires strong leadership to get the job done. Ms. Nielsen is  a qualified candidate with the talent and experience to succeed. As  Chief of Staff to the previous DHS Secretary, Gen. John Kelly, she  understands the daily operations of the Department and shares our goals  for its future.   In addition, her previous tenure with the Department makes her an  ideal candidate to be ready to lead the agency on day one.   Ms. Nielsen is an experienced professional who will help lead the  Department as it faces constantly evolving threats. I look forward to  advancing her nomination later today, and I urge my colleagues to join  me in supporting Ms. Nielsen for this critical national security post.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany S. 371.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 371) entitled       ``An Act to make technical changes and other improvements to       the Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017.'',       do pass with an amendment.     I move to concur in the House amendment, and I ask  unanimous consent that the motion be agreed to and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  December 5; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Nielsen nomination; further, that at 12:30 p.m.,  the Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair; finally,  that all time during recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader  remarks count postcloture on the Nielsen nomination.    For the information of all Senators, the official  Senate photograph will be taken tomorrow immediately following the  conference lunches.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned,  following the remarks of Senator Brown.
