 In a moment, the Senate will resume business. A few of  our Republican colleagues may continue their speeches.   The Senate spent 2 hard weeks working on this bill, and many months  before that. We have every intention of sticking it out until the job  is done, and that is what we are going to do. I look forward to passing  this historic and extremely bipartisan bill later today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at a time to be determined on Tuesday, June  8, the Senate resume consideration of S. 1260; that all postcloture  time be considered expired and the Senate vote in relation to Cornyn  amendment No. 1858; that if a Budget Act point of order is raised and a  motion to waive is made following disposition of the Cornyn amendment,  the Senate vote on the motion to waive; that if waived, the Senate vote  on substitute amendment No. 1502, as amended; that the cloture motion  with respect to S. 1260 be withdrawn; and that the bill be considered  read a third time, the Senate vote on passage of S. 1260, as amended,  if amended, with 60 affirmative votes required for passage, all with no  intervening action or debate; further, that the Senate now vote on the  motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to Calendar No. 60,  H.R. 3233; that following the cloture vote, notwithstanding rule XXII,  the Senate proceed to executive session, and the cloture motions with  respect to Executive Calendar Nos. 111 and 134 be withdrawn, and the  Senate vote on confirmation of the nominations in the order listed;  that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; finally, that following the disposition of Calendar  No. 134, the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use leader  remarks and that Senators Klobuchar and Peters be permitted to speak  for up to 2 minutes each before the vote.    Mr. President, now, let me just tell the public and the  Members what this does. It is something we proposed. It assures that  there is a vote on the January 6 Commission in the next hour. It  assures that the vote occurs in the light of day, not at 3 in the  morning.   It also assures that votes on the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act  will occur and prevail as soon as we return in June.   This is a good solution because we get to vote on the Commission.   And let me just say this to my Republican colleagues and to the  country: This Commission is desperately needed. What has been  perpetrated by President Trump over the last several months is the Big  Lie--the Big Lie that the elections were fixed, that he is rightfully  President.   Nothing is more corrosive to our democracy than a view that elections  are not on the level. Yet that has been propagated by Donald Trump and  many of his allies.   A Commission can get to the bottom of this in a clear way. It is a  bipartisan Commission. It is a down-the-middle Commission. There was  significant Republican input by the Republican leader in the House and  the Republican ranking member of the relevant committee.   So this is right down the middle. If our Republican friends vote  against this, I would ask them: What are you afraid of? The truth? Are  you afraid that Donald Trump's Big Lie will be dispelled? Are you  afraid that all of the misinformation that has poured out will be  rebutted by a bipartisan, down-the-middle Commission?   This is about a democracy. It is about the future of our democracy.  The Big Lie has eroded that democracy, and we must do everything we can  to rebut it. This is not a Democratic or Republican obligation. This is  an American obligation.   Our democracy--our beautiful, more than-two-century-old democracy is  at more risk because of the lies that have been perpetrated by  President Trump and his allies than it has been in a very long time,  and this Commission is a great antidote to that.   So I hope we can get broad support and move forward. I will speak  more after the vote on this issue.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to move to  proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 130.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 127.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar 46, H.R. 7.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (H.R. 7) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of       1938 to provide more effective remedies to victims of       discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex,       and for other purposes.                                Cloture Motion     Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  motions with respect to Executive Calendar Nos. 130 and 127 ripen at  5:30 p.m., Monday, June 7; that the cloture with respect to the motion  to proceed to H.R. 7 ripen upon disposition of S. 1260 and the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, May 28, be  waived.    Madam President, I have a brief statement on the vote on  the January 6 Commission.   My colleagues, this was a case of good news and bad news about the  Republican Party in the Senate.   The good news: Republicans worked with Democrats on comprehensive  legislation to strengthen our commitment to scientific research, which  will pass the Senate when the Senate resumes session.   The bad news: The Republican minority just mounted a partisan  filibuster against an independent Commission to report on January 6.  Both efforts should have moved forward solidly in a bipartisan way, but  out of fear or fealty to Donald Trump, the Republican minority just  prevented the American people from getting the full truth about January  6. The Republican minority just prevented the Senate from even debating  the bill--no opportunity for amendments, no opportunity for debate.   There was an attempt by the Republican minority to shunt this vote  into the dark of night, but because of today's Senate time agreement,  it was done in broad daylight. The American people will see how each  Republican Senator voted.   This should have been simple. The Commission was bipartisan,  independent, straight down the middle. House Democrats accepted every  change that House leadership requested. Speaker Pelosi and I supported  and still do support the changes Senator Collins proposed, and we told  that to other Senators.   Senate Republicans, for months, publicly supported the idea of a  Commission, but now, all of a sudden, the Senate minority and the  Senate minority leader waged a partisan filibuster against the bill.   This vote has made it official: Donald Trump's Big Lie has now fully  enveloped the Republican Party. Trump's Big Lie is now the defining  principle of what was once the party of Lincoln.   House Republicans canned Congresswoman Cheney for the crime of  telling the truth that Joe Biden is President. Republican State  legislatures seizing on the Big Lie are conducting the greatest assault  on voting rights since the beginning of Jim Crow. Republicans in both  Chambers are trying to rewrite history and claim that January 6 was  just a peaceful protest that got a little out of hand. And now this--a  partisan blockade of a simple, independent, bipartisan Commission.   I have heard all the excuses why Republicans are opposing this bill:  It is too early. It goes on too long. It is not needed. Almost all of  these excuses are meritless and were invented in the past 2 weeks.   We all know what is going on here. Senate Republicans chose to defend  the Big Lie because they believe anything that might upset Donald Trump  could hurt them politically.   We all lived through the horrors of January 6. I was no farther than  30 feet from those White Supremacist hooligans. Do my Republican  colleagues remember that day? Do my Republican colleagues remember the  savage mob calling for the execution of Mike Pence, the makeshift  gallows outside the Capitol, men with bulletproof vests and zip ties  breaking into the Senate Gallery and rifling through your desks, and  police officers crushed between doorways? Shame on the Republican Party  for trying to sweep the horrors of that day under the rug because they  are afraid of Donald Trump.   Our democracy has long endured because leaders of good faith, even if  they disagreed, even at political costs, shared a fidelity to the  truth. That is not so today.   I hope this is not the beginning of an effort by Senate Republicans  to prevent this Chamber from debating reasonable, commonsense  legislation. We will soon see.   After the State work period, I will bring forward legislation that  would help provide equal pay for women. Will our Republican colleagues  let the Senate debate the bill, or will they engage in another partisan  filibuster of urgent legislation? We will soon see.
