 Madam Speaker, the border is not secure. Our officers are  doing everything they can, but they need more resources. They need  better leadership.   The President must take the border crisis seriously because 100,000  Americans died from fentanyl poisoning last year, and we know that  fentanyl is coming from China through the U.S.-Mexico border.   Republicans in the House understand this. We stand ready to increase  physical barriers, to hire more Border Patrol agents and immigration  judges, to implement new technologies, and to support our officers on  the front lines of this crisis.  [[Page H993]]    As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I am committed to  working with all of my colleagues to make sure that our country is  safe, our border is secure, and our law enforcement has the tools it  needs to be successful. Our great Nation depends on it.                            ____________________
