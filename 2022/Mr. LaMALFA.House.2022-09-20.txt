 Madam Speaker, September is National Rice Month, and  even though the month is two-thirds over with, it is never not time to  have rice for your next meal.   I want to pay a special tribute to the hardworking farmers, millers,  merchants, suppliers, and the consumers who make rice not only such a  nutritious product, but an important part of our economy.   My home State of California is the second largest rice-producing  State with the Sacramento Valley home to 95 percent of California's  production. It is an important part also of the Pacific Flyway.  California primarily produces medium grain sticky rice, otherwise known  as sushi rice.   America's rice industry contributes 125,000 good-paying jobs and an  estimated $34 billion to our Nation's economy. Rice farmers take  excellent care of their land, prioritizing resource conservation,  nutrition, top yields worldwide, and product quality.   U.S. rice farmers produce more rice using less land, energy, and  water than they did just 20 years ago, providing critical habitat for  many species, which is really important, once again, to the Pacific  Flyway as the ducks and geese move all the way from the north down to  the south.   Unfortunately, drastic water cuts have taken half of the rice acreage  out of California this year. We need to keep the industry going strong  for all those good needs.                            ____________________
