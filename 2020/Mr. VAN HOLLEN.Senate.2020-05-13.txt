 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the  confirmation of Troy Edgar to be Chief Financial Officer of the  Department of Homeland Security.   The nominee would have authority over the transfer and reprogramming  of funds within the Department of Homeland Security. While he has  pledged to notify Congress in advance of any such action, this  administration has made it clear that it will continue to use every  available tool to fund the wall that President Trump said Mexico would  pay for and his administration's abusive immigrant detention policies.  For that reason, any nominee to this position merits heightened  scrutiny.   I am alarmed by rampant overcrowding and squalid conditions in DHS  detention facilities. Despite DHS IG reports and numerous congressional  inquiries and hearings, the Department has consistently mismanaged  these facilities and shown a disregard for the care of those in its  custody. To date, 674 detainees and 39 detention facility personnel  have tested positive for COVID-19. Notwithstanding its failure to  ensure the safety of its facility personnel and detainees, the  Department has continued to use its transfer and reprogramming  authority to increase the number of detention beds. Last August, DHS  transferred or reprogrammed $271 million, including $155 million from  the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, to expand ICE operations at the southern  border.   A promise to notify Congress does nothing to stop these activities. I  am confident that anything short of a statutory limitation on transfer  and reprogramming authority will be ignored and that any official who  stands in the way of these efforts will be circumvented or fired. The  Senate should not confirm a nominee with the power to approve such  actions until reasonable limits are enacted into law. For that reason,  I voted against this nominee.                            ____________________
