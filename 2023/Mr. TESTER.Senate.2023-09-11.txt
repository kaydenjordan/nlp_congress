 Madam President, with a historic number of veterans  receiving care and benefits under the PACT Act, the Department of  Veterans Affairs needs a qualified second-in-command.   Now more than ever, the VA needs a steady hand to uphold its mission  to deliver veterans the healthcare and benefits that they have earned.   I rise today because Tanya Bradsher is that leader. She has an  impressive record of serving our country in and out of uniform,  especially in her current role--which is VA Chief of Staff--where she  has been critical in overseeing the Department's implementation of the  PACT Act.   Between her time serving in the U.S. Army--including a deployment to  Iraq--and working in Congress and working at the White House and the  Defense Health Agency and at the Department of Homeland Security, it is  clear that she is qualified for the job and ready to hit the ground  running to serve our Nation's veterans.   It is no secret that the VA has a lot of work on its plate. From  rolling out the Electronic Health Record Modernization program to  working with the Defense Department to improve transition process for  servicemembers who are leaving the military, these are challenges VA's  No. 2 official is directly tasked with, all while running the day-to- day operations of the VA.   That is why this body needs to come together in a bipartisan way to  make Tanya Bradsher the permanent leader--the leader who will tackle  these challenges and ensure that the VA is upholding its mission to the  veterans and their families.   The fact is, having a permanent leader in this role ensures that we  can hold the VA accountable to do their job. And our veterans deserve  no less.   In the past, this body has been able to rise above politics to  install qualified individuals at the VA responsible for getting vets  the healthcare and the benefits they need and that they have earned.  Today, we must do that again to confirm Tanya Bradsher as VA's next  Deputy Secretary and making her the first woman ever confirmed for this  position.   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this vote  occur immediately.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great  Montanan, and a national champion for our access to public lands.   For his entire life, Land Tawney has fought to ensure that every  Montanan and every American is able to experience the joys that our  rivers, streams, and public lands have to offer. For the last 10 years  he has led this charge from the helm of Backcountry Hunters and  Anglers, an organization that was once volunteer based and local, but  is now a leading advocacy group for hunters and anglers in 48 States  and two Canadian provinces. But unfortunately for us, Land recently  announced that he will be leaving Backcountry Hunters and Anglers for  greener pastures and wider trails.   While I am sure that we haven't heard the last of Land Tawney he will  certainly be missed by many Montanans and sportsmen and women across  the Nation. In his tenure as president and CEO, Land was able to grow  BHA to a community with more than half a million members. He played a  key role in helping pass my Great American Outdoors Act and permanently  reauthorizing and fully funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   I am proud to call Land a friend, but more importantly, I am proud of  the things we have accomplished in Congress with the support of Land  and the BHA. He is a fierce advocate for preserving access. He is a  builder of broad coalitions. And he is someone that you always want on  your team.   I am going to miss Land at BHA, but I am looking forward to seeing  what is next.   Thank you, Land.                            ____________________
