 Mr. Speaker, I am a New York Representative whose district  is about 10 miles from the World Trade Center, and I lost many friends  and constituents in that horrendous attack.   Many years ago, President Roosevelt stood right here in this Chamber  and talked about a day of infamy regarding the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Certainly, also the day of these attacks was a day of infamy, September  11, 2001.   I remember days and weeks after the attacks you would just walk in my  district and see burned papers sort of dropping from the clouds. It is  really something that we will remember forever. We remember the brave  responders. We remember the people that gave their lives so that others  can live. It also told us that we in the United States have to continue  to fight tyranny, have to continue to remember those poor 3,000 souls  whose lives ended. It could have been any one of us. They lost their  lives.   So I think that this is a time for all Americans to pause and say we  cherish our values. We remember the people who lost their lives, and we  will always fight against oppression wherever it rears its ugly head.  God bless America.                            ____________________
