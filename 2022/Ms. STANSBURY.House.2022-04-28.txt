 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank our brave  firefighters and first responders who are on the front lines, saving  lives as wildfires burn across the beautiful State of New Mexico.   This week began with 20 wildfires burning across 16 counties of our  State, causing thousands of New Mexicans to evacuate their homes. We  mourn the lives that have been lost and stand in solidarity with the  many families who have been forced to leave, in many cases, lands on  which they have lived on for generations.   As we lift up our firefighters and first responders, I thank our  Governor, Governor Lujan Grisham, for her leadership in the face of  these devastating fires. Her quick response has saved lives, and I want  to echo her call for additional support to coordinate emergency  response across the State.   These wildfires show us why our votes in this body are so important,  as we are sending more than $5.5 billion to prevent and fight wildfires  through the bipartisan infrastructure law and other bills we have  passed.   As wildfires continue to burn across our State, we stand ready to  support our Governor, local officials, firefighters, and everyone  helping out. Together, as New Mexicans, we stand shoulder to shoulder  in solidarity and in support of our communities.  [[Page H4603]]                                ____________________
