 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brian O'Hara in  appreciation for his outstanding public service to the people of  Oklahoma's First Congressional District and wish him well as he enters  retirement.   Brian has spent nearly 10 years serving constituents in our district  office as a congressional staffer, first with my predecessor, Jim  Bridenstine, and then in our office. He has a lifetime of knowledge and  experience that our office will dearly miss as he leaves his post.   Prior to his congressional staff career, Brian served as a councilman  for the city of Jenks. He had a robust business career, as well.   In his private life, Brian contributes much of his time, money, and  efforts to benefit several good causes. However, no cause has meant  more to Brian than fighting against cancer, and I don't know anyone who  has been a better ambassador for this profound effort.   Brian, thank you for serving our constituents in the great State of  Oklahoma like every day is Christmas. Merry Christmas to you and your  wife, Karen, and happy retirement.                            ____________________
