 Mr. Speaker, the USS Fitzgerald  collided with a cargo vessel in the Sea of Japan on Saturday, resulting  in the loss of life of seven patriotic sailors. Each of the deceased  sailors was dedicated in the service to their Nation and exemplified  the U.S. Navy's motto, ``Not for self but for country.''  [[Page H5003]]    As the grateful father of an orthopedic surgeon currently serving in  the United States Navy, the sailors and their families are in my  thoughts and prayers.   May we never forget these sailors: Shingo Douglass, 25, of  California; Noe Hernandez, 26, of Texas; Ngoc Huynh, 25, of  Connecticut; Xavier Martin, 24, of Maryland; Gary Rehm, Jr., 37, of  Ohio; Dakota Rigsby, 19, of Virginia; Carlos Sibayan, 23, of  California.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family of former State Representative Skipper  Perry of Aiken, South Carolina, Aiken Chamber of Commerce ``Man of the  Year.''                            ____________________
