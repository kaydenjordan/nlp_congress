 Madam President, will the gentleman yield?    Thank you for rising because I do believe what you are  saying about Senator Whitehouse is accurate. In my opinion, like Lou  Gehrig, like Cal Ripken, he will go down in history in this longevity  streak in highlighting, spotlighting like a true North Star the need  for us to take action on these issues, and he is, without question, a  climate change hall of famer.   And I agree with you, there is a new dawn which has now arrived, with  our fingers crossed. And I share your hope, the Senator from Rhode  Island, that we might be able to find a way to persuade the gentleman  from Oklahoma that it is sunny most of the time in Oklahoma and it is  windy most of the time in Oklahoma and there are tens of thousands of  jobs yet to be created. And we can work in partnership in order to  accomplish that goal.   But for today, I just wanted to come over and honor the great Sheldon  Whitehouse for his incredible leadership during this time we have been  going through with the climate ``denier in chief'' now gone, and there  is hope alive. Your leadership is absolutely hall of fame and historic.  Congratulations, Senator Whitehouse.
