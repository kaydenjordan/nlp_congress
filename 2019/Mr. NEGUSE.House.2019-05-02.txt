 Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment. It is at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am offering an amendment today to provide  a pathway for the curriculum in our elementary and secondary schools to  include information on the impacts of  [[Page H3416]]  climate change. Eighty percent of parents and 86 percent of teachers  believe that schools should teach about climate change and its impacts  on our environment, our economy, and our society.   As our future generations grow up in a world that is impacted by  extreme weather events and a changing climate, it is essential that we  educate them on the causes and impacts of the crisis, as well as equip  them for finding solutions to combat it.   Climate change truly is an existential threat, in my view, that we  must begin tackling head-on. Science is perfectly clear that we have a  very short runway to avoid catastrophic consequences for our planet,  and this moment requires bold action now. The solutions we find and the  bold policies that our country requires to combat this current crisis  must begin with education.   While it is our duty to get the ball rolling on policies and programs  that will begin to mitigate climate change-related issues, make no  mistake: It is our children who will feel the brunt of the effects that  our scientific community has outlined time and time again.   When my daughter, Natalie, who is now 8 months old, is attending  middle school, climate change and its impacts on our planet will be her  reality. She should be equipped with every resource we are able to  offer her at that time, and that begins with education.   This amendment underscores the importance of State and local efforts  to teach our youth the causes and effects of climate change. Again, the  science is clear, and it is of the utmost importance that the next  generation is presented with the facts of this crisis.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel), the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I again thank the chairman for his  distinguished leadership in chairing the Foreign Affairs full committee  and for his leadership in shepherding this important resolution to the  floor.   Mr. Chairman, I would hope that my colleagues across the aisle could  come to consensus on this amendment. I think it is a commonsense,  reasonable amendment that ensures that our children, the next  generation, are, as I said, well-informed about the causes and the  effects of climate change so that they can work with all of us to try  to stop it and to try to deal with the planetary crisis that we find  ourselves in.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1000
