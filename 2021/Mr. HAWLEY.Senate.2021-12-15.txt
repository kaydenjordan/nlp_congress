 I object.   Madam President, it is now December. It has been nearly 4 months  since the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.   Thirteen servicemembers lost their lives in the attack on Abbey Gate  along with hundreds of civilians. As a result of the botched evacuation  operation, hundreds, if not thousands, of American civilians were left  behind to the enemy.   We hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle that my  insistence that we actually vote on nominees is unprecedented. I would  humbly suggest that the crisis into which this President has led this  country is unprecedented. In my lifetime, it is unprecedented.   And who has been held accountable for this disaster? No one. Who has  the President fired? Who has offered their resignation? Which of the  planners at the Department of State or the Department of Defense or the  National Security Council have been relieved of duty? No one.   Until there is accountability, I am going to ask that the Senate do  the simple task of its job, which is to actually vote on these  nominees. The least we could do is observe regular order and vote on  these leadership positions at the Department of State and at the  Department of Defense.   My colleagues say that we have got to put national security first. I  agree with them about that. But I believe that begins at the top, with  the President of the United States and the leadership of the Department  of Defense and the Department of State. I, for one, am not going to  stand by and look the other way while this administration  systematically endangers our national security, imperils the American  people, and watches the sacrifice of our soldiers go by without any  accountability, without any change in direction.   I am not willing to look the other way and just pretend that  Afghanistan didn't happen, which seems to be the posture that many in  this body have adopted. I am not willing to do that. I can't do that  because I promised the parents of the fallen that I wouldn't do that.   I am going to discharge my responsibility. And as long as it takes, I  will continue to draw attention to what happened at Abbey Gate and to  demand accountability for the disaster that this administration has  pushed upon this country and upon the people of my State.    Mr. President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 606, Dawn  N. Ison, of Michigan, to be United States Attorney for the Eastern  District of Michigan for the term of four years.                            ____________________
