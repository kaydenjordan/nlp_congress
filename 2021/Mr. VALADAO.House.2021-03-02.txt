 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, the For the  People Act. This piece of legislation undermines State authority over  voter registration and election procedures while federally mandating  practices we have seen fail in California during the 2018 and 2020  election cycles.   California's motor voter law automatically registers people to vote  when registering their car or applying for a license with the DMV. This  program was found to create over 120,000 errors, including registering  at least 1,500 residents who were not eligible to vote.   Senator Padilla, while serving as California's secretary of state at  that time, stated these mistakes ``threatened to undermine public  confidence in the program.''   H.R. 1 exposes our elections to voter fraud and is especially  dangerous at a time when so many Americans are questioning the validity  of election results. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on  H.R. 1.
