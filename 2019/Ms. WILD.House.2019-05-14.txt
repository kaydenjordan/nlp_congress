 Mr. Speaker, 54 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson  launched Head Start as part of the War on Poverty, a historic effort to  build a more just, equal America.   Today, Head Start serves children across my community, including more  than 70 children in SafeStart, a program in my district designed for  children of parents who struggle with substance abuse that has been  recognized as a national model.   Across our country, over 30 million children have participated in  Head Start since its founding. We have felt the benefits throughout our  society. Study after study has shown how pivotal early childhood  education is for positioning children to fulfill their potential later  on.   Despite its record of success, Head Start is severely underfunded  today. In my home State of Pennsylvania, only 27 percent of eligible  children are able to get a slot in a Head Start program. I hope my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in pledging to fight  to get increased funding for Head Start signed into law so that we  renew our commitment to its promise of a future where every child in  every ZIP Code can live a life of opportunity.                            ____________________
