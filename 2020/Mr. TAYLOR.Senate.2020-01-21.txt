 In a regular NSC secure video conference call       on July 18, I heard a staff person from the Office of       Management and Budget say that there was a hold on security       assistance to Ukraine but could not say why. Toward the end       of an otherwise normal meeting, a voice on the call--the       person was off-screen--said that she was from OMB and her       boss had instructed her not to approve any additional       spending on security assistance for Ukraine until further       notice.        I and others sat in astonishment. The Ukrainians were       fighting the Russians and counted on not only the training       and weapons but also the assurance of U.S. support. All that       the OMB staff person said was that the directive had come       from the President, to the Chief of Staff, to OMB. In an       instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong       support for Ukraine was threatened.    Mr. Manager CROW. It is hard to believe OMB would not have any  documents following this bombshell announcement. It surely does. It was  the agency that delivered the shocking news to the rest of the U.S.  Government that the President was withholding the vital military aid  from our partner, and we would see these documents if the Senate issued  a subpoena.   The July 18 meeting was just the first in a series of meetings where  OMB held the line and enforced the President's hold on the aid. But  there was a second meeting on July 23, where we understood agencies  raised concerns about the legality of OMB's hold on the aid and then a  third meeting, at a more senior level, on July 26. Witnesses testified  that at that meeting, OMB struggled to offer an explanation for the  President's hold on the aid. Then there was a fourth meeting on July  31, where the legal concerns about the hold were raised. At each of  these meetings, there was confusion about the scope and the reasons for  the hold. Nobody seemed to know what was going on. But that was exactly  the point.   All of the agencies--except OMB, which was simply conveying the  President's order--supported the military aid and argued for lifting  the hold. OMB did not produce a single document providing information  about his participation, preparation, or followup from any of these  meetings.   Did these OMB officials come prepared with talking points for these  meetings? Did OMB officials take notes during any of these meetings?  Did they exchange emails about what was going on? Did OMB discuss what  reasons they could give everyone else for the hold? By issuing this  subpoena, the Senate can find out the answers to all of those questions  and others like them. The American people deserve answers.   OMB documents would also reveal key facts about what happened on July  25. On July 25, President Trump conducted his phone call with President  Zelensky, during which he demanded ``a favor.'' This favor was for  Ukraine to conduct an investigation to benefit the President's  reelection campaign. That call was at 9 a.m. Just 90 minutes after  President Trump hung up the phone, Duffey, the political appointee at  OMB who is in charge of national security programs, emailed DOD to  ``formalize'' the hold on the military aid, just 90 minutes after  President Trump's call--a call in which the President had asked for ``a  favor.''   That email is on the screen in front of you. We have a redacted copy  of this email because it was recently released through the Freedom of  Information Act. It was not released by the Trump administration in  response to the House's subpoena.   In this email, Duffey told DOD officials that, based on the guidance  it received, they should ``hold off on any additional DOD obligations  of these funds.'' He added that the request was ``sensitive'' and that  they should keep this information ``closely held,'' meaning, don't tell  anybody about it.   Why did Duffey consider the information sensitive? Why didn't he want  anyone to learn about it? Answers to those questions may be found in  OMB emails--emails that we could all see if you issue a subpoena.   But there is more. Remember, the administration needed to create a  way to stop funding that was already underway. The train had already  left the station and something like this had never been done before.  Later in the evening of July 25, OMB found a way, even though DOD had  already notified Congress that the funds would be released.   Here is how this scheme worked. OMB sent DOD a funding document that  included a carefully worded footnote directing DOD to hold off on  spending the funds ``to allow for an interagency process to determine  the best use.'' Remember that language, ``to allow for an interagency  process to determine the best use.''   Let me explain that. The footnote stated that this ``brief pause''  would not prevent DOD from spending the money by the end of the fiscal  year, which was coming up on September 30. OMB had to do this because  it knew that not spending the money was illegal, and they knew that DOD  would be worried about that. And they were right; DOD was worried about  it. Mr. Sandy testified that in his 12 years of experience at OMB, he  could not recall anything like this ever happening before. The drafting  of this unusual funding document and the issuance of the document must  have generated a significant amount of email traffic, memos, and other  documentation at OMB--memos, email traffic, and documentation that we  would all see if the Senate issued a subpoena.   What was the result from this series of events on July 25? Where was  Mr. Duffey's guidance to implement the hold coming from? Why was the  request ``sensitive''? What was the connection between OMB's direction  to DOD and the call President Trump had with President Zelensky just 90  minutes before? Did agency officials communicate about the questions  coming from Ukrainian officials?   The American people deserve answers. A subpoena would provide those  answers.   OMB documents also would reveal information about the decision to  have a political appointee take over Ukraine funding responsibility.  The tensions  [[Page S404]]  and chaos surrounding the freeze escalated at the end of July, when  Duffey, a political appointee at OMB with no relevant experience in  funding approvals, took authority for releasing military aid to Ukraine  away from Sandy, a career OMB official. Sandy could think of no other  explanation of a political appointee's taking on this responsibility.  Sandy was given no reason other than Mr. Duffey wanted to be ``more  involved in daily operations.''    During his deposition, Sandy confirmed that he was removed from the  funding approval process after he had raised concerns to Duffey about  whether the hold was legal under the Impoundment Control Act. Needless  to say, OMB has refused to turn over any documents or communications  involving that decision to replace Mr. Sandy.   Why did Duffey--a political appointee with no relevant experience in  this area--take over responsibility for Ukraine's funding approval? Was  the White House involved in that decision? Was Sandy removed because he  had expressed concerns about the legality of the hold?   By August 7, people in our government were worried, and when people  in the government get worried, sometimes what they do is they draft  memos, because when they are concerned about getting caught up in  something that doesn't seem right, they don't want to be a part of it.   So, on that day, Mark Sandy and other colleagues at the OMB drafted  and sent a memo about Ukraine military aid to Acting Director Vought.  According to Sandy, the memo advocated for the release of the funds. It  said that the military aid was consistent with American national  security interests, that it would help to oppose Russian aggression,  and that it was backed by strong bipartisan support. But President  Trump did not lift the hold.   Over the next several weeks, the OMB continued to issue funding  documents that kept kicking the can down the road, supposedly to allow  for more of this ``interagency process'' while inserting those  footnotes throughout the apportionment documents, stating that the  delay wouldn't affect the funding. But here is the really shocking  part: There was no interagency process. They made it up. It had ended  months before. They made it up because nobody could say the real reason  for the hold. In total, the OMB issued nine of these documents between  July 25 and September 10.   Did the White House respond to the OMB's concerns and recommendation  to release the aid? Did the White House instruct the OMB to continue  creating a paper trail in an effort to justify the hold? Who knew what  and when the OMB documents would shed light on the OMB's actions as the  President's scheme unraveled? Did the White House direct the OMB to  continue issuing the hold? What was OMB told about the President's  reasons for releasing the hold? What communications did the OMB  officials have with the White House around the time of the release? As  the President's scheme unraveled, did anyone at the OMB connect the  dots for the real reason for the hold? The OMB documents would shed  light on all of these questions, and the American people deserve  answers.   I remember what it feels like to not have the equipment you need when  you need it. Real people's lives are at stake. That is why this  matters. We need this information so we can ensure that this never  happens again. Eventually, this will all come out. We will have answers  to these questions. The question now is whether we will have them in  time and who here will be on the right side of history.   I reserve the balance of our time for an opportunity to respond to  the President's argument.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the  Senate.   Manager Crow, you should be happy to know that the aid that was  provided to Ukraine over the course of the present administration  included lethal weapons. Those were not provided by the previous  administration. The suggestion that Ukraine failed to get any equipment  is false. The security assistance was not for funding Ukraine over the  summer of 2019. There was no lack of equipment due to the temporary  pause. It was for future funding.   Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Defense, who oversaw the U.S. aid  shipment, said: ``The hold went and came so quickly they did not notice  any change.''   Under Secretary of State David Hale explained: ``The pause to aid was  for future assistance, not to keep the army going now.''   So the made-up narrative that security assistance was conditioned on  Ukraine's taking some action on investigations is further disproved by  the straightforward fact that the aid was delivered on September 11,  2019, without Ukraine's taking any action on any investigation.   It is interesting to note that the Obama administration withheld $585  million of promised aid to Egypt in 2013, but the administration's  public message was that the money was not officially on hold as,  technically, it was not due until September 30--the end of the fiscal  year--so that then they didn't have to disclose the halt to anyone.   It sounds like this may be a practice of a number of administrations.  In fact, this President has been concerned about how aid is being put  forward, so there have been pauses on foreign aid in a variety of  contexts.   In September of 2019, the administration announced that it was  withholding over $100 million in aid to Afghanistan over concerns about  government corruption. In August of 2019, President Trump announced  that the administration and Seoul were in talks to substantially  increase South Korea's share of the expense of U.S. military support  for South Korea. In June, President Trump cut or paused over $550  million in foreign aid to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala because  those countries were not fairly sharing the burden of preventing mass  migration to the United States.   It is not the only administration. As I said, President Obama  withheld hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to Egypt.   To be clear--and I want to be clear--Ambassador Yovanovitch herself  testified that our policy actually got stronger under President Trump,  largely because, unlike the Obama administration, ``this administration  made the decision to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine to help Ukraine  fend off Russian aggression.'' She testified in a deposition before  your various committees that it actually had felt, ``in the 3 years  that I was there, partly because of my efforts but also the interagency  team and President Trump's decision to provide lethal weapons to  Ukraine, that our policy actually got stronger.''   Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent, whose name has come up a couple of  times, agrees that Javelins are incredibly effective weapons at  stopping advance and that the Russians are scared of them.   Ambassador Volker explained that President Trump approved each of the  decisions made along the way, and as a result, America's policy toward  Ukraine strengthened.   So when we want to talk about facts, go to your own discovery and  your own witnesses that you called.   This all supposedly started because of a whistleblower. Where is that  whistleblower?   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House managers have 35 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, in war, time matters; minutes  and hours can seem like years. So the idea that, well, it made it there  eventually just doesn't work. And, yes, the aid was provided. It was  provided by Congress--this Senate and the House of Representatives-- with the President's signature. The Congress is the one that sends the  aid, and millions of dollars of this aid would have been lost because  of the delay had Congress not actually passed another law that extended  that deadline to allow the funds to be spent. Let me repeat that. The  delay had jeopardized the expenditure of the money to such an extent  that Congress had to pass another law to extend the deadline so that  the money and the equipment got to the people on the frontlines.   Need I also reiterate, as to the supposed interagency process--the  concerns that the President and his counsel continue to raise about  corruption and making sure that the process went right--there was no  interagency process. The whole thing was made up. It  [[Page S405]]  was a phantom. There was a delay, and delays matter.   Mr. Chief Justice, I reserve the balance of my time for Mr. Schiff.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Schiff.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   There are just a few additional points I would like to make on this  amendment and on my colleagues' arguments.   First of all, Mr. Sekulow makes the point that the aid ultimately got  released. They ultimately got the money, right? Yes, they got the money  after the President got caught, after the President was forced to  relieve the hold on the aid. After he got caught, yes, but even then,  they had held on to the aid so long that it took a subsequent act of  Congress to make sure it could all go out the door.   So, what, is the President supposed to get credit for that--that we  had to intervene because he withheld the aid for so long and that this  is the only reason Ukraine got all of the aid we had approved in the  first place?   My colleagues have glossed over the fact that what they did was  illegal, that the GAO--independent watchdog agency--found that that  hold was illegal. So it not only violated the law, it not only took an  act of Congress to make sure they ultimately got the aid, but this is  supposed to be the defense as to why you shouldn't see the documents?  Is that what we are to believe?   Now, counsel also says, well, he is not the first President to  withhold aid. And that is true. After all, counsel says: Well,  President Obama withheld aid to Egypt. Yes. It was at the urging of the  Members of Congress. Senators McCain and Graham urged that that aid be  withheld. And why? Because there was a revolution in Egypt after it was  appropriated. It was not something that was hidden from Congress. That  was a pretty darned good reason to think, do we still want to give aid  to this government after this revolution?   We are not saying that aid has never been withheld--that is absurd-- but I would hope and expect this is the first time aid has been  withheld by a President of the United States to coerce an ally at war  to help him cheat in the next election. I think that is a first, but  what we do here may determine whether it is the last.   There is one other thing about this pause in aid, right? It is the  argument: Well, no harm, no foul. OK. You got caught. They got the aid.  What is the big deal?   Well, as we heard during the trial, it is not just the aid. Aid is  obviously the most important thing, as Mr. Crow mentioned--you know,  without it, you can't defend yourself--and we will have testimony as to  just what kind of military aid the President was withholding. But we  also had testimony that it was the fact of the aid itself that was so  important to Ukraine, the fact that the United States had Ukraine's  back. And why? Because this new President of Ukraine--this new,  untested, former comedian President of Ukraine who was at war with  Russia was going to be going into a negotiation with Vladimir Putin  with an eye to ending that conflict, and whether he went into that  negotiation from a position of strength or a position of weakness would  depend on whether we had his back.   And so when the Ukrainians learned and the Russians learned that the  President of the United States did not have his back, was withholding  this aid, what message do you think that sent to Vladimir Putin? What  message do you think it sent to Vladimir Putin when Donald Trump  wouldn't let Volodymyr Zelensky, our ally, in the door at the White  House but would let the Russian Foreign Minister? What message does  that send?   So it is not just the aid, and it is not just when the aid is  delivered, it is not just if all of the aid is delivered, it is also  what message does the freeze send to our friend and, even more  importantly, to our foe, and the message it sent was a disaster--was a  disaster.   Now, you might ask yourself because counselors said: Hey, President  Trump has given lethal weapons to Ukraine--you might ask yourself, if  the President was so concerned about corruption, why didn't he do that  in 2017, and why didn't he do that in 2018? Why was it only 2019 that  there was a problem? Was there no corruption in Ukraine in 2017? Was  there no corruption in Ukraine in 2018?   No. Ukraine has always battled corruption. It wasn't the presence or  lack of corruption in one year to another; it was the presence of Joe  Biden as a potential candidate for President. That was the key change  in 2019. That made all the difference.   Let's get back to one of the key moments in this saga. A lot of you  are attorneys--you are probably much better attorneys than I am--and I  am sure you had the experience in cases you tried where there was some  vignette, some conversation, some document. It may not have been the  most important on its face, but it told you something about the case  that was much larger than that conversation.   For me, one of those conversations was not on July 25 between  President Trump and President Zelensky but on July 26, the very next  day.   Now, you may have watched some of the House proceedings or you may  not have, and people watching may have seen it and maybe they didn't,  but there is this scene in a Ukrainian restaurant--a restaurant in  Kyiv--with Gordon Sondland. Now, bear in mind it was Gordon Sondland  who said there was absolutely quid pro quo and two plus two equals  four. This is not some Never Trumper. This is a million-dollar donor to  the Trump inauguration. OK? If there is a bias there, it is clearly in  a million-dollar bias in favor of this President, not against him.   So there is the scene in Kyiv, in this restaurant. Sondland has a  cell phone, and he is sitting with David Holmes, who is a career  diplomat--U.S. diplomat--in the Ukraine Embassy. Gordon Sondland takes  out his phone, and he calls the White House. Gordon Sondland calling  for the White House. Gordon Sondland holding for the President. And it  takes a while to be connected, but he is connected to the President.  That is pretty impressive, right? This isn't some guy with no  relationship to the President. The President may say: Gordon Sondland,  I barely know him, or something to that effect, but this is a guy who  picked up his cell phone, and he can call the President of the United  States from a restaurant in Kyiv, and he does.   And the President's voice is so loud that David Holmes, this  diplomat, can hear it. And what does the President say? Does he say:  How is that reform coming? How is the attack on corruption going?   No. He just says: Is he going to do the investigation? Is Zelensky  going to do the investigation? And Sondland says: Yes. He will do  anything you want. He loves your ass.   This is the extent of the President's interest in Ukraine. They go on  to talk about other things, and then they hang up. And David Holmes  turns to the Ambassador and says--in language which I will have to  modify to remove an expletive--says something along the lines of: Does  the President give a ``blank'' about Ukraine? And Sondland says: No. He  doesn't give a ``blank'' about Ukraine. He only cares about the big  stuff, like the investigation of the Bidens that Giuliani wants.   This is a million-dollar donor to the Trump inaugural admitting the  President doesn't care about Ukraine. He doesn't care whether they get  military dollars to defend themselves. He doesn't care about what  position Zelensky goes into in these negotiations with Putin. He  doesn't care about that.   Isn't that clear? It is why he didn't care about corruption in 2017  or 2018, and he certainly didn't care about it in 2019. All he cared  about was the big stuff that affected him personally, like this  investigation that he wanted of the Bidens.   So we do ask: Do you want to see these documents? Do you want to know  if these documents corroborate Ambassador Sondland? Will the documents  show, as we fully expect they will, that the only thing he cared about  was the big stuff that affected him?   David Holmes' response was: Well, you know, there is some big stuff  going on here, like the war with Russia. This isn't withholding aid  because of a revolution in Egypt. This is withholding aid from a  country in which 15,000 people have died fighting the Russians, and as  Ambassador Taylor said and others: You know, Russia is fighting to  remake the map of Europe by dint of military force.   If we think that is just about Ukraine's security, we are very  deceived. It is about our security. It is  [[Page S406]]  about the tens of thousands of troops we have in Europe. And if we  undercut our own ally, if we give Russia reason to believe we will not  have their back, that we will use Ukraine as a play thing or worse to  get them to help us cheat in an election, that will only embolden Putin  to do more.   You said it as often as I have--the only thing he respects is  strength. You think that looks like strength to Vladimir Putin? I think  that looks like something that Vladimir Putin is only too accustomed  to, and that is the kind of corruption that he finds and perpetuates in  his own regime and pushes all around the world.   My colleague Val Demings made reference to a conversation which I  think is one of the other key vignettes in this whole sad saga, and  that is a conversation that Ambassador Volker had with Andriy Yermak,  one of the top aides to President Zelensky.   This is a conversation in which Ambassador Volker is doing exactly  what he is supposed to be doing, which is he is telling Yermak: You  know, you guys shouldn't really do this investigation of your former  President Poroshenko because it would be for a political reason. You  really shouldn't engage in political investigations. And as  Representative Demings said: What is the response of the Ukrainians?  Oh, you mean like the one you want us to do of the Bidens and the  Clintons. Threw it right back in his face. Ukraine is not oblivious to  that hypocrisy.   Mr. Sekulow says: What are we here for? You know, part of our  strength is not only our support for our allies, it is not only our  military might, it is what we stand for.   We used to stand for the rule of law. We used to champion the rule of  law around the world. Part of the rule of law is, of course, that no  one is above the law.   But to be out in Ukraine or anywhere else in the world championing  the rule of law and saying don't engage in political prosecutions and  having them throw it right back in our face: Oh, you mean like the one  you want us to do--that is why we are here. That is why we are here.  That is why we are here.   I yield back.
