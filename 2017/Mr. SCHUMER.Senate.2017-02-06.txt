 Madam President, I rise this morning to speak directly  to my friends on the other side of the aisle.   Now is the time to put country before party. I understand the pull of  party loyalty. I understand deference to a new President. But from what  we have seen in the first 2 weeks of this administration, party loyalty  is demanding too much of my Republican colleagues on several issues. On  the matter of the Cabinet, on the matter of the President's Executive  order on immigration, and on the matter of dealing with Russia, we need  Republicans to set aside partisan considerations in favor of doing what  is best for the country; otherwise, our institutions of government, our  Constitution, and our core American ideals may be eroded.   My friends on the other side of the aisle are going along with the  President and treating many of these things as if they are normal, but  America knows they are not. We need Republicans to start recognizing  it, saying it, and stepping up to the plate to do something about it.   I understand my Republican colleagues will go along with the  President 90 percent of the time, but there are certain issues that are  too important that demand putting country above party. Now is the time  to put country above party.   First, on the Cabinet, our norms of good government and above all  ethics are being tested by a Cabinet unlike any other I have seen in my  time in public office. There are so many billionaires with so many  conflicts of interest and so little expertise in the issues they would  oversee.   Take the nomination we are now considering: Betsy DeVos for Education  Secretary. In my mind she is the least qualified nominee in a  historically unqualified Cabinet. On conflicts of interest, she ranks  among the worst. In her ethics agreement, which was delivered to the  committee after the first hearing, it was revealed that she keeps  interests in three family-owned trusts that have holdings in companies  that could be affected by matters related to the Department of  Education. Independent ethics watchdogs have criticized her ethics  agreement for failing to deal with these conflicts of interest.   On philosophy of education, her views are extreme. She seems to  constantly demean the main purpose of her job--public education. Nine  out of 10 American kids attend public schools. Her views on public  education are a major concern, particularly for Senators from rural  areas. There is not a lot of choice of schools outside major  metropolitan areas. If you don't have a good public school in your  neighborhood or in your community, you have nothing. Any Senator from a  rural State should be worried about her commitment to public education.  [[Page S686]]    We in New York have the third largest rural population in America. I  am worried for those schools where, if the school is no good, you don't  have much choice; you don't have any choice.   Above all, and on basic competence, Mrs. DeVos has failed to make the  grade. She didn't seem to know about the Federal education law that  guarantees education to students with disabilities. She could not  unequivocally say that guns shouldn't be in the schools, and she didn't  seem to know about a long simmering debate in education policy about  measuring growth versus proficiency. Frankly, Mrs. DeVos's answers at  the hearings were embarrassing, not only for her but for my Republican  colleagues on the committee who rushed her nomination through with 5  minutes of questions, only one round, and at 5 p.m.   Cabinet Secretaries can't be expected to know everything, but this is  different. The nominee for Secretary of Education doesn't know some of  the most basic facts about education policy. She has failed to show  proficiency, and there is no longer any time for growth.   The American people are speaking in one loud voice against this  nominee. I have had many people come up to me in New York and say: I  voted for Donald Trump, but I am making calls about this nominee.  Americans across the country in red and blue States have been flooding  our offices with phone calls and emails, asking the Senate to vote no  on Betsy DeVos. Local newspaper editorial boards, many of whom have  endorsed Trump, are saying the same thing.   My friends, the Senators from Maine and Alaska, were profiles in  courage last week when they announced their opposition to her  nomination, but, unfortunately, so far they are the exception. We need  just one more vote, and we can get a Secretary of Education who is a  lot better than the one who was nominated. I ask my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to follow the courageous example of the  Senators from Maine and Alaska. We have an obligation as Senators--not  as Republicans and not as Democrats, but as Senators--to evaluate these  nominees and their fitness for office because these nominees are going  to wield immense power over the lives of Americans for the next 4  years. I ask my Republican colleagues to look into their conscience and  cast their votes tomorrow, not based on party loyalty but based on  whether or not Mrs. DeVos is qualified to be our Nation's leader on  education policy. If one doesn't measure up, the Senate has a  responsibility to reject the nomination.   I realize it rarely occurs, but this should be an exception because  she is so uniquely unqualified, whether it comes to competence, whether  it comes to philosophy against the public schools, or whether it comes  to conflicts of interest, which still exist in far too many instances  with Mrs. DeVos.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I just listened to my friend the majority  leader and the majority whip on the floor. They are able legislators,  but they are sort of misleading the public as to our motivation. They  have tried to paint every Democratic request as leftover resentment  from the election. ``Sour grapes'' the majority leader said a few weeks  ago. They can say it day after day after day, but it will never be  true.   All we Democrats are insisting on is careful, careful consideration  of nominees who we believe almost universally are below par. These  nominees are going to have a tremendous effect on the American people.   Every mother and father in America should worry about Betsy DeVos's  lack of dedication and almost negative feelings about public education.  She heaps abuse on public education. Ninety percent of our children are  in public schools. Of course, there should be discussion about it. She  shouldn't be the nominee.    Yes, I understand, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle,  there is a new President. My guess is, if we went in their cloakroom  and heard their whispers, our Republican colleagues would say: I wish  he could have come up with someone else.   Betsy DeVos is the negative trifecta. She is negative on competence.  She doesn't even understand the basic aspects of education. She is  negative on philosophy. She disdains public education, where 90 percent  of our kids are. She is negative on ethics. Her conflicts of interest  are legion, and she hasn't, unlike some other of the Cabinet nominees,  tried to erase them.   So of course there should be a tremendous amount of discussion. Of  course Democrats ought to bring to light who Betsy DeVos is. So when  she does her acts as Secretary, when she does things that hurt public  education as Secretary, the American people know what is happening and  can stand up against it.   I have to tell my colleagues, it is not Democrats who are bitter  about the election; it is the American people who are bitter about the  nomination of Betsy DeVos, and that is why millions and millions of  calls--almost unprecedented on a Cabinet nomination--have poured into  this Capitol, into Democratic and Republican offices alike. The  distinguished chairman of this committee--who is a dear friend; I have  such respect and admiration for him, and we have spent time together  socially--was put in the awkward position of having to rush through a  nominee, 5 minutes of questions, that is it, for each Senator; 5  minutes at night, no second rounds. There was no rationale for that,  other than he was afraid of what she would say or might not say. Sure  enough, when she testified, those fears were actualized because Betsy  DeVos couldn't answer the most fundamental questions about public  education.   She couldn't get her paperwork in on time. What kind of nominee is  that? How is someone who is going to run the Department of Education,  with tens of thousands of employees, unable to get her paperwork  submitted in enough time to clear the ethics organizations? How was she  unable to get her paperwork in on time? Every nominee of President  Obama's did, and we didn't hear from them until they did.   The rush; a few extra days, some hours last night so we might examine  a nominee who has tremendous power over the future of millions of  American kids and their families--oh, no. If anything, we should be  spending more time on Betsy DeVos, not less. What should be happening  is she should go back for a second hearing now that her paperwork is  in. What should happen is she should be asked more questions because  she was so unable to answer so many rudiments last time. What should  happen is, there should be more time, not less, on debating this  nominee, not because we want to be dilatory but because we want a  nominee who at least meets some basic tests, and she does not.   That is why every Democrat will be voting against her, and two  Republicans, who showed tremendous courage. Again, I have been around  here a while. I know the pressures. That is why I have such respect for  the Senators from Alaska and Maine who voted against Betsy DeVos not  for political considerations, not in frustration that they lost the  election but because they knew how bad she would be for public  education because their States are largely rural. In rural America,  there is not much choice, which has been Betsy DeVos's watchword,  although the charter schools she set up have been, by and large, a  failure. They don't have that choice. So someone who decries public  education, who disdains public education, is not good for their State  and, I would dare say, is not good for the States of a lot of Senators  on the other side of the aisle who feel compelled--that party loyalty-- to vote for her. In fact, when we talk about parties demanding things,  it is the Republican side demanding a vote for an unqualified  candidate, not the Democrats delaying the vote.   I hope against hope that another Republican will have the courage of  the Senators from Alaska and Maine and join us. Then what can happen is  the President will get to make the nomination. We Democrats are not  going to pick the Secretary of Education, but it will be a qualified  nominee because they will have learned their lesson at the White House  that they can't brush through these nominations with such little  vetting.    I yield one hour under my control to Senator Murphy.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.   The Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from  Maine.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.    Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from  Maine.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.    Mr. President, if the average American heard someone  read a letter from Coretta Scott King that  [[Page S856]]  said what it said, they would not be offended. They would say that is  someone's opinion; that is all.   It seems to me that we could use rule XIX almost every day on the  floor of the Senate. This is selective enforcement, and another example  of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle escalating the  partisanship and further decreasing comity in the Senate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.    Mr. President, it is my understanding--I was not there-- that there was a warning over Senator Kennedy's letter, but the actual  ruling was based on Coretta Scott King's letter; is that correct?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct.    Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.  [[Page S857]]         Mr. President, I don't want to prolong this much more.  In light of what my friend from Florida said, I would just reread what  I said earlier.   If average Americans heard someone read a letter from Coretta Scott  King that said what it said, they would not be offended. They would say  that is someone's opinion. That is all.   It seems to me we could use rule XIX almost every day on the floor of  the Senate, as my colleague from Maine so pointedly and piquantly  exhibited a few minutes ago.   This selective enforcement is another example of our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle escalating the partisanship and further  decreasing the comity of the Senate, which I treasure as well. This was  unnecessary.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, we here in the Senate have a tradition of  mutual respect among our fellow Senators. We have a spirit of comity.  It is a tradition that I hold in high esteem.   Last night that tradition was violated, and the Senate went in a very  bad direction. I believe my Republican colleagues were far too zealous  in trying to enforce that tradition and in doing so were guilty of the  exact same thing they were trying to police.   My friend the Senator from Massachusetts was reading a letter written  by Mrs. Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., to  the Judiciary Committee--her testimony about the nomination of then- Judge Jeff Sessions to be a Federal judge. For that, the Chair and my  friend the majority leader interrupted her remarks, invoked rule XIX,  and forbid her from continuing. The Chair directed the Senator to take  her seat. In my view, it was totally, totally uncalled for. Senator  Warren wasn't hurling wild accusations; she was reading a thoughtful  and considered letter from a leading civil rights figure. Anyone who  watches the Senate floor on a daily basis could tell that what happened  last night was the most selective enforcement of rule XIX.   My friend the Senator from Massachusetts was here when one of her  colleagues called the leadership of my dear friend Senator Reid  ``cancerous'' and said that he ``doesn't care about the safety'' of our  troops. That was not enforced as a rule XIX violation, but  [[Page S921]]  reading a letter from Coretta Scott King--that was too much.   Suggesting that the distinguished majority leader had repeatedly lied  to the press--a comment made by a fellow Republican, by the way--that  was fine. Reading the letter of a civil rights icon? At least to the  other side, unacceptable.   Just last week I heard a friend on the other side of the aisle accuse  me of engaging in a ``tear-jerking performance'' that belonged at the  ``Screen Actors Guild awards.'' It was only the second time that week I  had been accused of fake tears on the floor of the Senate, but I didn't  run to the floor to invoke rule XIX. But when my friend from  Massachusetts read a piece of congressional testimony by Coretta Scott  King, she was told to sit down.   Why was my friend from Massachusetts cut off when these other, much  more explicit, much more direct, much nastier attacks were disregarded?  There is a shocking double standard here when it comes to speech.  Unfortunately, it is not constrained by the four walls of this Chamber.   While the Senator from Massachusetts has my Republican colleagues up  in arms by simply reciting the words of a civil rights leader, my  Republican colleagues can hardly summon a note of disapproval for an  administration that insults a Federal judge, tells the news media to  ``shut up,'' offhandedly threatens a legislator's career, and seems to  invent new dimensions of falsehood each and every day.   I certainly hope that this anti-free speech attitude is not traveling  down Pennsylvania Avenue to our great Chamber, especially when the only  speech being stifled is speech that Republicans don't agree with--even  speech that is substantive, relevant, on point to the matter this body  is considering, and appropriate and measured in tone.   I would make a broader point. This is not what America is about,  silencing speech, especially in this Chamber. What we do here is  debate. We debate fiercely and forcefully but respectfully. The  Founders of the Republic and titans of the early Senate--Webster, Clay,  and Calhoun--debated until they were blue in the face. From time to  time, they probably had tough words for one another. We are not afraid  of tough words in America. We don't look to censor speech. The rule is  only intended to keep Senators on the facts, to keep them from making  baseless accusations about another's character. My friend from  Massachusetts was following the letter and the spirit of the rule last  night. She was engaging in that tradition of forceful but respectful  debate when she was cut off. That is not what the Senate is about. That  is not what our dear country is about.   Every Member on the other side of the aisle ought to realize that  what they did to Senator Warren was selective enforcement. It was the  most selective enforcement of a rarely used procedure to interrupt her,  to silence her, and it was the only violation of the spirit of mutual  respect and comity in this body that occurred last night.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
