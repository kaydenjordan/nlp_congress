 Mr. Speaker, in the 100 days Vice President Harris has  been overseeing the border, an estimated 500,000 immigrants and  thousands of pounds of drugs have flowed over the border into our  country. Despite clear evidence of a worsening crisis, the Biden  administration continued to dismantle effective policies.   When I visited the border, Border Patrol agents consistently  expressed that eliminating the Remain in Mexico policy has brought on  this current crisis. Now, the Biden administration is considering  rescinding yet another successful policy, title 42, which allows CBP to  expel adult migrants.   The data is clear. Human traffickers, drug smugglers, and criminals  are benefiting from the Biden administration's open border policies.  More fentanyl has been seized this year than in all of 2020.   Deadly drugs like fentanyl are flowing across the border into our  communities, killing people in my district and all of our districts.  Fentanyl was present in 75 percent of the overdose deaths in my home  county of Luzerne County in the last year.    An open border is not some faraway problem. Consequences are  reverberating across America. We must send a strong message of  enforcement and resecure our southern border.                            ____________________
