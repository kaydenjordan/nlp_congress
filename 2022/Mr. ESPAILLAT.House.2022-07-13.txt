 Mr. Speaker, the January 6 Committee has interviewed  more than a thousand people and gathered more than 140,000 documents.   Yesterday, the committee revealed how the former White House counsel  agreed that there was no evidence of widespread election fraud. At  hearing after hearing, the committee has proven that Trump's big lie  led to a violent insurrection that attempted to end our democracy.   I introduced two resolutions calling for the prosecution of  insurrectionists and condemning the Proud Boys' acts of terror. Now,  more than 800 insurrectionists have been arrested, and the leader of  the Proud Boys has been charged with seditious conspiracy.   Efforts to undermine our democracy are not over. We must remain alert  and protect people's right to vote.                            ____________________
