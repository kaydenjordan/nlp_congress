 Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman of the  subcommittee for yielding.  [[Page H3172]]    First, I include in the Record a letter from the County of Santa  Clara, California, relative to the issue of net neutrality and the  underlying legislation.                                              County of Santa Clara,                                  Office of the County Executive,                                        San Jose, CA, April 4, 2019.      Hon. Anna Eshoo,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Eshoo: The County of Santa Clara       strongly supports H.R. 1644, the ``Save the Internet Act of       2019.'' This measure would re-establish federal rules and       policies protecting net neutrality as articulated by the       Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in its 2015 Report       and Order, In the Matter of Protecting and Promoting the Open       Internet (FCC 15-24) (the Order).        Like local governments across the country, the County of       Santa Clara provides public safety, welfare, and governance       services that depend on an open internet. For example, County       public health alert systems and the County's virtual       emergency operations center could both be hobbled by       broadband internet access service (BIAS) provider practices       subject to regulation under the Order. The County is deeply       concerned that there currently is no ``cop on the beat''       ensuring the protection of such systems, and thus strongly       supports H.R. 1644, which would reestablish oversight of BIAS       provider practices that threaten public safety.        The County's concerns are particularly acute in light of       its past experience with BIAS provider practices. The       County's experience has demonstrated that BIAS providers will       act in their own economic interests, even when doing so       threatens public safety. For example, shortly after the FCC       revoked net neutrality protections, Verizon throttled Santa       Clara County firefighters in the midst of their efforts to       fight the then-largest fire in California history--despite       repeated requests to remove the throttling and allow the       firefights to perform their duties. These events are outlined       in the attached Declaration, submitted to the U.S. Court of       Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.        Net neutrality is also vital to the continued economic       success of our region. Santa Clara County is a world-leading       hub of high-technology innovation and development and is home       to almost 2 million residents. Net neutrality is necessary       for the prosperity of the county's economy, as it encourages       competition among businesses, fosters innovation, creates       jobs, and promotes economic vitality both within the county       and across the nation.        Preserving net neutrality for County of Santa Clara       residents has long been an action point for the County. In       2017, the County's Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted       resolution number BOS-2017-105, Resolution of the Board of       Supervisors of the County of Santa Clara Supporting the       Preservation of Federal Rules and Policies Protecting Net       Neutrality, to publicly confirm its support of an open       internet. In addition, the County of Santa Clara and the       Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, along       with the City and County of San Francisco, California Public       Utilities Commission, 22 states (including California), the       District of Columbia, and several private and nonprofit       entities filed a lawsuit (Docket 181051, D.C. Cir.)       challenging the FCC's December 2017 decision to repeal net       neutrality policies with its Report and Order, In the Matter       of Restoring Internet Freedom (FCC 17-166).        By restoring the FCC's 2015 order In the Matter of       Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet, H.R. 1644 would       ensure net neutrality. In addition, the bill would nullify       the FCC's 2017 order In the Matter of Restoring Internet       Freedom and would prohibit the enactment of any other rule       substantially the same as this order, unless the new rule is       specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of       the enactment of H.R. 1644. It is for these reasons we       support H.R. 1644.        On behalf of the County and its residents, thank you for       your co-sponsorship of this important measure that will       protect net neutrality rules and policies now and in future.            Sincerely,                                      Jeffrey V. Smith, M.D., J.D.,                                                  County Executive.         Enclosure: Declaration of Fire Chief Anthony Bowden (Docket       18-1051, D.C. Cir.)    IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA                                  CIRCUIT    Case No. 18-1051 (Lead): Consolidated with Nos. 10-1052, 18-1053, 18-  1054, 18-1055, 18-1056, 18-1061, 18-1062, 18-1064, 18-1065, 18-1066,                18-1067, 18-1068, 18-1088, 18-1089, 18-1105         MOZILLA CORPORATION, et al., Petitioners, v. FEDERAL       COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION and UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,--      Respondents.                   DECLARATION OF FIRE CHIEF ANTHONY BOWDEN         I, Anthony Bowden, declare:        1. I make this declaration in support of the Brief of the       County of Santa Clara (``County'') in the matter referenced       above. I know the facts herein of my own personal knowledge       and if called upon to do so, I could competently testify to       them under oath.        2. 1 was recently appointed the Fire Chief for the Santa       Clara County Central Fire Protection District (``County       Fire''). As Fire Chief, I also serve as Fire Marshal for       Santa Clara County and as the California Office of Emergency       Services (OES) Operational Area Fire and Rescue Coordinator.       In these roles, I am responsible for the coordination of       mutual aid resources in Santa Clara County. This includes the       coordination of all fire resources to significant events,       such as wildfires, throughout the State, when those resources       are requested from Santa Clara County's operational area. I       have worked in fire protection for more than two decades, and       in that time, I have held every rank at County Fire.        3. Established in 1947, County Fire provides fire services       for Santa Clara County and the County's communities of       Campbell, Cupertino, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos,       Monte Sereno, and Saratoga. The department also provides       protection for the unincorporated areas adjacent to those       cities. Wrapping in an approximately 20-mile arc around the       southern end of Silicon Valley, County Fire has grown to       include 15 fire stations, an administrative headquarters, a       maintenance facility, and several other support facilities,       and covers 128.3 square miles. The department employs almost       three hundred fire prevention, suppression, investigation,       administration, and maintenance personnel; daily emergency       response consists of more than sixty employees. County Fire       also contributes resources to all-hazard response outside       Santa Clara County and around the state. For example, County       Fire has deployed equipment and personnel in response to the       ongoing Mendocino Complex Fire, the largest fire in       California's history.        4. County Fire relies upon Internet-based systems to       provide crucial and time-sensitive public safety services.       The Internet has become an essential tool in providing fire       and emergency response, particularly for events like large       fires which require the rapid deployment and organization of       thousands of personnel and hundreds of fire engines,       aircraft, and bulldozers. During these events, resources are       marshaled from across the state and country--in some cases,       even from other countries. In these situations, a key       responsibility of emergency responders, and of County Fire in       particular, is tracking those resources and ensuring they get       to the right place as quickly and safely as possible. County       Fire, like virtually all other emergency responders, relies       heavily on the Internet to do both of these things.        5. As I explain below, County Fire has experienced       throttling by its ISP, Verizon. This throttling has had a       significant impact on our ability to provide emergency       services. Verizon imposed these limitations despite being       informed that throttling was actively impeding County Fire's       ability to provide crisis-response and essential emergency       services.        6. Only a few weeks ago, County Fire deployed OES Incident       Support Unit 5262 (``OES 5262''), to the Mendocino Complex       Fire, now the largest fire in state history. OES 5262 is       deployed to large incidents as a command and control       resource. Its primary function is to track, organize, and       prioritize routing of resources from around the state and       country to the sites where they are most needed. OES 5262       relies heavily on the use of specialized software and       Google Sheets to do near-real-time resource tracking       through the use of cloud computing over the Internet.        7. Resources tracked across such a large event include       personnel and equipment supplied from local governments       across California; the State of California; federal agencies       including the Department of Defense, the Bureau of Land       Management, the U.S. Forest Service; and other countries. As       of Monday, August 13, 2018, the response effort for the       wildfires burning across California included 13,000       firefighters, multiple aircraft, dozens or hundreds of       bulldozers, and hundreds of fire engines. The wildfires have       resulted in over 726,000 acres burned and roughly 2,000       structures destroyed. With several months left in what is a       ``normal'' fire season, we fully expect these numbers to       rise.        8. OES 5262 also coordinates all local government resources       deployed to the Mendocino Complex Fire. That is, the unit       facilitates resource check-in and routing for local       government resources. In doing so, the unit typically       exchanges 5-10 gigabytes of data per day via the Internet       using a mobile router and wireless connection. Near-real-time       information exchange is vital to proper function. In large       and complex fires, resource allocation requires immediate       information. Dated or stale information regarding the       availability or need for resources can slow response times       and render them far less effective. Resources could be       deployed to the wrong fire, the wrong part of a fire, or fail       to be deployed at all. Even small delays in response       translate into devastating effects, including loss of       property, and, in some cases, loss of life.        9. In the midst of our response to the Mendocino Complex       Fire, County Fire discovered the data connection for OES 5262       was being throttled by Verizon, and data rates had been       reduced to 1/200, or less, than the previous speeds. These       reduced speeds severely interfered with the OES 5262's       ability to function effectively. My Information Technology       staff communicated directly with Verizon via email about the       throttling, requesting it be immediately lifted for public       safety purposes. That email exchange is attached here as       Exhibit A. We explained the importance of OES 5262 and its       role in providing for public and first-responder safety and       requested immediate removal of the throttling. Verizon       representatives confirmed the throttling, but, rather than       restoring us to an essential data transfer speed, they       indicated that County Fire would  [[Page H3173]]       have to switch to a new data plan at more than twice the       cost, and they would only remove throttling after we       contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to       the new data plan.        10. In the interim, County Fire personnel in were forced to       use other agencies' Internet Service Providers and their own       personal devices to provide the necessary connectivity and       data transfer capability required by OES 5262. While Verizon       ultimately did lift the throttling, it was only after County       Fire subscribed to a new, more expensive plan.        11. In light of our experience, County Fire believes it is       likely that Verizon will continue to use the exigent nature       of public safety emergencies and catastrophic events to       coerce public agencies into higher cost plans ultimately       paying significantly more for mission critical service--even       if that means risking harm to public safety during       negotiations.        I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the       United States of America that the foregoing is true and       correct.        Executed on August at San Jose, California.        Anthony Bowden.     Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bill. To those who  may be viewing and listening in, it sounds as if, from my Republican  friends, that the sky is actually coming down around our ears. I have  good news for you. It isn't.   The ranking member of the full committee said that the Republicans  simply are opposed to paid prioritization, throttling, and blocking.  But there is something else that the American people need to know. What  they are against here is what they call the heavy hand of government.  We say it is the Federal Communications Commission that should be able  to enforce the law against throttling, blocking, and paid  prioritization.   It is as simple as that. They don't want a cop on the beat.   This is a very simple, three-page bill, but it is powerful because it  puts in place the protections that the FCC came up with in 2015.  Notably, the courts upheld that decision.   There is much talk on the other side of the aisle about Silicon  Valley. You are not from Silicon Valley; I represent it. There are  companies there that had filed suit against the ISPs because of what  they have done.   If you don't think that the ISPs haven't misbehaved, talk to the  firefighters of Santa Clara County. Talk to them. They were fighting  the worst fire in California's history when they were being throttled.  They called Verizon, and Verizon tried to sell them an upgraded plan as  they were trying to save lives.   Across America, 86 percent of the American people--Democrats,  Republicans, and Independents--support what we are doing. We want this  for our constituents. We want the protection of consumers. We don't  want any mitts on the internet. It is as simple as that. Groups from A  to Z, from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to the  American Library Association, support this.   I am proud to be a net neutrality warrior, and I ask everyone in the  House to become one, too, by voting for H.R. 1644. It is a simple,  three-page, powerful bill that will serve the people of our country  well.
