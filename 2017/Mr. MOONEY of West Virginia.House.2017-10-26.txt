 Mr. Speaker, we had a Democratic  President, John F. Kennedy, who cut taxes when he was President. I  think he would take issue with a lot of the things that have been said  by his own party.   It has been 30 years since we addressed taxes in this country.  President Ronald Reagan addressed it 30 years ago. We are way overdue  for tax cuts in the United States of America.   Everybody knows that the 35 percent tax rate on corporations has  driven companies overseas. West Virginia saw, just a couple of years  ago, one of our largest remaining corporate headquarters, Mylan  Pharmaceuticals, relocate overseas to avoid the taxes that are too high  in this country. We all know that is a problem. We have a plan we are  putting forward to try to solve it.   I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: Where is your  plan?   You have no plan. This is all political. All you do is make political  attacks. You have had meetings recently and said: Don't offer a plan.  Let's just attack the Republicans for their plan.  [[Page H8253]]    At least we have a plan to address this because hardworking taxpayers  in West Virginia and America need and expect us to deliver on these tax  cuts. So I rise in strong support of the budget today so we can move  forward with our tax cut plan.
