 Mr. Speaker, I am so proud to stand here today to support  H. Res. 826, the protect Medicaid resolution. I am proud to go on  record today to spotlight the administration's continuous attempts to  take away healthcare for Americans, especially those most vulnerable,  such as seniors and those with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, Medicaid was created in recognition of the importance of  healthcare for all Americans. Even though many low-income people have  jobs, working every single day, the reality is that they don't have  access to employer or private health insurance, and Medicaid fills that  gap.   It is such a sad reality that we need to remind this administration  that the purpose of Medicaid is to provide healthcare for low-income  individuals and families. Medicaid recognizes the humanity of everyone,  despite their socioeconomic status.   When I was on the Budget Committee, I repeatedly voted against  pernicious efforts to change the Federal-  [[Page H854]]  State Medicaid partnership through the per capita caps, onerous work  requirements--I led a letter on that--State waivers to jettison core  medical protections, repeal of the Affordable Care Act. It was just  exhausting. And of course, the favorite tool in the toolkit was block  grants. Block grants.   If you don't know what block grants are, just think, chopping block.   And why has Congress repeatedly not enacted these harmful proposals?  Because block-granting Medicaid will only lead to gutting care for  millions, including seniors and people with disabilities.   Block-granting Medicaid means setting caps on total funding and  leaving the hard choices to governors and State legislators to decide  which populations to serve and which ones to drop.   Seniors and persons with disabilities, those account for a good  portion of Medicaid spending, and any attempts to cut costs, as a  result of cap funding, will hit these groups the hardest.   Perhaps we should cut services to more healthy children to meet the  needs of those in nursing homes. We literally pit the medical needy  against the medical needy.   Healthcare providers whose Medicaid payments would be curtailed and  cut so low that they may decide not to provide services, will make it  harder for even those who are eligible for Medicaid to find those  services.   And let me just remind you that Medicaid block grants are not  responsive to recessions. Per capita cuts, block grants, and work  requirements would undermine Medicaid's ability to help when the need  is greatest, such as during an economic recession, as it was designed  to do.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 826 to  reject efforts to reduce access to quality and affordable healthcare  for low-income patients, especially those with serious and chronic  health conditions.                            ____________________
