 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from North Carolina for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2513, the Corporate  Transparency Act. I do so regrettably.   While I agree with the objective of the bill to help law enforcement  crack down on the financing of illegal operations, this bill's solution  places undue burdens on small businesses and presents unacceptable due  process concerns for millions of small business owners whose sensitive  personally identifiable information will be collected and stored in a  new Federal database accessible without a warrant or a Federal  subpoena.   I want to thank my friend, the sponsor of this bill, for her good  faith attempt to streamline beneficial ownership reporting. I agree  with her that we need to do more to combat terrorist financing, money  laundering, drug trafficking, and other national security threats. I am  sympathetic, also, to the needs of law enforcement to identify the  financing sources of illicit operations and shut them down.   That said, the bill before us today seeks to achieve these ends  unnecessarily on the backs of America's small businesses. The bill  would create additional regulatory reporting requirements for existing  and newly created small businesses. These businesses do not have the  compliance resources comparable to larger firms. This reporting  requirement will take a toll on their productivity and their bottom  line.   According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, 95 percent of  new firms begin with fewer than 20 employees and, thus, would most  likely be subject to the reporting and compliance burdens of this bill.  Accounting for this growth and conservative estimates of the time and  expenses associated with completing the paperwork required by the bill,  the National Federation of Independent Business forecasts that the bill  would cost America's small businesses $5.7 billion over 10 years and  result in 131 million new hours of paperwork. These are dollars that  companies could spend on making new investments or hiring new staff and  time they could spend on building their businesses.   H.R. 2513 would require small business owners or officers to report  personally identifiable information such as name, Social Security  number, and driver's license number to a newly created Federal  Government database operated by FinCEN. Law enforcement can access this  database without due process, and the sensitive personal information  contained in it is subject to the ever-growing threat of malicious  cybercriminals.   Even with all the new requirements and privacy concerns created by  this bill, it still does not fully address the root issue with current  beneficial ownership reporting rules. The supposed justification of the  bill is to ease the burden on financial institutions associated with  implementing FinCEN's customer due diligence rule. However, H.R. 2513  fails to repeal and replace the CDD rule, and the rule will continue to  coexist with the additional regulatory burdens on small businesses  created by the bill.   Finally, the bill falls short if the goal is to relieve financial  institutions of burdensome reporting requirements that do not  materially contribute to countering money laundering and illicit  finance. That is because it fails to make inflation-adjusted changes to  the thresholds for filing suspicious activity reports and currency  transaction reports.   While I recognize the need to combat financing of illicit operations,  this bill attempts to do so by placing unjustified reporting  requirements on our small businesses that could cost them time and  money and hinder their growth.    So, to conclude and to summarize, Mr. Chairman, we can and  should update our AML/BSA laws, and we can and should give FinCEN and  law enforcement better visibility into the beneficial ownership  information of firms vulnerable to money laundering and illicit  finance, but this is the wrong solution. I am hopeful that the concerns  of Main Street small businesses can be addressed if this bill moves to  the U.S. Senate.     Madam Speaker, in 2014 this House unanimously passed the  Ukraine Freedom Support Act. That legislation authorized funds to  ``counter corruption, and improve transparency and accountability of  institutions that are part of the Government of Ukraine.'' Every  Democrat voted for that legislation.   In 2017, the House passed 375-34 with 145 Democrats supporting the  National Defense Authorization Act, which required the executive branch  to certify that Ukraine was making certain defense reforms and  countering corruption.   In 2018, Congress reauthorized that language, and 127 Democrats  supported it.   And finally in 2019, they reauthorized that again with 139 Democrats  supporting it.   The President not only had the authority to do what he did in the  call with President Zelensky, he had a legal obligation to do so.   Madam Speaker, this Democrat majority is trying to impeach the  President for following a law that they voted for.                            ____________________
