 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   I just want to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues for  responding to what is an unprecedented event in the history of this  country. Many of us who have studied history know full well that the  country has been here before, and we have always recovered. The problem  is many times that recovery is uneven. What we have done to this  legislation is created the opportunity to have a more equitable  recovery taking place, and I thank you all for doing that.   The fact of the matter is this is a great country which does not have  to be made great again. What we have got to do is make this country's  greatness accessible and affordable for all Americans. This legislation  makes an attempt to do that. I would hope that, as we go forward, we  will build upon it, and, when we come back, which we will, we will have  an equitable society for all.
