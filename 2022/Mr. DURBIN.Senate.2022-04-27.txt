Judge Garnett is an experienced jurist and a long-time public servant  who will make an outstanding addition to the bench. During her 13 years  as an assistant U.S. Attorney, she prosecuted hundreds of matters,  including criminal street gang offenses, child exploitation, and  threats made against government officials. In recognition of her  accomplishments as a prosecutor, Judge Garnett received a number of  awards from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of  California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Postal Service.   Since 2014, Judge Garnett has served as a Los Angeles Superior Court  judge, presiding over misdemeanor and felony proceedings. In 2016, she  also served as an appellate State court judge, presiding over criminal,  civil, and family law cases.   The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Judge Garnett as  ``well qualified'' to be a district court judge. She also has the  strong support of her home State Senators, Mrs. Feinstein and Mr.  Padilla.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting Judge Garnett's  nomination.
