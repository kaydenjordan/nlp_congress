 Mr. President, I thank Senator Gardner.   Indeed, this is an example of the Senate working together. There is,  simply, a problem in the bill that was passed.  [[Page S3509]]  It is a technical problem, but it goes to the heart of our military- civilian space program. It goes to the heart of the cooperation that we  have had with Russia that goes back to the Soviet Union days when, in  fact, in 1975, in the middle of the Cold War, a crew from America  rendezvoused and docked with the crew from the Soviet Union. Ever since  that crew, which was led by Lt. Gen. Tom Stafford, of the United  States, and General Alexey Leonov, of the Soviet Union, we have had  cooperation in space, and that program continues today on the  International Space Station.   Before I get into talking about the details of the amendment, as  Senator Gardner has discussed so well already, I hope that the Senate  will treat it as technical in nature because it corrects what was not  intended. Unless corrected, it will be disastrous not only for NASA but  for all of the burgeoning commercial space industry, which we are  bringing back to America. What has happened over the last four decades,  in the meantime, is that a lot of that commercial space industry has  flown the coop to other launchers from other nations. But it is coming  back to America.   prayers for the Victims of the Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting    Mr. President, before I get into the substance, I just want to speak  with regard to the terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday and of my  feelings about this violence that has occurred. I don't know whether it  has occurred because of the excessive rhetoric and the sharpness and  the fact that politics has become a blood sport, but we are so divided.   This is what I want to say. We are Americans first, regardless of  party. In times of threat, we come together. We are all on the same  team.    This Senator has prayed, as I know others have, for the complete  recovery of all of those who were wounded yesterday, two of whom were  apparently grievously wounded. We pray for their full recovery. It was  a heinous attack. Let's come together in bipartisanship.                        Amendment No. 250, as Modified    Mr. President, right here is an example of coming together.  Recognizing there is a technical problem, we are coming together to fix  that problem. Let's do this in the spirit of what Americans do. We are  Americans first.   I am obviously here, as I demonstrated in my vote yesterday, for the  Iran sanctions bill, as well as the Russia sanctions amendment, which  we adopted yesterday. Both were bipartisan efforts. I wish to thank our  colleagues, especially the members of the Banking and Foreign Relations  Committees.   This Senator is a cosponsor of the sanctions bill which addresses  Iran's support for terrorism, ballistic missile activity, and human  rights violations--these destabilizing activities--and this bill  strengthens the hand of the United States in countering Iran. These are  destabilizing activities separate and apart from the Iran nuclear  agreement, and to date, the United States has the evidence that they  have complied with the Iran nuclear agreement.   At the same time, we are facing an aggressive Vladimir Putin. The  Russia bill which we debated yesterday and which will come to final  passage shortly strengthens our hand against Putin's Russia. The U.S.  intelligence community has already made clear that Putin attempted to  interfere in our election. Let me tell my colleagues, that didn't stop  with the past election. It is continuing. And we better be ready for it  next year in the 2018 elections because Putin and the GRU have done all  the groundwork. But that is nothing new because he had done it in  elections before in Europe, and he has been doing it in elections right  now, as we saw in France. It boomeranged on him, thank goodness. We  will see an attempt on the upcoming German elections.   The intelligence community has made it very clear--the ranking member  of the Intelligence Committee is here--that Putin and the GRU are  likely to do this again. That is why I say beware. They have laid the  groundwork for next year's elections to try to interfere. Putin's  influence campaign struck at the very core of our democracy and simply  must not be permitted to do it again.   Now is not the time to cozy up to Russia; rather, the United States  must redouble our cyber defenses and our cyber offenses to deter him,  to make him feel enough pain so that he won't do it again. The  sanctions we will adopt today are tough. We need this, but we need  more.   Shortly, we are going to vote on the amendment Senator Gardner has  explained. Interestingly, in all of this angst and conflict with  Russia, we get along with Russia in the civilian and commercial space  program. We have had peaceful cooperation in outer space ever since  what I told my colleagues about; that is, since 1975, in the middle of  the Cold War, the rendezvous and docking and living together in space  for 9 days, a Soviet crew and an American crew. That has been the  central theme of our space program since that time. The shining example  of that now is the cooperation in the International Space Station, the  football field-sized--it is 120 yards long; think one goalpost to  another. People don't have any idea of how big it is on orbit. It  circles the Earth every 90 minutes.   We have been working in space together with many nations but  especially our partner the Russians for over 16 years. So the peaceful  cooperation in space has been good for business. It has been good for  jobs in America. And we are working to grow our share of an over $300  billion global space economy.   That is what this amendment is about. It is about fixing the question  on the purchase of those RD-180 engines, the Russian engine that is  used in the Atlas V, that is used not only for defense launches but for  commercial launches and will be one of the two rockets launching  American astronauts within a year and a half to and from the  International Space Station.   So this amendment is for the benefit of our economy, as well as the  betterment of our civilization.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
