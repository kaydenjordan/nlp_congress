Mr. President, on September 5 of this year, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions announced the repeal of the Deferred Action for  Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA. That same day, President  Trump called on Congress to come up with a solution to legalize DACA.   He challenged us; he said to the Senate, and he said to the House: I  am going to eliminate this Executive order of President Obama. Now it  is your turn. Pass a law if you want to protect 780,000 young people  who had signed up under DACA.   DACA was the direct result of the DREAM Act, which I introduced 16  years ago, to try to protect young people who came to the United  States, brought here by their parents at an early age, who grew up here  and don't have a future. They don't have a home. They don't have a  legal status. They don't have a country to call their own.   It strikes me that these young people themselves did nothing wrong. I  can even argue that their parents did what every parent would do--the  best thing they could for their kids. But in this situation, trying to  focus on what their future will be, their future is clearly in doubt,  and right now many of them are worried about what is going to happen  next.   You see, without the protection of DACA, they can be deported. They  are undocumented. They can't legally work in the United States, and  many of them have wondered whether they should continue school or what  they will do when they can't go to work. These are real-life  challenges, and many times they break down emotionally as they talk  about the uncertainty of their future.   Just outside this Capitol is a beautiful Mall, and smack dab in the  middle of it are two white tents. They are tents that have been built  by these young Dreamers in an effort to process hundreds of people,  just like themselves, who are coming to Washington to tell their  stories to Senators and Congressmen in the hopes that we will do  something.   There are some in the Senate who don't want to help them at all. They  [[Page S8011]]  don't believe they should receive any help in any way whatsoever. There  are others who say: Let's put it off. Let's do it sometime, maybe next  year. Next year is coming soon, and under the President's decision, on  March 5 of 2018--just a few weeks from now--there will be no DACA  protection whatsoever.   It means that today, 122 a day of these DACA-protected young people  will fall out of protected status. March 5 of next year, the number  goes to 1,000 a day--1,000 a day--who will be subject to deportation,  uncertain about what their future might be.   I think it is time for us to do something, and I hope that we can do  it on a bipartisan basis and do it in a timely fashion. It is important  that we fix our entire immigration system, but let's not try to do  everything that needs to be done on immigration when we should be  taking care of these young people as our highest and first priority.   I am ready to sign up for immigration reform. I was there before. It  was called the Gang of 8--four Democrats and four Republicans. A few  years ago, we came up with a comprehensive bill to pass the Senate. The  Republicans in the House refused to even call for a hearing, let alone  a vote on the floor.   We should do our part to pass the new DACA, the new Dream Act. Do it  before we leave this year. Do it this year so that we can spare these  young people the anxiety and stress and fear they have because of the  current situation and so that we can meet President Trump's challenge.   I didn't like the fact that he eliminated DACA, but it is fair for  him to say to us: You have 6 months, Congress. Now do something.   I am not in control here. I am in the minority, being a Democrat. It  is up to Republican leaders here.   All I hear from Republican leaders is: Let's wait until next year and  see if we have time to get around to this. We have the time, all the  time we need now, to do this.   I want to thank a number of people. First, I want to thank the 34  Republican House Members who, last week, sent a letter to the Speaker  of the House, Paul Ryan, saying that we should fix the DACA system  before we leave this year. Thank you to those 34 Republicans.   In this Chamber, I want to thank 6 or 10 Republican Senators who have  either cosponsored the Dream Act or are now actively engaged in helping  to rewrite its replacement in the Senate. I am sure this kind of  bipartisanship is a surprise to those who follow Congress, but it is an  indication that many people share my belief that it is a simple matter  of justice to give these young people their chance to become part of  America's future.   I started a few years ago, when the Dreamers worked up the courage to  declare publicly that they were undocumented--frightening their parents  but giving them some unity and identity in America. I started coming to  the floor when they sent me their color photos and telling their  stories because there is no speech I could give that matches the  stories of their lives. Each time I tell a story, I know it makes a  difference. I know the people who are watching this on C-SPAN and those  who are in the Galleries here in the Senate pay close attention because  we are talking about real lives and real people.   Tonight I want to tell you about Carla Martinez. Carla Martinez was  brought to the United States from Mexico at the age of 8. She grew up  in the Austin and Pflugerville area of Texas, and she was an excellent  student. In middle school and high school, she enrolled in advanced  placement and community college courses, and she was recognized as an  AP scholar student. In high school, she participated in the band, and  she worked and volunteered in her community. During her senior year,  Carla would go to school from 9 a.m. until 2:30 in the afternoon, then  she would work from 3 in the afternoon until 11 at night and only then  start her homework.   In August 2012, Carla began her studies at the University of Texas,  San Antonio, obtaining a bachelor's degree in civil engineering. A  student like Carla, who is undocumented, did not qualify for Federal  Government assistance. It meant there was no Pell grant to help her pay  for college or a Federal loan to help her pay for college. She had to  work to earn the money to pay her way through school. Something which  many people would shrink away from, she accepted the reality of being  undocumented in America. Because she was ineligible for financial aid,  she worked to support herself, and she often had to choose between food  and buying books.   During college, Carla was also an officer in a number of  organizations, including the Society of Women Engineers. She was a  College of Engineering Ambassador, which means she had to maintain a  very high GPA at the University of Texas. During her summers, Carla  interned at Alpha Testing and the San Antonio Water System while she  also worked as an engineering camp counselor.   In August of 2016, Carla was the first DACA recipient to study abroad  with the University of Texas at San Antonio's Education Abroad Program.  She studied in as part of the first group of students to participate in  the Urbino, Italy, civil engineering program.   Because she couldn't get financial aid, studying abroad was more  difficult for her than the other students who were part of the program.  Not only did she need the money to go to college, she needed to raise  the money to pay for the study abroad. She never gave up.   One of her professors said:         Carla is a very dedicated student. She has excellent       organizational skills and works well with her classmates. She       is a team player. Her involvement with the College is       fantastic--she has been an ambassador.    In May 2017, Carla graduated from the University of Texas at San  Antonio with a civil engineering degree and two job offers. Today she  works full-time at M&S Engineering as a water/wastewater engineer.   Her dreams for the future are to go back to school and get a master's  in business and engineering and to give back by creating a scholarship  program to help fund other engineering students.   Carla wrote me a letter about her worries because of President  Trump's decision to take away her protection from being deported from  the United States. Here is what she said: ``Every day that passes, it's  a day closer to not being able to work, not having a driver's license,  and not being able to financially provide for my family as the head of  the household.''   People like Carla are the reason more than 400 business leaders  signed a letter to all Members of Congress urging us to do something  and pass a bipartisan Dream Act. The letter says:         Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our       economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of       why we continue to have a global competitive advantage.    That gathering of Dreamers out on the Mall, just away from the  Capitol dome here, are a lot of young people just like Carla. They are  coming here in the hopes that Members of Congress will slow down in the  hallways on the way to their office or to a committee hearing and just  hear for a moment their stories--stories just like Carla's--stories  that really beg us to do something. We know we have to, we know we  should, and there is absolutely no reason to delay it.   Why would we want this amazing young woman, who has done so many  extraordinary things in her life, to live with this uncertainty 1  minute more than she has to? Why wouldn't we step up and do what we are  supposed to do?   I am working on this with colleagues. A number of Republican Senators  have been sitting down in my office, even today, trying to work out the  details on a compromise. We are not quite there, but there was a  determination in our meeting today to get there, to put something  together.   I would like to do this before we leave for the holidays. I think it  is only right that we try our very best to achieve that, and I think we  can. I think if Members of both sides show good faith, we can reach  that goal.   I want to especially thank Lindsey Graham, my cosponsor of the Dream  Act, and Jeff Flake of Arizona, another cosponsor, who have stepped up  and really just shown extraordinary commitment to this cause. We also  have Lisa Murkowski and Cory Gardner as well who are cosponsors of the  same legislation, and there are other Senators who are working with us  behind the scenes to get this done. Some  [[Page S8012]]  of them I know are taking a political risk to do it, but they believe  it is the right thing to do, and they want to be on the record to be  part of the solution. I am looking forward to working with them.   In a few weeks--maybe only 10 days now--Congress is going to adjourn  to go home for the holidays, but Dreamers can't go home for the  holidays because they really don't have a home. They are homeless in  America because they are waiting on us to come up with the legislation  that defines their status and gives them a future. Hundreds of  thousands of Dreamers can't enjoy the holidays the way many of us can  because of their concern about being deported from the United States of  America, separated from parents, brothers and sisters, friends, family,  and loved ones.   When we introduced the Dream Act, Senator Lindsey Graham, a  Republican from South Carolina, said: ``The moment of reckoning is  coming.'' Well, that moment is here. Congress has the responsibility to  do our job to make the Dream Act the law of the land before the end of  this year or bear the responsibility for forcing hundreds of thousands  of talented young immigrants out of the workforce and putting them at  risk of immediate deportation.   The question we face is very basic, Will the United States of America  be a better nation if Carla is forced to leave? This woman's  determination, her drive, and her talent have brought her to this  glorious moment when she finally graduated college. With this degree  and with this education, she can offer us so much more and really serve  America and its future.   This is the country she loves. She deserves the respect of this  country, and she deserves the determination of the Members of the  Senate to take this up as a highest priority in the closing days of  this Senate session.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
