 Mr. President, this week, I have the honor of  recognizing Celea Poitra and Gahge Whitemanrunshim of Big Horn County  for courageously stepping up to help others in the face of danger. They  exhibit strong Montana values, and their dedication to helping others  is admirable.   Celea and Gahge were in their grandmother's pickup truck heading to a  dental appointment on Saturday, February 27, 2021, when they witnessed  devastating 30-vehicle pileup on the Yellowstone River Bridge outside  Billings, MT. Dozens of vehicles crashed into each other on the icy  interstate highway bridge. After their truck came to a stop, Celea and  Gahge saw a vehicle with a mother and two kids hanging partially off  the guardrail of the bridge. Celea and Gahge did not hesitate to step  in and help. However, the impact from other vehicles hitting the pile- up knocked both of them off of the bridge, and they fell to the ground  about 60 feet below.   They sustained serious injuries when they fell and are recovering in  Billings' hospital. Celea was treated for a broken back, lacerated  kidney, and other injuries. She was in an intensive care unit and is  expected to need multiple surgeries. Gahge suffered a fractured neck,  punctured lung, and other injuries. Their grandmother and guardian,  Joan, stated that it is very much in her children's nature to go out of  their way to help someone.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Celea and Gahge for  demonstrating such bravery to help others in need and I pray for their  swift recovery. Their selflessness serves as an inspiration to all  Montanans.                             ____________________
