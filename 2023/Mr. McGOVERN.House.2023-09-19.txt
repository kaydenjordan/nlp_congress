 Mr. Speaker, we are 11 days--11 days--away from a  government shutdown and the rightwing of the Republican Party is busy  fighting with the far rightwing. The sham plan Republicans have cobbled  together this week gets us nowhere closer to funding the government. It  goes back on the bipartisan deal struck earlier this year and is dead  on arrival in the Senate,  [[Page H4391]]  and it shows where Republican priorities are.   By imposing draconian cuts on domestic programs, their sham CR means  massive cuts to programs for people living in poverty and everything  from housing support to heating assistance to WIC benefits.   Make no mistake: If we don't reject these cuts and if we don't fully  fund the Biden administration's $1.4 billion supplemental WIC request,  eligible low-income people, primarily toddlers, preschoolers, and  postpartum moms could be turned away from food. I can't for the life of  me think of a more rotten thing to do.   Pregnant moms and their young families are counting on you, so let's  drop the theatrics, come together, fully fund WIC, and work toward  ending hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of a bipartisan amendment that is made  in order and will be offered by Representatives Gaetz and Jacobs to  prohibit the transfer of cluster munitions.   Since 2009, the United States has refused to use, produce, transfer,  or sell cluster munitions. As a Nation, we could take pride in this  decision.   Cluster munitions are indiscriminate weapons. They explode when  touched  [[Page H4395]]  by a soldier, a farmer, or a child. They contaminate an entire field of  combat, and they remain a deadly threat long past the end of a  conflict. Rain and other events can move them from where they first  landed to who knows where.   Yet, the Biden administration recently chose to send cluster  munitions to Ukraine. I condemn Russia's use of cluster munitions on  Ukraine, but two evils do not add up to a greater good. The United  States should not have provided cluster munitions to Ukraine, and this  amendment is necessary to ensure such a transfer does not happen again.   I also support this amendment because it is not specific to Ukraine.  Now that the United States has opened the door to using cluster  munitions, we have no idea where else the U.S. might decide to send  them.   An international treaty exists to ban cluster munitions. Mr. Speaker,  112 countries have ratified the Convention on Cluster Munitions since  May 2008, and 12 more have signed. Nigeria ratified the convention on  February 28, and South Sudan did so on August 3.   The United States and Russia are not parties to the treaty, and now  each of us has brought these terrible weapons into play inside Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, the only thing that can undermine the ban on cluster  munitions is the willingness of governments to use or transfer these  terrible, indiscriminate weapons.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Gaetz-Jacobs  amendment and prohibit the United States from any further transfers of  cluster munitions.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding so I  can vent a little bit.   Mr. Speaker, I just saw a Roll Call story that is reporting that  Republicans are pulling their continuing resolution today to weigh more  cuts. I mean, are you kidding me? Their crummy CR contained an 8  percent across-the-board cut in almost every program that helps people,  everything from medical research, WIC, Head Start, housing. Even border  security is cut by 8 percent. The only thing that is exempt is the  military budget, the biggest bureaucracy in our government.   They are okay with cutting fuel assistance for poor people by 65  percent. Money to help people be able to heat their homes in the  winter, they are okay with cutting that, but they believe you can't  find one penny of savings in a missile system in the Pentagon with huge  cost overruns. I mean, it is pathetic. As the Republican whip said: The  patients are running the hospital around here.   The gentleman from Oklahoma said this is about a negotiation. My  Republican friends can't even negotiate with themselves, and we have 11  days to go before there is a shutdown, and they are going in the wrong  direction. It has become more and more difficult to get to an  agreement.   Enough, I mean, enough. The Republican leadership of this House is  incompetent. They are so incompetent; it takes my breath away. They are  letting the clowns run the circus. It is time the Speaker of the House  develop a spine and stand up to the most extreme elements on the  Republican side and actually sit down and negotiate an agreement that  deals with the reality of our government.   The Republicans only control barely just one branch of our  government, the House. The Senate is under Democratic control. The  White House is run by a Democrat. You are going to have to negotiate,  and you are moving in the wrong direction. Time is running out. Stop  this nonsense. Get serious. Get to the negotiating table. Enough of  this.
