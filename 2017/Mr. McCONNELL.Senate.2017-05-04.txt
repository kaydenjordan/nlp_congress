 Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Young on his  first major speech in the Senate. It was truly inspirational. Our  colleagues who are here on the floor have had an opportunity to listen  to a very important speech.   I also acknowledge a former Senator who is with us in the Chamber,  Richard Lugar of Indiana, who also was an extraordinary representative  of the people of Indiana.   I congratulate Senator Young.    Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the  government funding bill the House passed yesterday, and with it,  critical resources to address a number of issues facing our country.   As I have noted over the course of this week, the bill includes a  number of provisions that are important to our country, and today I  would like to take a closer look at the positive impact they can make  in the lives of the men and women we represent.   Our country is suffering from a terrible epidemic. Heroin and  prescription opioid abuse is destroying families and communities all  across our Nation. On average, overdoses from these drugs claim 91  lives every day--91 lives every day. Drug addiction can even devastate  the lives of babies before they are born.   States like mine have been hit particularly hard by this epidemic. I  have heard countless stories from Kentuckians who have experienced the  heartbreak of addiction firsthand.   Here is one story that a grandmother from Independence, KY, shared  with my office: ``[M]y granddaughter is growing up without a father due  to this evil drug,'' she wrote. ``Our children are the future of this  country and deserve all the help and support we can give them.''   Unfortunately, her story is similar to thousands more all across the  land. Grandparents and other family members are increasingly taking  care of children when parents fall into addiction. As too many families  have experienced, addiction can have long-lasting and damaging effects  on children and can be financially challenging for the caregivers.   A mom in Florence, KY, contacted my office about her son who is  battling  [[Page S2741]]  addiction and frequently runs into trouble with the law. ``There are so  many lives lost and so many more headed in that direction,'' she said.  ``It's an epidemic, not a crime spree.''   We took decisive action against heroin and opioid abuse last year  with the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and  the 21st Century Cures Act. This bill before us, when we pass it, will  provide significant new resources to combat this crisis as well.   These critical funds will go to prevention, treatment, and  enforcement programs that can help our communities heal from this  scourge and help keep more families from ever knowing the suffering  associated with this epidemic.   Look, there is still more work to do to get the opioid crisis under  control, but this funding legislation will take another critical step  in the right direction. That is why substance abuse treatment  organizations support it, including one local group that recently  contacted my office in support of the bill. This legislation, in their  words, will help ``[enhance] the ability of front lines providers to  more effectively deploy resources and tackle this epidemic within our  communities.''   That is making a positive and meaningful impact in the lives of the  men and women we represent.   Healthcare benefits for thousands of retired coal miners were set to  expire across the country at the end of this week. Men and women who  dedicated their lives to providing an affordable and reliable source of  energy to this Nation would have lost their healthcare, many of them  when they needed it most.   I have met with retired coal miners numerous times in my office about  this issue, including one retiree from Georgetown, KY, who worked as an  underground miner for 10 years. He suffers from diabetes and heart  disease, and his wife is a breast cancer survivor. ``There is no  question whether or not we need our health insurance to continue,'' he  said. ``Without it, we would probably lose our home, [which] would be  catastrophic not to mention what might happen to our health because we  could not afford to get coverage or our medicine.''   These coal miner retirees clearly needed our help, which is why I  have been fighting for their healthcare at every step of the way. Today  I am proud that this funding legislation includes my proposal to  permanently extend healthcare benefits for thousands of retirees across  the Nation and in Kentucky. These coal miners and their families can  live with the peace of mind they have been looking for. That is making  a positive and meaningful impact in the lives of the men and women we  represent.   For too long, Federal bureaucrats in Washington imposed one-size- fits-all education policies on our children. Distant bureaucrats  dictated nationwide policies, even though the needs of a student in  Kentucky are different from of a student in Maine or California. For  this reason, we enacted the Every Student Succeeds Act education reform  law last Congress, which sends power back to the States, parents, and  teachers, and this funding bill will support its implementation, giving  our schools the resources they need to prepare our students.   This funding legislation also supports school choice through  reauthorization of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program and through  increased Federal funding for charter schools. Both of these school  choice provisions will help expand opportunities for parents to send  their children to the school that best meets their needs.   In my home State of Kentucky, the increased support for charter  schools will be very important, as the new Republican majority in  Frankfort recently passed a charter schools law.   Yesterday I met with State Representative Carney and charter school  advocates who were key to shepherding this legislation into law down in  Kentucky. I thank them for their efforts on behalf of Kentucky's  students and families, and I look forward to working with them to  support charter schools in Kentucky going forward.   By funding the implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act and  supporting school choice across the country, this legislation will help  parents and students achieve strong educational outcomes. That is  making a positive and meaningful impact in the lives of the men and  women we represent.   Of course, this bill contains other important wins for the country as  well. It includes the largest border security funding increase in a  decade, allowing our country to better support border security agents,  enhance technology, and update critical infrastructure down at the  border. It includes important resources to help us begin rebuilding our  military, allowing our country to give servicemembers more of the tools  that they need, and fund a much needed raise for our men and women in  uniform.   On military funding, we broke out of the years-long insistence by our  colleagues on the other side that every increase in defense had to be  met by an increase on the domestic side. That is no longer the law.   As I have outlined several times this week, this legislation includes  other conservative priorities as well. Importantly, it achieves these  things while conforming to spending caps and reducing bureaucracy, even  consolidating, eliminating, or rescinding funds for over 150 government  programs and initiatives.   Because of hard work from both Chambers and both sides of the aisle,  we have a funding bill before us that can make many important and  positive impacts in the lives of the people we represent. I know I will  be supporting it, and I urge colleagues to do the same.   I look forward to its passage so we can send the agreement to  President Trump for his signature.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time  until 1:45 p.m. today be equally divided in the usual form and that at  1:45 p.m., the motion to refer with amendment be withdrawn, the motion  to concur with amendment be withdrawn, and the Senate vote on the  motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R.  244.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 53, Scott Gottlieb to be Commissioner of Food  and Drugs, Department of Health and Human Services.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, the cloture vote on the Gottlieb nomination occur following  disposition of the Wilson nomination on Monday, May 8.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 158, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  the comeback votes on Monday night are on confirmation of Heather  Wilson as Secretary of the Air Force, and cloture on the nomination of  Scott Gottlieb to head the FDA. We plan to move on the U.S. Trade  Representative, Robert Lighthizer, as well, next week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until Friday, May 5, at  12 noon, for a pro forma session only, with no business being  conducted. I further ask that when the Senate adjourns on Friday, May  5, it next convene at 2 p.m., Monday, May 8; further, that following  the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate resume  executive session as under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Tester.
