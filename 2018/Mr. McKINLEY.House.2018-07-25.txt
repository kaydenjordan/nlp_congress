 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may  hereafter be considered as the first sponsor of H.R. 1002, a bill  originally introduced by Representative Dent of Pennsylvania, for the  purposes of adding cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to  clause 7 of rule XII.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Glenville State  College in Glenville, West Virginia.   With an enrollment of 1,641 students, Glenville State has emerged as  a pivotal institution of higher education in central West Virginia.   Under the leadership of its president, Tracey Pellett, they stand out  for their efforts to reduce the cost of tuition, thereby giving more  students access to an affordable education.   When we meet with students, their number one concern is the amount of  debt that they are accumulating. That is understandable.   Since 1987, nationwide tuition rates have grown more than 213  percent. But since 2016, while most colleges have hiked their tuition,  Glenville has frozen their rates and even cut the cost of summer  courses by 25 percent.   For the upcoming school year, the school plans on reducing tuition by  a full 2 percent. This could be a template for other universities and  colleges across the country to follow.   I applaud Glenville State College for its dedication to ensuring that  every student can access a quality, affordable education.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the  House for 1 minute.
