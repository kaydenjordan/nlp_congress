 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a pioneer of women's  sports in Minnesota, Dorothy McIntyre, who was recently inducted in the  Minnesota High School Basketball Hall of Fame.   There are very few who have done more to advance Minnesota girls  sports than Eden Prairie coach and teacher, Dorothy McIntyre. Dorothy  arrived in Eden Prairie in 1959, with girls sports in Minnesota nearly  nonexistent. But Dorothy led a courageous group of like-minded  colleagues to push for change.   Progress was slow. Gymnastics was first, tennis next, and basketball  not until 1976. But Dorothy kept at it, and when she was told girls  must play basketball in the fall instead of the winter, her answer was  a firm: No, that's not fair. She got results, and today, girls play  basketball just like the boys do, and Dorothy McIntyre is a big reason  why.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Dorothy McIntyre on her well- deserved induction into the Minnesota High School Basketball Hall of  Fame.                            ____________________
