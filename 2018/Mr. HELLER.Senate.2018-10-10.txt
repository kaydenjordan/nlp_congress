 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  retirement of  [[Page S6769]]  city of Sparks Mayor Geno Martini, a dedicated public servant, a proven  leader in northern Nevada, and a friend. As a citizen of Sparks for 71  years, Mayor Martini has been an integral part of our community, and is  a Nevadan through and through.   As a Sparks High School and University of Nevada, Reno, graduate,  Mayor Martini has devoted his life to improving the community he is  proud to call home. Mayor Martini served as mayor of Sparks for over 13  years and was also a member of the Sparks City Council. He has played  an instrumental role in a number of projects that benefit the Sparks  community. Whether it is his work on the North Truckee Drain project  that helps prevent flooding for businesses and homeowners or his  efforts to redevelop the Sparks Marina and transform an abandoned  parking structure into a beautiful apartment home community, Mayor  Martini's legacy of leadership will be preserved through the positive  impact that his work will have on this community for generations to  come.   His colleagues credit the development and revitalization of downtown  Sparks to Mayor Martini's efforts. We have seen tremendous economic  growth in the city of Sparks and much of that would not have been  possible without the leadership of Mayor Martini.   Additionally, Mayor Martini is a longtime advocate for those who  serve the city and has worked to provide support to the community's  residents who are in need. For instance, he helped to increase funding  for Sparks' police and fire departments and played a key role in the  creation of the community assistance center to shelter and offer  outreach to individuals and families who are homeless. Further, he  helps at-risk children in our community who cannot otherwise  participate in recreation programs due to financial hardships by  raising funds for the Sparks Youth Scholarship Program.   I congratulate Mayor Martini on his retirement and thank him for his  years of service to our community. Sparks and Nevada are better places  because of Mayor Martini, and his efforts and stewardship will not be  forgotten.                            ____________________
