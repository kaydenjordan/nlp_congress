 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  fully associate myself with the comments of the gentleman from New York  condemning anti-Semitism, full stop, an entirely appropriate thing to  do.   I just think it is curious how we ended up here. We are having this  debate right now because Democrats had an objection to something said  by a Democrat. So they launch off on this drafting project, and then lo  and behold, I hear all of the remarks on the floor, and a lot of the  substance in the resolution is about President Trump, and criticizing  him and trying to open wounds.   This is, unfortunately, becoming the new mantra of the left in the  Congress. When they have got a problem that they can't solve, it must  be President Trump's fault.   It is a lot of the sentiment that we see echoed out of the Judiciary  Committee where there is no Russian collusion. The Mueller report is  about to drop and Democrats know it is not going to allege Russian  collusion, so they have to launch an 81-pronged investigation to harass  our President.   They can't get their own House in order, so everything has to be the  fault of a President who is creating more economic opportunity,  reducing unemployment, ending wars, and doing a heck of a job for the  country.                                time  1645
