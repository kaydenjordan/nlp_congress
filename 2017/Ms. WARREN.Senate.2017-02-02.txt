 Mr. President, for the first time in more than a decade,  the Republican Party controls the House, the Senate, and the White  House. This week they are starting to roll out their legislative  agenda.   So now that they have complete control of the agenda, what do the  Republicans have in store? Something to bump up wages for working  families or something to create more jobs? Something to tackle the  student debt crisis? Maybe something to deal with all the jobs that get  shipped overseas? No, one of the Republican Party's first orders of  business is a giveaway to ExxonMobil that will help corrupt and  repressive foreign regimes and make it easier to funnel money to  terrorists around the world.   Here is the problem. Big corporations like Exxon--or other oil, gas,  and mining companies--often pay millions of dollars to foreign  governments to access natural resources located in these countries.  Many of these foreign regimes are corrupt, and Exxon's massive payouts  regularly end up in the pockets of government officials rather than in  the hands of the people. These corrupt officials get filthy rich while  their citizens face punishing poverty and dangerous working conditions.  Worse still, some of these undisclosed payments can end up financing  terrorists.   Just over 6 years ago, Congress passed a bipartisan provision to help  tackle this problem. With the strong support of Senator Dick Lugar, the  leading Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Congress  required oil, gas, and mining companies to disclose any payments they  make to governments to extract natural resources. Republicans and  Democrats agreed that shining a light on these payments would help  combat corruption and terrorism around the globe and help citizens in  some of the very poorest nations in the world hold their own  governments accountable.   Disclosing these foreign payments also helps investors right here in  the United States so they can make more informed investment decisions.  Some investors may want to stay away from companies that could face  expensive lawsuits for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or  other anti-corruption laws. Other investors, quite frankly, may just  prefer not to invest in companies that could be helping prop up corrupt  foreign governments or indirectly financing terrorism.   Congress directed the Securities and Exchange Commission to write the  rule, and the SEC spent years soliciting input from investors, from  human rights advocates, from anti-corruption experts, and from oil,  gas, and mining companies. The agency ultimately issued a ruling last  year, and it  [[Page S649]]  worked. The rule gained the support of faith groups, human rights  groups, development organizations, and anti-corruption advocates all  around the world. The rule also earned the support of investors who  collectively controlled more than $10 trillion in assets, and--we  should really be proud--it set an international standard, with the  European Union, Canada, and other countries adopting similar standards  for companies in their own countries.   But it didn't go down well with everyone. A handful of powerful oil  and gas companies have been after this requirement from the start, and  Exxon has been leading the pack on this. In fact, Rex Tillerson, the  CEO of Exxon at the time, personally lobbied against the requirement  back in 2010. His reason? What was his objection? The foreign payments  rule would undermine Exxon's ability to do business in Russia. Listen  to that again. If Exxon has to tell the world about the millions of  dollars it hands over to the Russian Government, Exxon wouldn't be able  to do as much business in Russia. So now the Republican Congress wants  to rush in to help out poor Exxon so they can keep the secret money  flowing to these Russian officials.   This Exxon giveaway shows just how bankrupt the Republican agenda is.  They don't have any ideas for helping working families. It is just one  corporate giveaway after another--making their big business donors  happy and keeping the campaign contributions flowing for the next  election. But the economic lives of our working families, our moral  leadership in the world, the safety of our financial system, and the  water we drink and the air we breathe--all of those--are just  afterthoughts to the corporate wish list.   If you are a corrupt foreign dictator, Republicans rolling back the  rules is great for you. If you are an oil company executive,  Republicans rolling back the rules is great for you. But if you are  anyone else, you should be outraged that the Republican Congress is so  willing to throw you under the bus to please these groups.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote against this resolution.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.                 Heroin and Prescription Drug Abuse Epidemic
