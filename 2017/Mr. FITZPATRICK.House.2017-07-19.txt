 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize KidsPeace,  which is a private charity dedicated to assisting children and  adolescents experiencing emotional, behavioral, and social challenges  in Pennsylvania. Founded in 1882, KidsPeace provides a comprehensive  range of residential treatment programs, accredited educational  services, and a variety of foster care and community-based treatment  programs to help people in need overcome challenges and transform their  lives.   Last week, I had the privilege of meeting Dominick DiSalvo and  Patrick Slattery, advocates of KidsPeace Foster Care in Doylestown in  my district, where they work with families affected by the opioid  epidemic.   Through the power of family living, kids who have emotional and  behavioral challenges learn to participate in healthier relationships  with adults, experience healthy family functioning, witness positive  parenting styles, participate in community life, and learn social  skills through positive role modeling.   I am proud of the efforts of KidsPeace to help Bucks County's youth  receive the information and treatment they need to become healthy  adults. KidsPeace reminds us that we can all make a difference in the  life of a child.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Middletown  Township's two newest police officers: Officer Kassidy Grove and  Officer Ryan Morrison.   Officers Grove and Morrison, both 23 years old, were sworn in by the  Middletown Township Board of Supervisors this week.   Kassidy Grove is a graduate of Pennsbury High School and attended  Lock Haven University where she played rugby. She went on to work at  the Lehigh County Sheriff's Office and for the Yardley Borough Police  Department.   Ryan Morrison graduated from Neshaminy High School, after which he  enlisted as a military police officer. He recently graduated from the  Temple University Police Academy.   Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Kassidy Grove and Ryan Morrison joining  the police department of my hometown, Middletown Township, we recognize  the larger commitment of all law enforcement to step up and serve their  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in solidarity with my brothers and sisters of  the thin blue line, and I urge all Americans to honor their sacrifice.  Together, let us recommit ourselves to the daily ideals and laws that  Officers Grove and Morrison and so many others are sworn to uphold.                            ____________________
