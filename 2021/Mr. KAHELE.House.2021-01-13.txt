 Madam Speaker, as a member of our Armed Forces, now a  Member of Congress, I have taken and given the oath of office many  times. I will support and defend the Constitution against all enemies,  foreign and domestic.   On January 6, the President violated his oath, inciting violent and  deadly insurrection. Our sacred oaths are hollow without  accountability. We must hold this President accountable, remove him  from office, and ensure he can never hold public office again.   I urge my colleagues to do the same. This oath has to matter. Mahalo.
