 Madam Speaker, The White House held a roundtable on the  National Crisis of Veteran Suicide, which I was invited to be a part  of. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 579  and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 580.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, colleague, and fellow  marine,   Greg Pence, for the honor to speak before this body tonight  on such a--you don't call an occasion like this important, but I think  we call it relevant.   It is relevant because Marines, for a long time, since 1775, have  fought to defend freedom, and we go to the fight to win, but we also go  to the fight to help others.   On Sunday, 23 October 1983, you have heard the story told already,  how 220 marines, 18 sailors, and 3 soldiers lost their lives when a  terrorist's truck bomb exploded at a barracks compound in Beirut,  Lebanon.   The same day, 58 of our French brothers in arms lost their lives in  an additional attack by Hezbollah.   In what would be the deadliest day for the Marine Corps since the  battle of Iwo Jima, seven of the marines and sailors were Michiganders,  including Lance Corporal David Bousum of Fife Lake, Michigan.   I remember that day very vividly. At the time, I was a KC-130 pilot  stationed at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois, flying the KC-130  refuelers. We used to fly all around the world, in and out of the  Middle East doing our mission.   Five days after the bombing was the annual Marine Corps Birthday Ball  for our unit and our greater Chicago marines. And that year, we had as  our guest of honor then-Major General Al Gray, commander of the 2nd  Marine Division, who a couple years after that became the commandant of  the Marine Corps.   The Marines are full of tradition and pageantry. And I will tell you  what, the only thing we do more than celebrate, is grieve. And of the  roughly 50 years of birthday balls that I have attended, that one was  heavy with grief. We had lost our brothers through a heinous act, and a  cowardly act. It took us a while to get over it at that time, but, in  the end, you really never get over it. All you do is set your course  for the future fight to make sure that that does not happen again.   The loss of life will always have an impact on our entire armed  services community and our Nation. Our mission, as the Marine Corps, is  to be the most ready when the Nation is least ready, and we will always  be that, whether it be in the 1770s or in the 2070s and beyond.   Today, we honor the fallen, we honor their lives, their legacies, and  their families.   We will never forget the sacrifices made by Michigan's own that day.  We lost the following warriors, marines, and sailors:   Lance Corporal David Bousum from Fife Lake   Lance Corporal Johansen Banks from Detroit   Sergeant Anthony K. Brown from Detroit   Hospital Corpsman 2 Michael H. Johnson from Detroit   Sergeant Michael R. Massman from Port Huron   Sergeant William H. Pollard from Flint   First Lieutenant William A. Zimmerman from Grand Haven   We will never forget.   In the Marines' Hymn, the third stanza ends with: ``If the Army and  the Navy ever look on Heaven's scenes, they will find the streets are  guarded by United States Marines.''   I would suggest to you that some of those marines are on duty today.  We honor their service, we honor their sacrifice, and we honor our  country by remembering. God bless you all and Semper Fidelis.
