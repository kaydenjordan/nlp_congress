 Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate, again, some  exceptional young people from my district, the cheerleaders from West  Orange High School. Known as the Mountaineers, they fought their way to  the 2020 Universal Cheerleading Association's National Cheerleading  Championships in Orlando, Florida. They survived a tough regional in  Pennsylvania to get there.   In Orlando, they faced the best high school cheerleading squads in  the country. During their first UCA competition, they won their  semifinal for the large varsity non-tumbling division and earned a trip  to the finals.   Before they left, I said to them I hoped that they would bring the  trophy home to West Orange, and that is exactly what they did. The  Mountaineers earned a trophy for finishing eighth out of 32 squads, and  I am extremely proud of them. They may not have  [[Page H1580]]  earned the top trophy, but they are champions to me and their entire  10th District of New Jersey.                            ____________________
