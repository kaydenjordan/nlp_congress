 Mr. Speaker, the very first thing I want  to say is this: Take note, those of you who are around the world  watching this House of Representatives in action, that the very first  bill that we are putting out is a bill to send a powerful message that  we not only stand with Israel, but we will fight with Israel.   There is absolutely no way, as God is our maker, that we are going to  stand by and see Israel destroyed. Make no mistake about it. It is as  clear as a bell. In the Holy Scriptures brought down by the mighty hand  of God Almighty: Stand with my people, the people of Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I was called upon as a member of the NATO Parliamentary  Assembly to go to Iran to write the paper on Iran. I met the people of  Iran, and I want the people of Iran to listen: Go to your mullahs. Go  to your leadership. They are the ones that control Hamas, Hezbollah.   Then, I call upon our friends in Saudi Arabia. The answer to this is  in your hands.
