 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of  Josephine Baker, a daughter of Harlem and beloved in France, who, in  her wake, made history yesterday. Josephine Baker became a bridge  between France and the United States, especially in the fight against  discrimination.   She was an artist, a civil rights leader, a World War II resistance  fighter, shining bright both on stage and off it. She was a woman of  countless firsts: the first onstage, the first in the movies, and the  first Black woman to break the rules and shatter the glass ceilings.  Yesterday, she became another first, the first American-born, first  Black woman, and first entertainer to be inducted into the French  Pantheon. She joins nearly 80 luminaries in this Paris monument, where  she will continue to be a bright light for all of us.   I commend the French people and President Macron and thank them so  much for keeping the legacy of Josephine Baker alive. Thank you so  much. Merci beaucoup.                            ____________________
