 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I come here with the heaviest  heart. My beloved Bronx saw the deadliest fire in the history of New  York City in more than three decades; a fire that has left a death  count of 17 residents, including 8 children.   A malfunctioning space heater was the immediate cause of the fire in  a duplex on the third floor of a 19-story building known as Twin Parks  North West. And even though the fire was largely limited to the third  floor, both the apartment door and the nearby stairwell door were left  open, causing the smoke to spread rapidly and widely throughout the 19- story building.   Since the building has no fire escapes and since the stairwells were  full of black, toxic smoke, the tenants had no means of escape. The  smoke spread so widely that victims were found on every floor. The  fatalities were tenants who died from severe smoke inhalation from  cardiac and respiratory arrest.   Almost all of the victims came from a single town in Gambia. The  Gambian community has had roots in Twin Parks North West that date back  more than half a century. It is hard to imagine a more closely knit  community, a community more tied by the bonds of faith and family and  fellowship than the Gambian community of Twin Parks North West, and so  the loss is deeply felt.   The victims were as young as 2, and no older than 50. These were  victims who had their whole lives ahead of them. Ousmane Konteh was  only 2 years old.   Muhammed Drammeh celebrated his twelfth birthday.   Sera Janneh was a student at Lehman College. She had dreams of  becoming a social worker of aiding those afflicted by trauma.   My heart aches for the father who lost his wife, two daughters, and a  son; for the mother who lost her toddler; for the children who lost  their parents; for the Drammeh family who lost four members; and the  Dukureh family who lost five.   The fire at Twin Parks North West was as preventable as it was  tragic. If the space heater had shut off automatically, the fire would  have been prevented.   If the apartment door and the stairwell doors had closed  automatically, the spread of the smoke would have been contained and  countless lives would have been saved.   If the building had a sprinkler system, the fire would have been  extinguished.   If the building had a two-way intercom system, the tenants would have  been advised by the fire department to remain in their homes instead of  fleeing to a smoke-filled stairwell that had become a death trap.   And if the tenants had sufficient heat and hot water in their homes,  there would have been no need to use dangerous space heaters in the  first place.   The use of space heaters is often a cry for help and a cry for heat.  It is often an act of desperation for decent and dignified housing.   Madam Speaker, the Bronx is no stranger to deadly fires. New York  City's four worst fires in the past 30 years have all been in the  Bronx, have all been in my district of south Bronx.   The prevalence of deadly fires in south Bronx is no accident. It is a  consequence of systemic disinvestment from the lowest income  communities of color, from places like the south Bronx, from the safety  and quality of affordable housing.   When it comes to fire safety, America is a tale of two countries and  New York is a tale of two cities. If you live in a luxury development  in Manhattan, then fire safety can be taken for granted. But if you  live in an affordable housing complex in the south Bronx, there is no  guarantee that your building will have a sprinkler system; in fact, it  is unlikely to have one.   There is no guarantee that your building will have self-closing  doors. There is no guarantee that your building will have what experts  would consider anything resembling modern standards of fire safety.   In America, poor people of color are left to live in conditions that  put them at greater risk of losing everything, including their own  homes, their own families, their own lives from a catastrophic fire.   If that is not cruel and callous, I am not sure what would be. We are  reminded that safe and decent affordable housing is not a privilege but  a right; not a luxury but a moral necessity; not an abstraction but a  matter of life and death. Building back better should and must mean  building back safer for communities long forgotten.   On January 9, the world bore witness to one of the fire department's  finest hours of public service. It took the Herculean efforts of more  than 200 firefighters to extinguish the fires at Twin Parks North West.  Firefighters who had ran out of oxygen in their tanks ran into burning  buildings, saving lives at great risk to their own.  [[Page H247]]    There are no words that can convey more powerfully the heroism shown  than the image beside me; the image of Matt Zimpfer, a proud member of  the FDNY carrying a baby, a visibly traumatized baby that he had  rescued from the fire at Twin Parks North West. It is as much an image  of our common humanity as it is of the FDNY's uncommon bravery.   For the south Bronx, January 9 is a day that will live in infamy, but  the image beside me reminds me that even in a moment of despair, there  was cause for hope. Even in a moment of tragedy and a day of infamy,  heroes can and do emerge.   The overwhelming sense of sorrow that weighs so heavily on my heart  is rivaled only by the overwhelming gratitude that I feel for our  heroes at the FDNY, a gratitude that will remain with me for as long as  I live.   May God bless the heroic souls of the FDNY, New York City's bravest,  and may God bless the resilient and resourceful souls of the Gambian  community of Twin Parks North West.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
