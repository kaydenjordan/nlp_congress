 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  legislation because working families deserve a government that will  make their lives better.   First off, to build back better, we must invest in our Nation's  entrepreneurs, and that is exactly what this bill does. It will make a  $5 billion investment in SBA programs that go beyond recovery and  provide transformative, long-term solutions and economic stimulus. It  will create millions of new jobs on top of the millions already added  under the Biden administration.   This legislation also includes the largest single, one-time  investment ever made to HUD's public housing capital fund. It will go a  long way to clearing the backlog of repairs around the country.   This bill also creates universal pre-K, extends the child tax credit,  and finally mandates paid parental leave.   On climate, we are including a focus on environmental justice and  frontline communities like those I represent.
