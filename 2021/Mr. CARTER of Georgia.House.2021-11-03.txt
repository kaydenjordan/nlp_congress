 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  and applaud the 2021 World Series Champions, the Atlanta Braves. I am  enormously proud of the Atlanta Braves, their players, their coaches,  and especially their fans for their determination and resiliency on a  long road to this championship title.   The last time the Braves won the World Series was 1995. I can finally  say that my Atlanta Braves are champions once again. With the World  Series victory, the Braves completed one of history's greatest  championship turnarounds.   Plagued by injuries to their best pitcher and outfielder, the Braves  had a losing record in August. Through much adversity, the Braves  relied on a number of players and others who helped them to regain the  World Series title.   As Braves fans in Georgia and around the world celebrate, I  congratulate this team on a remarkable season, a 2021 World Series  title, and a place in the history books.   The city and people of Atlanta, the great State of Georgia, and the  great Braves nation will be forever grateful to the 2021 Atlanta Braves  for breaking the curse and winning it all.   The Atlanta Braves are the World Series champions.   Go Braves.
