 Madam Speaker, the anti-energy policies of the  Biden administration have targeted oil and gas production and  eliminated American energy independence. Since day one, the Biden  administration has embarked on an agenda of regulatory overreach.   Something you might have heard from the White House press secretary  recently is that there are 9,000 untapped drilling permits that  companies are not using. While this is in part true, they are being  dishonest and purposefully leaving out crucial context and factors that  cause companies to wait to drill those wells.   For starters, many of the wells produced predominantly natural gas,  not oil. In addition, drilling can't begin overnight as leases can take  months or years before companies actively drill.   Furthermore, the Federal permit to drill is not the only government  approval required. Rights-of-way can take years to acquire before  companies can access leases. Most companies cannot drill before  pipelines are in place, and the delayed approvals have resulted in  companies developing drilling access at much slower rates.   This administration is taking up to three times the amount of time to  approve Federal permits than the Trump administration, and that is if  they approve them at all. The American people are tired of the  Democrats' blame-shifting while they ignore the real causes of crushing  gas prices.   We must unleash American energy and lower gas prices domestically. In  addition, restoring American production will remove Putin's control of  the energy market and end his leverage over Europe.   To solve the crisis, President Biden must immediately end the Federal  freeze on all new oil and gas projects, fast-track pending LNG export  permits, expedite approval of all pipeline and energy development, and  stop the regulatory assault on American energy development and  financing.
