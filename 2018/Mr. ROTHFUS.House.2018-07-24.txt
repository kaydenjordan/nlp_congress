 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the House amendment to  S. 1182, the National Flood Insurance Program Extension Act.   This summer has been a challenging time for western Pennsylvania,  where summer storms have caused devastating floods. Residents are still  recovering from the damage. At the same time, the NFIP, the National  Flood Insurance Program, is close to lapsing. That is because, like so  many things we have done in the House, the Senate has failed to act.   We know the NFIP is in need of reform. As a member of the Financial  Services Committee, I applaud Chairmen Hensarling and Duffy for their  work to craft a bipartisan bill that we have passed. Many of these  reforms in this bill are bipartisan. They are noncontroversial.  Pennsylvania's own insurance commissioner, a Democratic appointee, even  testified before our committee in support of the private flood  insurance provisions that are essential to improving consumer choice.  Unfortunately, the Senate is stalled. We should continue urging  Senators to take action, in the meantime.    I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this temporary  extension, and I urge the Senate to get back to work.
