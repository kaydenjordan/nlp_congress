 Mr. Speaker, the rich and wealthy corporate  winners of this Republican tax scam love company, and they just got the  company of 14 United States Senators who will personally benefit from a  new 20 percent deduction for wealthy  [[Page H10207]]  real estate investors with no employees to pass that benefit on to.   One Senator who voted against the bill, before he announced he was  voting for it, stands to gain $7 million annually and personally. The  Senator said he was unaware of the provision and that he did not read  the bill.   Mr. Speaker, the conference committee, the reconciliation process,  was to narrow the differences between these two bad bills, not add new  provisions that benefit rich Senators. This bad bill just took a  dramatic and potentially illegal turn that should be fully investigated  before a vote is taken today.
