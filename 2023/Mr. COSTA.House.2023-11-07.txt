 Mr. Speaker, we are at a seminal moment in world history,  comparable to times in the 20th century, like the Depression, World War  II, and the 1960s.   The world is on fire with conflict. Democratic countries like Israel,  Ukraine, and Armenia are under attack from terrorists and other  authoritarian regimes that want to reshape the world order and take  away basic freedoms and human rights.   These authoritarian regimes and these attacks from terrorists are  anti-Semitic, they involve hate crimes that are sadly on the rise for  other ethnic groups, as well.   Terrorist groups like Hamas and bad actors like President Putin of  Russia and Xi of China are spreading misinformation to create discord.  We see the impacts of that propaganda here at home.   Our actions today, therefore, will determine the future success of  free societies throughout the world, and that is why it is important  for us to stand firm in our support of democracies around the world.   We must stand against the attempts to undermine Israel's very  existence. It is disturbing to see the chants of ``from the river to  the sea.'' This is a phrase used by Hamas--a rallying cry of terrorists  calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. It is anti-Semitic,  and it is hateful.   Israel has the right to defend itself. It has an obligation to  protect its citizens and secure its borders.   Let us not forget the families, the children, and the elderly who  were slaughtered in their homes a month ago by the terrorists who  carried out a planned, coordinated attack on innocent Israeli civilians  on October 7.   We should also hold sorrow for the Palestinian people. Many of those  who live in Gaza are equally victims of Hamas and their barbaric  actions against humanity in using these Palestinians as human shields.   Hamas, therefore, is responsible for this terror and their suffering.  Congress must help the Palestinian people out of this horrific  situation, starting with humanitarian aid. The Palestinians have a  right to determine their own future.   Congress also must send military and economic resources to Israel. It  must work to expand and strengthen the Abraham Accords, which are  critical. We cannot allow Iran and its proxy terrorist groups like  Hamas and Hezbollah to disrupt the accomplishments of this diplomacy.   Let's understand what is at stake here. Iran wants to have hegemony  over the entire Middle East, and we must be mindful of that with their  alliances with Russia and China.   Congress must also send additional aid to Ukraine. These Ukrainians,  these brave people, are defending their sovereignty. We must give them  everything they need to win their fight for freedom and defeat Putin,  who I believe is a war criminal by the actions he has carried out in  the last 18 to 19 months. Russia today, really, is a syndicate  masquerading as a country, and its mob boss is Putin.   For some of my Republican colleagues who are having second thoughts  on funding additional support for Ukraine, I remind you of President  Reagan and Senator John McCain who always recognized the threats of  Russia's Communism to our democracy. I believe in Putin's heart he is  still a Communist.   It is important that we have this bipartisan package to support the  President's proposal and the supplemental package that will provide  funding for the next year for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, additional  border security and humanitarian assistance. This could benefit Armenia  and the over 120,000 Armenians who have been displaced from their  historic homeland as a result of Azerbaijan.   These are all critical issues in the foreign affairs of America and  the world security if we are to remain the beacon of light around the  world.   These are critical times, to be sure, therefore, America must be  together with our allies in Europe. We cannot lose sight of what is at  stake if we do not stop these threats against freedom,  [[Page H5470]]  whether it is in the Middle East, whether it is in Asia, or elsewhere.   Mr. Speaker, this is the test of our time. It is the test of our  generation, and historians will look back 10 to 20 years from now and  they will determine: Did we make more good decisions than poor  decisions in standing up for human rights and the freedoms we cherish?   I pray that we make more good decisions than poor decisions and that  America remain united and the beacon of light for democracy around the  world.                            ____________________
