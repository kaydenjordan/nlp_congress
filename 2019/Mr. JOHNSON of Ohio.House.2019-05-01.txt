 Mr. Chairman, put simply, this legislation  forces President Trump's hand to carry out the goals of his  predecessor, but this administration was elected to tackle our energy  issues differently, our environmental issues differently.   Americans asked for this change in direction. And we got that last  Congress, where Republicans worked with this administration to find  creative ways to streamline the development and use of all of our  energy sources and technologies.   We examined grid modification issues, looked at ways to encourage the  creation and adoption of advanced nuclear energy, along with creative  ways to encourage new coal and natural gas technologies.   We looked at how market forces are driving new energy technologies  and  [[Page H3375]]  how the Federal Government can play a supportive role in that  advancement, not pick winners and losers.   I worry that today's legislation could bring us back to a  prescriptive approach to our Federal energy policy. It could cause  significant ratepayer hikes on families and small businesses in eastern  and southeastern Ohio who simply cannot absorb higher electric bills.   H.R. 9 was rushed through our committees. The Energy and Commerce  Committee held no hearings on it, but simply a full committee markup.  Members had no time to debate it--only vote.   E&C Democrat leadership even expressed frustration over the expedited  pace of this bill.   Because of these reasons and the issues raised by my colleagues, I  urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 9.                                time  1600
