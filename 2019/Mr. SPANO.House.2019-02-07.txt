 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the leadership of  both parties to end the possibility of another government shutdown  before next Friday.   Many in this Chamber oppose President Trump's plans to secure our  border because they believe that doing so would send a negative  message, a message that immigrants are not welcome in this Nation. This  is simply not true.   Just yesterday, I met with farmers from my district who told me how  very much they rely on skilled foreign labor. One farmer in particular  advertised 800 jobs and, in fact, did not receive a single American  applicant.   These farmers also expressed concern that, if the government shutdown  continued, they will be unable to hire workers abroad because the State  Department would not conduct the necessary hearings for H-2A visas.  This is  [[Page H1399]]  not acceptable, and we can and must do better.   The strong economy led by President Trump has created more jobs than  there are Americans to fill them, and we want to encourage legal  immigration not only to fill a need, but also because immigrants create  a stronger America. After all, without legal immigration, my great- grandfather, Francisco Spano, would not have immigrated here from  Italy, and I would not be standing before this House today.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for this House to come together to avert  another shutdown, continue growing our economy, and push for an  immigration system that is fair, just, and inclusive for all.                            ____________________
