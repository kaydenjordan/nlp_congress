 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from Texas  for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2851, legislation that  would give Attorney General Jeff Sessions through the Drug Enforcement  Administration sweeping new authority to combat the synthetic drug  crisis facing our country.   In 2016, nearly 64,000 Americans died because of a drug overdose, and  the overdose rate from the synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and  fentanyl analogues, nearly doubled. We know that illicit fentanyl and  fentanyl analogues are extremely deadly and increasingly are being  shipped into our country through China.   I know all Members would agree that synthetic drugs are a very real  threat that we have to combat. However, it is unclear to me that the  appropriate response to this crisis is the creation of a new schedule-- schedule A--that would impose new burdens on researchers and  manufacturers. It would also dramatically limit the scientific and  medical role HHS and the FDA play in our scheduling process today.   In fact, the DEA already has the authority today to temporarily add  these synthetic substances to the Controlled Substances Act if they  determine that they pose an imminent hazard to public safety. The  agency has used this authority over 80 times, including most recently  to put all fentanyl-related substances into schedule I. DEA also has  authority under the Analogue Act to treat synthetics that are  substantially similar to a controlled substance the same way they treat  the controlled substance, and this is authority the DEA has and  continues to use to combat this crisis.   Instead of proposing to improve the DEA's existing statutory  authority, this bill creates a new schedule for synthetic substances,  and it gives almost sole discretion as to when a substance can be  temporarily scheduled in the new schedule A and expands temporary  scheduling for up to 5 years.                                time  0945    Another reason I oppose this bill is because it also eliminates the  critical scientific and medical analysis by HHS and FDA. It only  requires the DEA to consider recommendations from HHS, eliminating the  binding nature of such analysis under the permanent scheduling process  today.   A letter in opposition from a coalition including the ACLU, Drug  Policy Alliance, Human Rights Watch, and the NAACP, among others, has  also raised concerns about SITSA circumventing the role of HHS in the  scheduling process. The letter notes: ``SITSA would enable the Attorney  General, an unelected individual, to single-handedly determine which  substances are acceptable for private citizens to consume.''   As a public health agency, HHS, acting through FDA, is best  positioned to be making decisions regarding scheduling drugs or  substances based on their scientific and medical analysis. We should  not hand this authority over to a law enforcement agency, and that is  yet another reason why I oppose this bill.   I also continue to be concerned about the potential for H.R. 2851 to  undermine or stifle research and development of synthetic substances.  We know that many synthetic drugs have the same chemical properties as  drugs with known therapeutic uses. By subjecting schedule A substances  to the same requirements as schedule I, we may be unintentionally  creating hurdles for the research community to evaluate whether these  substances may be possible alternatives for treatment of pain and  addiction.   These are all discussions I wish I could have raised during  consideration of the legislation in the Energy and Commerce Committee.  Despite receiving primary referral, the chairman chose to cede to the  Judiciary Committee, denying our members the opportunity to have a full  debate on this legislation.   For all these reasons, I join my colleague, Congressman Nadler, the  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, in opposing this flawed  legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.
