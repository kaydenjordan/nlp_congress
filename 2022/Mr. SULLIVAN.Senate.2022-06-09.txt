 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is Thursday, and I normally come down  on the Senate floor to give the ``Alaskan of the Week'' speech. And,  unfortunately, I am not going to do that today.   Actually, last week, I named two Alaskans of the week. We kind of had  a two-for-one last week. Just as a little wrap-up for that, it was  quite a remarkable thing that took place just last week in Alaska on  Memorial Day.   My two Alaskans of the week, a 92-year-old artist working with a  detective, both Alaska Natives, both from the community of Unalaska out  on the Aleutian Islands chain, worked together. Actually, Gertrude  Svarny worked for decades to right a wrong and get a military burial on  Memorial Day for a young man and also an Alaska Native from Unalaska  who died fighting in World War II and was never recognized, no  gravestone, no tombstone, nothing--for decades. And we had an amazing  ceremony thanks to these two amazing Alaskans--Gertrude Svarny, as I  mentioned, and Mike Livingston. And the memory of this young Alaska  Native soldier, Private George Fox, was now finally recognized.   That was in a Memorial Day ceremony last week. I was trying to get  there. Unfortunately, they sometimes get a lot of bad weather out  there. I flew halfway out to the Aleutian Islands, and we had horrible  weather. We couldn't land.   But the ceremony happened. So there were two Alaskans of the week 2  weeks ago that I just wanted to highlight again. It was an incredibly  moving ceremony.   So I figured that was two for one. So, unfortunately, I am not going  to do an ``Alaskan of the Week'' today. I know we like to end the week  on a high note.                                Infrastructure    Mr. President, I am going to talk about a mystery that has really  been, certainly, flummoxing me and, I think, so many people in our  Federal Government on a matter that especially impacts millions and  millions of Americans suffering from high energy prices. It is a  mystery for the American people.   And, you know, our Federal Government can sometimes be so opaque that  you often don't know who is up to what in this Big Government of ours,  particularly when people are trying to do  [[Page S2885]]  things that are so obviously harmful to the American people. So I am  going to talk a little bit about this mystery because I think we  finally solved it. There is a culprit who is usually the culprit in a  lot of bad things happening in our Federal Government, and I am going  to talk about that.   So here is a little bit of background on the mystery. We passed a  bipartisan infrastructure bill in November. Now, I voted for it. Some  of my colleagues didn't. I voted for it primarily because I come from a  resource-rich, infrastructure-poor State.   Alaska has resources--oil, gas, minerals, renewables--that can help  our State and can help the country and, really, help the world, but we  have very little infrastructure.    Think about this. My State is 120 times bigger than Connecticut, and  we have less road miles than Connecticut. And I know we have less road  miles than Maryland.   So, we need infrastructure. So Senator Murkowski, Congressman Young,  and I participated, certainly in our own ways, on getting this  infrastructure bill written and then over the goal line in terms of  votes.   Overall, I thought it was a positive bill. It wasn't perfect, but  especially with the focus on roads, bridges, ports, harbors, and  broadband--and there is actually a provision in there for Federal loan  guarantees on a huge Alaska gas project--an LNG project. So in my view,  this bill was a win-win-win for jobs, infrastructure, and energy  infrastructure to help bring down energy prices, and, of course, on the  environment.   I like to show this chart a lot. It has gotten a lot of attention.  Some of our national media folks have seen it, and they say: Gee, that  can't be true. Let's PolitiFact or fact-check Senator Sullivan's  emissions chart. So they have, and they have come back and said: Hey,  gosh, he is actually right.   It shows annual emissions from the major economies in the world since  2005 to present. Who is the leader in reducing emissions? Who is the  leader? We are. America is--actually, by far; not even close--with  almost a 15-percent emission reduction since 2005.   Who is the main culprit of spewing emissions out into the global  atmosphere? Well, you guessed it--our good friends, the Chinese  communists--China, India, Iran, and Russia.   So we are the leader on this. I had the opportunity during a  confirmation hearing recently for one of the Biden administration's EPA  nominees in charge of air quality. I showed him this chart. He didn't  seem to know a lot about the chart, but he seemed like a good guy. I  asked: Hey, why do you think this happened? He kind of trotted out  initially the EPA regs. Wrong answer. This is because of the revolution  in the production of American gas. That is a fact, OK? You can check it  all you want.   So you would think that infrastructure, part of the infrastructure  bill that can help us actually produce more energy with more energy  infrastructure, that everybody would be for it--helps the environment,  global emissions, certainly helps workers, and helps build out  infrastructure, which we sorely need.   As I mentioned, Mr. President, big supporters of the infrastructure  bill were all the trade unions in Alaska and America because they know  they are going to get the jobs from the build-out of this  infrastructure bill.   Now, one of the things the bill had that I thought was actually  really important--it was something I worked on in the Environment and  Public Works Committee--were provisions to streamline our Federal  permitting system to be able to get infrastructure projects deployed  and built. That was a big element of this bill--not as much as I  wanted, but certainly a good start.   This has been an issue I have been working on since my time here in  the Senate. It is a bipartisan issue, as the Presiding Officer knows.  When you talk to mayors and Governors in America anywhere--it doesn't  matter what party they are--they want the ability to have the Federal  Government permit infrastructure projects so we can move them out. That  is not controversial.   And here is the thing. As a country, we used to be really good at  building stuff--building stuff on time, building stuff that is  impressive. Just to give you a few examples--I think a lot of people  know this--but our country used to be the envy of the world building  great projects responsibly, efficiently, and on time. The Pentagon was  built in 16 months. The Empire State Building was built in 1 year 45  days. With the 1,500-mile Alaska-Canadian Highway--what we call the  ALCAN Highway, connecting the lower 48 all the way through Canada up  into Alaska, 1,500 miles--it took 8 months to do that. So we know how  to do this as a country.    Let's fast-forward to today. A new U.S. highway construction project,  to build a highway, usually takes 9 to 19 years. That is according to  the GAO. Let me just give you a couple of examples of those.   The Gross Reservoir in Colorado, which is going to offer clean water  to the people of Colorado, has taken two decades of planning and  permitting. To expand the Gross Reservoir northwest of Denver has taken  two decades--20 years--to get this important project in Colorado  permitted.   The California bullet train project was approved in the late 1990s.  It is still not built. Its costs, because of permitting delays, have  gone from $33 billion to $105 billion.   The Mountain Valley Pipeline in Virginia and West Virginia began in  2015 to bring natural gas. There are only 20 miles left to complete. It  might not ever be completed because of permitting delays. The Federal  courts are delaying, delaying, and delaying energy projects.   The Kensington mine in Alaska, which now employs over 400 people--it  is a gold mine with an average wage, by the way, of over $100,000, the  average wage--took 20 years to permit if you include the litigation.  The list goes on and on and on.   When NEPA was originally passed, the EIS, the environmental impact  statement, was to take less than a year. It usually took less than a  year and was usually a couple hundred pages. Now the average EIS takes  4 to 6 years to complete on any project in America, and it usually  costs several millions of dollars. We are killing ourselves as a  country in our ability to build or to not build infrastructure  projects.   What did we do in the infrastructure bill? It was bipartisan. We  worked together and put together some pretty good permitting reform  provisions. They are not nearly as good as I would have wanted them,  but they were pretty good, pretty good, to get the infrastructure that  is in this bill--roads; bridges; ports; yes, energy projects of  pipelines for oil and gas, which we need--built quickly or at least in  a reasonable amount of time, not in 20 years.   So here is the mystery. That all happened. The President said he  liked it. The unions really liked it. The building trades--the men and  women who build stuff in this country--liked it. I have worked with  Terry O'Sullivan, the great leader of the Laborers, on permitting  reform--this very issue. We have got some good things in there. So what  is the mystery?   Here is the mystery: After all of this work and the President touting  the infrastructure bill and our getting ready to build and having good  impacts in terms of natural gas, not just on environment and emissions  but in continuing to make us the global leader, the White House set out  new rules in April, under NEPA, for infrastructure projects.   What did they do? They made the NEPA rules much harder to actually  build infrastructure, not just for oil and gas, but it targeted oil and  gas. This is for all infrastructure--roads, bridges, ports, renewable  projects, LNG projects, natural gas projects.   The White House put out new NEPA rules rescinding the Trump  administration's rules, which were quite good and similar to some of  the reforms we got in the infrastructure bill, and everybody knows that  these White House rules are going to delay infrastructure projects. Why  in the heck would we do that as a country? We just passed a big  infrastructure bill with permitting reform in it, and somebody over at  the White House said: No, let's make it harder.   Here is an editorial from the Wall Street Journal that talks about  the infrastructure NEPA regs. It is called: ``How to Kill American  Infrastructure on the Sly. The White House revises  [[Page S2886]]  NEPA rules that will scuttle [the ability to build] new roads, bridges  and oil and gas pipelines.''   (Ms. CORTEZ MASTO assumed the Chair.)   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record this editorial.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From The Wall Street Journal, April 20, 2022]               How To Kill American Infrastructure on the Sly                (By The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board)         Americans are going to need a split-screen for the Biden       Administration's policy contradictions. Even as the President       on Tuesday promoted the bipartisan infrastructure bill he       signed last November, the White House moved to make it harder       to build roads, bridges and, of course, oil and natural-gas       pipelines.        The White House Council on Environmental Quality is       revising rules under the National Environmental Policy Act       for permitting major construction projects. CEQ Chair Brenda       Mallory says the changes will ``provide regulatory       certainty'' and ``reduce conflict.'' Instead, they will cause       more litigation and delays that raise construction costs, if       they don't kill projects outright.        NEPA requires federal agencies to review the environmental       impact of major projects that are funded by the feds or       require a federal permit. Reviews can take years and run       thousands of pages, covering the smallest potential impact on       species, air or water quality. Project developers can be       forced to mitigate these effects by, say, relocating species.        While the 1970 law was intended to prevent environmental       disasters, it has become a weapon to block development. The       Trump Administration sought to fast-track projects by       limiting NEPA reviews to environmental effects that are       directly foreseeable--e.g., how a pipeline's construction       would affect a stream it crosses.        Some liberal judges, however, have interpreted NEPA broadly       to require the study of effects that indirectly result from a       project such as CO2 emissions. Now the Biden Administration       is mandating this. CEQ's new rule will require agencies to       calculate the ``indirect'' and ``cumulative impacts'' that       ``can result from individually minor but collectively       significant actions taking place over a period of time.''       This means death by a thousand regulatory cuts for many       projects.        The Transportation Department will likely have to examine       how a highway expansion could increase greenhouse-gas       emissions in concert with new warehouses. The Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission might have to calculate how a new       pipeline would affect emissions from upstream production and       downstream consumption.        Wait--didn't FERC recently walk back its policy to do       exactly this? The White House is thumbing its nose at West       Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who blasted FERC's now-suspended       policy for shutting ``down the infrastructure we desperately       need as a country.''        The rule's obvious intent is to make it harder to build       pipelines, roads and other infrastructure that would enable       more U.S. oil and gas production, even as the Administration       makes phony gestures to reduce energy prices. Last Friday the       Administration announced it would comply with a court order       to hold oil and gas lease sales on public land. Those leases       won't matter if energy companies can't get federal permits       for rights-of-way.        While fossil fuels may be the rule's political target,       don't be surprised if green energy is snagged in this trip-      wire. Environmental groups have used NEPA to block new       mineral mines and transmission lines that connect distant       renewable energy sources to population centers. In this       Administration, the left hand doesn't seem to know what the       far left hand is doing.     So the new rules come out. They are clearly meant to  kill infrastructure, especially oil and gas but kind of everything. The  President is touting this infrastructure bill as one of his big  achievements. It was bipartisan. A number of us, myself included, voted  for it, but there is somebody out there who is trying to make sure the  infrastructure doesn't get built. Hmm. That is the mystery. That is the  mystery. Who would do that? Well, heck. I am trying to find the answer  because I really care about this issue--permitting reform--in order to  get infrastructure projects built. My State has been ground zero about  projects being delayed. So who is it?   So I am starting to ask around the White House. Secretary Granholm  was testifying in front of the Armed Services Committee 2 weeks ago.   I raised this issue with her: Madam Secretary, who the heck is doing  it? Are you?   Senator, I didn't know anything about this CQ rule.   It is a little surprising. I mean, there was a lot about energy, but  that is what she said in the hearing. Go take a look at it. I believe  her. I don't think she was pushing to delay infrastructure.   Would it be the Secretary of Labor, Marty Walsh? He is a former  laborer, a LIUNA guy, right? I supported Marty Walsh strongly because I  talked to him before his confirmation about--Hey, look. There is a  group in the White House who hates energy even though it has great  jobs, and there are some in the White House who think that they want to  help the building trades build stuff. If you are with that group, Marty  Walsh, I will support you as Secretary of Labor. He said he was. So I  don't think it is he.   As a matter of fact, when these regs came out, the Laborers'  International put out a statement, saying:         Once again, communities in need of vital infrastructure and       the hard-working men and women who build America will be       waiting as project details are subjected to onerous reviews       [by these new rules].    This is the Laborers' International. The men and women who build  stuff are not happy about this new NEPA rule.         Americans will continue to bear the expense of NEPA-related       delays, which cost taxpayers millions of dollars annually.       Lengthy review processes and unpredictable legal challenges       [will result from these new NEPA regs. They will have] a       chilling impact on private investment in infrastructure.    Of course, when we need energy, these new NEPA rules will make it  harder for Americans to get energy, and the price of energy is going to  continue to go like this: on the backs of working families.   So was it the Secretary of Labor pushing this? I doubt it. I doubt  it.   Who was it?   Well, as I have said on the floor of the U.S. Senate many times  before, if there is something bad happening to the national interests  of our country either domestically or internationally, it is probably  not farfetched to assume John Kerry is near it. There is nobody in the  Biden administration who so regularly tries to undermine America's  national interests than John Kerry's kowtowing to the Chinese Communist  Party or kissing up to Iranian terrorists. When Putin began his  barbaric invasion of Ukraine, John Kerry publicly voiced his first  concerns not about people dying and not about a democracy being overrun  by a dictator; it was how Vladimir Putin might take his eye off his  climate change goals.   This is embarrassing as Americans. He is a senior official. Now, he  has no power in terms of being confirmed by the Senate. Yes, he is a  former Secretary of State and a former Senator, but on these issues, he  is so out of touch with the average American.   So who was pushing these new NEPA rules to delay energy projects for  America? It is the big mystery. Heck, I don't even think it was the  President. He seems proud of this infrastructure bill. He has told all  of the unions he wants them to get to work and build, but now we have a  new rule that is going to delay the building of infrastructure.    The mystery is solved. The mystery is solved.   This is a headline from a TIME magazine news story that just came out  yesterday of John Kerry saying:         ``We Have to Push Back Hard'' on Efforts to Build New       [Energy] Infrastructure in Response to Rising Gas Prices.    We have to push back hard. You can't make this stuff up. This is the  guy. This is the guy. So we have a new bunch of Federal rules right  now, driven by this guy--and probably Gina McCarthy--who want to drive  up energy prices and make it harder for infrastructure to be built,  which is exactly what this will do. Nobody is even arguing against  that. It will drive up energy prices on the backs of working-class  Americans, and now he is out publicly saying that we have got to do  it--stop infrastructure.   We have this new revisionism suggesting we have to be producing more  energy. Well, yes, we do. It is amazing. You never know whose side this  guy is on, but he is not on America's side, I will tell you that.   So this is a new regulation, a NEPA reg. We have the authority here  in Congress to use what is called a Congressional Review Act, a CRA. We  have the power, when a new reg comes out, to say: No, we don't like  that in the Senate. We are going to have a vote, a Congressional Review  Act vote, on whether to rescind an amendment that is clearly driven by  this guy--a regulation by  [[Page S2887]]  this guy--that will delay energy projects; that will delay renewable  projects; that will make sure Americans continue to pay record high  energy prices.   So we are going to have a vote on that. I plan on bringing that  resolution to the floor soon. It is a privileged resolution, so we will  get a vote whether Majority Leader Schumer wants to vote on it or not.   I am assuming the President will like my CRA because he can't want  delays to his infrastructure bill. He can't want delays to getting  energy relief for American families. This guy does, right? So we are  going to have a little test, and we will have another mystery solved  here on the Senate floor.   Two weeks ago, in the Commerce Committee, I had a little debate with  a couple of my colleagues, friends of mine, but I made a statement,  which I think is very true. It is certainly true in my State, and it is  this: At the national level, my Democratic colleagues, when they have a  choice between supporting guys like this and his radical environmental  allies and the working men and women of America who want to build  stuff, they always choose him and his allies.   My colleagues--some of them--really got upset: How can you say that,  Dan? That is not true.   Well, it is true in Alaska. I see it every day.   So my CRA is going to just ask a simple question: Whom are you for?  Whom do you stand with? Do you stand with the American working  families, the laborers, the people who build the infrastructure that we  need, the families who are suffering from high energy costs or this guy  and his radical environmental ally and special interests who have a lot  of power in this White House and who are clearly behind this reg that I  am trying to rescind to make it harder to build infrastructure,  especially American energy infrastructure?   For my colleagues who say no, we are with the working men and women  of America--we will see. We will see. I hope you vote with me to  rescind this reg that is only harming our country, only harming working  families, only harming working Americans, and promotes the radical,  out-of-touch agenda of John Kerry, Gina McCarthy, and the far-left,  woke environmental interests that they answer to. It is going to be an  interesting vote, and the American people are going to be watching.   I yield the floor.
