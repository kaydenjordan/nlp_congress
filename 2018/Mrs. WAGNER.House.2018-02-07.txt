 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1153, the Mortgage Choice Act,  provides needed clarity to the calculation of points and fees for  qualified mortgages, or QM, especially for those companies affiliated  with real estate brokers.   Established under the ability-to-repay/QM section of the Truth in  Lending Act, H.R. 1153 would amend the definition of points and fees  and allow more loans to qualify, thus increasing choices for all  borrowers.    Chairman Huizenga's bipartisan legislation does not create a QM  loophole like some would argue. Instead, H.R. 1153 rightly attempts to  level the playing field, regardless of whether the lender is affiliated  with a title agency or not.   In addition, H.R. 1153 does not allow high-cost loans to qualify as  QMs. By allowing loans with the same points and fees to be treated  equally under the law, Chairman Huizenga's bill corrects one of the  many flaws of the post-Dodd-Frank era.   Thanks to the Mortgage Choice Act, it will now be easier for low- and  moderate-income Americans to buy a home. I commend my colleague,  Chairman Huizenga, for his bipartisan work on this issue, and I urge  all Members to support this legislation.
