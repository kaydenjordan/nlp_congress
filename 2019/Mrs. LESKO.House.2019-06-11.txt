 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H. Res. 430.   It is disappointing that we are here again debating a measure that  will have absolutely no impact on the lives of our constituents.  Instead of fixing pressing issues like the security and humanitarian  crisis at our southern border, the Democrats continue their focus on  influencing the 2020 election at taxpayer expense. Americans are tired  of this witch hunt.   For nearly 2 years, Democrats claimed that the President colluded  with the Russians to interfere in the 2016 Presidential election. After  22 months, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 warrants, 40 FBI agents, and spending  $35 million, Special Counsel Mueller concluded there was no collusion  between President Trump and Russia and did not charge him with  obstruction.   Yet, my Democratic colleagues continue to attempt to undermine the  President of the United States because, all I can think of is, they  haven't accepted the fact that he won the election. It is clear to me  that the Democrats are trying to influence the 2020 Presidential  election at taxpayer expense.   Americans have real problems that we can and should be tackling  instead. In May, the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended a jaw-dropping  133,000 people at our southern border. That is only the people they  caught. Yet, we are here debating subpoenas targeting the President,  probably because it will provide Democrats free airtime.   This unprecedented resolution should not even be on the House floor  today. It has never been done before in the entire history of the  United States.   The House has only sued for documents twice before. In both cases,  the individuals in question were first found in contempt of Congress at  both the committee level and by the full House. This has not happened  here.   On top of that, the relevant subpoenas seek material that includes  grand jury materials that, by law, cannot be made public. The Democrats  are asking Attorney General Barr to violate the law.   When my colleagues and I tried to improve this resolution, the  Democrats blocked us at every turn.   I offered an amendment that would let the American people know how  much money this resolution would cost taxpayers. Democrats blocked it.  Republicans offered amendments to prevent taxpayer money from going to  lobbyists, to disclose contracts with lawyers, and to disclose where  this taxpayer money was coming from to fund this witch hunt. Democrats  blocked each and every one.   One amendment in particular highlights the partisan political, media- grabbing motives of this resolution. Republicans offered an amendment  requiring the Judiciary Committee chairman to certify that he made a  good faith effort to negotiate with the Attorney General, but the  Democrats blocked that amendment, too.   The Attorney General has been transparent, and the Department of  Justice has attempted numerous accommodations, including just yesterday  when the Department of Justice agreed to let members of the committee  view an unredacted report excluding grand jury material, which, by law,  cannot be released.                                time  1430    But even as the Attorney General has attempted to work with the  Committee on the Judiciary, Chairman Nadler has moved at unprecedented  speed, moving from a demand for an unredacted report to subpoena to  this resolution in a matter of mere weeks. From the Democrats' actions  and prior statements, it is difficult not to view the purpose of this  resolution and this debate as anything but political.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins), ranking member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is my fellow Judiciary Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), our Republican leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline), a fellow Judiciary Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Committee on the Judiciary is one of the most  venerable in the House of Representatives, and I am honored to have  been selected to join its ranks.   It has jurisdiction over intellectual property, during a time of  exponential scientific breakthroughs. It has jurisdiction over election  interference, during a time when we are concerned about Russians  interfering with our election. It has jurisdiction over immigration  issues, during a time of an unprecedented security and humanitarian  crisis on our southern border.   I am disappointed to see how the Democratic majority has chosen to  waste this authority. I am disappointed to see that it has chosen to  ignore its responsibilities to the American people in favor of sound  bites and photo ops.   Instead of legislating, the Democratic majority prefers posing with  buckets of fried chicken for the national media in crude attempts to  undermine our President and his administration.   Really?   It is time to move on and tackle the real issues that Americans care  about.   The American people elected us, they elected me, to Congress to get  things done. Let us secure the border. Let us improve healthcare. Let  us improve education.   Let us stop this political theater that happens meeting after meeting  and hearing after hearing in multiple committees in what I believe is a  blatant attempt to influence the 2020 presidential election using  taxpayer resources.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have left and  how much time the other side has left?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to use my 1 minute to actually refute these  blatant allegations and fantasies, I believe, by my fellow Democrats,  and that is how somehow the President and the Department of Justice has  been stonewalling them.   Let me go over the timelines really quick.   On March 22, the Attorney General immediately notified the chairmen  and the ranking members of the House and Senate Committees on Judiciary  that they had received the confidential report from the special  counsel.  [[Page H4422]]    The next day, the Attorney General informed Congress of the special  counsel's principal conclusions.   March 29, he updated the Congress on what could be done and what  redactions had to be made.   Then on April 18, less than a month after receiving it, the Attorney  General made the redacted confidential report available to Congress and  the entire public.   The same day, the Attorney General released the confidential report  and made the minimally-redacted version of the confidential report  available for review.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
