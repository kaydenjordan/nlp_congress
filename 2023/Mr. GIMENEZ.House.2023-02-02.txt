 Madam Speaker, anti-Semitism has no place on the Foreign  Affairs Committee. I will say it again: Anti-Semitism has no place on  the Foreign Affairs Committee.   That is why Representative Omar has no place specifically on the  Foreign Affairs Committee, where Israel's security is one of the issues  of critical importance.   Without a doubt, the democratic Jewish State of Israel is America's  strongest ally in the Middle East and has a fundamental right to exist.   Representative Omar has repeated anti-Semitic canards and perpetuated  hateful tropes against the Jewish community. Her comments have  compromised the ability of the House Foreign Affairs Committee to  conduct its official business.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in the affirmative to  remove Representative Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.                                time  1145
