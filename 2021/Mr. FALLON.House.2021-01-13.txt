 Madam Speaker, last summer, the antifa and BLM riots  swept all over our country. Cities were burned, businesses destroyed,  and lives violently stolen. And it wasn't just for an afternoon, like  those horrible hours we had on January 6; but rather, they went for  weeks and, in some cases, even months.   So if there is any silver lining in this dark cloud, it is that our  friends from across the aisle have come to realize that riots are bad.  We conservatives have known this all along.   This snap impeachment is a sham and it didn't go through the  Committee on the Judiciary. It is not even about the President's actual  words, but it is about how our Democratic colleagues want to interpret  his words and fashion a particular meaning to them.   Now, this is just political grandstanding at its worst. The American  people desperately want us to move on and tackle the issues and find  solutions to them forthwith.   Madam Speaker, let's end this obsession and charade and let's get to  work.
