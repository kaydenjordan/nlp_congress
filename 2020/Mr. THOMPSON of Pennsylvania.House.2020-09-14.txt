 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Lieutenant Merle T. Schall.   Lieutenant Schall was a member of the United States Navy from  Elderton, Pennsylvania.   On the evening of November 6, 1943, at approximately 2200 hours,  Lieutenant Schall took off for what would be his final journey.   His plane was shot down while serving as cover and guidance for a  ship below in the Pacific Ocean as he and his fellow Navy men  approached Bougainville Island in an effort to regain control from the  Japanese who had invaded the island the year before.   Sadly, Lieutenant Schall did not survive. On Wednesday, August 26, I  had the pleasure and honor of meeting Michael, Lieutenant Schall's  nephew, at the Indiana County Courthouse in my district. I was pleased  to present Michael with his uncle's much-deserved medals. Lieutenant  Schall is a recipient of a Purple Heart, Air Medal, American Defense  Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal,  World War II Victory Medal, the Honorable Service Lapel Pin, and the  Gold Star Lapel Button.   It was an honor to celebrate his service and his life that he  sacrificed to this country at the Indiana Courthouse that day.                            ____________________
