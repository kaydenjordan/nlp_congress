 Madam Speaker, I was grateful to attend  the joint session of Congress today to hear directly from the valiant  Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He is a world hero for  freedom and democracy.   Courageous Ukrainians will always be cherished as they protect rule  of law over rule by gun by authoritarians in a worldwide conflict.   On Tuesday, President Zelenskyy clarified the war is not against  Russian citizens. Putin is the mass murderer. President Zelenskyy  called for Russian soldiers to surrender, and I have offered a  bipartisan bill in Congress to reward Russian defectors with expedited  refugee status to the United States, with up to $100,000 for Russian  equipment turned over to Ukraine.   In the congressional address today, President Zelenskyy cited Mount  Rushmore for its busts of American Founders, and I have a bipartisan  bill in Congress for a bust of President Zelenskyy to be placed in the  U.S. Capitol, in the tradition of Churchill, Havel, and Kossuth.   God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live President Zelenskyy.                            ____________________
