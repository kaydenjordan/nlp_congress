 Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my heartfelt  congratulations to the 2022 National Teacher of the Year, Kurt Russell.   Mr. Russell teaches at Oberlin High School in Oberlin, Ohio. He is a  25-year veteran of the classroom.   Kurt Russell was first inspired to become a teacher in middle school  when he encountered his first Black male teacher.   In addition to his classroom and extracurricular duties, Kurt is the  head coach for the school's varsity basketball team. He sees basketball  as an extension of the classroom and a place where young people can  learn about working together and how to handle both adversity and  success.   He provides an inclusive and safe environment for studying diverse  groups and encouraging all students' voices to be heard.   Now, as the 2022 National Teacher of the Year, he plans to advocate  for classrooms to better reflect the students within them.    Mr. Russell joins his cohort of National Teachers of the Year from  every State and territory this week in Washington, D.C., to celebrate  their achievement, the profession, and their dedication to students.   As a fellow National Teacher of the Year, I offer my heartfelt  congratulations to the entire cohort and all the teachers who are being  recognized this week.                            ____________________
