SEC. 7. PROTECTING PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.         Any personal identifying information collected or stored       through the activities authorized in this Act shall be done       in accordance with section 690 of title 45, Code of Federal       Regulations (relating to the protection of human subjects),       or any successor regulation.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 847, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 847, the Promoting  Digital Privacy Technologies Act.   The 21st century has ushered in the era of hyper-internet  utilization, the gig economy of nearly everything.   Americans are online. Practically any digital action that internet  users take--from social media to shopping online to browsing news or  using email--creates data that is stored by companies or organizations.  More and more data about each of us is being generated faster and  faster each day. In fact, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are generated  nearly every day. Ninety percent of the world's data was created in  just the last 2 years alone.   Companies can use, share, or sell data they collect since most of the  data economy is invisible--Americans are not able to see this constant  flow of their information, but the more modern digital economy is  fueled by personal data.   Unfortunately, there are few processes that can enable the productive  use of personal data while also protecting the privacy and  confidentiality of the people to whom that data is linked.   A 2019 survey by the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration found that 73 percent of U.S. households have  significant concerns about online privacy and security risks. I hear it  from my own constituents all throughout Oakland County, Michigan.   There are tremendous opportunities to capture the benefits of data,  including for safer roads, improved public health, and better  educational outcomes. However, in any use of personal data, we have the  ability and the necessity to ensure privacy and confidentiality. Form  and function, my friends. One key way to achieve that is through the  development of the privacy-enhancing technologies, or PETs.   PETs are a broad range of technologies that allow organizations to  collect, share, and use data while mitigating the privacy risks that  arise from those activities. The goal is to make these systems that use  personal information private by default, opening up those data to a  wide range of researchers who would otherwise not have access.  [[Page H4729]]    These technologies have the potential to enable broader use of  Federal data sets, as privacy risks are often the greatest barrier to  open government data efforts. We recognize the untapped potential and  opportunity for the United States of America to lead here. The  technology itself for PETs is still immature and not necessarily ready  for widespread use.   My bill, H.R. 847, the Promoting Digital Privacy Technologies Act,  supports research, workforce development, standard setting, and  government coordination for PETs.   H.R. 847 directs the National Science Foundation to conduct  fundamental privacy research that can help improve these technologies,  assess their limitations, and broaden their applicability. This bill  also directs the National Science Foundation to support workforce  development activities in order to help address the growing shortage of  privacy professionals across the United States of America.   H.R. 847 also supports activities at the National Institute of  Standards and Technology to facilitate the development of standards and  best practices for integration of PETs in the public and private  sectors. This is the best of government in action, my friends.   Finally, H.R. 847 directs the White House Office of Science and  Technology Policy to coordinate Federal activities to accelerate the  development of PETs across government.   Congress has been debating different proposals for privacy  legislation, as we know, for many, many years. I remain hopeful and  optimistic that we will get something done. In the meantime, the  Promoting Digital Privacy Technologies Act will help ensure that we  have the necessary tools to fully implement privacy legislation without  stifling innovation. It is high time that we research ways in which  privacy-enhancing technologies can be utilized to protect Americans'  most sensitive and personal data.                                time  1430    I also thank my colleagues--this has been a bipartisan effort-- Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, as well as Senator Catherine Cortez Masto  and Senator Deb Fischer, for working with me to develop this  legislation last year. I also thank our stakeholders whose feedback  helped strengthen this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 847, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague in encouraging Members of this  legislative body to support H.R. 847. I recognize that privacy- enhancing technologies are an innovation opportunity for the United  States of America. The role that the National Institute of Standards  and Technology will play with this legislation will convene industry  stakeholders and nonprofit groups to a standard set, which is certainly  welcome by many, and will also ensure us the ability to continue to  succeed and compete in years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5324) to provide guidance for and investment in the upgrade  and modernization of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration Weather Radio All Hazards network, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5324         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``NOAA Weather Radio       Modernization Act of 2021'' or ``NWR Modernization Act of       2021''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         (a) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the       Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and       Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric       Administration.        (b) NOAA Weather Radio.--The term ``NOAA Weather Radio''       means the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration       Weather Radio All Hazards network.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The NOAA Weather Radio is a nationwide network of       transmitters that are critical to protecting life and       property by broadcasting weather and other hazard alerts.        (2) NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts currently reach 95       percent of the United States population.        (3) NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts originate from all       National Weather Service Offices, but are only available via       a receiver located in sufficient proximity to a radio       transmitting tower.        (4) There are limited options to obtain NOAA Weather Radio       broadcasts via the Internet or mobile device application,       which are provided by volunteer mechanisms obtaining the       audio feed in an ad hoc manner.        (5) NOAA Weather Radio should provide equal access and       availability to unimpeded broadcasts of weather and non-      weather hazards to every person located within the United       States, its territories, and tribal lands.       SEC. 4. UPGRADING EXISTING SYSTEMS.         (a) In General.--The Administrator shall, to the maximum       extent practicable, expand coverage of the NOAA Weather Radio       and ensure its reliability. In doing so, the Administrator       shall--        (1) maintain support for existing systems serving areas not       covered by or having poor quality cellular service;  [[Page H4730]]         (2) ensure consistent maintenance and operations       monitoring, with timely repairs to broadcast transmitter site       equipment and antennas; and        (3) enhance the ability to amplify Non-Weather Emergency       Messages via NOAA Weather Radio as necessary.

(c) Expanding Access.--As part of the activities in this       section, the Administrator shall acquire additional       transmitters as required to expand coverage to rural and       underserved communities, national parks, and recreation       areas.       SEC. 5. MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE.         (a) In General.--In parallel to the activities under       section 4, the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent       practicable, enhance NOAA Weather Radio to ensure its       capabilities and coverage remain valuable to the public. In       carrying out these activities, the Administrator shall--        (1) upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure to       accelerate the transition of broadcasts to Internet Protocol-      based communications over non-copper media;        (2) accelerate software upgrades to the Advanced Weather       Interactive Processing System, or the relevant system       successors, in order to implement partial county       notifications and alerts;        (3) consult with relevant stakeholders, including the       private sector, to enhance accessibility and usability of       NOAA Weather Radio data and feeds;        (4) develop options, including, but not limited to,       satellite backup capability and commercial provider       partnerships for NOAA Weather Radio continuity in the event       of Weather Forecast Office outages;        (5) research and develop alternative options, including,       but not limited to, microwave capabilities, to transmit NOAA       Weather Radio signals to transmitters that are remote or do       not have IP capability; and        (6) transition critical applications to the Integrated       Dissemination Program, or the relevant program successors.        (b) Priority.--In carrying out the objectives described in       subsection (a), the Administrator shall prioritize practices,       capabilities, and technologies recommended by the assessment       in subsection (c), to maximize accessibility, particularly in       remote and underserved areas of the country.        (c) Assessment for Management and Distribution.--Not later       than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the       Administrator shall complete an assessment of access to NOAA       Weather Radio. In conducting such an assessment, the       Administrator shall take into consideration and provide       recommendations on--        (1) the need for continuous, adequate, and operational       real-time broadcasts of the NOAA Weather Radio in both urban       and rural areas;        (2) solicited inputs from relevant stakeholders on the       compatibility of NOAA Weather Radio data for third party       platforms that provide online services, such as websites and       mobile device applications, or deliver NOAA Weather Radio       access;        (3) existing or new management systems, which promote       consistent, efficient, and compatible access to NOAA Weather       Radio;        (4) the ability of NOAA to aggregate real time broadcast       feeds at one or more central locations;        (5) effective interagency coordination;        (6) the potential effects of an electromagnetic pulse or       geomagnetic disturbance on NOAA Weather Radio; and        (7) any other function the Administrator deems necessary.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to carry out this section $40,000,000 to       remain available until expended.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 5324, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I voice my support for this bipartisan legislation led by Ranking  Member Bice and Chairwoman Sherrill of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee's Environment Subcommittee. The NWR Modernization  Act of 2021 will direct NOAA to undertake various updates to the NOAA  Weather Radio. NOAA Weather Radio serves as a consistent and reliable  source of weather forecasts, warnings, and watches from the National  Weather Service to communities across America--something that is all  too palpable to Americans today given the rise of extreme weather  incidents.   Because of its broad reach and continuous coverage, NOAA Weather  Radio also provides information related to natural disasters and other  hazardous, nonweather events. In order to ensure that NOAA Weather  Radio can continue to provide reliable, life-saving information, it is  vital to ensure the system is upgraded to reflect the modern era. This  bill requires NOAA to require more transmitters and update vital  software and telecommunications infrastructure to support operation of  NOAA Weather Radio and enhance its transmission of nonweather emergency  messages. These updates should help to expand NOAA Weather Radio  coverage to ensure all communities, especially underserved rural  communities, receive these critical alerts.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will provide benefits to many across this  incredible country. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its  passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will to take a moment to reflect. The Congresswoman  from Oklahoma mentioned something that I believe is important to  reiterate, which is that the technology adoptions occurred before the  iPhone. Last June, in Oakland County, Michigan, the city of Farmington  and Farmington Hills experienced an extreme weather event otherwise  known as a supercell. This is rapid winds at a high level, multiple-- hundreds of feet, sometimes up in the air, ripping large trees from  their roots. It was very destructive. There was no warning. It  terrified residents of my district.   We also reflect that in Mason City, Iowa, just last month, there was  a major tornado that blew through, again, without warning. So this is  very real and palpable to the American people.   I again recognize the leadership of the Congresswoman from New Jersey  (Ms. Sherrill), who is the subcommittee chair of the Environment  Subcommittee, for her leadership, along with the Congresswoman from  Oklahoma (Mrs. Bice) for bringing us this very critical bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, NOAA Weather Radio is absolutely essential.  We have a bill to modernize it. The American people need it now.   H.R. 5324, the NWR Modernization Act of 2021, has my full support. I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 66) to require the Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal  Blooms and Hypoxia to develop a plan for reducing, mitigating, and  controlling harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in South Florida, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 66         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``South Florida Clean Coastal       Waters Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. SOUTH FLORIDA HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS AND HYPOXIA                     ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLAN.         (a) In General.--The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia       Research and Control Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-383; 33       U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) is amended--        (1) by redesignating sections 605 through 609 as sections       606 through 610, respectively; and        (2) by inserting after section 604 the following:       ``SEC. 605.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 66, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 66, the South Florida Clean  Coastal Waters Act of 2021.   The South Florida region suffers from blooms of harmful algae in both  its fresh and marine bodies of water. The impacts of marine red tide  and freshwater blue-green algae in this region are felt in marine life,  across the local economy, and on public health.   When these algae blooms die and sink to the bottom of water bodies,  they can cause hypoxia or low oxygen events, which further impact  marine and freshwater ecosystems.   This bill authorizes a scientific assessment and action plan to  address the negative impacts of harmful algal blooms, HABs, and hypoxia  in South Florida.   We know that many Michiganders enjoy the splendors of South Florida  in the winter season. We have had this reported from colleagues from  Florida. We are supporting this bill because this work can serve as a  template for other communities suffering from HABs and hypoxia and help  address these disruptive events.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, April 29, 2022.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chair, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Johnson: In recognition of the goal of       expediting consideration of S.66, the ``South Florida Clean       Coastal Waters Act of 2021,'' the Committee on Natural       Resources agrees to waive formal consideration of the bill as       to provisions that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Natural Resources.        The Committee on Natural Resources takes this action with       the mutual understanding that, in doing so, we do not waive       any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining-issues within our jurisdiction. Our Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation.        I also ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this       matter be included in the Congressional Record. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward       to continuing to work with you as this measure moves through       the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,      Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.                                   ____                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, April 29, 2022.      Chairman Raul M. Grijalva,      Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva, I am writing to you concerning S.       66, the ``South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2021,''       which was passed by the Senate on March 8, 2022.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       bill. I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural       Resources. I acknowledge that your committee will waive       further consideration of S. 66 and that this action is not a       waiver of future jurisdictional claims by the Committee on       Natural Resources over this subject matter.        I will make sure to include our exchange of letters in the       Congressional Record and will support the appointment of the       Committee on Natural Resource conferees during any House-      Senate conference. Thank you for your cooperation on this       legislation.            Sincerely,                                             Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                                        Chairwoman.     Madam Speaker, for those watching at home, a friendly  reminder that S. 66 passed the House last session of Congress, the  116th Congress. We are now in the 117th Congress. We will pass this  bill again. That is our intention, to send it over to the Senate yet  again to get it passed and signed into law.   As a friendly reminder, the House Science, Space, and Technology  Committee oversees and has jurisdiction over the Harmful Algal Bloom  and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, which is why we are passing it  through not only our committee but, obviously, here on the House floor.   Madam Speaker, yet again, I join my colleagues in urging the passage  of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I note that, with this bill, the task  force to develop an action plan based on an integrated assessment that  details methods for reducing, mitigating, and controlling HABs and  hypoxia in South Florida is obviously essential.   This is an interagency effort involving the State, local and Tribal  governments, as well as non-Federal stakeholder groups. I urge the  passage of S. 66.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7077) to require the United States Fire Administration to  conduct on-site investigations of major fires, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7077         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering the U.S. Fire       Administration Act''.       SEC. 2. FIRE INVESTIGATIONS.         The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15       U.S.C. 2201 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SEC. 38. INVESTIGATION AUTHORITIES.         ``(a) In General.--In the case of any major fire, the       Administrator may send incident investigators, which may       include safety specialists, fire protection engineers, codes       and standards experts, researchers, and fire training       specialists, to the site of the fire to conduct an       investigation as described in subsection (b).        ``(b) Investigation Required.--A fire investigation       conducted under this section--        ``(1) shall be conducted in coordination and cooperation       with appropriate Federal, State, and local authorities,       including Federal agencies that are authorized to investigate       a major fire or an incident of which the major fire is a       part; and        ``(2) shall examine the determined cause and origin of the       fire and assess broader systematic matters to include use of       codes and standards, demographics, structural       characteristics, smoke and fire dynamics (movement) during       the event, and costs of associated injuries and deaths.        ``(c) Report.--Upon concluding any fire investigation under       this section, the Administrator shall issue a public report       to local, State, and Federal authorities on the findings of       such investigation, or collaborate with another investigating       Federal agency on that agency's report, including       recommendations on--        ``(1) any other buildings with similar characteristics that       may bear similar fire risks;        ``(2) improving tactical response to similar fires;        ``(3) improving civilian safety practices;        ``(4) assessing the costs and benefits to the community of       adding fire safety features; and        ``(5) how to mitigate the causes of such fire.        ``(d) Discretionary Authority.--In addition to       investigations conducted pursuant to subsection (a), the       Administrator may send fire investigators to conduct       investigations at the site of any fire with unusual or       remarkable context that results in losses less severe than       those occurring as a result of a major fire, in coordination       with appropriate Federal, State, and local authorities,       including Federal agencies that are authorized to investigate       a major fire or an incident of which the major fire is a       part.        ``(e) Major Fire Defined.--For purposes of this section,       the term `major fire' shall have the meaning given such term       under regulations to be issued by the Administrator.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7077, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H4734]]    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7077, the Empowering  the U.S. Fire Administration Act.   Although fire loss has improved significantly over the past 25 years,  the fire problem in the United States of America remains serious and is  deserving of our attention and our legislative action.   The United States still has one of the highest fire death rates in  the industrialized world. It is clear we have work to do to prevent  these fires and, unfortunately, their deadly consequences.   According to FEMA, between 2017 and 2019, residential building fires  caused an estimated 2,770 deaths, 11,650 injuries, and $8.1 billion in  property loss.   In Michigan--and this is deeply personal to those of us in Oakland  County--we have recently experienced a significant rise in fire-related  deaths during 2022, just this year alone. According to the Bureau of  Fire Services, fire-related deaths across Michigan increased by 144  percent. Fires themselves are on the rise in the first month of 2022  alone compared to 2021.   Unfortunately, it was reported that these increased fires in Michigan  were all preventable, Madam Speaker, and that is why I am proud to be  joining my incredible colleague from New York, Congressman Torres,  today in supporting his legislation.   The Empowering the U.S. Fire Administration Act is part of a Federal  legislative package aimed at solving the underlying issues that cause  deadly fires.   H.R. 7077 is led by my friend and colleague, Congressman Ritchie  Torres. On January 9 of this year, a major fire occurred at the Twin  Parks North West apartment building in Representative Torres' district  in which 17 people, including 8 children, tragically lost their lives.   Following that, we experienced a less deadly fire, although  monumental, at Oakland Hills in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, in which  the second-largest wood frame structure caught on fire and nearly all  collapsed.   A key objective of the U.S. Fire Administration is to significantly  reduce the Nation's loss of life from fire while also achieving a  reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire.   This bill authorizes the U.S. Fire Administration to conduct onsite  investigations of major fires by authorizing the USFA to send incident  investigators to the site of a major fire.   This bill will more fully leverage the unique expertise of the USFA  to contribute to what we can learn from these fires to continue to  strengthen prevention going forward.                                time  1500    These catastrophes deserve Federal support. They hamper our local  fire departments. Our local residents deserve answers.   I mentioned the tragedy in my own region in February that the Oakland  Hills Country Club, a fixture that has been in our community for  generations, experienced. The 99-year-old clubhouse is one of the  oldest, all-wooden structures in Michigan and it was where I worked as  a hostess following my graduation from high school at Birmingham  Seaholm. I was saving up money for college. Thankfully, no one was  injured, but the Oakland County Sheriff recently forecasted that the  total fire investigation could take up to a full year to complete.   We must learn from these fires to inform efforts to prevent major  fires from occurring in the future, and the USFA is an important  component of these efforts. The agency is limited in its ability to  learn from these fires, as it currently lacks the authority to conduct  on-site investigations. This is what this bill will achieve.   It will unlock the expertise of Federal fire safety specialists and  engineers to coordinate and cooperate with local firefighter  investigators after a major fire incident in their community.   It authorizes the USFA to send their own experts to the site of a  major fire to conduct an on-site investigation in coordination and  cooperation with appropriate Federal, State, and local authorities. In  doing so, this bill more fully utilizes the agency's extensive  expertise to help learn from major fires and to help inform prevention  efforts in the future.   Additionally, this bill requires USFA to issue a public report on the  findings of the investigation to local, State, and Federal authorities.  This report would include recommendations on how to mitigate the causes  of the investigated fire, as well as buildings with similar  characteristics that may bear similar fire risks.   The sharing of national best practices is how we succeed as the  United States of America. If other Federal agencies, for example, NIST,  are also investigating the fire, the bill would encourage the agency to  collaborate on a comprehensive report and interagency effort. In fact,  collaboration with local, State, and other Federal authorities is a  central theme of this entire bill. We are just ensuring that USFA also  has the specific authorities it needs to carry out its mission.   I thank my colleague, Congressman Ritchie Torres, a freshman in this  body, for his fantastic leadership on this bill. I also recognize my  Science Committee colleagues, Congressman Peter Meijer from west  Michigan and Congressman Anthony Gonzalez from the State of Ohio.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join us in passing this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Torres).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  critical bill, H.R. 7077, a bill to empower the U.S. Fire  Administration to act in regard to the event of fires for investigative  purposes.   I also note that the Members who are supporting this bill not only  share a time zone but also share a generation and share a vision for  the future, a vision for the future of this country that utilizes the  best of government and interagency effort, government acting cohesively  together when needed, having the Federal Government come in and support  local fire departments in the wake of catastrophic fires.   This is quite palpable, Madam Speaker. The urgency to pass the bill,  H.R. 7077, could not be more palpable.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1437) to amend the Weather Research and Forecasting  Innovation Act of 2017 to direct the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration to provide comprehensive and regularly updated Federal  precipitation information, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1437         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on H.R. 1437, the bill now under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1437, the Providing  Research and Estimates of Changes in Precipitation, or PRECIP Act.   I commend Environment Subcommittee Chairwoman Sherrill of the Science  Committee on her work to bring the PRECIP Act to the House floor today.  This bipartisan bill is the result of significant stakeholder  engagement led by Congresswoman Sherrill of New Jersey.   Precipitation data is used by decisionmakers like dam safety  officials, flood plain managers, civil engineers, and Federal, State,  and local officials, to build resilient infrastructure, something we  care a lot about in this body, for communities.                                time  1515    The precipitation data is extremely important for Michiganians. This  is a huge reality for us, particularly in southeastern Michigan, after  record, record rainfall over the last year.   The Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessments organization  found that changes in precipitation in the Great Lakes region will lead  to more extreme precipitation events in the State of Michigan,  otherwise known as flooding, a reality all too probable to the Speaker  and myself, both hailing from southeast Michigan.   These extreme precipitation events can cause flooding and can also  affect lake levels, which could have severe economic and ecological  impacts across my home State of Michigan and certainly across the  country.   The PRECIP Act would help to modernize outdated precipitation data  across the country, and the bill also directs NOAA to update  precipitation data on a regular cadence. This will not only address  many precipitation estimates that are currently years, and sometimes  decades, out of date, it will also help local responders act when their  residents need them to. It will also help local elected officials  coordinate with the Federal agencies in responding to extreme  precipitation events. It will also ensure consistency in precipitation  estimates across the United States; as we know, precipitation events do  not respect State or regional boundaries.   As we are also anticipating an increase in frequency and intensity of  precipitation events due to the reality of climate change, it is  critical that this bill also requires NOAA to consider future climate  change while updating these precipitation estimates. This will ensure  that this data remains relevant for the future.   I am deeply proud to cosponsor this bill that has both bipartisan and  bicameral support. Its passage will positively impact all Americans,  and I urge my colleagues in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have seen Congresswoman Debbie Dingell  of Michigan's 12th District, in her waders, moving around her district,  including Dearborn, in flood-ridden neighborhoods. This is a crisis.   It is important to pass the PRECIP Act, as introduced by the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. Sherrill), co-led by the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).   This is a remarkable piece of legislation that will make a huge  difference to this country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 1437, the PRECIP Act, is  of great merit. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.
