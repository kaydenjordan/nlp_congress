 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Marine Corps  Junior ROTC program at Little Rock Catholic High School for raising  $20,500 toward the construction of a Gold Star families monument on the  State capital grounds in Little Rock.   The Catholic High School Marine Corps Junior ROTC unit is celebrating  its golden anniversary this year. The cadets were diligent in their  fundraising: accepting donations at football games, selling food items,  engaging the alumni association, and going door to door.   I would also like to recognize Sergeant Major R.S. Jernigan and  Colonel Charles Johnson, who have stewarded these young men in their  dedication to service in their community, State, and country. As a  proud alumnus of Catholic High School in Little Rock and a former  company commander of this outstanding JROTC unit, I am proud of the  hard work of these young men and how they have exhibited leadership in  the pursuit of their goal. They exemplify what we mean when we say:  Hard work pays off.   Congratulations on this outstanding salute to our beloved Gold Star  families and their future monument, and congratulations for 50 years of  leadership and character development at Catholic High. Semper fi.                 Recognizing the Children's Advocacy Alliance     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Children's  Advocacy Alliance in Conway, Arkansas, and the local first responders  for their dedication to serving and protecting the children of central  Arkansas. Children's Advocacy Alliance was founded in 2000 as court- appointed special advocates for the 20th Judicial District of Arkansas.  Currently it serves Faulkner, Conway, and Van Buren Counties in my  district.   Earlier this month, local law enforcement and other first responders  came out to support the annual Heroes for Hope race held by Children's  Advocacy Alliance in Conway. In its seventh year, the race incorporates  a central theme of being a superhero for each child in need. Every  child needs a hero, but the abused child needs a superhero.   This year, 160 participants ran in support of the race. Thank you to  all the dedicated workers at the Children's Advocacy Alliance and to  the dedicated law enforcement people for being those superheroes for  kids in need.            Welcoming Head Coach Darrell Walker to UA Little Rock     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of  Arkansas at Little Rock's new men's basketball coach, Darrell Walker. A  former Razorback, Mr. Walker was drafted by the New York Knicks in 1983  and played professional basketball for 10 years before assuming an  assistant coaching role for the Toronto Raptors. Over the past two  decades, Mr. Walker has demonstrated a high level of competency and  competitiveness at coaching, having been a part of four different NBA  coaching staffs and serving as the head coach for the Toronto Raptors  from 1996 to 1998.   More recently, he was head coach for two seasons at Clark Atlanta  University, amassing a 45-18 overall record. His passion for  excellence, leadership, and hard work are evidenced by the accolades  and career accomplishments. I look forward to following his success at  home at UA Little Rock during his time as head coach of such a dynamic  basketball community. This will be a great partnership.   Welcome home, Coach Walker.                            ____________________
