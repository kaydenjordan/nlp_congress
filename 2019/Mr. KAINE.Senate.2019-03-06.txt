 Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President. I am pleased today to introduce in the  Senate, with my colleague Senator Young, a bipartisan resolution to  repeal the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force  (AUMF) against Iraq. This legislation will formally end the  authorizations for the Gulf and Iraq wars--28 and 17 years,  respectively, after these AUMFs were first passed, reasserting  Congress' vital role in not only declaring wars, but in ending them.  The repeal of these authorizations also recognizes the strong  partnership the United States now has with a sovereign, democratic  Iraq.   The United States is no longer at war with Iraq and our legal  frameworks should reflect this reality as much as our policy  frameworks, to include the Strategic Framework Agreement that Iraq and  the United States signed in November 2008, which affirms the  establishment of a long-term relationship of cooperation and  friendship, based on the principle of equality in  [[Page S1710]]  sovereignty and the rights and principles that are enshrined in the  United Nations Charter.   Since 2014, U.S. troops have been in Iraq, alongside Iraqi forces, at  the Government of Iraq's request for assistance in combating the  Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Current Administration  officials, including Secretary Pompeo, Acting Secretary Shanahan and  Commander of the United States Central Command, General Votel, have  routinely emphasized that United States military forces remain in Iraq  at the invitation of the Government of Iraq and in respect to its  sovereignty. Recent presidential administrations have maintained that  the 2002 AUMF only serves to ``reinforce'' any legal authority to  combat ISIS provided by the 2001 AUMF and is not independently required  to authorize any such activities. As such, repealing the 1991 AUMF and  the 2002 AUMF would not affect ongoing United States military  operations. It would however, prevent the future misuse of the Gulf and  Iraq War authorizations and strengthen Congressional oversight over war  powers.   It is past time to repeal both AUMFs and formally mark the end of the  Iraq War that resulted in a devastating loss of life and wounded tens  of thousands of our troops. It makes no sense that two AUMFs remain in  place against a country that is now a close ally. They serve no  operational purpose, run the risk of future abuse by the President, and  help keep our nation at permanent war.   I am proud to join Senator Young in introducing a bill to repeal  these outdated and unnecessary authorizations. I hope we can continue  to find bipartisan compromise on these tough war power issues to  include revising and replacing the 2001 AUMF.                            ____________________     Mr. President.
