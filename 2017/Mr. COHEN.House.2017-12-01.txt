 Mr. Speaker, today, in Federal district court in  Washington, Michael Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI, a felony. It  is a strong indication that he is cooperating with the Mueller  investigation concerning Russia and its involvement with President  Trump and his team and the election of the President of the United  States.   We are facing a crisis in our country with our Constitution, our form  of government, and the rule of law. I have filed a bill to amend the  Constitution to not allow pardons of people from any President's  campaign team or family. I am also the sponsor of a bill that says you  can't fire a special counsel without cause. The special counsel would  have the right to seek redress in court.   We must be ready to protect Bob Mueller and the integrity of the rule  of law in this country, for I foresee this President firing him, as  Nixon did in the Saturday Night Massacre.   We are repeating the horrors of Watergate and the shredding of our  Constitution, common sense, and decency.                            ____________________
