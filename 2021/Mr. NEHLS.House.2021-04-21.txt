 Madam Speaker, for weeks now our country has witnessed the  never-ending horrific images and stories from our southern border. We  have heard from Border Patrol that they don't have enough agents to  secure the southern border and babysit--yes, babysit--the tens of  thousands of migrant children flooding across our southern border. As a  result, criminal illegal aliens are slipping through undetected.   We are a nation of laws and law and order, or at least we used to be.  Ever since this current administration assumed control of the White  House, there has been an outright refusal--yes, refusal--to put the  American people first and address the crisis at our southern border.   The administration's inactions will cost American lives, will cost  billions of taxpayer dollars, and once again put the responsibility of  the Federal Government on individual States.   I know this. I dealt with it firsthand as a sheriff in Fort Bend  County, Texas. I had to tell dozens of residents in my home county  whose homes were burglarized by a ring of illegal aliens from Honduras  and Colombia that many of the illegal aliens had been deported multiple  times.   In January of 2020, in my office, I had to sit and tell a son whose  mother was killed in a hit and run that the illegal alien that ran his  mother over had been deported six--yes, six--times prior. That fellow  right there.   Madam Speaker, enough is enough. End this crisis. Put the American  people first and secure our southern border.
