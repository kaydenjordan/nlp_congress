 Mr. President, today I recognize Mrs. Lisa  Maloff, of Zephyr, NV, on the grand opening of the Lisa Maloff  University Center at Lake Tahoe Community College. On August 16, 2018,  members of the Lake Tahoe community will come together for a ribbon- cutting ceremony. The facility will help Californians and Nevadans  alike achieve their goal of obtaining a 4-year college degree.   Upon moving to Lake Tahoe in 1958, Lisa hoped to complete a teaching  credential and give back to her community through public service.  Unfortunately, the closest 4-year institution was the University of  Nevada, Reno. The geographic isolation of the Tahoe Basin's mountainous  terrain, sometimes unpredictable weather, and travel time forced Lisa  to defer her dream of teaching and stymied her educational goals. Some  of these challenges persist today, especially for the area's working  students with families. Now, with the opening of the Lisa Maloff  University Center, through partnership with nearby universities, the  dreams of a 4-year college degree will become a reality to scores of  students in the Lake Tahoe Basin.   This center is one of many philanthropic contributions by Mrs. Lisa  Maloff and her husband, Robert Maloff, and adds to the lore that has  earned her the moniker of Angel of Tahoe. Mrs. Maloff has been a strong  supporter and advocate for a variety of Lake Tahoe causes, including  Barton Memorial Hospital, the Boys and Girls Club of Lake Tahoe, the  Tahoe Douglas Fire Protection District, George Whittell High School,  and Tahoe Youth & Family Services. Her passion for improving services,  programs, and the quality of life in the Lake Tahoe community is  commendable and serves as a great example to all Nevadans.   Today, I celebrate the many contributions of Mrs. Lisa Maloff to the  Lake Tahoe Basin community and her work to enhance the opportunities  for all young Nevadans to succeed and thrive. It is with pride that I  ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mrs. Lisa Maloff for her  generous philanthropy, her commitment to education, and her efforts to  change outcomes for people in the Lake Tahoe Basin.                            ____________________
