 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the biggest tax hikes in 50 years;  the biggest peacetime tax hikes ever recorded in American history--that  is what Washington Democrats are cooking up. Our Democratic colleagues  and President Biden are behind closed doors, dreaming up creative new  ways to grab literally historic amounts of the American people's money.   Remember, the same socialist spending plans that Democrats claim cost  zero dollars somehow also need staggering new tax hikes to pay for  them. So, even with significant inflation, runaway gas prices, and  runaway energy costs already hitting American families in their  pocketbooks, Washington Democrats have spent months dreaming up new  cash grabs for the IRS.   Democrats have talked about massively hiking business taxes, to a  level that would leave industries paying more than their competitors in  communist China. They have talked about jacking up marginal income tax  rates in ways that would hammer small businesses and family businesses  that file as passthroughs. They have talked about adding a second death  tax to give the IRS an even bigger bite out of family farms. They have  even promised something that our country has never seen before: a new  IRS surveillance dragnet where the IRS would get to track ordinary  citizens' inflows and outflows. Banks and credit unions would be forced  to hand over Americans' private information to the IRS. The Democrats  are so desperate to shake down the American people for money that they  are proposing to essentially treat everybody--everybody--like they are  under audit.   For months now, our Democratic colleagues have been toying with one  staggering tax increase after another. We have seen one disappointing  jobs report after another, one historic inflation report after another,  but Democrats are still convinced that the biggest peacetime tax hikes  on record in American history are just what the doctor ordered.   As one news report explained, ``the scramble has opened the door to  potential tax proposals [that] progressives could only have dreamed  of''--just dreamed of--``just a few months ago.''   The far left is officially calling the shots, and that is where the  latest new craziness comes into the picture. If public reporting has it  right, the Democrats are so desperate to raise taxes that they are now  proposing to tax money the American people haven't even made yet. Let  me say that again. They are now proposing to tax money the American  people haven't even made yet. Yes, you heard me right. So much for the  quaint idea that you had to actually make money first before the IRS  could tax it. Now Democrats want to tax money you haven't made yet.   There are already capital gains taxes that Americans pay when they  cash out an investment, when they sell what they have been holding and  realize actual gains. Now Democrats want to go much further and tax  certain citizens just because their holdings have gone up in value,  regardless of whether they have actually sold them and made any money.   Get this: In parallel with taxing people on hypothetical gains they  haven't realized, they apparently also want to hand out tax breaks for  hypothetical losses--losses--that people haven't realized. So they want  to tax gains they haven't realized and hand out tax breaks for losses  people haven't realized.   This harebrained scheme would have the IRS penalizing people who have  invested wisely and compensating people who have invested poorly, all  independent of whether they have actually made or lost any money. Let's  just think of the unintended consequences, like the fact that, in the  event of a market crash or financial crisis, the government would be on  the hook for massive automatic tax cuts for billionaires or the fact  that some experts suggest this new scheme would drive the wealthiest  Americans away from stocks and bonds, push them into other tax  shelters, and thereby reduce the growth in ordinary Americans'  investments that households rely on for college funds and 401(k)s.   Or the fact that new, innovative entrepreneurs whose startups begin  to grow in value could now get hit with a crushing tax bill long before  their company is actually cash-flow positive. The next visionary  startup founder could have to sell away ownership prematurely just to  pay Uncle Sam.   Our Democratic colleagues have become so tax hike happy that they are  throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. Now they are talking  about rewiring the entire economy  [[Page S7325]]  after a couple of days' discussions on the back of an envelope. It is a  massive and untested change that has not received any--any--meaningful  study or scrutiny.   Even the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is  complaining:         It hasn't been marked up, and there's been no vetting of       it.    Our Democratic colleague, the senior Senator from Montana, says:         Anytime you get into stuff that's not proven in the tax       code, it becomes a bit dangerous.    The senior Senator from Virginia says:         My fear is that we're going to try some innovative new       ideas and if we don't have time to develop them . . . we       could mess some of this up.    No kidding, Madam President.   This is just the latest saga in this long parade of Democratic tax  hikes. Nonpartisan analysts have shown that various aspects of the  Democrats' plans would shatter President Biden's promise to leave the  middle class alone. I guarantee you, the middle class will get hit.   When Republicans had power, we prioritized giving Americans a big tax  cut. We wanted families to keep more of their own money and make  American businesses more competitive all around the world.   Democrats want the opposite--historic tax hikes. So families keep  less, Washington gets more, and our competitors, like China, can pop  the champagne.                            ____________________
