 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in favor of my amendment, which will require the  Department of Homeland Security to create an annual report on the  number of illegal aliens who have been deported for assaulting a law  enforcement officer. This report will be made available to Congress and  to the public on the DHS website. My amendment will promote  accountability and transparency for the removal of these criminal  aliens.   The complete and total invasion taking place at our southern border  has made America less safe. Biden's border crisis has opened the door  to human traffickers, gang members, and other dangerous criminals who  enter our country with malicious intent, threatening the safety of our  citizens and the police officers who serve as our first line of defense  against crime.   Earlier this year, a female Border Patrol agent was violently  attacked by a male alien while attempting to make an arrest.   Last year, two law enforcement officers were injured by an illegal  alien when responding to a disturbance in New York. One officer  suffered a concussion and the other had a broken hand.   We cannot allow these criminals to run rampant in our communities.  The American people have the right to know if illegal aliens are  attacking law enforcement officers and to what extent. That is why my  amendment requires DHS to be accountable and transparent about the  removal of these criminals.   Rather than wasting time on the Democrats' agenda to keep our  southern border wide open and defund the police, House Republicans are  proud to back the blue, especially this week on National Police Week as  we recognize these brave men and women throughout our country for their  service.   We, as Republicans, have proposed policy solutions to put an end to  Biden's border crisis.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague, Representative  Andrew Garbarino,  for his leadership to ensure that we can hold these illegal criminal  aliens accountable for violence against law enforcement officers with  H.R. 2494.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment, as  well as the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Chair, I am glad that we have found some common  ground on this.   I thank my colleague for supporting this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
