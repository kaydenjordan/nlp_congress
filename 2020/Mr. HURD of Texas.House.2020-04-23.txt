 Madam Speaker, 134,700--that is the number of  small businesses in my home State of Texas that have received Paycheck  Protection Program loans amounting to more than $28.4 billion.   This money helps small business owners catch their breath because  they didn't have to fire their employees. This money prevented  thousands from going on unemployment and standing in line at already- overrun food banks.   Madam Speaker, this money has been a Band-Aid helping small  businesses stop bleeding. This program has and will help many survive  this moment of darkness. More funding for PPP will save jobs. More  funding for testing will save lives. Let's get it done. No more delays.   Madam Speaker, I am proud a solution to add funds to this program  finally came about, but I am disappointed partisanship delayed it. Our  neighbors and communities are stepping up and working together to help  one another. Congress should follow that lead.
