 Mr. Chair, today, we tell our fellow  Americans that their children's right to learn without fear; that their  own right to dance at a concert, worship at a synagogue, shop at the  mall; that all those rights to come home, to live, and to love are  greater than any other right in the Constitution.   This bill puts in place an expansion of violent history checks on  firearm purchases where there were too many gaps before.   It will not end every gun violence death in America, but we should  try. It also will get rid of this argument about States like California  and Illinois, where you have gun violence. You can no longer say, well,  they have tough background checks there, so it is not working. Well,  no, we are only as safe as the lowest common denominator. If our States  like Nevada and Arizona have low restrictions when it comes to  purchasing a firearm, we are only as safe as they are.   We will have a nationwide background check that will make sure that  all of us are safe. We are here, Mr. Chair, because of Mr. Thompson,  because of Moms Demand Action, because of Everytown for Gun Safety, and  because of March For Our Lives.   Keep marching. You got us to this point.
