 Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank my  colleagues and all those ``me too'' survivors who bravely come forward  to tell their stories of sexual harassment.    Imagine you are a young congressional staffer who eagerly comes to  Washington to make the world a better place for some and work for  someone you actually believe in. Instead, your boss breaks your trust  with unwanted sexual advances, groping, abusive language, or worse, and  you feel absolutely devastated and powerless.   Here is the thing: the United States Congress has made sexual  harassment in the workplace illegal, yet this behavior has sullied our  own Halls.   Quite frankly, I think it is pitiful and embarrassing that we even  have to have this discussion, but with that said, today's resolution to  require mandatory antiharassment training is obviously a good step and  necessary. And there is more work to be done, as my colleagues have  said.   There must be respect and safety in all our workplaces, in Congress,  and across America. I urge all my colleagues to support this good  resolution.
