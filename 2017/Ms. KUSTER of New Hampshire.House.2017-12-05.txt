 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  S. 1266, Enhancing Veteran Care Act.   Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs can contract with  qualified and accredited third-party nonprofits to investigate a VA  medical center for deficiencies in its facility. Only the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs, however, is directly capable of authorizing these  third-party investigations.   Unfortunately, this process is needlessly cumbersome and delays the  improvement of medical centers. This bill  [[Page H9643]]  is an important reform because it empowers Veteran Integrated Service  Network directors and VA medical center directors to initiate these  third-party reviews.   The Manchester VA Medical Center in my home State of New Hampshire  currently faces a number of questions regarding the services it  provides and the facilities it manages. While Secretary Shulkin has  initiated reviews of the facility, it took a number of whistleblowers  to put their reputation and jobs on the line to force action.   Legislation like the Enhancing Veteran Care Act could have  streamlined this process and made both the facility and the VISN more  accountable to the needs of veterans in New Hampshire. VA must be  better at assessing its own shortcomings.   Ultimately, veterans in the Granite State and across the country  deserve the highest standard of care.   I thank Senators Inhofe and Lankford for introducing this important  legislation. I thank Senator Shaheen, one of the lead Democratic  cosponsors of the bill, for helping advance this bill through the U.S.  Senate and being attentive to the needs of our Granite State veterans.   I proudly support this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to  support this bill and immediately send it to the President's desk.
