 Madam President, across more than five decades  in public service, Governor Joe A. Garcia of Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo was a  leader among leaders, for his community and all of Indian Country. He  was also a dear friend and close mentor. In so many ways, New Mexico  will not be the same without him.   Governor Garcia was a three-time Governor of Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo,  where he oversaw the Self Governance Initiative, under which the Pueblo  now runs all of its Bureau of Indian Affairs programs. He was serving  as the Pueblo's Head Councilman at the time of his death.   Governor Garcia served for two terms as the president of the National  Congress of American Indians, the oldest and largest American Indian  and Alaska Native organization serving sovereign Tribal Nations. He  also served as the vice president of the Board of Trustees of the Santa  Fe Indian School and as the chairman of the All Indian Pueblo Council-- now named the All Pueblo Council of Governors--which represents 20  Pueblos located in New Mexico and Texas.   In addition, Governor Garcia was a member of the Tribal Leaders Task  Force, where he served as cochair for 3 years for the Federal  Communications Commission. He was also a cochair of the Tribal  Technical Advisory Committee for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration--SAMHSA--and cochair of the Tribal  Transportation Self Governance Program Negotiated Rulemaking Team.   As a young man, Governor Garcia served in the U.S. Air Force. After  his military service, he earned a bachelor of science in electrical  engineering from the University of New Mexico. Governor Garcia worked  on the technical staff at Los Alamos National Laboratory for 25 years,  working on electronics design and development for data acquisition  systems. He also taught courses in computers, electronics, lasers, and  math at the Northern New Mexico College from 1979 to 1983.   Governor Garcia fought to advance the mission of Tribal sovereignty  over education through his leadership at the Santa Fe Indian School-- SFIS. The SFIS became the first former Federal Indian boarding school  where a Tribal organization--the All Indian Pueblo Council--contracted  for the education of their children.   Since the signing of the Santa Fe Indian School Act in 2000, the  Pueblo Governors have held the school's land in trust and established  an educational program based on the right and responsibility to educate  New Mexico Indian children in a way that supports their cultural and  traditional belief system. Governor Garcia championed both increased  funding and support for SFIS and the establishment of Tribally  controlled educational systems across Indian Country.   On a personal note, I was fortunate to be among the many who learned  from Governor Garcia--his wise counsel and advice and the example he  set  [[Page S2183]]  for all of us to follow. I will never forget sitting down with him  years ago when he first encouraged me to run for the U.S. Senate to  represent our great State. My thoughts are with his wife, Oneva, his  daughters Melissa and MorningStar, his six grandchildren, two great- grandchildren, and all those in Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico, and Indian  Country who knew and loved him.   The legacy that Governor Garcia built over decades of steadfast  advocacy for Tribal sovereignty, educational sovereignty, and the  cultural preservation of Pueblo communities will be felt for  generations to come.                            ____________________
