 Mr. President, I would like to talk about a couple of  topics.   First, I thank my colleagues on the Senate Commerce, Science, and  Transportation Committee for very recently approving legislation to  rename the NASA Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, OH, after Ohio's own  and a true American hero--the late Neil Armstrong. I now, of course,  urge that this legislation be taken up by the full Senate and that we  get it passed. There is an identical bill in the House. We hope to join  both bills so that it may be sent to the President for his signature  very soon.   The NASA Plum Brook Station is a state-of-the-art testing facility.  It is near Sandusky, OH, and is a terrific facility that is doing a lot  of the testing right now for both NASA and some private sector  companies. It is part of the NASA Glenn complex that is headquartered  in Cleveland, OH.   It is an impressive operation for a lot of reasons, but the one that  is most exciting right now is their work on the Artemis Project. This  is, of course, NASA's plan to put astronauts back on the Moon by 2024,  including having the first woman go to the Moon. This mission will also  lay the groundwork for future expeditions to the next great leap in  spaceflight--that, of course, being a manned mission to Mars. It is  exciting stuff.   At Plum Brook, they are already testing critical components of the  rocket engines that are scheduled to carry Artemis astronauts into  space starting next year. Very soon, they are going to be testing the  spacecraft itself. We hope it will arrive at Plum Brook within the next  few weeks where it will undergo about 4 months of testing.   This past summer, I and my colleague, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown,  introduced this legislation to rename the facility after Neil  Armstrong, and we did so on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the  Apollo 11 Moon landing, from which, of course, Neil Armstrong became  world famous for being the first person to walk on the surface of the  Moon.   Ultimately, Neil Armstrong was a test pilot. We think of him as an  astronaut. Some know that he was also a fighter pilot and that he was a  veteran of the Korean conflict. He was just an amazing individual-- humble, smart. He was a very patriotic individual. How appropriate and  perfect that as a test pilot, which he was during his whole post- fighter pilot career until his time as an astronaut, Plum Brook be  named after him.   By the way, Neil's family agrees with that, as does NASA, and as do  others we have talked to. So we are hoping that this will be a fitting  way to honor a man who, for all of his accomplishments, saw himself,  first and foremost, as a patriot who pushed the boundaries of flight.  Therefore, the test facility is very dear to them.   I talked to him about this test facility. After one of my visits  there, I went to see him at his home and told him about the progress  they were making. At that time, they were trying to revamp some of the  facilities there. He was really excited about it. He was a very modest  man and did not want things named after him. He viewed his service to  his country as the reward. That is all he ever wanted in life. That  makes it all the more fitting that we, in fact, do name this after him.  It is a great model for young people and, certainly, for those who are  interested in avionics and spacecraft and in being astronauts. His  example is one we should all look up to.  [[Page S6740]]    When this comes to the Senate floor for a vote, I hope all of my  colleagues will support it, and I hope that it will happen very soon.                            Thousand Talents Plan    Mr. President, there was a very troubling report that was issued this  week by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. This is a tough  subject. In this report, it details for the very first time how  taxpayers' dollars have been used, really, over the past 20 years to  fund scientific research that has then been misappropriated by one of  our global competitors--China--to fuel its own economy and its own  military growth.   What do I mean by that? What happened?   Every year, Federal grant-making agencies, like the National  Institutes of Health--the NIH--or the Department of Energy's National  Labs or the National Science Foundation, give out taxpayers' dollars  for research--actually, about $150 billion a year.   This is a good thing for us as a country. It leads to new  breakthroughs in science and technology, healthcare, weapons systems,  and so on. Through research grants, this money goes primarily to  universities and to other research institutions across the United  States. This investment has been very helpful in making the United  States the world leader in scientific innovation. Again, it has  resulted in some amazing breakthroughs.   Our U.S. research is built on some principles here in this country.  One is transparency. Another is collaboration. Others are integrity,  peer review, and a merit-based system. In fact, the open and  collaborative nature of the research that is done here in the United  States is one of the reasons we attract some of the best and brightest  scientists and researchers from all around the world. That is a good  thing. Yet, without proper protections, this research is vulnerable to  theft by other countries, and that is exactly what has happened.   The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, along  with Ranking Member Tom Carper, conducted an 8-month investigation into  how American taxpayer-funded research has been taken by China-- effectively stolen--to assist its own economy and its own military.  China has been very open about its goals to surpass the United States  as the world leader in science and technology by the middle of this  century.   An important part of this effort is what China calls its talent  recruitment programs. Through talent recruitment programs, China has  strategically and systematically acquired knowledge and intellectual  property from researchers and scientists in the United States in both  the public and private sectors.   In the course of our investigation, the FBI shared with us that China  plans to spend more than $2 trillion between 2008 and 2020 toward  improving its human capital, which includes recruiting and developing  researchers and scientists.   The Thousand Talents Plan, which was the focus of our investigation,  is now in its 11th year of operation, and it is probably China's most  prominent talent recruitment program. However, there are about 200 or  more other talent recruitment programs as well.   Launched in 2008, China designed the Thousand Talents Plan to recruit  2,000 high-quality, overseas experts and to get their knowledge and  their expertise and their research. By 2017, China had exceeded that  initial goal by recruiting more than 7,000 of what they call ``high-end  professionals,'' including many from American research institutions.   Some of the U.S.-based researchers, of course, also receive taxpayer- funded Federal grant money we talked about earlier to do the same  research right here in the United States. In exchange for spending part  of every year working in Chinese institutions, the Thousand Talents  Plan recruits are rewarded with generous salaries and research budgets,  sometimes even exceeding their pay at the American research  institutions where, in practice, they are working. These researchers  also often get access to what is called a shadow lab in science. In  other words, they provide them not just with funding, but they also  say: We will provide you lab space in China.   At our hearing yesterday, the Department of Energy witness testified  that China offered some of his researchers hundreds of thousands and  even millions of dollars to join a talent recruitment program.   For a researcher here, the Thousand Talents Plan might seem like a  good opportunity, but it certainly is not a good opportunity for the  United States, especially because embedded in the language of some of  these contracts these researchers sign are very troubling provisions  that prevent these recruits from disclosing their participation in the  Thousand Talents Plan even though disclosing foreign payments is  required by U.S. regulations. Not only is this dishonest, but it is  also a clear violation of the American regulations that require  researchers who apply for these grants we are talking about--this $150  billion of taxpayer money--to disclose any funding they are receiving  from a foreign source. In effect, what is happening with the Thousand  Talents Plan is that it is incentivizing these program members to lie  on grant applications to U.S. grant-funding agencies to avoid  disclosing their funding from Chinese institutions.   What is worse, in many of these contracts, researchers are often  required to transfer to China the technological breakthroughs--the  research--that are being developed in American labs with American grant  money. There are a lot of examples we found in our 8-month study. Let  me talk about a couple quickly.   In one, we learned that a Thousand Talents Plan recruit at the  Department of Energy's National Labs used the intellectual property  created during his work in a National Lab to file for a U.S. patent  under the name of a Chinese company, effectively stealing the federally  funded research and claiming it for China.   Another Thousand Talents Plan member illegally downloaded more than  30,000 files from a National Lab--this is connected with Department of  Energy funding--without authorization right before returning to China.   Once China has it, some of this research could be used to threaten  the national security of the United States. As an example, the State  Department witness testified at our hearing yesterday that ``the  Chinese Communist Party has declared the Chinese university system to  be on the front line of military-civilian fusion efforts for  technological acquisition for weapons research and the expansion of key  scientific and engineering talent to drive Chinese innovation.'' That  is pretty obvious. That is what all of our witnesses, in essence, said.   This is not a new problem. We found out through our investigation  that the Federal Government should have known about this issue for  almost two decades but has yet to do anything substantial to stop it.  It is unacceptable that we have allowed this to go on as long as we  have.   These talent programs are a win-win for China and a lose-lose for the  United States. First, the Chinese Government and their research  entities are getting research that is paid for by us. Second, it is not  used by us. That research is used in China to improve their own  economic and military status.   So why is it taking so long for us to do anything about this problem?  I think there are a couple of reasons.   First, a lot of the U.S. research community didn't fully understand  the Thousand Talents Plan and the threat it poses. Even though this one  program is more than a decade old at this point, it wasn't until last  year that the FBI began organizing a unified Federal response to the  threat it has been posing to our universities and research  institutions. We have been slow to focus on this issue, and therefore  it has continued.    I appreciated the FBI's candor at the hearing yesterday, by the way,  when the FBI Assistant Director testified that he wished the FBI had  ``taken more rapid and comprehensive action in the past.'' I do too.   Second, I think one reason this hasn't been stopped is that the  coordination between the grant-making agencies is almost as bad as the  coordination with the Federal law enforcement folks, meaning that they  aren't talking to each other about problems they have had, about  particular instances regarding some of the research that has been  taken.   As I said, we are talking about more than $150 billion of taxpayer  money every year that goes to these agencies,  [[Page S6741]]  but once these funds are in the agencies' hands, we found no evidence  of a unified and coordinated tracking and monitoring process to ensure  that the money did not go toward the Thousand Talents Plan participants  or other programs. The National Science Foundation, for instance,  doesn't seem to have anyone who handles grant oversight in this regard.  These research entities need to share information on these issues.   But other organizations are at fault too. We found that the State  Department is on the frontlines due to its responsibilities to vet visa  applications for visiting students and scholars, but it very rarely  denies visas under that process.   Quite frankly, the research community here in the United States bears  some responsibility too. There has been a collective failure by our  universities and our research institutions to vet researchers for these  conflicts of interest with other countries. Again, this is made worse  by the fact that many of these researchers are receiving taxpayer funds  to conduct their research here.   It is going to take a comprehensive strategy across the Federal  Government to better protect our research against this threat. Our  report makes a number of recommendations that, combined, will go a long  way toward strengthening the security of our research networks, while  preserving the shared culture of transparency and fairness.   Of course we want to continue to be the top place in the world for  research, and that means that we have to be able to share and have  transparency and openness, but it also means that we need to do a much  better job of protecting this information from being misused.   We, of course, need to do better at getting the word out to  universities, research institutions, and the general public about this  threat being posed by the Thousand Talents Plan and other foreign  talent recruitment plans. This means better coordination between law  enforcement, the intelligence community, and grant-making agencies so  that the government is on the same page on this threat.   We also need to change the research culture to preserve its openness  and innovative spirit while making sure foreign researchers are  properly vetted by the sponsoring organizations.   NIH, NSF, and other grant-making institutions need to standardize how  they find conflicts of interest in grant applications. They don't do  that now.   Members of the research community need to develop best practices for  American researchers to follow so that they can determine whether  receiving funds from a foreign country would compromise our principles  of research integrity and threaten our national security.   Finally, we need to help the State Department do a better job in its  visa vetting process for foreign researchers. We need to do a better  job of determining potential conflicts of interest before individuals  who may not have the best interests of the United States at heart start  working at our research institutions and using our taxpayer dollars.   In the coming months, I will introduce bipartisan legislation that  will help address some of these challenges. I look forward to working  with Senator Carper, the ranking member on the subcommittee, and other  colleagues to get those initiatives to the President's desk.   Let me conclude by saying that we don't want to exclude China from  contributing to scientific innovation--not at all. Advancements in the  fields of robotics, medicine, energy, weapons systems, and more are  things that are very important, and many of these can benefit the  entire globe. But we want to have fair and transparent processes in  place as we conduct this research, and our taxpayers don't want to be  the ones to pick up the tab as China misappropriates our research to  build up its own economy and a military designed to rival ours.   My hope is that this report is the start of a productive dialogue  with China and here in Congress on how we can better build a more  secure research system that continues to reward those who come to our  shores to discover new breakthroughs in science, while keeping China  and other nation state competitors from taking that research for their  own purposes.   I yield the floor.
