 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 7608, which provides an additional $1 million for the VA to  conduct educational outreach to veterans about the Airborne Hazards and  Open Burn Pit Registry.   My amendment will help veterans exposed to burn pits by strengthening  the burn pit registry and making patients aware of early warning signs  of life-threatening illnesses as well as the existence of the registry.   My amendment will also fund additional research on the health effects  of burn pits, using the data from the registry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to help our veterans exposed to  burn pits by supporting my amendment.
