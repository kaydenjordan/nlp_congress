 Mr. Speaker, today the House voted on a motion to  suspend the rules and pass H.J. Res. 30, disapproving the President's  proposal to take an action relating to the application of certain  sanctions with respect to the Russian Federation (Roll Call no. 42).   I strongly support this legislation that prevents the Trump  administration from terminating certain sanctions on three companies,  including aluminum giant Rusal, controlled by Oleg Deripaska, a Russian  oligarch and close ally of Vladimir Putin. These sanctions were imposed  under a comprehensive sanctions law passed by Congress in response to  Russian interference in the 2016 election.   There are far too many unanswered questions about this decision by  the Trump administration. Congress must fully vet whether these  companies are no longer owned and operated by Deripaska or his  compatriots. Russia must be held accountable for their actions.    Mr. Speaker, had I been present for the vote today on  H.J. Res. 30, I would have voted ``aye'' to retain these sanctions.   Stated against:
