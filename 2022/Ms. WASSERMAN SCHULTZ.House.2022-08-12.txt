 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise to support legislation that delivers  relief to every kitchen table across the country, cuts healthcare and  drug costs, and creates millions of good-paying jobs to save our planet  for future generations.   In my home State of Florida, the Inflation Reduction Act hands  security and peace of mind to millions of seniors in my State. It caps  out-of-pocket prescription costs and monthly insulin costs for Medicare  recipients, and finally allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug  prices.   Millions of Floridians will be healthier and more financially secure  by lowering premiums for 13 million Americans with expanded financial  help for the Affordable Care Act healthcare policies. It will slash  energy costs and work to stop our warming planet from stealing their  grandchildren's future.   This is our biggest shot ever to tackle climate change by speeding up  clean energy transitions and cutting climate pollution 40 percent by  2030.   The Inflation Reduction Act does all this by making corporations pay  their fair share, reducing the deficit, and ensuring no one who makes  less than $400,000 will pay one penny more.   This is game-changing relief for our seniors, our climate, and anyone  demanding tax fairness.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to pass this lifesaving  legislation.
