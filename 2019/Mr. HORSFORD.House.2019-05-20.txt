 Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleague, Congresswoman  Plaskett, and I am very honored to be able to join with her as one of  the coanchors for the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour.   Tonight, as my colleague indicated, we are here to honor the life and  legacy of a civil rights icon, the honorable Judge Damon Keith, who was  also a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated.   Judge Keith was born on July 4, 1922, the grandson of slaves, who  went on to become an internationally revered champion of justice. Judge  Keith has vigorously enforced the Nation's civil rights laws, most  notably in the areas of employment and education.   In Stamps v. Detroit Edison Company, Judge Keith ruled the Detroit  Edison Company had practiced systemic racial discrimination, resulting  in fines against the company of $4 million and against the employee  union of $250,000. He ordered the company to institute an aggressive  affirmative action program.   In 2016, Judge Keith wrote a searing dissent when an appeals panel  ruled that Ohio's voting rights laws did not discriminate against  minorities by restricting early and absentee ballots. He said in that  dissent: ``The birth of this Nation was founded upon the radical  principle that we, as a people, would govern ourselves. And voting is  the ultimate expression of self-government. Instead of making it easier  for all persons, unrestrained and unfettered, to exercise this  fundamental right to vote, legislators are making it harder.''   He concluded by saying: ``With every gain in equality, there is often  an equally robust and reactive retrenchment. We must never forget that  constant dialectical tension. For every action, there is a reaction.  The majority's decision is a fateful reminder that we can never fool  ourselves into believing that we have arrived as a nation.''  [[Page H4000]]    That is a statement that is ever so true even today.   Judge Keith recalled many of the civil rights activists and innocent  children who were slain to make sure minorities had access to the  voting polls.   They include: Emmett Till, Herbert Lee, Medgar Evers, Jimmie Lee  Jackson, Benjamin Brown, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the four  little girls who were, sadly, killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church  bombing in Birmingham, Alabama.   Judge Keith fought on their behalf during his tenure on this Federal  court.   Some of his other rulings had a profound impact on American life as  well, the biggest being his decision that prohibited the Nixon  administration from warrantless wiretapping in domestic security cases.   He ordered the Nixon Justice Department to end all wiretapping that  was not approved by the courts. This was in the midst of the Nixon  administration's attempt to go after radicals accused of conspiring to  bomb a CIA office in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He stated it violated the  Constitution's Fourth Amendment rights from ``unreasonable searches and  seizures.''   The Nixon administration appealed his ruling, and the Supreme Court,  with a vote of 8-0, rejected the administration's claim of  constitutional authority to protect the Nation from internal subversion  by wiretapping dangerous radicals without court warrants.   Along with this case, he ruled in favor of integration of the Detroit  Police Department and made the decision that deportation hearings could  not be held in secret after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.   He has left an indelible mark on the judiciary. Judge Keith has  received over 40 honorary degrees from colleges and universities across  the country and is the recipient of numerous awards. He was awarded the  Spingarn Medal from the NAACP, and the Edward J. Devitt Distinguished  Service to Justice Award, the highest award that can be bestowed on a  member of the Federal judiciary.   Judge Keith fought on all of our behalf to make this country more  just, fair, and less discriminatory.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Adams for her  leadership on these issues and her understanding of the dire impacts  that the Trump administration's proposed rule change would mean on  working families and the poor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) for yielding.   This is a very serious and important issue that we are talking about  tonight. I really want to provide the context to what got us to this  point where the Trump administration is now trying to balance the  budget on the backs of working people: the poor, seniors, children, and  needy families.   The President and Republicans in Congress during the last Congress  passed the so-called Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. What that Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act actually did was add $1.5 trillion to our deficit. The tax cuts  that were so-called were supposed to help the working poor. Eighty- three percent of the benefit from those tax cuts went to 1 percent of  the wealthiest, the well-connected, and the powerful. Now, to balance  the budget, they are proposing these draconian measures--cuts and  revisions--on our budget, and they are targeting the poor, those who  are relying, as my colleague said, on important programs such as SNAP,  Head Start funding, the Children's Health Insurance Program, the  National School Lunch Program, and other anti-poverty programs.   Let me talk to you for a moment, Mr. Speaker, about what these cuts  mean to the people in my home State of Nevada. Nearly 434,000 Nevadans  would be at risk of losing their SNAP benefits. SNAP benefits help  families put food on the table and also help contribute to our local  economy because they are buying those groceries at our local grocery  stores. They are ensuring that we keep workers working at our local  grocery stores.   The proposed rule would impact Nevadans, by putting 633,000 Nevadans  at risk of being kicked off of Medicaid. Since we have adopted the  Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion in my home State of Nevada  in 2008, we have cut the rate of uninsured in half. Prior to the  Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion, our uninsured rate  among children was over 30 percent. Now it is below 14 percent and  continuing to decline. This administration wants to take us backward.  We won't go backward.   Over 3,000 young toddlers in Nevada would be at risk of being removed  from the Early Head Start and Head Start programs. That is  unconscionable to me because the Acelero program that helps administer  Head Start in my district already has a waiting list. There are already  families who can't get into the program because there is not adequate  funding based on this administration's lack of priorities around the  poor.   So while this rule may seem mundane to some, the impact on families  is real. So we are bringing attention to this issue so the voters and  constituents across the United States can have a voice in this process.  The rule that the President is proposing to make has a 45-day window  for the American public to comment on just how harmful this rule would  be. The deadline to submit comments is June 21 of this year, and I  would encourage all of the public to make sure that their voices are  being heard.   So just to underline again, the Trump administration has proposed a  rule that would recalculate how we measure poverty, a move that would  more than likely kick people off of certain Federal programs that are  meant to assist poor and low-income families.   So why would they do that?   Because they have targeted the working poor in order to balance the  budget to pay for the tax cuts that they gave to big corporations, the  wealthy, and the well-connected.   The administration is considering switching to a different inflation  measure that rises more slowly, a change that over time would make it  harder to qualify for assistance. It is already hard enough for many  constituents in my district to receive aid.   Mr. Speaker, I talked to you about the waiting list of families at  Acelero Head Start program. It is right there on the corner of Martin  Luther King and Carey in my district. I have talked to the parents at  that program, and those families that are in it depend on the Head  Start program in order to give their children a good head start and be  able to prepare them for school. But without it, they would be left  without adequate childcare and without adequate support for their  families.   The Children's Health Insurance Program is something that I had  worked on when I was in the State senate. This is not a partisan issue.  In fact, many of my colleagues on the other side have supported funding  for the Children's Health Insurance Program, but the proposed Trump  administration rule that would recalculate how we measure poverty would  actually impact 633,000 Nevadans who would be kicked off of Medicaid  and the Children's Health Insurance Program.   So I would ask my colleagues on the other side why they would support  the administration impacting their constituents in this way?   It is not just the constituents in my district. It is not just the  constituents in Delegate Plaskett's district. Every Member of this body  has constituents who would be negatively impacted if this rule by the  Trump administration is enacted.   By allowing for these additional substitutions, chained CPI, which is  the measurement by which the administration is looking to measure  poverty, shows a slower rate of inflation. But for many families who  are already choosing between paying the rent and buying food, they are  already living as frugally as possible.   Time and time again, the Trump administration has attacked programs  that help struggling American families put food on the table and keep a  roof over their heads. But they ran and passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act. They did it in 51 days without one hearing, and now there are all  these unintended consequences from that measure that was passed in the  previous Congress, and they want to come back here and balance the  budget on the backs of the poor. We say, No.    The Department of Education has said that more than 1 million  schoolchildren were homeless in the 2016-2017 school year. One million  schoolchildren in America are homeless, and this administration wants  to deny them health insurance coverage under Medicaid and a school  lunch during the school day?   The Department of Agriculture said that 15 million households faced  food insecurity in 2017, meaning that they experienced difficulty  affording food, and this administration--the Trump administration-- wants to pass a rule that would recalculate how we measure poverty in  order to deny more children and families receiving this care. Despite  that, 70 percent of voters indicated that they had experienced at least  one form of economic hardship last year--70 percent. But we can find  ways to give tax cuts to big corporations, to the wealthy, and to the  well-connected.   The President's proposed rule would be harmful. It is misguided and  unfair to so many Nevada families and families all across the country.  Again, I would urge the public to write their Member of Congress and  ask them what they are doing to protect the public on this issue. After  the public has written their Member, they should submit their comment  before the June 21 date to the administration so that we can rescind  this proposed rule and protect working families and the poor.    I am at a loss for words how we choose to balance the  budget on 1 million homeless children, but find a way to give tax cuts  to the wealthy. We added $1.5 trillion to our Federal deficit, but now  we have 1 million homeless children in last year's school year whom we  are struggling to make sure they get adequate support in their schools  and a nutritious meal. And this administration wants to deny them that  by this rule change.    We have to have a more balanced discussion in this  body. I believe that we need to be competitive, and we need to make  sure that we are doing things to help incentivize our private sector.  There is a way to do that, but, unfortunately, our colleagues took the  approach to ram this measure through in 51 days with not one hearing.  They didn't discusses the impacts, and none of the issues that we are  now bringing forward on how the working poor, the middle class, and  those who are struggling and aspiring to be part of the middle class  are being negatively impacted by these policies.   So there is a direct correlation. We can't just talk about the budget  or the cuts to the budget that this administration is making without  talking about what this administration and Republicans in Congress did  last Congress by adding $1.5 trillion to our Federal deficit. It is not  just these Federal programs that we are talking about tonight. It is  Medicare, it is Social Security, and it is the Affordable Care Act. I  am sure we will have a Special Order on those topics as well, but we  wanted to bring attention to this tonight, because we only have 45 days  for the public to get their comments in to, hopefully, reverse this  rule so that it won't go into effect.    Would the gentlewoman yield on that point?    There was a recent article that showed many of the  workers of large employers who don't pay a livable wage are on SNAP  benefits. These are people who are working, but because they are not  being paid an adequate wage, they are eligible for SNAP benefits.   On top of that, based on the rule change and the discussion the  gentlewoman just outlined, 11 million could lose their benefits. These  are people, some of whom are working but because employers aren't  willing to pay them a living wage, they are on benefits, Federal  benefits, being subsidized by the Federal Government.   Either we need these employers to step up and give America a raise so  they don't have to be on SNAP benefits or we need this administration  to understand that balancing the budget on the working poor isn't the  solution.    Mr. Speaker, the comment period for the American public  for this proposed rule by the administration ends on June 21.   The Trump administration floated this proposal through what is called  a request for comment, essentially a request for the public to provide  information and views to the Federal Government on this potential  change. They are expecting them not to know that this is happening.   This administration presented no research on how low-income families'  costs for basic necessities has changed over time, nor did they provide  information on the implications of changing the poverty line for  individuals' and families' access to needed assistance.   That is why tonight's Special Order was so important and timely, for  us to bring awareness to this. I don't know how many Members of this  body know that the administration is doing this.   Again, I would ask my colleagues on the other side, who have  constituents just like we do who will be impacted, whether they support  this administration in this proposed rule change that will take away  fundamental benefits from their constituents, just like it will ours.   This is not a handout. This is a hand up. It is a hand up in order to  help individuals bridge, if you will, while they are going through  difficult times.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record information from the Center on  Budget and Policy Priorities titled ``Trump Administration Floating  Changes to Poverty Measure That Would Reduce or Eliminate Assistance to  Millions of Low-Income Americans.''  [From the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Tuesday, May 7, 2019]    Trump Administration Floating Changes to Poverty Measure That Would    Reduce or Eliminate Assistance to Millions of Lower-Income Americans     (Statement by Sharon Parrott, Senior Fellow and Senior Counselor)         The Trump Administration yesterday floated a proposal to       use a lower measure of inflation when adjusting the poverty       line each year. Consistent with other policies the       Administration has pursued, this policy would over time cut       or take away entirely food assistance, health, and other       forms of basic assistance from millions of people who       struggle to put food on the table, keep a roof over their       heads, and see a doctor when they need to. The reductions in       assistance that this proposal would produce stand in stark       contrast to the Administration's 2017 tax law, which       conferred large new benefits on the highest-income       households.        If the poverty line is altered in this fashion, fewer       individuals and families will qualify over time for various       forms of assistance, including many who work hard but are       paid low wages. That's because using a lower measure of       inflation like the chained CPI to adjust the poverty line       each year would make the eligibility thresholds for various       programs that serve people in need lower and lower over time,       compared with what the thresholds otherwise would be. This,       in turn, would lower the income eligibility limits for       programs like SNAP (formerly known as food stamps) and       Medicaid, which are tied to the federal poverty line. It also       would reduce the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) premium tax       credits--and thereby increase the out-of-pocket premium       charges faced by millions of people who purchase health       insurance through the ACA marketplaces.        The notion that the nation does too much to help struggling       families stands in contrast to a broad set of data. For       example, even with our current poverty line and set of       supports, the Department of Education says that more 1       million school children were homeless in the 2016-2017 school       year, and the Department of Agriculture (USDA) says that 15       million households faced food insecurity in 2017, meaning       that they experienced difficulty affording food.        This proposal is entirely discretionary on the part of the       Administration. No statute or regulation requires it to alter       the methodology for updating the poverty line. Rather, the       Administration is choosing to consider a policy that would       weaken basic assistance programs and thereby increase       hardship.        The Administration is considering using a lower inflation       measure to adjust the poverty line while wholly ignoring       other questions about the adequacy of the poverty line as a       measure of whether households can meet basic needs. And, it       has failed to put forward evidence about whether the chained       CPI itself accurately captures changes in the cost of living       for low-income households.        Indeed, the issue of what measure to use in adjusting the       poverty line for inflation is only one of a number of       questions about the poverty line and the official poverty       measure. Considerable research over the years--including a       major report by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)--has       identified a number of ways in which the poverty line appears       to be inadequate. For example, the poverty line doesn't fully       include certain costs that many low-income families face like       child care. In accordance with the guidance of the NAS panel,       federal analysts worked carefully with researchers over a       number of years to develop the Supplemental Poverty Measure       (SPM), which more fully measures the cost of current basic       living expenses. With this more careful accounting, the SPM's       poverty line is higher than the official poverty line for       most types of households, and its poverty rate is slightly       higher than the official poverty rate.        Another indication that the poverty line is too low is the       high rate of hardship among families with incomes just above       that marker. Near-poor families, using today's poverty line,       face high rates of food insecurity, difficulty paying rent       and utilities, and high rates of uninsurance.        The Administration's announcement, however, ignores all       other issues regarding poverty measurement that the NAS and       other analysts have raised and cherry-picks just one issue--      the measure used to adjust for inflation--to focus on in       isolation. Simply switching to a lower inflation measure       would likely make the poverty line less rather than more       accurate as a measure of what families need to get by.        Moreover, it is not at all clear that the chained CPI is a       better measure of inflation for low-income households' basic       living expenses, even if we had a poverty measure that       measured those living expenses more adequately. Research on       different inflation measures generally focuses on the best       way to measure inflation for the economy and consumers       overall. But the consumption patterns of low-income       households--and their ability to change their consumption in       response to changes in prices--may be different from those of       typical consumers. A recent study indicates that inflation       tends to rise faster for low-income households than for the       population as a whole. As just one example, housing costs       comprise a significantly larger share of low-income       households' budgets, on average, than they do for middle- and       upper-income households. And Labor Department data show that       costs for rental housing, which low-income people rely on       disproportionately, have been rising faster than the overall       CPI.        The Administration has floated this proposal through a       ``Request for Comment''--essentially a request for the public       to provide information and views to the federal government on       this potential change. But the Administration presented no       research on how low-income families' costs for basic       necessities has changed over time, the adequacy of the       poverty line itself as compared to the cost of basic       necessities, or the implications of changing the poverty line       for individuals' and families' access to needed assistance.       Asking for public comment in apparent preparation for a       policy change that could harm millions of struggling       Americans over time, without providing the public with       research and data on these basic questions, suggests this is       not a serious effort to explore the important substantive       issues that poverty measurement presents.        The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a nonprofit,       nonpartisan research organization and policy institute that       conducts research and analysis on a range of government       policies and programs. It is supported primarily by       foundation grants.     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the co-anchor for  this hour. This has been a very enlightening topic for us to bring  attention to.   Each one of us has constituents who are impacted, to whom we speak on  a regular basis. We cannot allow this administration to make this type  of an executive order and not have the consequences explained to the  American people.   That is what tonight was all about.   Sometimes the other side questioned President Obama making executive  orders. Well, this executive order that President Trump is proposing  directly impacts the working poor in this country. We cannot allow that  to happen.   We cannot allow children who are homeless, families who are  struggling, and the working poor who are trying to do everything they  can to keep it together to be impacted by this misguided, reckless, and  totally unnecessary rule change being proposed by the Trump  administration.   Again, we urge the American public to have their voice heard and  submit their comments by June 21 or contact their Member of Congress.   We are fighting on their behalf, but we need to make sure that every  Member in this body understands the implications of this proposed rule  change.
