 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3462, the  bipartisan SBA Cyber Awareness Act.   The Small Business Administration supports small businesses in every  corner of the country. With the support of Congress, the SBA has gone  to bat for small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic through relief  programs like PPP and EIDL. Yet, year after year, the SBA's Office of  Inspector General has found that IT security is one of the agency's  most serious management and performance challenges.   The pandemic highlighted the gaps in the agency's cybersecurity. As a  result of high demand, a glitch in the EIDL application exposed the  personal information of over 8,000 applicants.   We need to bolster the SBA's cybersecurity so that the SBA can better  protect small businesses' information and continue to help small  businesses nationwide.   My bill, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act, would direct the SBA to issue  an annual report on the agency's cybersecurity strategy, as well as  disclosure of recent threats and breaches. Under this bill, the SBA  would also report on its supply chain risk management strategy and  issue a plan to address the risks of foreign manufactured information  technology used by the agency, including components originating from  the People's Republic of China.   This bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent, and a similar  version passed the House of Representatives unopposed last year in  November 2021.   I thank the bill's Republican co-lead, Representative Young Kim, for  her support, as well as Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member  Luetkemeyer, and the staff of the Small Business Committee, all of whom  have been critical in advancing this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me again in supporting this  commonsense bill to support SBA cybersecurity.
