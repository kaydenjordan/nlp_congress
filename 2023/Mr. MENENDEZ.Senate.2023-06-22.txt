 I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I love your booming  voice.   I just want to come to the floor very quickly. I look forward to  working with Chairman Wyden so we can forge even stronger economic ties  between the United States and Taiwan. As Chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee and the Democratic cochair of the Senate-Taiwan  caucus, I can tell you that such efforts are deeply important to U.S.  businesses and our economic and national security.   I reviewed the United States-Taiwan 21st Century Trade First  Agreement Implementation Act. It reasserts important Congressional  prerogatives with which I agree, and I appreciate Chairman Wyden's  leadership in this regard.   I want to just add this point: If we truly want to help our  businesses and if we are committed to taking our economic ties with  Taiwan to the next level, we have to pass the Taiwan tax agreement.   Taiwan has made clear that they want a tax agreement with the United  States, and U.S. businesses want a tax agreement with Taiwan, but there  is a gap in the law that means there can be no agreement unless there  is some new legislation. The Taiwan Tax Agreement Act eliminates this  gap. It sets into motion an agreement with Taiwan that matches the  substance of the commitments we have with our partners around the  world, and it does so consistent with our Taiwan Relations Act.   I know that Chairman Wyden has also another aspect of this, and I  look forward to working together so we can come to a mutually agreeable  conclusion to achieve it.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  [[Page S2215]]    In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

Transmittal No. 23-0L       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(b)(5)(C), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of India.        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(l), AECA Transmittal No.: 21-13; Date:       April 30, 2021; Implementing Agency: Navy.        Funding Source: National Funds.        (iii) Description: On April 30, 2021, Congress was notified       by congressional certification transmittal number 21-13 of       the possible sale, under Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export       Control Act, of six (6) P-81 Patrol Aircraft; eight (8)       Multifunctional Information Distribution System-Joint       Tactical Radio Systems 5 (MIDS-JTRS 5) (6 installed, 2       spares); forty-two (42) AN/AAR-54 Missile Warning Sensors (36       installed, 6 spares); and fourteen (14) LN-251 with Embedded       Global Positioning Systems (GPS)/Inertial Navigations Systems       (EGIs) (12 installed, 2 spares). Also included were CFM56-7       commercial engines; Tactical Open Mission Software (ITOMS)       variant for P-81; Electro-Optical (EO) and Infrared (IR) MX-      20HD; AN/AAQ-2(V)l Acoustic System; ARES-1000 commercial       variant Electronic Support Measures; AN/APR-39D Radar Warning       Receiver; AN/ALE-47 Counter Measures Dispensing System;       support equipment and spares; publications; repair and       return; transportation; aircraft ferry; training; U.S.       Government and contractor engineering, software, technical,       and logistics support services; and other related elements of       logistical and program support. The total estimated cost was       $2.42 billion. MDE constituted $2.05 billion of this total.        This transmittal reports a net value increase in MDE of       $.55 billion to $2.6 billion due to price increases. No       additional MDE equipment will be included. The following non-      MDE will be added: AN/ARC-210 RT-2036(C) UHF/VHF Radio       Transceivers; AN/AAR-47 Missile Warning Sensors; Electronic       Countermeasure AN/ALQ-213; Advanced Digital Antenna       Production (ADAP) Antenna Electronics (AE); and Advanced       Digital Antenna Production (ADAP) Controlled Reception       Pattern Antenna (CRPA). Also, the non-MDE AN/APR-39D Radar       Warning Receiver previously notified will be replaced with       the AN/APR-39D(V)2 Processor Radar. These revisions will       result in an increase in estimated non-MDE value of $.23       billion to $.60 billion. The total case value will increase       by $0.78 billion, resulting in an estimated total case value       of $3.2 billion.        (iv) Significance: The additional non-MDE represents an       increase in capability over what was previously notified. The       proposed articles and services will improve India's       capability to meet current and future threats by providing       critical capabilities to India's maritime operations.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States by helping to strengthen the U.S.-Indian strategic       relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive       partner which continues to be an important force for       political stability, peace, and economic progress in the       Indo-Pacific and South Asia region.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensitivity of       Technology Statement contained in the original notification       applies to items reported here with the exceptions of:        (a) Electronic Warfare Self Protection (EWSP). The aircraft       EWSP consists of the ALQ-213 Electronic Warfare Management       System (EWMS), the AN/ALE-47 Counter Measures Dispensing       System (CMDS), and the AN/AAR-47 Missile Warning System.        (b) AN/ARC-210 RT-2036(C) Radios. The RT-2036(C) is the       first airborne software-defined radio to have MUOS (Mobile       User Objective System) Satellite Communications (SATCOM),       Second Generation Anti-Jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO       (SATURN) Electronic Counter-Counter Measures (ECCM) waveform,       high-speed mobile ad hoc networked communications, and       beyond-line-of-sight connectivity for secure data, voice and       imagery.        (c) AN/APR-39D(V)2 Processor Radar. The Radar provides       increased Probability of Detection (Sensitivity), corrects       ID/Ambiguity Resolution, improves Direction of Arrival (DOA)       accuracy versus Circular Polarized (CP) Emitters, and       improves DOA Indications versus CID Band Emitters.        (d) Advanced Digital Antenna Production (ADAP) Antenna       Electronics (AE). The ADAP Antenna provides digital anti-jam       processing and protected GPS L1 and GPS L2 for the majority       of Radio-Frequency (RF) and Infrared Frequency (IF) input GPS       receivers.

(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: June 21, 2023.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to call upon the administration  to take urgent action, as we did in 2012-2013, to pressure Rwanda to  end its support for United Nations sanctioned M23 rebels and stop  destabilizing eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, and to  stress the need for DRC to hold credible, on-time elections in December  2023.   According to the final report by the U.N. Group of Experts for the  DRC, Rwandan support for the M23 extends from the highest levels in  Kigali, including the Minister of Defense, an alarming allegation.  Rwandan troops now are fighting alongside the M23 inside DRC, and the  Rwandan Government is providing the M23 with weapons, uniforms, and  equipment. M23 has killed hundreds of Congolese civilians over the past  year, including the November 29 massacre of more than 170 men, women,  and children in the village of Kishishe. With Rwandan support, M23  downed a U.N. helicopter, killing U.N. peacekeepers, recruited child  soldiers, and displaced more than 1 million Congolese in eastern DRC.  Incidents of sexual violence targeting internally displaced persons are  also skyrocketing. On June 13, Human Rights Watch reported that,  ``Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have  committed unlawful killings, rape, and other apparent war crimes since  late 2022.''   There is overwhelming evidence of Rwandan support for M23, and M23  has repeatedly failed to adhere to ceasefire agreements brokered by the  East African Community. Despite this, the United States, the United  Nations, and other members of the international community have been  slow to respond. The last time Rwandan President Paul Kagame supported  M23 rebels in eastern DRC, in 2012, the United States suspended Foreign  Military Financing--FMF--for Rwanda, a decision that prompted several  European donors to also suspend or redirect assistance away from  Rwanda. The U.S. also imposed additional security assistance  restrictions under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act, CSPA. President  Obama, Secretary of State Clinton, Under Secretary of State for  Political Affairs Sherman, and Assistant Secretary of State for African  Affairs Carson all engaged directly with the leaders of DRC, Rwanda,  and Uganda to end the conflict and pressure Kagame to cease his support  for M23.   Our response to the current M23 crisis has been, by comparison,  woefully inadequate. Although Secretary of State Blinken travelled to  the region in August 2022 to discuss the instability in eastern DRC,  the United States did not publicly call on President Kagame to end  Rwanda's support for M23 until October 2022, months after the first  U.N. Group of Experts report documented Rwanda's actions. We have not  imposed any new sanctions on M23 leaders or Rwandan officials  implicated in gross violations of human rights in eastern DRC, nor have  we completely cut security assistance and military-to-military  engagement to Rwanda. In fact, as recently as May of this year, Rwanda  participated in the African Land Forces Summit sponsored by the U.S.  Army Chief of Staff. In February 2023, the United States invited  members of the Rwandan Defense Force to participate in a multinational  exercise in Kenya called Justified Accord, where the U.S. reportedly  provided Rwanda cyber capability training. The decision to provide  cyber-related training to Rwanda is particularly difficult to  comprehend in light of 2021 reports by Freedom House and Amnesty  International. According to the Amnesty report, ``Rwanda used NSO  Group's spyware to potentially target more than 3,500 activists,  journalists and politicians.'' The Freedom House report states that  ``Rwandans abroad experience digital threats, spyware attacks, family  intimidation and harassment, mobility controls, physical intimidation,  assault, detention, rendition, and assassination.'' The United States  cannot continue to support Rwandan efforts to serve as peacekeepers in  some parts of Africa while the very same Rwandan military is fomenting  violence and instability next door in DRC.   In addition to disrupting the lives of more than 1 million people in  eastern DRC, Rwanda's support for M23 is also undermining efforts to  prepare for elections. The last elections were so poorly managed that  the United States sanctioned the leadership of the National Independent  Electoral Commission--CENI--a precedent that should serve as a warning  to future electoral commissions across Africa. While CENI is under new  leadership, procurement and management of the voter registry seem as  opaque now as they were before. This is a problem. It is important for  CENI to be transparent about its spending and its management of the  voter registry. Contrary to its actions in 2018, the DRC should welcome  international election observers and do everything it can to help, not  hinder, domestic election observers.   Even if all of those shortcomings are addressed, violence in the east  may disenfranchise voters by preventing them from registering to vote  or casting a ballot on election day. Credible and  [[Page S2217]]  timely elections are crucial to the future stability of the DRC and in  the interest of the United States, the region, and the international  community. The U.S. and its partners must increase pressure on Rwanda  to end its destabilization campaign and must encourage the CENI and the  Congolese Government to do all they can to hold timely, credible  elections in December 2023.   Although the situation is dire, it is not hopeless. There are steps  that the United States can take. First, the State Department must  complete a review of its Rwanda policy, which it committed to undertake  in response to a letter I sent last July. As I also requested in July,  the Department should continue suspending security assistance until  Rwanda ceases support for the M23. This suspension should apply to  security cooperation and exchanges with Rwanda at all levels. The U.S.  should impose sanctions on Rwandan Government officials implicated-- either directly or indirectly--in human rights violations or  corruption, to include the theft of minerals or other resources from  eastern DRC.   And there are steps the Congolese must take. I encourage President  Tshisekedi and DRC officials to do more to combat corruption in their  country, particularly within the judiciary and the armed forces, and to  lift the ``state of siege'' in eastern DRC. It is clear that conditions  for civil society have improved under President Tshisekedi, but much  more should be done to ensure that Congolese are able to criticize  their government freely, particularly in eastern DRC. I am troubled by  multiple reports that journalists have been arrested, including by  national intelligence agency operatives, for reporting on what is  happening in the east. There have also been disturbing reports that the  DRC Government or individual DRC military officers are enlisting the  support of rebel groups or militias to help combat M23. If these  reports are true, it is incumbent upon President Tshisekedi to put an  end to such efforts. Finally, I urge CENI and President Tshisekedi to  ensure that international organizations are able to obtain  accreditation and visas in a timely manner, so that they are able to  support domestic election observation efforts without impediment.   The situation in eastern Congo is not going to fix itself. It  requires a collective effort--from us, from our partners, from the  U.N., and from the Congolese. I urge us all to act.                            ____________________
