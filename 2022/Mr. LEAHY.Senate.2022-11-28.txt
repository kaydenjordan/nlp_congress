 Madam President, today marks the 1-year anniversary of the  election of Xiomara Castro Sarmiento, the first woman to hold the  office of President of Honduras. She succeeded Juan Orlando Hernandez  who had discredited the office of the Presidency by colluding with drug  traffickers, corrupt business owners, and other criminals; abusing his  authority by pressuring corrupt legislators and judges to dismantle the  institutions of democracy; and using the armed forces and police to  brutally silence his critics. The many crimes committed by his  government were well documented, yet numerous U.S. officials treated  him like a legitimate partner even after his stolen reelection in 2017,  until he was finally arrested and extradited to the United States.   The election of President Castro gave the people of Honduras a new  sense of hope that finally that dark period was behind them, that  rather than seeking to enrich themselves and hold onto power, she and  her administration would finally tackle the grinding poverty,  inequality, injustice, impunity, and insecurity that have caused so  many Hondurans to seek a better, safer life outside the country.   It has now been 10 months since President Castro was sworn in, and  her record is mixed. She has taken a number of important steps to  reverse the improper and illegal practices of her predecessor and to  put the country on a brighter path. By doing so, she has distinguished  herself from her counterparts in El Salvador and Guatemala who have  chosen to continue down the dark path of authoritarianism, corruption,  and impunity. But while her administration faces every imaginable  challenge, none is more urgent and necessary than reversing the  Hernandez administration's assault on the independence of the judiciary  and the rule of law. Under President Hernandez, the very concept of  justice was turned on its head. Anyone with money could get away with  practically anything, including murder, and the government could arrest  and imprison anyone with impunity. The vast majority of crimes went  unpunished.   Recognizing the need to establish public confidence in the courts and  Office of the Attorney General, one of President Castro's most  important promises during her campaign was to create a Comision  International Contra la Impunidad en Honduras--CICIH--to succeed the  defunct Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity-- MACCIH--which was shut down by President Hernandez. Yet, nearly a year  after her election, a formal agreement between the United Nations and  Honduras, or convenio, to establish an independent CICIH, has not been  signed.   One of the lessons the people of Central America have learned is that  the only way to establish the rule of law and end impunity in their  countries is with the active participation of international  institutions and experts and the unequivocal commitment of local  officials. Despite millions of dollars invested by the United States  and other donor countries, that local commitment was lacking for the  International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala--CICIG--and the  MACCIH in Honduras. Each was pointed to by the former leaders of those  countries as proof of their commitment to the rule of law. Yet each was  vulnerable to manipulation, and each was shut down by those same  leaders when it became clear that they themselves could be held  accountable for their crimes. Their only interest was in appearing to  support the institutions of justice while all the time ensuring that  they, their families, and their corrupt accomplices in government and  the private sector remained above the law.   Considering how easily CICIG and MACCIH were sabotaged by the  previous leaders of those countries and how much is at stake for the  people of Honduras and the country's future development, nothing is  more important than firmly establishing a culture of respect for the  rule of law and for those whose job it is to administer it.   Doing so will take years, but the essential first step in that  process is for the Castro administration to complete the negotiations  with the United Nations and sign a convenio for the installation of a  fully independent CICIH headed by a commissioner with the necessary  experience, professionalism, and integrity, selected by the United  Nations.   An independent commissioner will work with local judicial authorities  in applying the law to the facts, wherever they lead. Past partial  solutions only resulted in money wasted, time lost, and justice denied.  Only after such a convenio is signed, which should occur without  further delay, will the Honduran people and the international community  have confidence that President Castro will keep her word and that  Honduras will finally be on a path toward real justice and  accountability.
