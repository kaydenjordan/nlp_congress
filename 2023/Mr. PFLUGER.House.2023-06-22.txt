 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2023 NCAA  Division II National Champion Angelo State University Rams baseball  team.  [[Page H3077]]    The Rams' championship is the first in history and the fifth national  championship title at Angelo State. This is a time to reflect upon the  diligence, sacrifice, and determination that these young men have  contributed toward the national championship, and I especially want to  recognize Head Coach Kevin Brooks and his coaching staff.   Coach Brooks started the program in 2005 and has remained a dedicated  leader of his team and of the young baseball players. I also want to  recognize President Ronnie Hawkins for his leadership to the university  and to the community.   Mr. Speaker, baseball isn't the only good thing going on at Angelo  State. There are many things to celebrate, but today, I congratulate  the Rams. Their achievement will forever be etched in the annals of  history. Their success is a source of pride for our entire community,  and they will inspire future generations of Texas-11 athletes for years  to come. Today, we celebrate their victory and the unyielding pursuit  of excellence that it represents.   Well done, Champions.                            ____________________
