 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the  distinguished career of U.S. Army Reserve COL Gregory A. Scheidhauer as  he retires from his nearly three decades of service to our Nation.  Dedication to his country and commitment to his fellow servicemembers  are qualities that define Greg's career, and his years of effort have  made lasting improvements to our Nation's defense.   Born in Silver Spring, MD, Greg went on to attend Bowie High School  and, later, West Virginia University, where he earned his bachelor of  science degree in sports management in 1990. He joined the Army ROTC  program at West Virginia University in 1988 and began his military  service upon graduation, commissioning in 1990.   In 2009, Greg joined my office in the House of Representatives as a  defense fellow, where he served alongside my staff for the year. His  expertise, assistance, and advice were invaluable to the team, and our  office, as well as all Hoosiers, greatly benefitted from his work.  After his service in my office, Colonel Scheidhauer became a  legislative liaison for the Office of the Chief of Army Reserve at Fort  Belvoir.   In 2010, Greg deployed to Iraq and served as the director of  logistics for the Joint Forces Special Operations Component Command- Iraq, JSOCC-I, during Operation Iraq Freedom and Operation New Dawn. He  worked to ensure the U.S. Special Operations Forces servicemembers  throughout Iraq had the supplies and equipment they needed for  counterterrorism operations and training. Upon his return, he was  selected to serve as a congressional budget liaison in the Army's  Congressional Budget Office.   Greg's hard work in that role led to his being named the Chief of the  Army Reserve Legislative Affairs Division in 2014, where, for nearly 5  years, he oversaw the legislative liaison team and worked to engage and  inform Members of Congress and our staff members on the Army Reserve.   As we thank Greg for his dedicated work over his career, we must also  thank his family who have been his support system through it all: his  wife Andrea; daughter, Alexis; and sons, Brennan and Christopher. The  sacrifice of our servicemembers is immense, but so is that of their  families, and we are grateful that they have shared Greg's time and  expertise in the service of our county.   Greg has served with distinction and honor and now will be retiring  to spend time playing golf and basketball, cheering on the Mountaineers  and the Redskins, and, of course, spending time with his family. I  congratulate Greg on his career of service and wish him the best as he  moves into the next chapter of his life.                            ____________________
