 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee  on Rules, I call up House Resolution 558 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 558         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 1423) to amend title 9 of the United States       Code with respect to arbitration. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on the Judiciary now       printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an       original bill for the purpose of amendment under the five-      minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-32       modified by the amendment printed in part A of the report of       the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. That       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered       as read. All points of order against that amendment in the       nature of a substitute are waived. No amendment to that       amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order       except those printed in part B of the report of the Committee       on Rules. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of September 20, 2019, relating to a measure       making or continuing appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2020.        Sec. 3.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of September 19, 2019, or September 20, 2019,       for the Speaker to entertain motions that the House suspend       the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or       her designee shall consult with the Minority Leader or his       designee on the designation of any matter for consideration       pursuant to this section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona  (Mrs. Lesko), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the House Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 558, providing for consideration of H.R. 1423,  the FAIR Act, under a structured rule.   The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  the Judiciary.   The rule also provides same day authority for a rule providing for  the consideration of a fiscal year 2020 CR and provides blank  suspension authority through the legislative day of Friday, September  20, 2019.   Mr. Speaker, 11 years ago, Kevin Ziober joined the United States Navy  Reserve. In his own words, he did so to ``help protect America's  liberties, freedoms, and security.''   From 2010 to 2012, Kevin worked diligently for a Federal contractor  in my home State of California, helping to grow the company from 18  employees to more than 90.   When he found out that he would be deployed in November of 2012, his  employer decorated the office with navy-color balloons and threw a  surprise party in his honor.  [[Page H7762]]    Unfortunately, the real surprise was delivered to him 30 minutes  after his party. Kevin was fired. His employer made it clear that his  job would not be waiting for him when he got back from his deployment.   I wonder what my colleagues would do if forced with the same  circumstance of choosing country over providing for their own families.   The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act  protects his rights as a reservist to deploy and keep his job.   When Kevin returned from serving his country in 2014 and tried to  enforce this very right, his employer filed a motion to compel  arbitration, and it was granted.   Six months into his tenure with the company, Kevin had been required  to sign several documents as a condition of keeping his job. Those  documents included a forced arbitration clause, which meant that Kevin  would have no access to the Federal court system--no access. He would  lose his right to a jury trial, to any meaningful appeal, and to a  public or speedy proceeding of any kind.   Mr. Speaker, Kevin and the thousands of other Americans who have been  forced into arbitration proceedings are why we are here today. We are  here to ensure that Americans are not forced to unknowingly agree to  surrender their constitutional rights.   Under the present system, when corporations harm workers and  consumers, their cases are often funneled into the confidential quasi- legal arbitration system.   When thousands of Californians were charged early termination fees  that were illegal under State law, DIRECTV responded by forcing  individual customers into arbitration.   What exactly are consumers supposed to do when it costs more to  pursue a case through arbitration than it would if they were looking to  recover a small amount?   Instead of victims fighting their cases together, big corporations  can get away with making millions illegally by harming average  Americans. By allowing forced arbitration and preventing class action  lawsuits, we incentivize this very bad behavior.   Mandatory arbitration has the potential to affect everyone. One story  that haunts me is that of Sister Irene Morissette.   When she was 84 years old, Sister Irene, an elderly Catholic nun,  moved to Chateau Vestavia, an assisted living facility outside of  Birmingham, Alabama. While living at this facility, she was brutally  raped at 84 years of age. The police found blood and semen on her bed  and her clothing.   The medical examiner documented bleeding and injuries that indicated  a rape had occurred, but after the police failed to bring a criminal  case, Irene's family attempted to bring a civil suit against Chateau  Vestavia. Instead of being able to pursue her case in court, she was  forced to arbitration. Irene, unknowingly, had signed a forced  arbitration clause buried in the documents required to live at the  facility.   The arbitrator decided that, despite the physical evidence of rape,  besides the blood and the semen on her clothing, the facility that was  charged with keeping her safe could not and would not be held  responsible.   Unfortunately, forced arbitration is common practice among large  chain nursing facilities. Ninety percent of these large facilities  require forced arbitration agreements.   Mr. Speaker, can you imagine trusting your loved one, your mom or a  grandma, to be cared for at one of these facilities and then finding  out that they have been brutally harmed and that you could not seek a  fair recourse, no justice?   These facilities argue that if you refuse to sign a forced  arbitration clause, you can just take your loved one, take your  business somewhere else, go. But that choice isn't a viable choice,  because the majority of these large facilities, as I stated, 90 percent  of these large facilities require you to sign an arbitration agreement.                                time  1230    Many people don't have another option, at least not one if they want  to live close to their loved ones or in their home State. So, seniors  must sign away their right and be denied the opportunity to seek  justice, just like Sister Irene.   What struck me the most about her story is why the arbitrator did not  rule in her favor. The arbitrator said that Sister Irene did not sound  upset enough in the audio recording to determine if she was really  raped. What does that mean? How many times have men been judge and jury  when deciding women didn't seem hurt enough, didn't fight back enough,  didn't wear the right clothing, didn't scream loud enough, or didn't  wear her own condom? Sister Irene was 84 years old, for God's sake.  What does it take to find responsibility in an act of violence against  an innocent nun?   I wonder how many other victims, who have been forced into  arbitration, have heard similar statements of doubt from private  arbitrators. The worst part is that we will never know. And why is  that? Because most arbitration proceedings are not public.  Nondisclosure agreements and gag orders often accompany mandatory  arbitration. The #MeToo movement taught us a valuable lesson about  nondisclosure agreements and forced arbitration. Without forced  arbitration, we could have stopped Bill O'Reilly or Roger Ailes from  assaulting women and spewing their hate on FOX News long ago. Doing  away with forced arbitration means more victims can share their stories  and prevent abusers from harming others.   What I hope these stories make clear is that arbitration, contrary to  claims of my colleagues, does not work for everyone. In fact, for most  Americans, it serves as a barrier to justice and a legal shield for  corporations. It is a system that deters defendants from seeking  justice and small payouts. It is a system that is fundamentally based  on tricking Americans into giving up their rights.   That is why H.R. 1423 is so critically important. This bill would  restore the rights of Americans by allowing them to make the choice for  themselves about whether arbitration is right for them. Ultimately,  that is what this bill is about: freedom to choose for every American.   If arbitration is the amazing system that my colleagues claim it is,  then Americans will flock to pursue their claims through it. But if  arbitration is, in fact, the barrier to justice that it appears to be  for so many Americans, then this bill will allow them to choose for  themselves how they want to pursue that justice. Voting for this rule  is a step towards fighting the special interests that oppress our  constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   When Wells Fargo opened up 3.5 million fake accounts, including  178,972 from Arizona, Wells Fargo tried, since 2013, to use forced  arbitration to block lawsuits, including a class-action case. These  people were charged excess overdraft fees when their accounts were not  overdrawn.   As it relates to labor, there are 60.1 million workers who make up a  majority of nonunion private-sector employees who are subject to forced  arbitration clauses. These employees are told that if they want the job  or want to keep their current job, they must sign away their right to  their day in court and submit to forced arbitration agreements.   In contrast, the collective bargaining process includes protections  that are unavailable to many nonunion workers, such as rejecting unfair  employment terms. In collective bargaining, both the company and the  union are represented by counsel and can agree on arbitration before  the dispute arises to an informed and transparent basis.   The collective bargaining process can also involve agreement over  other important protections, such as truly neutral arbitrators, better  procedures, and transparent decisionmaking.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire first  from my colleague if she is prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Before I conclude, I would like to start by thanking Mr. Johnson and  Mr. Nadler for bringing this critical piece of legislation to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have repeatedly argued that this  legislation is for trial lawyers. Let me tell you about Allen.   Allen tried to hold American Express accountable for high swipe fees  in a class action lawsuit with other small businesses. Instead, he was  forced to go at it alone in arbitration, where he quickly found out  that, even if he won his case, he would lose because it would cost much  more to bring his claim than he could hope to ever recover. Allen lost  his case after appealing all the way to the Supreme Court.   Recently, some very large companies like Walgreens, CVS, and Safeway  have taken American Express to trial over the very same issue. The  difference here is that they are large enough to have been able to  negotiate contracts without forced arbitration clauses.   I have heard it said that the FAIR Act is bad for small businesses.  It is quite the opposite. Corporate America claims the FAIR Act outlaws  all arbitration clauses. That is simply not true. The FAIR Act does not  apply to business-to-business arbitrations.   The bill protects workers, consumers, and small businesses with  antitrust cases. Companies like Walmart or Exxon are not protected from  forced arbitration under the FAIR Act.   I could share many more of these stories, but our time here is  limited.   It shocks me that my colleague is so opposed to fair representation  when our Founding Fathers recognized the importance of access to legal  counsel, and every day on this very floor we pledge ``with liberty and  justice for all''--for all.   I do agree with my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that the biggest special  interest at play here is the corporations that want to protect their  top executives who sexually assault their employees; the cable  companies who charge illegal fees, making millions in profits; the  credit card companies that charge exorbitant fees, crippling small  businesses; and many others that use forced arbitration to escape  justice.   There are plenty of special interests that are fighting to keep using  this broken system, and my colleague has tried to flip that narrative  to make it seem as if the underdog will be hurt by this legislation-- the underdog of billionaires. Nothing could be further from the truth.   Let's not forget whom this bill is for. This bill is about fighting  for veterans like Kevin, for our loved ones in nursing homes like  Sister Irene, for small businessowners and every other victim of forced  arbitration.   Mr. Speaker, we have tossed around a lot of legal terms in this  debate, but at its core, this bill is about justice.   In conclusion, I would like to tell about a horrific experience  suffered by a customer of Massage Envy in L.A. County.   Lilly was sexually assaulted by a therapist, and after the assault,  Lilly tried and tried to cancel her membership to this service, but the  company repeatedly put roadblocks in her way. A year and a half later,  she downloaded the Massage Envy app on her phone to cancel her  membership. Hidden in the fine print of the app was a forced  arbitration clause. Lilly filed a lawsuit.   Like hundreds of other women who have been assaulted, now Massage  Envy is using forced arbitration to prevent Lilly from getting justice,  attempting to force her and other women into arbitration to keep it a  secret. Years later, she still has not seen an outcome.   By isolating survivors of sexual assault, wage theft, and  discrimination and denying them the leverage of class action suits, we  discourage other victims from coming forward. While the victims wait in  limbo, navigating a potentially rigged arbitration system, their  perpetrators are free to continue to rape, to continue to steal, and to  continue their bad behavior.   Forced arbitration is bad for workers, small businesses, and  consumers, and this bill is about giving Americans a chance to fight  against powerful special interests.   Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues consider this legislation, I ask you:  Will we continue to silence victims, or will we give them the freedom  to make their own choice to fight against the injustice that they have  suffered?   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on  the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows                     Amendment to House Resolution 558    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, the amendment printed in section 5 shall be in       order as though printed as the last amendment in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution if offered by Representative Lesko of Arizona or a       designee. That amendment shall be debatable for 10 minutes       equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an       opponent.        Sec. 5. The amendment referred to in section 4 is as       follows:        At the end of section 401 of chapter 4 of title 9 of the       United States Code, as added by section 3 of the bill, add       the following:        ``(7) the term `solicited party' means a contracting party       asked to agree to a predispute arbitration agreement or to a       predispute joint-action waiver; and        ``(8) the term `soliciting party' means a contracting party       who asked a solicited party to agree to a predispute       arbitration agreement or to a predispute joint-action       waiver.''.        In section 402(a) of chapter 4 of title 9 of the United       States Code, as added by section 3 of the bill, insert        ``unless the solicited party seeks to enforce such       agreement, or such waiver, against the soliciting party and       the agreement or waiver was agreed to before the date of       enactment of this Act'' before the period at the end.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
