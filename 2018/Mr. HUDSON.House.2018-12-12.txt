 Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be recognized and to be  here today to honor my dear friend, Parker Poling, as she leaves  Congressman Patrick McHenry's leadership office to take over as  executive director  [[Page H10159]]  of the National Republican Congressional Committee.   Parker has been a friend, a mentor, and a counselor to me and  countless others over the years, none more significantly than Patrick  McHenry. It has been a real pleasure to watch him evolve and develop as  a legislator under her very good tutelage.   We met when we were both chiefs of staff, me coming to Washington out  of North Carolina, and Parker starting out as chief of staff for one of  my best friends, Patrick McHenry.   Parker is intelligent; she is poised; she is wise beyond her years;  and she is a heck of a great person. She is just a pleasure to spend  time with. She has helped me more times than I can count over the  years, including when I decided to run for Congress myself.   She is as well respected as anyone on Capitol Hill, and I couldn't be  more proud of her as she moves on to her new role.   I do feel badly for my friends across the aisle, though, because  Parker will now be steering the ship for House Republicans for the next  2 years, so you had better look out.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Parker Poling for her years  of service to the House of Representatives and the people of this  country, and in wishing her, Todd, Barrett, and Eliza well in their  future endeavors. Thank you, and God bless you.
