 Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the  nomination of Congressman Tom Price to be the next Secretary of Health  and Human Services. My opposition to Mr. Price has less to do with his  well-known, extreme, rightwing economic views than it has to do with  the hypocrisy and dishonesty of President Trump.   The simple truth is, Congressman Price's record is the exact opposite  of what President Trump promised to working families and for senior  citizens all over this country. If President Trump had run his campaign  for President by saying: OK, Americans, I am going to cut Social  Security, and I am going to cut Medicare, and I am going to cut  Medicaid, and I am going to put together a Cabinet that will do just  that, I think Congressman Price would have been the perfect candidate  for Secretary of HHS, but that is not the kind of campaign Donald Trump  ran.   He ran a campaign in which he said over and over again: I am a  different type of Republican. I am not going to cut Social Security, I  am not going to cut Medicare, and I am not going to cut Medicaid. Yet  he has nominated individuals like Congressman Price, who have spent  their entire career doing the exact opposite of what Donald Trump  promised the American people he would do.   If Mr. Trump had said: I want to prevent the American people from  getting low-cost prescription drugs from Canada, and I want to continue  to prohibit Medicare from negotiating for lower drug prices,  Congressman Price would have been a great choice, but that is not what  Donald Trump said during his campaign.   This is what President Trump said. During the campaign on May 7,  2015, Mr. Trump tweeted:         I was the first and only GOP candidate to state there will       be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.    On August 10, 2015, Mr. Trump said:         [I will] save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security       without cuts.    Without cuts.         [We] have to do it. . . . People have been paying in for       years, and now many of these candidates want to cut it.    On November 3, 2015, Mr. Trump said:         I'll save Social Security. I'll save
