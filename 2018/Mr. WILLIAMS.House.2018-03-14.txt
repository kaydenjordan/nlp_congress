 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to  recognize a city in Texas' 25th Congressional District for being named  the number one place to live in all of America. That city would be none  other than our great State's capital, Austin, Texas.   Cities from all over the Nation are scored based on their job market,  their value, quality of life, desirability, and net migration. With a  population of almost 2 million people and an additional 50 new  residents every single day, Austin is one of the fastest growing  cities. It is no wonder Austin secured the number one spot.   In addition to its unleashed economic potential, young families are  relocating to central Texas for something they can't get anywhere else:  the ability to experience living in a big city with a booming economy  that also provides the warmth and friendliness of a small town is what  makes Austin one of a kind.   Mom-and-pop shops down the road are able to open their doors, hire  more Texans, and pay their employees more due to an overhaul of our  Nation's Tax Code. The truth is Austin is just now seeing the fruits of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I am excited to watch Austin continue to  thrive because of it.   Texas is the greatest State in America, and Austin is its leadoff  hitter.   May God bless Texas. May God bless this great Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to recognize pro-life  pregnancy centers and all the good they do for mothers and their unborn  children.   As a God-fearing father and grandfather, I have always believed that  life begins at the moment of conception. No one should ever be forced  to promote the abortion of an unborn baby against their will.   Rather than protecting free speech, a constitutional right, the  Federal Government is extorting speech by forcing these pregnancy  centers to contradict their pro-life message.   During my time in Congress, I have visited multiple pro-life  pregnancy centers around the 25th District of Texas. In particular, I  would like to highlight the Austin Pregnancy Resource Center and the  Cleburne Pregnancy Center, both of which I have been to.   These outstanding centers provide resources, information, and  emotional support for those soon-to-be moms. They also provide after- care for moms and their baby, such as supplies, clothing, and  education, as we previously heard. Women deserve to know there are  better options than abortion and that there are facilities out there to  help them.   The bottom line, Americans and organizations should not be forced by  the government to promote ideas that conflict with their beliefs. As a  steadfast pro-life supporter, I will continue advocating for the rights  of the unborn and the centers that fight for them.   In God we trust.
