 Mr. President, over the past few years, the national  headlines have been dominated by stories about the high cost of  pharmaceuticals. We have seen jaw-dropping examples of companies  raising the cost of their products overnight, pricing too many families  out of the prescription drugs they need to survive. Just last week,  House and Senate Committees charged with oversight of the  pharmaceutical industry heard heartbreaking testimony from family  members of those dependent on insulin who have been forced to ration  their treatment because the annual cost of insulin has nearly doubled  since 2012. That is appalling, and putting Americans into that kind of  situation is unacceptable.   Lawmakers across the political spectrum, including President Trump,  agree that Congress needs to act to rein in these spiraling  prescription drug prices. Pharmaceutical companies should be  compensated for their important work developing lifesaving treatments.  But when companies engage in predatory practices at the expense of  consumers, we must act. That is why today I am reintroducing the  Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES)  Act, bipartisan legislation to end inappropriate delay tactics that are  used by some brand-name drug companies to block competition from more  affordable generic drugs. I am glad to be joined by Senators Grassley,  Klobuchar, Lee and 24 other Senators of both parties in introducing  this bill today.   The first delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the  withholding of drug samples that generic manufacturers need to gain  regulatory approval. Federal law requires generic competitors to prove  that their low-cost alternative is equally safe and effective as the  brand-name drug with which they wish to compete. Unfortunately, some  brand-name companies are preventing generic manufacturers from  obtaining the samples they need to make the necessary comparison. This  simple delay tactic misuses regulatory safeguards as a weapon to block  competition.   The second delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the  development of shared safety protocols. For some high-risk drugs,  Federal law requires a generic drug manufacturer to join the brand-name  drug manufacturer in a single, shared safety protocol for distribution  of the drug. Despite this requirement, some brand-name companies are  refusing to negotiate shared safety protocols with potential generic  competitors, again undermining those competitors' ability to gain FDA  approval for their generic versions of such drugs.   The CREATES Act allows the FDA more discretion to approve alternative  safety protocols, rather than require parties to develop shared safety  protocols. Any safety protocol approved by the FDA must meet the  rigorous statutory standards already in place.   These exclusionary practices thwart competition and deny consumers  the benefit of lower drug prices. Recognizing the effect these tactics  have in keeping drug prices high, in May 2018, FDA for the first time  publicly identified brand-name drug companies that abuse FDA's safety  programs or enact their own restricted distribution systems to delay  competition from generic and biosimilar manufacturers. The FDA's list  shows 164 inquiries covering more than 50 prescription drugs where  access to samples was at issue. In recent years, according to FDA  testimony to Congress, the number of inquiries has increased.   I share the concerns of Vermonters and Americans across the country  that many prescription drugs are simply too expensive. I hear this  again and again, from Vermonters in every corner of our state. When  brand companies can artificially raise the price of drugs by using  predatory practices, patients suffer. Illnesses worsen. Families,  government programs, and other payers in the healthcare system  ultimately bear those added, unnecessary costs.   Making meaningful reform to reduce the cost of prescription drugs  should be a top priority for all lawmakers. The CREATES Act is an  important piece of that puzzle, and is widely supported across the  political spectrum and has  [[Page S869]]  been endorsed by more than 90 groups. The Congressional Budget Office  estimates that the CREATES Act would lower Federal spending on  prescription drugs by $3.9 billion and research shows that the savings  to patients with employer-based health insurance and the health care  system overall would be far greater--many billions of dollars more.   Think for a moment about the impact of price hikes on the family of a  patient facing a life-threatening illness. Across the country,  hardworking Americans feel like the system is rigged against them by  corporations that are looking to make a profit at any price. With  examples like Turing and Mylan, it is no wonder they feel that way.   The CREATES Act is one piece of the puzzle, addressing  anticompetitive behavior that delays the creation of affordable generic  drugs. Drug affordability is a bipartisan issue that affects each and  every American. These reforms will make a difference. I hope we can  finally act together to help put more affordable prescription drugs in  the hands of Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. President, over the past few years, the national  headlines have been dominated by stories about the high cost of  pharmaceuticals.
