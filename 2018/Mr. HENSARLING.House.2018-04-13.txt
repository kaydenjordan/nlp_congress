 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 811, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4790) to amend the Volcker rule to give the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System sole rulemaking authority, to  exclude community banks from the requirements of the Volcker rule, and  for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, another day, another strong bipartisan bill presented to  the House by the House Financial Services Committee.   I take great pride in that fact.   Today, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4790, the Volcker Rule  Regulatory Harmonization Act.   I want to thank, first, the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for  his leadership on the issue and so many other issues in front of our  committee.   And I want to thank his bipartisan partner, the Democrat gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Foster) for his leadership on his side of the aisle  on this very important piece of legislation.   As a result of their hard work, this bill was reported out of our  committee, Mr. Speaker, 50-10, which means 80 percent--80 percent--of  our colleagues on the committee supported the legislation, including a  majority of the Democrats.   Now, Mr. Speaker, we enjoy, in America, the deepest, strongest, and  most liquid capital markets, frankly, the world has ever known, and  that helps us have a very strong, strong progrowth economy.   Our capital markets are vital; vital to the job growth and job- creating machine in America. Our capital markets provide very important  funding to Main Street businesses and to entrepreneurs for short-term  operations and long-term growth.   Main Street businesses, for example, like an equipment and party  rental store in my district, whose owner is named Arlis, who told me,  ``The number one issue for me to keep the doors open is access to  capital.''   That is why it is so critical that we ensure that he has access to  capital.   I also heard from Jeff from Henderson County in the Fifth District of  Texas that I have the privilege of representing. He owns a farm and  ranch store, and he explained, ``During the past year, I have been able  to expand my business location and double my inventory. I have been  able to hire additional employees as I grow. Without access to credit,  things like this would not be possible.''   Just two quick little vignettes about how in our economy capital  formation, access to credit, how important that is for the job engine  of America.   So again, Mr. Speaker, members of the House Financial Services  Committee on both sides of the aisle have been working very hard on  bipartisan pieces of legislation that can result in smarter, more  efficient, more effective regulation that our hardworking taxpayers  expect so that we can have robust capital formation and our job  creators, our small business people like Jeff and Arlis, can continue  to grow and prosper.   H.R. 4790 is just one example of this type of legislation.  Specifically, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4790 will streamline the regulatory  authority set forth in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, a section  more commonly known as the Volcker rule. It provides a framework that  will provide increased regulatory clarity for entities that must comply  with the Volcker rule. It does this by consolidating--consolidating-- rulemaking authority and interpretation with the Federal Reserve Board,  and for purposes of examination and enforcement, designating the  primary Federal regulator for a covered entity as the sole regulator in  those capacities.   The challenge here, Mr. Speaker, is that some entities can have as  many as five different regulators interpreting the Volcker rule and  five different regulators enforcing the Volcker rule. Sometimes they  conflict with each other, Mr. Speaker, and, frankly, the entity doesn't  know what to do. You cannot have an economy based on the rule of law  when, frankly, you don't know what the law says.   So the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) brings a very simple bill  to the House floor that says we are going to have one--one--regulator  in charge of interpreting the rules, and the primary regulator is going  to be in charge of enforcing the rule. It is common sense. It creates  efficiency.                                time  0915    Now, I want to be clear about one thing: H.R. 4790 does not repeal  the Volcker rule. I wish it did, but it doesn't. That is not what we  are debating here today.   Outside of providing important relief to community banks--bipartisan  regulatory relief that, by the way, has already been approved by a  strong two-  [[Page H3216]]  thirds of our Senate colleagues--this bill doesn't require any changes  to the Volcker rule itself.   I highlight this because this legislation, again, represents  something that Members of Congress should agree on, that regardless of  how you stand on a particular rule or regulation, it at least ought to  be clear, and there ought to be one interpretation and one enforcer of  the rule so that you know what the rule is. You can't abide by the rule  if you don't know what the rule is. This is only common sense, and it  can only lead to, again, stronger, deeper, more liquid capital markets  to help our job creators.   So regardless of whether we support the Volcker rule or we wish to  repeal it, hopefully, we can at least agree that it shouldn't be  unnecessarily complex and burdensome and virtually impossible to abide  by. And so that, again, is what H.R. 4790 is simply trying to do.   Mr. Speaker, I commend this piece of legislation to all of my  colleagues. It is a very important piece of legislation, again,  strongly bipartisan. Eighty percent of the Members of the House  Financial Services Committee support it.   Again, I want to commend the leadership of the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), and with that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds just to say I  am not sure what bill the ranking member is debating. It does not  appear to be H.R. 4790, and I have my own quotes.   Paul Volcker, himself, said the Volcker rule is ``much more  complicated than I would like to see.''   President Obama's Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, said:  ``Implementation of the Volcker rule is, frankly, complex. . . .''   President Obama's Federal Reserve Governor Tarullo said: ``Several  years of experience have convinced me that . . . the Volcker rule is  too complicated.''   President Obama's former Comptroller of the Currency said the Volcker  rule ``has been one of the most complex rulemakings I can remember  being involved in.''   That is why we need to simplify it.   Mr. Speaker, I am now very happy to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the bill's sponsor, one of the hardest  working and most knowledgeable members on our committee.                                time  0930     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), who is the chairman of the Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investment Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and  Insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Wisconsin an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), who has come to actually speak on H.R. 4790 as  opposed to H.R. red herring, the vice chairman of the Financial  Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), who is familiar with the eight-page  bill and knows that H.R. 4790 does not repeal the Volcker rule. He  happens to be the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee  on Terrorism and Illicit Finance.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Williams), the vice chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Monetary Policy and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, the majority has three more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), another hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), a great member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a good member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I listened very carefully to my friend and ranking  member describe this parade of horribles that is going to befall our  economy if H.R. 4790 is enacted, I would gently remind her that a  majority of her own Members supported it. So all of these accusations  that she has made against the majority party, I hope, and believe, she  has, obviously, foisted upon the majority of her own Members who  clearly do not support her in what she is attempting to do.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, I would remind all Members, contrary to the  Volcker rule, that weighs in at almost 1,000 pages, H.R. 4790 weighs in  at 8 pages. If you read the bill, you will discover that it does not  repeal the Volcker rule. Again, I don't know what bill the ranking  member was debating, but it is not H.R. 4790.   Now, Mr. Speaker, just think about it for a second. Paying your  taxes--tax day is coming up--is not a pleasant time of year. And as  unpleasant as that time is, think if you had to file your taxes with  five different Federal agencies. Think about the fact that if you had a  question about your taxes, that you had to call the Internal Revenue  Service, you had to call the Department of Labor, you had to call the  EPA, and you had to call the CFPB. What if you had five different  agencies interpreting the Internal Revenue Code, all enforcing it in  different ways? That would take one of the worst days of the year and  compound it mightily.   What the gentleman from Arkansas is trying to do on the majority  side, and what the gentleman from Illinois is trying to do on minority  side, is say: If we are going to have a Volcker rule--one of the most  complicated, complex rules ever devised by the mind of man--maybe we  ought to have one agency interpret it and one agency enforce it.   Why do we do that, Mr. Speaker?   We do that so that capital can be available to the people I spoke  about in my opening statement. So that Jeff and Arlis can have capital  to expand their small businesses on Main Street. That is what this is  all about--so that our small businesses can thrive, so that the people  who want to own a home can thrive, and so that this economy can grow.  This is commonsense. It is why it is a strong, bipartisan measure-- another strong, bipartisan measure that, unfortunately, our ranking  member chooses not to partake in. And it is one of the reasons why,  unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, if we listen to that side of the aisle--or  at least a particular voice--we will continue to have bad economic  growth. We need good economic growth for all of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 4790, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 300,  nays 104, not voting 25, as follows:                               [Roll No. 139]                                 YEAS--300       Abraham      Adams      Aderholt      Aguilar      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barragan      Barton      Beatty      Bera      Bergman      Beyer      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Blunt Rochester      Bost      Boyle, Brendan F.
