 Mr. President, we recently lost a great Rhode  Islander, Ernie Baptista.   Ernie was immensely successful in his professional life; his wise  counsel was sought not just around the country but around the globe.  Ernie was also a civic-minded community leader at home, with a passion  for politics. He immersed himself in Rhode Island's political whirl,  where he was well liked and well regarded by people of many different  political perspectives. Ernie's keen insight and advice was relied upon  by many candidates, including myself and Senator Reed. We both  treasured Ernie's quick wit, sharp intellect, and great sense of humor.  He was bright, insightful, and loyal and always provided wise counsel.   Ernie enjoyed the good things in life: good friends, good meals, and  good  [[Page S7277]]  works. We will fondly remember Ernie with a trademark cigar in hand and  a smile on his face and the way his presence filled every room he  entered. We will remember his generous and kind spirit, which lifted us  all.   Our deepest condolences go to Ernie's beloved family, Sharon, Peter,  and Jennifer. We mourn your great loss.   To Ernie, rest in peace, dear friend.                            ____________________
