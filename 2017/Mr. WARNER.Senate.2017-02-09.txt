 Mr. President, I am here to speak about Mr. Price, but I  want to respond to my friend the Senator from Nebraska.   I appreciate very much the independence the Senator has shown in his  tenure in the Senate. My hope would be that his comments about civics,  his comments about our three branches of government--I hope we will  take that speech and actually send it down to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  because I concur with him. I concur with him about the basic civics  lessons he laid out. I concur with him about three equal branches of  government. I concur with him about the fact that I look forward to  hearing from Judge Gorsuch and having my chance to view him.   But I would also think that in any kind of objective analysis of what  our country is going through right now, we have currently a President  of the United States who--I have real questions whether he has read  that document, the Constitution, whether he understands the basic  tenets of three coequal branches.   We saw his activities during a campaign where he called out a judge  because of his ethnic heritage and somehow impugned that judge's  independence. At some point, he walked that back, and perhaps those of  us who were kind of scratching our heads thought, well, that is just  during the campaign, and candidates do strange things during the  campaign.   Then we saw the President get elected, and we saw throughout a  transition period decrees by twitter that are, again, unprecedented in  modern activity. I know the President wants to be a disrupter, but  there is some level of comity and some level of civics and some level  of recognition of coequal branches that--candidly, when the President  of the United States attacks a judge because he doesn't like the ruling  in a way that calls into substance not the substance of the ruling but  the very nature of the judiciary, I think all of us--and I know the  Senator from Nebraska would agree with this--all of us need to sit up  and say this is not what the Founders intended.   I look forward to giving Judge Gorsuch and everyone else the  President might nominate a fair look, a fair appeal, and then making a  judgment on whether I think one of the most important positions--a  lifetime position of serving on our Nation's highest Court--whether he  is appropriate or not. But this President makes that case harder for  his nominee when he shows such blatant disregard of the fundamental  basics of our Constitution.   I would be more than happy and glad if we would all dial it back a  bit, but we are in uncharted territory in a way that, as somebody who  believes every bit as much in the Constitution as the Presiding Officer  does, it makes me very concerned about making sure we maintain those  basic liberties, making sure we have a government that can live within  its means, making sure we maintain the independence of the judiciary,  the independence of our legislative body, and an Executive who knows  there are limits on Presidential powers.   I appreciate his comments and particularly appreciate the fact that  through his tenure in the Senate, he has shown a level of independence.  I have taken some hits from my own team for showing similar levels of  independence. I commend his words, but I do hope that those words would  actually make their way down to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I am curious  to see what the President's tweeting response to that speech would be.   Mr. President, I did come here, though, today to rise and talk about  a need that Virginians and, for that matter, Americans have, about a  health care system that is affordable and accessible and provides high- quality health care.   I voted for the Affordable Care Act back in 2010, and I have  acknowledged, I think along with many of us, that just like every major  reform--just like Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid--Congress  never gets it 100 percent right the first time and that Congress needed  to revisit and improve certain aspects of the ACA.   As anybody who serves in the legislative body knows, you have to have  partners in order to get to yes. Unfortunately, that is what we have  heard from folks on the other side for the last 7 years. We have heard  all the critiques, we have heard the screech of repeal, but we have not  heard any kind of plan on what you replace.   The fact is, like it or not, ACA has played a critical role in  driving health care innovation, protecting consumers, and reducing  overall health care spending. Those are just facts--not alternative  facts, not alt acts; those are just facts. The increased coverage to  more people now makes it all the more difficult to find some way to  repeal and maintain all the things that people liked, yet replace it  with a plan that is actually more cost-effective.   So today we consider a candidate for Secretary of Health and Human  Services, the lead Cabinet member who will oversee our critical health  care programs. Congressman Price has advocated for dismantling the ACA,  and he has made it clear that, as Secretary of HHS, he would seek to  implement policies that, I believe, will make health care more  expensive and less accessible to Virginians.   Today, after a great deal of reflection, I join my colleagues in  opposing Congressman Price's nomination to be Secretary of HHS. And  rather than going through the statistics and facts--I know I have other  colleagues who want to speak--I want to reflect briefly on a couple of  stories I have heard from Virginians.   One of the things that was a benefit but I don't think folks have  focused on enough is that the ACA, with all its challenges, did allow  people freedom from the trap of being caught in a dead-end job that  they couldn't move from because of the fear of losing their health care  benefits. This was the first move toward an affordable benefits system,  something I think we are going to have to move beyond health care to  retirement and other aspects, as well, as more and more workers work  not in traditional full-time and long-term employment, but more and  more--one-third of the workforce today already is in some form of  contingent work: part-time work, independent contractors, gig work.  They have no benefits, other than the fact that through the ACA they  are able to maintain health care. The ACA has actually reduced this  phenomenon of ``job lock.''   A couple of weeks ago, I met Andrea in Richmond. She always dreamed  of opening a software business, but she and her business partner were  considered uninsurable because of preexisting conditions. The ACA  changed everything. After obtaining insurance through the exchanges,  Andrea and her business partner were able to take that risk. Today,  that successful company has a staff of 12. As Andrea said: ``Simply  put, my business would not exist without the security the Affordable  Care Act provided.''   The coverage gains we have seen are remarkable. That is clear from  hundreds of Virginians who have contacted me with stories like  Andrea's. In fact, never before in our Nation's history has the rate of  uninsured dropped below 10 percent. In Virginia, a State where our  legislature unfortunately would not expand Medicaid, we have still seen  an uninsured rate drop from 15 percent to 9 percent, and 327,000  Virginians got additional coverage. This is especially true in rural  areas.   Nationwide, the ACA lowered the percentage of uninsured by eight  points in rural communities. Rural communities often struggle with  hospitals that, without ACA, would be on the brink of financial  extinction.   Here is another quick example from Janet in Mosely, a rural area  south of Richmond, who grows and sells organic vegetables to support  her family, which includes four children. She said:         We went through various attempts to manage the cost of       health insurance and health care in our finances before the       ACA--with no  [[Page S996]]       good results. [Because of ACA], we have been able to have an       appropriate plan, with a realistic deductible, access to       quality doctors, and be able to go to preventative care       annual appointments. We are quite fearful about what life and       business may be like without the ACA, or an improved-upon       version of the ACA. A repeal would be disastrous.    Unfortunately, not only has Congressman Price strongly opposed the  ACA, but his plan--or what framework of a plan you see--and other  proposals dramatically scale back the individual market reforms that  allow people like Andrea and Janet to obtain meaningful coverage. As  our workforce becomes more mobile than ever, Congressman Price has said  people should have access to care, but access to care without  affordable care isn't true access.   For example, if you got rid of the ACA with no plan to replace it, we  would see the reinstatement of lifetime and annual limits on coverage.  They are what turned getting sick into a financial calamity for so many  people. Plans would be required to cover far less in terms of  conditions, moving away from the ACA's promise that insurance is worth  more than the paper it is written on.   As I mentioned already, the close to one-third of the workforce that  is already in some level of nontraditional work and doesn't work full  time in a long-term employment facility would lose that flexibility to  move from job to job.   We have also heard from Congressman Price plans to block-grant, for  example, Medicare. We in Virginia have a very trim Medicaid program. We  have also not expanded Medicare, which I think was a grave mistake of  the legislature. The Governor and I agreed we should expand it. Putting  a Block Grant Program in place for Virginia would be a disaster in  terms of Medicaid. As well, Congressman Price has voted against the  Children's Health Insurance Program, the CHIP program, one of the  things I was proud to expand in Virginia, where we ended up signing up  98 percent of all eligible children. Congressman Price called the CHIP  program ``government-run socialized medicine.'' What he didn't say is  what he would say to the 200,000-plus kids in Virginia who get their  health care coverage through CHIP.   So I believe that Congressman Price's approach--whether it is on  Medicaid block-granting, whether it is on the ACA, whether it is on the  CHIP program, whether it is his failure to come up with a sufficient  plan to provide access and affordability--means that if we go forward  with his nomination, the kind of chaos that would be created if you  repeal the ACA without a replacement plan in place will not only affect  the 20 million-plus Americans who got health care coverage through the  ACA but literally everyone else because it will absolutely pull the  bottom out of the overall insurance market. These are chances that we  can't take.   I have a series of other stories, but I see my friend the Senator  from Connecticut, who spent a great deal of time on this issue back  when there weren't that many people coming to the floor to defend the  ACA. I guess it is better to be early and right, but Congressman Murphy  has been a great leader on this issue. He was here, as I mentioned, on  the floor, when many of us were active in other activities, an absolute  native of the ACA, when we went through the bad rollout. But what we  have seen in America, as we get closer now to the reality of the new  administration, is that the new majority wants to actually repeal this  program without fixing it--simply repeal. I think his forewarnings  about what would happen are all coming to pass.   I will personally be opposing the nomination of Congressman Price to  be Secretary of HHS. I hope my colleagues will join me.   I do want to yield the floor to the Senator from Connecticut, who has  been such a great leader on this issue.
