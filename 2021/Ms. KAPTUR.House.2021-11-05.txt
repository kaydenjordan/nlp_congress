 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this historic  legislation and the related Rule to propel American progress. The  infrastructure bill along with the Build Back Better Act will usher in  a transformational 21st century for the American people. Rebuilding our  nation's infrastructure will create millions of living wage jobs for  the American people coast to coast. It will add value through work in  every state, hamlet, district and territory of our nation.   This measure rewards work in every sector--in both hardware and  software. The motor vehicle industry, new carbon free energy systems,  modern highways, airports, bridges, ports, rail grade separations,  broadband, and so much more. These bills strengthen America's families  and communities by relieving economic burdens that have held them back.  It allows millions of Americans to access affordable health insurance  and medications, child and elder care, and robust education and  workforce training to meet new horizons in this new era.   Major investments in education and health care for our children and  seniors have been long overdue. And, the environmental provisions to  heal our earth in an era of climate change will restore clean water,  clean air, healthy forests, and regenerative soils.   Please let me thank all the Committees and Members who have worked so  very hard on this measure. The cost of the related bills is paid for  and, as more jobs are created, and the overall wealth of our nation  increases, not only the annual deficit but also the accumulated  national debt will begin to be repaid. By passing these bills, this  Chamber meets its obligations to the American people of today and  tomorrow. Let us pass this transformative legislation as a critical  step in advancing its content to the other body. We acknowledge more  changes will likely occur as the bill moves forward. But tonight, this  House embraces the future.
