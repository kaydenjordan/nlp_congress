 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation, and I thank Congresswoman DeLauro and Chairwoman Lee for  their hard work and support of the priorities that I have included in  this bill as it relates to the Central American region.   We must ensure our aid to Central America helps the people it is  intended to help and advance our policy goals, including reducing  migration.   My Republican colleagues yesterday noted that what we have done in  the past is not working and has not worked, and I agree with them 100  percent.   The Trump administration turned a blind eye to corruption in the  region and emboldened predatory, corrupt government officials.   For the last 4 years, we effectively looked at the symptoms and not  at the systematic failures that forced the region's most vulnerable  asset, their young people, to flee to our border.   So if Guatemalan President Giammattei truly does believe in the rule  of law, he should show us with his actions. Recently, they have fired  Francisco Sandoval. He needs to be reinstated. The Guatemalan people in  Guatemala deserve a judicial sector and leaders with his credibility to  advance his cases of corruption.   I am so glad to report that my priorities in this bill include  restricting 75 percent of the funding that has gone to all three  governments--El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala--to ensure that the  money is actually reaching the people that it is intended.   Furthermore, we have never in the past restricted or put conditions  on funding to their attorney general's office. In this bill, we have  included an amendment that restricts all funding to the attorney  general.   Our goal here is to reduce migration and to ensure that the young  people in the region can see a future for themselves and take their  governments back.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I thank our brand new congresswoman  and her staff for the hard work that she has put before us in this  committee.
