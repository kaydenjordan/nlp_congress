 Mr. Speaker, there is no denying that Congress must take  action to improve our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. But, sadly,  bipartisan negotiations have hit a roadblock, and the infrastructure  legislation on the floor this week is a go-at-it-alone, my-way-or-the- highway bill.   Instead of focusing on traditional infrastructure, Democrats have  chosen to prioritize the left's Green New Deal agenda. This bill  includes an estimated $276 billion for Green New Deal-related mandates,  requirements, and programs. To put that into perspective, $1 out of  every $2 spent by this legislation is tied up in Green New Deal goals.   Further, this bill reduces flexibility for States to meet their own  unique infrastructure needs and fails to streamline major project  reviews, which typically face a 6-year delay. To make matters worse,  the spending increases proposed in this bill rely heavily on more  deficit spending. There are no pay-fors, which will only further fuel  inflation and increase the cost of goods like gas and food.   We need commonsense solutions that truly work to improve our roads,  bridges, railways, and rural broadband. I am pleased to hear that there  are bipartisan negotiations underway to achieve these goals, but this  bill this week veers off the road and into a partisan ditch.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' later this week on H.R. 3684.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life and legacy of  Anne Seaton, who went to be with the Lord on April 23, 2021.   Anne was a pillar of the Sixth District of Virginia, but her light  shone well beyond the valley.   Charitable at heart, Anne and the Mehnert family served as  missionaries in Jamaica and hosted refugees from New Orleans after  Hurricane Katrina to help provide comfort and aid to those afflicted.   In the valley, Anne was a passionate supporter of Grace Christian  School and Wilson High School, as well as one who helped fundraise for  the Waynesboro Symphony Orchestra.   Further, Anne was active in local politics, including the successful  campaign of her husband Scott to the Augusta County Board of  Supervisors.   Anne was the founder of the Republican Women of Greater Augusta and  inspired many to get involved in the community.   Above all, though, it was Anne's family and her faith that defined  her. A loving wife to Scott, mother to Joscelyn Hodge and her husband  Christopher, Phillip, Samuel, and Daniel, friend and daughter, Anne was  a devoted follower of Jesus Christ and was a member of Tabernacle  Presbyterian Church.   Anne has a grandchild due in December.   Anne not only believed in her faith, but she lived it as exemplified  through her life's work.   Living through our faith is a lesson we can all learn from the late  great Anne Seaton.   Anne is greatly missed and will not soon be forgotten.          Recognizing Amherst County High School Girls Softball Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Amherst County  High School girls softball team for winning this year's Class 4 State  Championship.   It was a defensive game all around, and Amherst County's pitcher,  Dylan McNerney, kept the Lancers in it with an incredible performance,  striking out 10 batters.   With the game tied at zero at the end of regulation, it took extra  innings for the Lancers to pull off a victory against the Hanover  Hawks.   Before the final inning began, head coach Samantha Thacker told the  team: ``This is our time, this is our inning, we have got to stay  settled and be patient,'' and they did just that.   In the top of the eighth, two errors by the Hawks put runners on base  for Amherst County with one out.   When Kayleigh Combs stepped up to bat, she put the ball into play,  and an overthrow allowed Cheyenne Wall to race home from third giving  the Lancers a one to nothing lead. Soon after, a wild pitch brought  Maegan Lloyd home adding another run to the board.   With a two to nothing lead heading into the bottom of the eighth, the  Lancers were able to keep the Hawks scoreless, securing the team's  first ever State softball title.   Congratulations to the players and coaches on a great season, they  have earned it.                            ____________________
