 Madam Speaker, I rise to support the Social Determinants  Accelerator Act.   The community that lives in the 61605 ZIP Code in Peoria, Illinois,  is vibrant and beautiful, but they face significant challenges. It is  one of the most distressed ZIP Codes in the entire Nation, a food  desert. And soon its only pharmacy will shut their doors, leaving them  with fewer options for basic healthcare.   Each of these factors can have a big impact on the health of every  person in the community. All 14 of the counties in the district that I  serve face healthcare provider shortages. Half of those counties face  provider shortages for mental, physical, and dental healthcare.   That is why I introduced the Social Determinants Accelerator Act, to  empower our local communities to address the day-to-day factors that  affect their lives. Today, the Energy and Commerce Committee heard my  bill. I thank Chairman Pallone for his leadership on this issue. I urge  my colleagues to support it because communities like 61605 in Peoria,  Illinois, deserve better.                            ____________________
