 Mr. President, I wanted to start by stating that I know a  lot of people look at us speaking on the floor and think, you know,  well, why aren't they wearing masks?   I saw Senator Schumer. He put on his mask after he finished his talk  and left. I have my mask here. I just took it off. I am going to put it  on after I finish speaking.   You know the way this works. I wear this mask to protect you, and you  wear a mask to protect me, and that is the way we protect each other in  this pandemic. I don't think there is any doubt that wearing a mask  saves lives, and that is how we are going to overcome in this pandemic.   I see people around New Mexico all the time when I am back home  wearing masks and really taking this pandemic seriously and taking our  Governor's orders seriously.                                  H.R. 6172    Mr. President, reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act, or FISA, is now before us. We have an opportunity to  reform this statute, to protect both our constitutional rights and our  security. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, Congress hurriedly passed  the PATRIOT Act and authorized extraordinarily broad authority to the  Executive and the executive branch that threatened America's and  Americans' privacy rights and liberty interests.    In October 2001, I was 1 of 66 Members in the House of  Representatives who voted against the PATRIOT Act. It was not an easy  vote, but in the years since, it is clear that it was the correct vote  because the PATRIOT Act ultimately allowed the government to invade the  privacy of millions of innocent Americans.   Exhibit 1: section 215 of the act. Section 215 has been greatly  abused, resulting in the bulk collection of hundreds of millions of  Americans' phone records and email contact lists.   The Nation was shocked when we found out about this bulk collection  in 2013. In 2015, we passed the FREEDOM Act to cure some of the abuses.  It did not cure them all.   Section 215 and two other provisions of the PATRIOT Act are up for  reauthorization. That is the bill before us. Congress has the  opportunity to protect our civil liberties even as we protect national  security.   And while the House bill made improvements, it is still flawed. The  House version still allows large-scale collection of Americans'  sensitive information, and it doesn't reform the FISA Courts to prevent  abuses. We should learn the lesson of October 2001 and not rush this  through the Senate. We should include amendments to better protect  Americans' civil liberties.   I support the Wyden-Daines amendment that prohibits collection of  Americans' internet website browsing and internet search history  information without a search warrant. It is a missed opportunity for  the Nation that the amendment failed yesterday, although by one vote-- by one vote.   Right now, the Federal Government can digitally track articles  Americans are reading online, social media they are using, where they  are shopping, which restaurants they are thinking about going to, and  the list goes on and on. Just imagine thinking about everything you do  on the internet and your devices. That is open game.   The Fourth Amendment protects us against unreasonable searches. In  this day and age, when so much of our life is conducted over the  internet, Americans must have assurance that their web browsing, which  can reveal highly sensitive information, will not be unreasonably  intruded upon by Federal authorities without a search warrant and  without probable cause. This information provides an intimate window  into our lives. It can reveal a person's medical conditions, political  and religious views, and far more.   We need to make clear that government must demonstrate probable cause  to collect this type of personal information.   Second, we need to strengthen the oversight of FISA Courts. We know  these secret courts are subject to abuse. In 2015, Congress authorized  FISA Courts to appoint amici--friends of the court--in cases involving  novel  [[Page S2436]]  or significant interpretation of the law. This was a positive step  forward to provide independent oversight, but it appears there have  been only 16 cases in which amici have actually been appointed. Yet  there have been more cases than 16 in which novel issues were raised  and many more cases where an independent voice is needed to defend  civil rights in FISA Court proceedings.   The recent Department of Justice inspector general report examining  25 FISA applications underscores this need. The IG found errors and  inadequately supported facts in every application. An expanded amicus  role is necessary to bring greater accountability to the application  process.   I voted in support of the Lee-Leahy amendment that expands amici  participation to significant First Amendment activities; to matters  where a religious or political organization, a public official or  candidate or the news media is involved; and to matters approving new  technology or reauthorizing programmatic surveillance.   Third, we must make sure FISA applications are completely accurate  and all exculpatory evidence is disclosed. Accuracy and transparency  are critical to maintaining integrity within our justice system.   The Lee-Leahy amendment strengthens the requirements for accuracy and  disclosure of all information--including exculpatory information--in  FISA applications.   I am pleased this body stood in support of strengthening safeguards  in the FISA Court process. However, our failure to protect Americans  from the Federal Government looking over their shoulders while they are  on the internet and collecting personal information is unacceptable.  National security does not require the Federal Government intruding  upon the private lives of Americans without probable cause and a search  warrant.   Our liberties and freedoms define us as a nation. Either we should  reconsider the Wyden-Daines amendment--a motion to reconsider is  allowed at this point--or we should vote no on FISA reauthorization. We  don't need to sacrifice our liberties and freedoms for an illusion of  security.   One of our Founders way back in this country, Ben Franklin, said it a  little bit differently. He said: ``Those who would give up liberty in  the name of security deserve neither.'                          Remembering Dennis Chavez    Now, Mr. President, before I yield the floor today, I would like to  commemorate one of New Mexico's great heroes, Senator Dennis Chavez,  who, 70 years ago this week, on May 12, 1950, stood on this floor of  the U.S. Senate and was the first in the Senate to sound the alarm  against Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had begun his reign of terror that  year.   Dennis Chavez was born into a farming family in territorial New  Mexico. He had a seventh grade education and rose to become a  Georgetown University Law School graduate, the first American-born  Hispanic U.S. Senator and, at 27 years, the longest serving Hispanic  Senator in the history of our country.   Senator Chavez, or ``El Senador,'' as we call him in New Mexico, was  a man of great integrity. In February 1950, McCarthy had charged-- without proof--that there were 205 card-carrying Communists working in  the State Department. By March, he accused American scholar Owen  Lattimore, among others, of being a Communist. That accusation--also  without evidence--spurred Senator Chavez to take to the Senate floor,  to come down here and to speak out.   He told the Senate:         I would like to be remembered as the man who raised a       voice--and I devoutly hope not a voice in the wilderness--at       a time in the history of this body when we seem bent upon       placing limitations on the freedom of the individual. I would       consider all of the legislation which I have supported       meaningless if I were to sit idly by, silent, during a period       which may go down in history as an era where we are permitted       curtailments of our liberties, a period when we quietly       shackled the growth of men's minds.    Dennis Chavez.   The fact is, we are seeing chilling similarities between the Joseph  McCarthy of seven decades ago and the situation we are in today   Mr. President, this week marks the 70th anniversary of a courageous  address to this body. Seventy years ago, on May 12, 1950, the senior  senator from New Mexico--Dennis Chavez--was the first to call out the  unfairness of Joe McCarthy's communist witch hunt.   In May of 1950, it was still four and one-half years before the  Senate would vote to ``condemn'' the senator from Wisconsin. But, even  at that time, early in McCarthy's crusade, Senator Chavez recognized  the present danger.   That day, Senator Chavez took to the floor, with 77 other Senators in  attendance. That was a time when Senators engaged in genuine,  spontaneous debate in this chamber. Senator Chavez counseled his  colleagues: ``. . . a man is ultimately remembered by what he does in  relation to his times, and the fact that we do our assigned duty may  not be enough; sometimes we must step out and sound the alarm.''   And sound the alarm against McCarthy, he did.   Dennis Chavez--born Dionisio on April 4, 1888--came from humble and  honorable beginnings. He came from generations who had farmed in Los  Chavez--a small community along the Rio Grande, south of Albuquerque,  in territorial New Mexico. When he was seven, his family moved to  Albuquerque in search of better opportunities. He learned English in  school but, at age 13, when he was in 7th grade, he had to leave school  to help support his family.   Dennis, however, never left his education. He studied engineering,  American history, and great political leaders at the Albuquerque Public  Library. In his early 20's, he worked for the City of Albuquerque  Engineering Department, and also became active in Democratic politics.  He joined the Democratic Party, even though most Hispanics at that time  in New Mexico were Republicans. He saw in the ``Democratic party a  political philosophy that placed human rights above property rights.''   In 1917, a newly elected Democratic Senator from New Mexico took  Dennis to Washington where he worked for the clerk of the Senate.  Dennis took and passed the entrance examination for and eventually  graduated from Georgetown University Law School--all with less than a  7th grade education.   He returned to New Mexico to practice law, and was first elected to  the U.S. House of Representatives--representing New Mexico's one at- large district--in 1930. In 1935, he was appointed to a Senate seat  that had become vacant, and was elected in his own right the next year.  Senator Chavez served in the Senate until his death in November 1962.   In so many ways, he was far ahead of his time. In the 1940s, he  fought for civil rights legislation. In the 1950s, he chaired the  Public Works Committee and sat on the Appropriations Committee, and  helped usher in major infrastructure projects all over the nation,  including water and military projects critical to New Mexico's  development.   ``El Senador'', as we call him in New Mexico, was the first American- born Hispanic elected to the Senate and, at 27 years, remains the  longest serving Hispanic Senator in history.   Joseph McCarthy began his reign of terror on February 9, 1950, a  speech charging, without proof, that there were 205 card carrying  members of the Communist Party working in the U.S. State Department.   By March of that year, McCarthy had accused American scholar Owen  Lattimore, among many others, of being a Communist. That accusation,  again without evidence, was too much for Senator Chavez and it gave  rise to his denunciation on the floor of the Senate.   At that time, in 1950, Republicans held the presidency and both  houses in Congress. And no matter one's party--bucking any anti- Communist sentiment could be politically costly.   But Senator Chavez took his chances against Joe McCarthy--in the name  of what was right.   He told the Senate that day, ``I would like to be remembered as the  man who raised a voice--and I devoutly hope not a voice in the  wilderness--at a time in the history of this body when we seem bent  upon placing limitations on the freedom of the individual. I would  consider all of the legislation which I have supported meaningless if I  were to sit idly by, silent, during a period which may go down in  history as an era where we are permitted curtailments of our  [[Page S2437]]  liberties, a period when we quietly shackled the growth of men's  minds.''   Dennis Chavez's entire career is defined by his courage, by his  integrity, by his commitment to justice.   The similarities between Joseph McCarthy and Donald Trump between  McCarthyism and Trumpism are--chilling. Both are demagogues. Both lie  to the American people. Both try to destroy reputations and lives based  on falsehoods.   But the lessons learned from that dark period in our history are  lessons we can all learn from today.   First--is the lesson of courage.   In 1950, there were few--of any political party--willing to go up  against Senator McCarthy.   But there were exceptions. Less than a month after Senator Chavez's  floor speech, the junior senator from Maine--Margaret Chase Smith--the  first woman to serve in both the House and Senate--delivered her  ``Declaration of Conscience'' on the Senate floor. Joined by six other  brave Republicans, the ``Great Lady of Maine'' denounced the ``hate and  character assassination sheltered by the shield of congressional  immunity.''   Where is that courage now? There are those in the Senate majority who  understand the incompetence of this president. That he has an uneasy  relationship with the truth. That his words and actions so often  undermine basic American values.   But so few ever speak out. No one challenges his lies, his  divisiveness, his singular focus on his own ambition to the exclusion  of the welfare of American people.   In 1950, there were seven Senate Republicans who challenged Joseph  McCarthy.   In 2020, who has the courage to stand up to say, ``The Emperor has no  clothes''?   Second--is the lesson of truth-telling.   Senator McCarthy--and his chief counsel and chief henchman, Roy  Cohn--stacked lies upon lies, wild accusations upon wild accusations.  They attacked hundreds of government employees, those in the  entertainment industry, academics, and labor-union activists.   Careers were destroyed. Reputations damaged. Lives devastated.   Is this much different than what the President does to those who  question, disagree with, testify against him?   The impeachment proceedings against President Trump may seem distant  now. But history will remember them. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch,  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, Ambassador Bill Taylor, Deputy  Assistant Secretary George Kent, Fiona Hill, Pentagon official Laura  Cooper, State Department official David Holmes, OMB official Mark  Sandy--all told the truth. Stood up to the President and his threats.  And all are American heroes.   There is a direct line between Joe McCarthy and Donald Trump: they  chose the same lawyer, Roy Cohn. And the President's threats to the  brave men and women who testified are right out of Roy Cohn's playbook.   Third--is the lesson of demagoguery.   Joe McCarthy was a demagogue. His anti-communism met the times. He  played upon and stoked fear. And he accused those who spoke out against  him of disloyalty to the nation.   As Senator Chavez so eloquently put it on the Senate floor that day:  ``We have embarked upon a course which breeds hysteria and confusion--a  course so dangerous that few dare to oppose the drift lest they be the  next marked for destruction.''   But before us today--is Donald Trump--and his demagoguery is even  more dangerous. He too plays upon fear--and anger. He accuses the free  press of being ``enemies of the people.'' He rails against immigrants  invading our country, stoking hatred and racism.   He promises working class Americans greater prosperity.   But, in the end, he gives the tax breaks to the rich, uses the office  for personal gain, and ignores the needs of everyday Americans.   And--in the middle of the most devastating pandemic our nation has  faced in a century--he's told the American people no one saw a pandemic  was coming, that it's a hoax, that the virus will ``magically''  disappear, that we have the best testing system in the world all while  promoting snake oil remedies that could actually harm Americans.   But--the American people are not fooled. They see the emptiness of  his promises, the division he sows, and the lies he tells.   Seventy years ago, Senator Chavez said: ``It matters little if the  Congress appropriates hundreds of millions of dollars to check the  erosion of soil if we permit the erosion of our civil liberties, free  institutions, and the untrammeled pursuit of truth.''   Those words resonate as much today as they did then.   Members of Congress, of this body--must not permit the erosion of our  constitutional institutions, must not permit the erosion of truth.   Now--more than ever--we must aspire to the courage of Senator Chavez.  History will be the judge--by rewarding courage and exposing cowardice.   I will finish with one passage from 70 years ago. Senator Chavez  said:         It matters little if the Congress appropriates hundreds of       millions of dollars to check the erosion of soil if we permit       the erosion of our civil liberties, free institutions, and       the untrammeled pursuit of truth.    That is our own Senator from New Mexico, Senator Dennis Chavez. Those  words resonate as much today as they did then.   I see my good friend Senator Paul is here on the floor, so I believe  he is the next in line.   I yield the floor.
