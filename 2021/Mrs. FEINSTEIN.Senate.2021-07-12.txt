 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for  the private relief of Maria Isabel Bueso Barrera and her parents. Ms.  Bueso is a Guatemalan national living in Concord, California. She has a  rare medical condition, and her removal from the United States would  deprive her of lifesaving medical care.   Ms. Bueso suffers from a rare, life-threatening disorder called  Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (MPS-VI), a rare genetic condition caused  by the absence of an enzyme that is needed for the growth of healthy  bones and connective tissues. Ms. Bueso uses a wheelchair for mobility,  has a shunt in her brain, and requires a tracheotomy to help her  breathe.   In 2003, Ms. Bueso and her family came to the United States at the  invitation of doctors who were conducting a clinical trial to treat her  condition. That trial led to Food and Drug Administration-approved  treatment for MPS-VI. Ms. Bueso now receives this life-saving treatment  every week at UCSF Children's Hospital in Oakland, CA, where she unoes  a 6-hour infusion of a prescription drug that replaces the enzyme that  people with MPS-VI lack. Ms. Bueso has participated in six other  medical trials.   For the past 10 years, Isabel and her family received deferred action  from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services so that she could  continue receiving the treatments that keep her alive. This treatment  is not available in Guatemala.   On August 13, 2019, USCIS notified Ms. Bueso and her family that  their extensions of deferred action were denied, and that they would be  deported if they did not leave the United States within 33 days.   This decision was effectively a death sentence for Ms. Bueso. USCIS  ultimately reconsidered its decision and granted Ms. Bueso and her  parents an additional extension of deferred action.   Ms. Bueso has beaten the odds because of the life-saving treatment  that she has received in the United States. She is now 26 years old and  a 2018 graduate of California State University, East Bay. She has  become an outspoken advocate on behalf of people with rare diseases.  Her family pays taxes, owns a home, and is active in their community.   The Bueso family should be allowed to remain in California, where  they will continue to enrich their community, and where Isabel will be  able to receive the care that allows her to survive and thrive.   The legislation that I am introducing today would provide a permanent  solution for Isabel and her parents. I ask my colleagues to support  this private bill, which makes the Bueso family eligible for issuance  of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status.   I also ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be included in  the Record.                                  S. 2313         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR MARIA ISABEL BUESO                     BARRERA, ALBERTO BUESO MENDOZA, AND KARLA MARIA                     BARRERA DE BUESO.
