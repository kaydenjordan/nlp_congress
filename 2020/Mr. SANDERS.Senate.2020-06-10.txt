 Mr. President, as everybody knows, our country today  faces an extraordinary set of crises--unprecedented, in fact--in the  modern history of this country. Over the last several weeks, hundreds  of thousands of Americans from one end of this country to the other,  from big cities and small towns, have rightly taken to the streets to  demand an end to police murder and brutality and, in fact, to rethink  the nature of policing in America.   In the midst of that--that rising up for police department rethinking  and police department murder and brutality--our country continues to  suffer from the COVID-19 pandemic, which, in a number of locations in  this country, is actually getting worse and which has, up to this  point, killed over 110,000 people and infected over 2 million  Americans.   Then, on top of all of that--the struggle for racial justice and  dealing with a pandemic in the midst of all of that--we have the worse  economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the last  number of months, as you know, over 32 million Americans have lost  their jobs.   In the midst of the struggle for racial justice, in the midst of this  horrific healthcare crisis, and in the midst of this economic meltdown,  the American people are demanding to know what their government is  doing in response to these crises. We were elected as Senators and  Members of the House to respond to the needs of the American people.  All over this country the American people are looking around them. They  see the struggle for racial justice. They see a pandemic. They see an  economic meltdown. And many of them are asking what the Republican  leadership here in the Senate is doing. There is crisis after crisis  after crisis, and what is the leadership here in the Senate doing?  Tragically, the answer is nothing--nothing.   Historians have suggested that in the year 64 AD, while Rome was  burning, the Emperor Nero played his fiddle. At least he did something.  He provided entertainment to his court. But here, in the U.S. Senate,  Republican Leader McConnell and his leadership team are doing nothing.  Sadly, tragically, this is the worst do-nothing Senate in modern  American history, and every Member of this body should be deeply  ashamed at the degree to which we are failing our constituents.   Enough is enough. The U.S. Senate must respond to the pain and the  suffering of the American people. Let us quickly wrap up debate over  the Land and Water Conservation Fund act, which is on the floor right  now. Let us wrap up debate, and let us vote on this bill. It is a good  bill. Let's pass it. Then, let us begin to work on the unprecedented  crises that are facing our country.   If there is anything that the torture and murder of George Floyd by  Minneapolis police has taught us is that we have to rethink the nature  of policing in America and reform our broken and racist criminal  justice system.   Let us be clear. The murder of George Floyd is not just an isolated  incident. It is the latest in an endless series of police killings of  African Americans--including Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Laquan  McDonald, Tamir Rice, Alton Sterling, Breonna Taylor, Freddie Gray,  Rekia Boyd, Walter Scott, and many, many, many others. If anyone thinks  that these police murders have just begun to take place in recent years  when people had cell phone cameras, you would obviously have been  mistaken. This has gone on forever.   The American people are rightly demanding justice and an end to  police brutality and murder. The U.S. Senate has got to act now. We  have to hear the cries for justice that are coming from the streets of  this country, that are coming from the African-American community, from  the White community, from the Latino community, and from all of our  people. We must act and we must act now.   Let me just suggest some of the items that must be in the legislation  that we pass. This is a limited number. We can do more.  [[Page S2858]]    In my view, every police officer involved in a killing must be held  accountable, and those found guilty must be punished with the full  force of law. That includes officers who stand by while these brutal  acts take place. Every single killing of a person by police or while in  police custody must be investigated by the Department of Justice. We  must create a process by which police departments look like the  communities that they serve and not look like invading armies.   We need to abolish qualified immunity so police officers are held  civilly liable for abuses. We need to prohibit the transfer of  offensive military equipment to police departments. We need to strip  Federal funds from departments that violate civil rights. We need to  provide funding to States and municipalities to create a civilian corps  of unarmed first responders to supplement law enforcement.   For too long we have asked police departments to do things which they  are not trained or prepared to do and have criminalized societal  problems like addiction, homelessness, and mental illness. These are  not problems solved by incarceration.   We need to make records of police misconduct publicly available so  that an officer with a record of misconduct cannot simply move two  towns over and start again.   We need to require all jurisdictions that receive grant funding to  establish independent police conduct review boards that are broadly  representative of the community and that have the authority to refer  deaths that occur at the hands of police or in police custody to  Federal authorities for investigation.   We need to ban the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray  on protesters. We need to make certain that when people go to the  street to protest, they are not treated like criminals and their basic  constitutional rights are not denied. The struggle for racial justice  is just one of the crises that we have to address.   Today, we are looking at a pandemic unprecedented in the last 100  years, and I would tell you that New Zealand, a very small country of  about 5 million people, did something rather interesting--not  surprising but interesting. They listened to their scientists. They  acted boldly at the start of the pandemic, and they had political  leadership trusted by their citizens. The result is that just the other  day, New Zealand was able to announce that the COVID-19 virus was  virtually eliminated in their country and they could reopen their  economy safely--safely.   On the other hand, in the United States, under President Trump, we  have a President who downplayed the crisis from the very beginning, who  ignored or attacked scientists, and who most people recognize is a  pathological liar, not to be trusted.   In New Zealand and in many other countries, bold and intelligent  action saved lives, and in our country, incompetent leadership cost us  lives.   Well, we cannot bring back those who unnecessarily died or who have  become ill, but what we can do is take action now to do everything  possible to minimize unnecessary deaths and illness in the future.  First and foremost, we need a national protocol based on science to  address this pandemic and not have 50 States and hundreds of  communities going forward in different directions. There is a way to  effectively deal with this crisis, and that leadership should be coming  from the Federal Government. What we are talking about is the need,  among other things, for increased testing and how to best utilize that  testing as we talk about opening businesses and schools. We need,  through the Defense Production Act and any other approach, to make  certain that all medical personnel have the necessary personal  protective equipment that they need.   Even today, months after the pandemic erupted, doctors and nurses  still lack the equipment they need to protect themselves. I was on the  phone just a couple of weeks ago with people in Vermont who work in  clinics. They still do not have the protective equipment they need.   We need to produce hundreds of millions of the most effective masks  that we can so as to protect all Americans, above and beyond medical  personnel. Masks are an important part of fighting this pandemic, and  every American should be able to have the best quality masks possible.   Working with the international community, we need to make certain  that a safe vaccine is produced as quickly as possible and that it is  distributed to every American for free. I have asked the Trump  administration on several occasions. God willing, that vaccine will be  produced soon--as soon as possible. We all want that.   As you know, the Federal Government is spending billions of dollars  to help develop that vaccine, giving money to the drug companies. That  is fine, but after that vaccine is developed, it must be distributed to  every man, woman, and child in this country at no cost. I don't want to  see people dying because they can't afford to pay for a vaccine. I  don't want to see the drug companies profiteering from this Federal  investment.   When we are talking about responding to the pandemic, we are talking  about workers who are on the frontlines, whether they are medical  professionals, workers in transportation, grocery stores, drug stores,  meatpacking plants, or whatever. They must receive hazard pay for the  dangerous work that they do. I get a little bit tired of seeing these  TV ads from big corporations thanking the heroes who are out on the  frontlines. Well, that is great. Thank them, but pay them. Pay them  hazardous pay for the dangerous work that they are doing. We can no  longer allow multi-billion dollar corporations like Amazon, Walmart,  and Tyson Foods to treat essential workers like expendable workers-- like sacrificial workers. We can no longer allow multi-billion dollar  corporations to run advertising calling their workers ``heroes'' while  paying them starvation wages and treating them disrespectfully.   It is not just the racial justice crisis we face, not just the  pandemic we face, but we are in the midst of an unprecedented economic  crisis, and we must act boldly and aggressively to protect the American  people in the midst of this crisis. As we speak, tens of millions of  people have lost their jobs. They are worried about being evicted from  their apartments. They are worried about losing their homes. They are  worried about putting food on the table. In Vermont--and, I suspect, in  every State in this country--there are people lining up at emergency  food banks to get the food they need to feed their kids. Anyone who  thinks that this is not a moment of urgency does not understand what  the word urgency means. When people in America go hungry, we have to  act. When people are being evicted from their apartments or losing  their homes, we have to act, and we have to act now, not a month from  now, not 2 months from now.   No, President Trump, this is not a time to take a victory lap. The  real unemployment rate remains over 20 percent, the highest it has been  since the Great Depression. Unless we get our act together boldly, over  half of small business owners in America will be forced to close their  doors for good within the next 6 months. We need to respond vigorously  to the economic crisis that we face and the pain and suffering of the  American people.   Now, what does that mean? Again, these are just a few of the  provisions that have to be passed. We need to pass a paycheck security  act which does what many European countries do, and that is to provide  workers with 100 percent of the paychecks and benefits they previously  received. According to a recent study from the University of California  Berkeley, if we had adopted a paycheck guarantee program similar to the  one in Germany, 24 million Americans would have a job today. Instead,  we are seeing President Trump and Senator McConnell taking a victory  lap because we created some 2 million jobs last month. That is good,  but when we have 32 million people who have lost their jobs in recent  months, we have to act, and we have to act boldly.    In my view, during this crisis, we must make sure that every American  gets the healthcare they need by expanding Medicare to cover the  underinsured, the uninsured, and the needs of people who have private  insurance but inadequate private insurance. In my view, in the midst of  this crisis with so much economic suffering, we need to provide every  working-class  [[Page S2859]]  person in this country with a $2,000 emergency payment each and every  month until the crisis is over, so that they can pay the rent, feed  their families, and deal with their basic needs.   Furthermore, as a top priority, we have to make sure that nobody in  America goes hungry, and that means substantially expanding the Meals  on Wheels program, the school meals programs, and SNAP benefits.   Here we are. All over this country people are demanding an end to  police killings and brutality and demanding racial justice in this  country. All over this country, people are being infected with a virus  and continue to die, and all over this country, people are wondering  how they are going to pay their bills because they have lost their jobs  and have, in some cases, no food in the cupboard. If there was ever a  time in the modern history of this country that the Senate and the  House are called upon to stand up for families, for the working  families of this country, who are struggling, who are living in  emotional anxiety, who are scared to death about what is going to  happen in the future, and if we are to reaffirm faith in government in  this country to know that we are seeing and hearing that pain, now is  the time. So today, I just call upon my colleagues. I know we have  disagreements, but let us understand the urgency of the moment. Let's  deal with the pandemic. Let's save lives. Let's deal with the economic  crisis. Let's put people back to work. Let's deal with the issue of  racial justice. Let's fight to end racism in this country. There is an  enormous amount of work to be done. Let's do it. Thank you.    Mr. President, since 2010 I have sponsored a  State of the Union essay contest for Vermont high school students. This  contest gives students in my State the opportunity to articulate what  issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United  States.   This is the contest's 10th year, and I would like to congratulate the  536 students who participated. It is truly heartening to see so many  young people engaged in finding solutions for the problems that face  our country. To my mind, this is what democracy is all about.   A volunteer panel of Vermont teachers reviewed the essays, and chose  Isabelle Hiller as this year's winner. Isabelle, a junior at Woodstock  Union High School, wrote about reforming our incarceration system.  Lucas Whitaker, a sophomore at Hazen Union High School, was the second  place winner. Lucas wrote about youth suicide and the need for  comprehensive mental health care. Maya Marcy, a junior at Long Trail  School, was the third place winner, with an essay on the cost of  college.   I am very proud to enter into the Congressional Record the essays  submitted by Isabelle, Lucas and Maya:   Winner, Isabelle Hiller, Woodstock Union High School, Junior, Education                              in Incarceration         Our country's federal prison system is stuck in an ethical       rut. We seem to focus on securing institutions and confining       offenders like savage dogs in a pound to ``protect the       public,'' and disregard the fact that 44,000 prisoners return       to society each year. The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP)       claims that public safety is the goal of detention, but       without any mental shift in convicts, all we do is press       pause on their potential harm to society until their release.       Currently, we have one of the highest prison populations in       the world. Unless we plan to incarcerate all convicts for       life, our approach to detainment should shift from `prison'       to `rehabilitation', focusing on equipping prisoners with the       skills to be mentally stable and financially and lawfully       successful.        To do so, all prisoners should not only have access to       academic resources, but be required to attend a set number of       courses each year. Just a few decades ago, Finland had one of       the highest imprisonment rates in Europe. Because of this,       researchers started investigating its cause. They concluded       that punishment does not help reduce crime. As a result,       Finland began `decarceration,' which was better for the       prisoners and crime rates didn't increase. Without teaching       prisoners skills or continuing their education, we merely       take them out of their lives and throw them back with no       change, and no basis to be stable in any realm.        In the United States, prisoners have a higher likelihood of       returning to illegal markets and returning to prison. As of       October 2017, the BOP found that only 32 percent of the       entire designated inmate population was enrolled in one or       more education or recreation programs. Furthermore,       participation decreases 16 percent in the recidivism       population. The only academic requirement in our federal       prison system is that inmates without a high school diploma       or a General Education Development have to enroll in a       literacy program, and need to be successful for good conduct       time. However, even for this requirement alone, there is a       stoppage to access the program due to overflow of over 16,000       inmates--that's a lot of potential students. Plus, although       mock job and resume builder courses are offered, inmates do       not take advantage of them-even with the knowledge that       occupational training program participants are 33 percent       less likely to recidivate.        By increasing funding of education, we ensure equal       accessibility to all courses for those 16,000 or more inmates       wanting to take courses. Consequently the recidivism rate       will reduce, decreasing our total prison population, and       lower the overall government spending on imprisonment as a       whole. By treating inmates like humans in their time of       rehabilitation, with a lower recidivism rate, we more       confidently ensure public safety when 44,000 convicts are       released each year, strengthening the Department of Justice's       prison system core ideologies. Although we have the right end       goal, we need to rethink the process by which we get there       for the sake of the public's safety and security.       Second Place, Lucas Whitaker, Hazen Union High School, Sophomore         One of the biggest issues in America's society today is the       mental health crisis in our youth, relating back to the lack       of mental health services in our schools. In many cases, this       leads to preventable death by suicide. According to a 2017       study by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention       (AFSP), suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the       U.S.        Paula Clayton, medical director of AFSP, states that 90% of       youth that kill themselves have a treatable psychiatric       disorder. She explains that even in suicide clusters, there's       almost always an underlying disorder, whether it's due to at-      home issues or anything else that may be going on, suicide is       the last straw. From this information we can gather that       mental health is a big part of losing students to suicide.       There are several steps that can be taken to ensure that       our youth are getting the help they need.        First of all, mental health professionals on campus is a       priority. If funds are an issue, as they usually are,       fundraisers are always an option. Schools tend to raise funds       for their athletic and music departments, as well as others,       but typically not for mental health. Money can be raised in       fundraisers not unlike the ones that are used to raise money       for extracurricular activities. This way mental health       professionals can be on campus for students to speak with at       any time, and having the money for this wouldn't be such an       issue. Fundraising aside, mental health services are       important enough to be state/government-funded.        Another step that can be taken is the steady normalization       of mental health discussions. In society today as a whole       mental health is a touchy topic. But with proper approach,       these conversations can be normalized so that people are       comfortable asking for help without being faced with       stereotypes or fear of judgment. This can start with general       annual assemblies about the topic and good coverage of the       topic in classes. Even a unit in health classes or       professionals coming in to speak with students on the subject       for a few days can be beneficial.        In a lot of cases, a student will end their life and it       will result in suicide clusters, or what is more commonly       known as `copycat suicides'. It's like a trigger that sets       off a line of students attempting suicide after another       student succeeds. If there is ever a situation in a community       where someone ends their life, schoolwide mental health       screenings are crucial. There are many non-profit       organizations that offer screening kits that ultimately lower       suicide rates. These kits usually include short, non-      diagnostic screens for signs of depression and suicide that       could even be beneficial as an annual subject. These are       usually completely anonymous and encourage students to seek       help.        Mental health issues are undoubtedly crucial in our youth       today. There are several ways we as a country can improve the       quality of mental health services in our schools for a       brighter future for our generation.              Third Place, Maya Marcy, Long Trail School, Junior         For many, college is a liberating opportunity to further       one's academic career and pursue a lifelong passion, as well       as create a substantial base to obtain an income and begin       life in adulthood. As well, with the increasingly competitive       workforce, a college degree is almost mandatory to make a       living wage. However, accessibility to attend a post-high       school institution continues to prove difficult for not only       marginalized groups, but also students coming from the middle       class. This difficulty arises from the injustice embedded       within the education system, a lack of government       responsibility, and the senseless and excessive cost       attributed to college in the present day.        According to the National Center for Education Statistics,       undergraduate enrollment in any post-secondary educational       institution has increased from 53% to 94% in just the past 40       years. Accompanying the growth in attendance is the       skyrocketing of tuition, a near 260% overall increase       compared to a 120% average inflation consumer product       increase, according to Business Insider. With this disparity       in tuition cost vs. income, the difference has resulted in       the form of $1.5 trillion of student debt among more than 40       million Americans, as reported by TIME.        With this, why is so little of the federal budget set aside       for such a vital part of our society? There is a simple       solution. There is no reason, that in a time of peace, The       United States should be spending upwards of $690 billion per       year on the military. According to the annual fiscal       Department of Defense budget report, in the most recent       proposal to Congress, President Donald Trump has introduced       an almost 10% increase in military spending, increasing the       budget to an astonishing $750 billion. To put facts along       with numbers, with a little over 10% of the entirety of the       military spending budget--approximately $80 billion--the       United States could cover the cost of public 4-year college       education for every aspiring student in the country. Putting       this plan into action  [[Page S2876]]       would provide an opportunity for millions of deserving,       hardworking students.        The opportunity to obtain an education is one that many in       the United States take for granted. We are fortunate enough       in the United States to have many of the most distinguished       Universities, programs, and professors in the world. However,       the inability to acknowledge and tackle the underlying       factors of how economic disparity affects the education       system remains apparent. Too often marginalized groups are       kept from succeeding in comparison to their privileged peers.       Wealth and the quality of schooling have collided for too       long. Every young adult has the right to a deserving and       fulfilling academic career, regardless of their upbringing.       We must realize now that the only way to fix the education       system is to approach it as an economic matter. From then on,       we will achieve equity and prosperity through the American       college system.                            ____________________
