Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank Chairman Shuster,  Ranking Member DeFazio, Subcommittee Chairman Graves, and Ranking  Member Napolitano, and their staffs for working with us on this  amendment.

It is a commonsense amendment, and I am glad to  offer it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
