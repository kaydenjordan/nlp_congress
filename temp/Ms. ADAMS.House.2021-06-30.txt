 Madam Speaker, I am honored today to stand on the floor of  the House to honor the life of a cherished friend and extraordinary  North Carolinian, Andrea L. Harris, a resident of Henderson, North  Carolina, who passed away on May 20, 2020.   Her death leaves a tremendous void throughout our State, but her  life's work is a lasting reminder of her courageous fight for civil and  human rights, social justice, and building Black wealth.   A bold voice of reason for the underrepresented, her work helped  improve the quality of life for so many.   A proud alumna of Bennett College, an advocate for HBCUs, a shero for  Black businesses, this ``mother of minority enterprise'' was always  about making good trouble.   She cofounded the North Carolina Institute for Minority Economic  Development, serving as president for more than two decades.   Andrea L. Harris made our State, our community, and our world much  better than she found it and fulfilled the Scripture in Psalms 84:10,  which says: ``Better is one day in Your courts than a thousand  elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than  dwell in the tents of the wicked.''   Rest in peace, my friend.   Andrea, we love and miss you.                            ____________________
