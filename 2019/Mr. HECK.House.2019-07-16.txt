 Mr. Chairman, I thank the chair of the committee for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise to strongly support the David Paul Nelson and  Matthew Young Pollard Intelligence Authorization Act.   In the last year we have made some pretty incredible progress in  reducing the security clearance backlog, yet, frankly, after all the  progress we have made, we are still--and you are hearing this number  correctly--left with nearly a half a million people on the waiting list  for security clearance.   Earlier this year, the average wait time for top secret security  clearance was reduced to 468 days, down from 534 days.   So, in other words, when we are out there competing for young talent  to come in and be a member of the intelligence community, say in a  field such as cyber, we are told we have to tell them, ``Cool your  jets. We will get back to you in a year, year and a half or so.''   Indeed, closer to home, my senior military adviser is a distinguished  graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He served  not one, but two tours in Afghanistan, where he had a security  clearance, and yet when he joined a staff in the House of  Representatives, to again earn a security clearance, it took 20 months,  nearly 2 years.   We are losing good people when we subject them to that long of a wait  time.   This bill makes some progress. It will build on the progress we made  this year by providing needed reform to this mission. It creates a  system of accountability and clear goals for how the process should  run.   Furthermore, the bill allows for innovation on using digital tools,  and reciprocity among agencies to improve our efficiencies when  clearances are needed to be transferred from one agency to another.   Our government can and must efficiently and effectively review  security clearance applicants. We owe our national security workforce  at least that much. This bill will help us to do that, to further  reduce it, so that the intelligence community can compete for the best  and the brightest in a timely fashion.   Mr. Chair, for that reason, among many, I urge Members' support for  the Intelligence Authorization Act.                                time  1915     Madam Chair, I was standing when he was recognized. The  gentleman from Ohio did not yield to him. And when he asked to claim  time in opposition, he did not say ``although I am not opposed.'' And  you did not, therefore, ask if there was no objection.   He was not legitimately recognized.    He asked for time in opposition but did not state that he  was not opposed.   You did not ask if, therefore, there was no objection. He was not  legitimately recognized.   The offerer of the amendment did not yield to him. The gentleman from  South Carolina claimed time in opposition but did not say ``although I  am not opposed.'' He supported the amendment. And you did not ask if  there was no objection.    Madam Chair, you didn't ask if there was no objection,  which is the customary practice.    Madam Chair, I thank very much the graciousness of the  gentleman from Ohio, although I think his amendment is wrongheaded.   Here is what is real:   Climate change is real, number one.   Number two, it has significant national security implications.   Number three, the only smart thing to do is to borrow the old motto  from the Boy Scouts, ``Be prepared.'' Passage of this amendment, which  would remove the Climate Security Advisory Council, renders us less  prepared.  [[Page H5894]]    We all know that the intelligence community and the DOD have, time  and again, assessed the measurable effects of climate change--rising  sea levels, higher temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events,  new stressors on natural resources and agriculture--have tangible  impacts that exacerbate economic distress, human insecurity, political  instability, and other humanitarian conditions detrimental to our  national security.   The smart thing to do is to be prepared, to have the advisory council  that can work across the intelligence community, that can collect the  information, coordinate the information, so that we know what is  coming, we know what we are being presented with, and we can confront  it in a smart way.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to please defeat this amendment and  pass the underlying bill.
