 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the Memorial Day weekend, Alaska  lost two really great men. These men were doers and they were builders  in every sense of the word--both literally and figuratively. They were  family people, and they were the best of friends to one another and to  so many of us.   Today I wish to pay tribute to Sam R. Brice and Howard A. Otis-- although, nobody called him Howard. We all knew him as ``Buzz'' Otis. I  wish to take just a few moments this afternoon and tell Members of the  Senate a little bit about these two very wonderful and great men.   You really couldn't find two more genuine Alaskans than Sam or Buzz.  Yet neither was born in the State. They came to Alaska.   Sam grew up in Florida. He was educated at Columbia University in New  York City. So he was a long way from New York City when he came to  Fairbanks, AK. He served in the Marine Corps, and then he moved to  Alaska to help his parents, Luther and helenka, establish a family  construction business there in the Interior.   The story is pretty legendary about his mother helenka. His mother  spelled her name always with a lower case ``h''. She didn't want the  capital, and always made sure that you put the emphasis on the ``len''  in helenka. She was really the epitome of an independent, self-reliant,  really strong Alaskan woman, and she wouldn't let anyone forget that.  She was very outgoing, vivacious, and had a heart of gold. I think it  all wore off on her children. We certainly saw that in Sam.   It was said that Sam Brice never met a stranger. He was known for  remembering every good deed that others did for him--no matter how many  years in the past it may have been, decades after the event. He always  generously returned the favor and always remembered to just say:  ``Thank you for that''--``thank you for that.''   Sam was one who just did good. He did good throughout the State.  Those in rural Alaska have fond memories and affection for a man who  helped build their communities and who was a leader. He was a leader of  the Associated General Contractors, and in his later years was well  known for roasting his fellow contractors at the AGC dinners. He had a  great sense of humor, and that humor was really contagious.   The lines from Sam's obituary really say everything one needs to know  about the man. They are:         In lieu of flowers, the family would wish all to remember       Sam who lived by example, whether a handshake, a smile, or a       contribution; he was always willing to lend a helping hand.       Please remember all the different ways Sam has touched       people's lives and consciously think how you can make the       world a better place, as Sam demonstrated throughout his       life. We ask you honor Sam's memory by emulating his       compassion to others and be a friend to man.    Sam's memorial services were this past Saturday. I was unable to  attend. I know the church was packed to overflowing. But as I was in  another part of the State that day, I couldn't help but think of those  words from the obituary about how we can individually and collectively  think about how we can make the world a better place by being  compassionate to others, being a friend to others, and living that in  our daily lives, as Sam did--truly, truly a great man.   His friend Buzz Otis was also a transplant to Alaska. He grew up in  Michigan. He was educated at Michigan State and came to Alaska in 1975,  thinking he was just going to explore the State for a few months, like  so many who come to our State. They think they are just going to come,  take a peek, and then leave, but as with many Alaskans, that didn't  happen with Buzz. In 1976, he founded a landscaping business in  Fairbanks called Great Northwest, and this was really his ticket to  business success and to a lifetime commitment to Alaska.   I have so many good friends throughout the State who are givers and  doers. I just think we Alaskans have a tendency to want to give back to  our communities. We help our neighbors. Buzz Otis did that in spades.  He was involved in a lot of different levels politically. He was a  strong supporter of mine and other members of the Alaska delegation. He  served on the Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly and was elected as  its presiding officer. He chaired the Fairbanks Economic Development  Corporation and managed the North Pole Economic Development  Corporation.   He was just involved in so many different aspects of his community.  He was an outdoorsman and loved sports. He was a rugby player and had a  rugby pitch. He loved the sport of dog mushing and encouraged young  people to take it up. He was just always doing, always engaged.   He was blessed in life to have a great family and a wonderful,  beautiful wife, Renee. That family standing together was a beautiful  thing to watch in terms of the support they all gave one another, and  it was truly so for Buzz, as a father and as a family man. I just can't  think of anything better. Family really does come first.   That is ultimately what claimed the lives of these two wonderful men  who had so much life left in them. Buzz's son was out on the river, and  Sam and Buzz went out to check on him in Sam's plane. It wasn't out of  the ordinary to do this. It was good weather, good visibility, and a  pretty fair day for the Interior. It turns out that Buzz's son was OK,  but the flight ended in tragedy. Sam's plane went down near the Salcha  River on the morning of Saturday, May 27.   If only this story had a happy ending. Instead, it had somewhat of an  Alaskan ending. Sam and Buzz gave their lives doing what so many  Alaskans do; that is, looking out for one another, looking out for  their families.   But we know we don't remember people for how they lost their lives.  We remember people for how they lived their lives. Sam and Buzz were  truly ``salt of the earth'' Alaskans. They were honest, hardworking,  caring, and adventurous. They hired local people, they treated them  well, and they were always welcomed back by the communities they served  so faithfully. They really dedicated their lives to the betterment of  the last frontier, and they never forgot family. Family was always  first.   Everyone says that you can't say enough about these people, and it is  true. So I will conclude my remarks and just simply express the  Senate's condolences to the Brice and Otis families: to Joan Brice, to  Renee Otis, to their children, and to their families--great families-- destined to carry on the legacies of Sam Brice and Buzz Otis.                  75th Anniversary of the Aleutian Campaign    We just recognized Memorial Day last week in our respective States. I  [[Page S3351]]  was pleased to be with many Alaskans as we observed Memorial Day. We  clearly revere those who serve in our military. In Alaska, we are home  to more veterans per capita than any other State in the Union.   This year, I was privileged to host a most distinguished veteran at  Alaska's official State veterans' memorial. This is located in a place  called Byers Lake, which is midway on the Parks Highway between  Fairbanks and Anchorage. It is extraordinarily picturesque. It is very  tranquil. It is almost a spiritual place in many, many ways, as we look  out to Denali in the background, being surrounded by the memorials for  honoring those veterans who have served us.   But I was able to bring to that gathering a very distinguished  veteran, our Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, a former Navy SEAL.   This following week, just on Sunday, I was able to do yet another  Memorial Day. Our focus was not on those who gave their lives on  foreign soil but in a battle for American soil. Our focus this past  Sunday was on what is known as the ``forgotten battle'' of World War  II. It was the bombing and subsequent occupation of the Aleutian  Islands of Alaska by Japan. It was a yearlong campaign, and for those  of us in Alaska, it is a campaign that we often speak about and we  share the stories. There are veterans of that campaign who are still  around today, sharing stories with us. They are living legends, if you  will.   I recognize that for many, if you were to ask them whether the United  States has ever been occupied--occupied in World War II--they wouldn't  know. I think, unfortunately, the name the ``forgotten battle'' may be  just exactly that. Most Americans don't recognize that the Aleutians  were occupied by the Japanese, that Americans were killed in defending  our homeland, and that some of the indigenous people were either  transported to Japan as prisoners of war or evacuated to the  southeastern coast of our State, a thousand miles away.   Making sure this ``forgotten war'' is not forgotten is a mission for  me. It is an important part of our Nation's history. Again, that  Aleutian Campaign was a yearlong campaign--fighting weather and terrain  with equipment that was clearly not up to the challenge--to reclaim  U.S. territory from a determined Japanese force.   A little bit of the history: On June 3, 1942, Japanese forces bombed  Dutch Harbor and, over the succeeding days, occupied the islands of  Attu and Kiska. These islands were occupied by Native people who had  been there over a thousand years.   It was not until May of 1943 that Attu was retaken, and 549 U.S. and  Allied troops were killed in combat. But there is evidence that the  U.S. and Allied losses in the Battle of Attu were much higher as a  result of exposure, disease, Japanese booby-traps, friendly fire, and  frostbite. Let me just tell you, the elements out there in the  Aleutians are particularly harsh. When you don't have the equipment, it  makes it even more so.   The war in the Aleutians came at a great price for our Native people  who had lived on those lands for thousands of years before the war. The  homes were burned, churches were burned, and 881 of the Aleut residents  of 9 separate villages were relocated to abandoned mining and fishing  camps in Southeastern Alaska, where they were forced to live under some  pretty tough conditions.   At the remembrance event that I attended in Alaska on Sunday, some of  the evacuees were at the ceremony. They were there. They shared their  stories about what it meant to literally be ripped from their village-- without having any idea what was really going on--and then sent to an  area that may have been a foreign country to them. On the Aleutian  Islands, the environment is entirely different from that of a cannery  in in Southeast Alaska. But what was extraordinary about these evacuees  was, despite the very harsh, difficult, and, in many cases, horrible  conditions, they never gave up. They didn't give up hope, and they  certainly didn't give up their patriotism. Twenty-five men from the  evacuated villages chose to join the fight. Three men joined the retake  of Attu. All were awarded the Bronze Star for their valor.   I think it is important to remember that the many lessons to be  learned from the Aleutian Campaign. America once perceived itself as a  nation oceans away from foreign threats. Today, I think it is  unthinkable for us to think that any of our territory could be occupied  by a foreign power. But we must never forget that during World War II,  a portion of the United States was occupied, and it was occupied in  those days, as today, because Alaska is a strategic location. These  lessons cannot and should not be lost to history.   We all know the saying that those who forget history are condemned to  repeat it. The Japanese incursion occurred less than a decade after GEN  Billy Mitchell testified that Alaska is indeed the most strategic place  in the world. The incursion taught our Nation a vital lesson--that the  defense of America begins in Alaska. Fortunately, the lessons of the  Aleutian Campaign and Alaska's strategic location are not lost on  today's military planners.   Let me walk you through what we see in the State of Alaska right now,  recognizing the proximity of Alaska to some of the hot spots around the  world, whether it is North Korea, Russia, or China. Alaska is seeing a  renaissance when it comes to our military presence. We see it at Joint  Base Elmendorf-Richardson, where Air Force F-22s and AWACS launch to  acknowledge their Russian counterparts that are flying in the Air  Defense Identification Zone. We see it at Eielson Air Force Base, which  is preparing to receive two squadrons of F-35s beginning in 2020. We  see it in the soldiers of the 4th Airborne Brigade Combat Team in  Anchorage, who are now waiting deployment to Afghanistan. We see it in  the soldiers of the 1st Stryker Brigade, who will soon begin their  rotation of pre-deployment training at the National Training Center. We  see it in the crews who are staffing ballistic missile radars in the  State, looking very carefully at North Korea. We also see it in the  patriotic construction workers who will begin building the new long- range missile discrimination radar at Clear Air Force Station this  summer and on the missile fields of Fort Greely, ready to intercept an  ICBM aimed at the North American continent from wherever. We see it in  the Navy SEALs who train in Kodiak and in the coastguardsmen who  protect our coastline from Metlakatla in the south, all the way north  to the Arctic.   I think it is very clear that never again will the United States  leave Alaska undefended, which brings me back to the characterization  of the Aleutian Campaign as the forgotten battle. Seventy-five years  ago, U.S. and Allied troops were called upon to repel an invader who  occupied U.S. soil. We in Alaska, particularly, will never forget that  fact, but neither should America.   Ignoring the fact that war has been, in fact, waged on U.S. soil in  this last century is a dangerous and a tragic thing. Let's resolve on  this 75th anniversary of the start of the Aleutian Campaign that the  forgotten battle is be forgotten no longer.   As I prepare to leave the floor, I would be remiss if I didn't add  that at the remembrance event in Unalaska this weekend, it was not only  an opportunity for many of the remaining evacuees to come together in  Alaska--for some it was their former community; others were from the  Pribilof, Kiska, and Attu. It was a coming together. It was a  homecoming for some, but there was also an effort to bring together  many of our veterans who had served in the Aleutian Campaign and whose  only exposure to the Aleutians was when they came in to defend that  territory. To have the exchange between those who had been forced from  their homeland and those Americans, those veterans who had come to  help--to have them united in a conversation for the first time ever was  an exceptional American story.   Over the course of 3 days, the sharing of stories was a remarkable  opportunity for us. I had a chance to speak with one of our World War  II veterans who said: I always knew what our part of the fight was  about, but I had no idea how what we were doing from the war effort had  impacted these displaced people--the original people of the Aleutian  Islands. To have that sharing, again, was a remarkable part of the  story.  [[Page S3352]]    Then, to complete that picture, there were several individuals who  were part of a Japanese film production company and were there to do  the filming of this 75th remembrance because, as they said: This is an  exceptional part of our history coming together too.   Recognizing, sharing that, and allowing the stories, again, to ensure  that this is not forgotten was a very significant and, I think, healing  opportunity for so many.   Madam President, I thank you for the opportunity to share this  important part of our history, ensuring that the forgotten battle is  not forgotten.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges  of the floor be granted to my interns for the remainder of the month of  June 2017. Those interns are Claire Faulkner, Fiona Kelty, Jackson  Blackwell, Jaden Frazier, James Flemings, Kinani Halvorsen, Mary  Crowley, Tasha Elizarde, Taylor Holman, Tristan Douville, Fatos  Redzepi, and Aimee Bushnell.
