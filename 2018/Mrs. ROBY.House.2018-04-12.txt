 Mr. Speaker, with Congress out of session for the recent  Easter district work period, I had the opportunity to visit Fort Rucker  and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, two outstanding military  installations in Alabama's Second District. It is so important that I  stay up to date with the needs and priorities of our military bases,  and I appreciate those who took the opportunity to meet with me  recently.   As a member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense,  properly funding our military is one of my top priorities. I will  always work to ensure that Fort Rucker and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force  Base remain strong components in our national defense infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, over the last year, I have appreciated working alongside  the administration that has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to  rebuilding our military after years of damaging cuts. I am proud to  serve in a congressional district that is home to two of our Nation's  finest military installations, and I will continue to provide the brave  men and women of our military with the best possible resources to  ensure that they are well-prepared for whatever challenges they may  face as they work to keep us safe.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by wishing Maxwell-Gunter  Air Force Base a happy 100th birthday. This past Saturday, Maxwell  celebrated 100 years of dedicated service. I speak for the entire  Second District in saying that we appreciate all that these men and  women do for our country, and our community, and I know that our region  looks forward to many more years of partnership.   Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to be an advocate for Fort Rucker  and Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base here in Congress, and I take this  responsibility very seriously.                            ____________________
