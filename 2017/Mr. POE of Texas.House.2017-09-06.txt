 Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Harvey rampaged across  Texas, the heavens opened up and 50 inches of rain hammered down on the  Houston area.   After 2 days of hard rain, on August 27, 60-year-old Houston Police  Officer Sergeant Steve Perez got up, as he does every morning, put on  the badge, the shield over his heart, and began to drive to work to  help rescue flood victims. It was dangerous. The floodwaters were high  and constantly rising. People's homes and businesses were flooding.  Perez's wife even asked him not to go that day. But, Mr. Speaker,  Sergeant Perez knew the people of Houston were counting on him.   He made a wrong turn when he was headed to work, fighting the flooded  streets. Because of that, the 34-year veteran of the force, Sergeant  Perez, died in the floodwaters. He gave his life for the thin blue  line, the line that protects and serves the rest of us.   Officers like Sergeant Perez are just a cut above the rest of us.  They willingly put themselves into harm's way for their communities,  and their motto is to protect and to serve.   Houston will remember Texas lawman Sergeant Perez as one of their  own, putting his life on the line during one of the worst natural  disasters in Texas history.   Next week, as hundreds of officers from all over the State of Texas  and other States stand in silence, taps will be played for the end of  watch for Sergeant Perez. Sergeant Perez is one of the rare breed--the  Texas breed of law officers that sacrifice for the rest of us.  [[Page H6659]]    While we mourn the loss of Sergeant Perez, we thank the good Lord  that such men ever lived.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Frelinghuysen) for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, my Houston area has suffered a historic hurricane, one  that really changed the lives of all the people who were affected. My  district was hammered by this flood.   To put it in perspective, 27 trillion gallons of rain fell over Texas  and parts of Louisiana in the 6 days of the flood. That is enough water  to file the Houston Astrodome 85,000 times.   At the height of the flood, 70 percent of Harris County, which is the  Houston area, was flooded, 70 percent was underwater.   The devastation in Texas equalled, Mr. Speaker, the size of New  Jersey. You place New Jersey in southeast Texas, that is how much of  the area was affected by this flood and the rain.   People had anywhere between 36 and 52 inches of rain. The Weather  Service had to create a new color, purple, on their maps to show how  much rain had fallen. Nothing like this has ever happened in North  America.   72,000 people were rescued by first responders and volunteers from  high water. This is the largest civilian water evacuation since  Dunkirk.   Thousands of civilian volunteers worked along with city and county  first responders to save countless lives. The heroes came from all  walks of life, from all parts of the country.   The attitude of the people of Texas was one of inspiration. Flooded  victims who didn't know each other, their homes were flooded, but they  were helping other flooded victims get to safety and get what property  they could recover. This heroism reminded me what it means to be a  Texan and an American.   Mr. Speaker, Harvey will not defeat the human spirit. There were two  men in Brownwood. Now, you know where Brownwood, Texas, is. Probably  nobody else ever heard of it. That is in way west Texas. They decided  they wanted to help. They got in their pickup trucks. They drove to  Austin, Texas, which is still 200 miles away from Houston. They went to  a sports place there and bought a bass boat, a trailer, a motor, and  filled it up with all kinds  [[Page H6666]]  of stuff, drove to Houston, Texas, and kept working for others. That is  one of many stories.   So this supplemental is important to southeast Texas.   Let this vote show that we will vote not for politics, but for  people.   And that is just the way it is.                                time  1100
