 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1 shamefully allows candidates for  Congress to use tax dollars to fund campaigns with a $6 match for every  $1 raised. Any normal person would call this a form of embezzlement.   Tax dollars are supposed to be used to maintain our transportation  infrastructure, fund our schools, and keep the public safe, not to fund  campaigns.   As a representative from New York City, which has public financing of  campaigns, and as a former candidate for mayor, I can tell you that it  does nothing to take big money out of politics, and it does nothing to  level the playing field. Bill de Blasio still received big donations  bundled by lobbyists and special interests, and I would have still been  outspent 4 to 1 with or without matching funds.   Using taxpayer money to fund political campaigns is not only wrong;  it is an abuse of taxpayers and has led to more corruption. Multiple  candidates and elected officials in New York City were convicted for  exploiting the system and developing schemes to illegally pad their  campaigns with taxpayer money.   Additionally, at a time when so many Americans question the integrity  of our election system and are looking for safeguards to protect their  vote, this bill bans States from having voter ID and implements same- day voter registration, which does not give election boards the proper  time to ensure individuals' eligibility and further erodes the public  trust.   Instead of this ridiculous bill, we should be adopting the Save  Democracy Act and restoring the trust and integrity of our election  system.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as a representative of more than a  quarter of NYPD's 36,000 active officers, and thousands more retirees  and first responders, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1280 and every  piece of legislation that aims to cripple or degrade our law  enforcement.   Instead of working with Republicans, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have chosen to push forth yet another partisan bill that  will diminish public safety and prevent our law enforcement officers  from serving and protecting our communities, all while trying to hold  them personally liable. The brave men and women who put on the uniform  every day deserve better.   We have offered real solutions to increase transparency,  accountability, and performance so our Nation's law enforcement  officers can better serve and protect all.   But make no mistake, this bill you are about to pass today defunds  the police. The Congressional Budget Office  [[Page H1069]]  has confirmed that the unfunded mandates contained in this bill will  drain the resources of State and local law enforcement to the tune of  several hundred million dollars. This is negligence.   As a resident of New York City who has seen our police department's  budget slashed by a billion dollars by politicians who think they know  more than the officers doing the job on the street, I can tell you that  there are serious ramifications.   Crime has skyrocketed. Last year, shootings increased by 97 percent,  and murders increased by 44 percent. We have seen livelihoods and  properties destroyed by rioters and looters in cities across America.   Government's number one responsibility to its citizenry is to keep  them safe. Defunding law enforcement is an abdication of that  responsibility.   Tonight, I call on every Member of this body to cosponsor my Right to  Remain Safe Act, which holds local governments responsible should  someone become a victim of a crime due to government's negligence.   Madam Speaker, if we adopt the motion to recommit today, we will  instruct the Judiciary Committee to consider my amendment to H.R. 1280  to include a simple, straightforward sense of Congress strongly  rejecting efforts to defund the police.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues say they don't support defunding the  police. Well, here is their chance to show it.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
