 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on H.R. 433, the  Veterans' Entry to Apprenticeship Act, which I introduced 2 weeks ago.   While a lot of progress has been made over the past few years in  reducing the number of unemployed veterans in America, the latest data  shows that around 370,000 remain unemployed as of 2017.   Last year, the House of Representatives passed several bills that  improved the lives of our veterans specifically related to healthcare.  My bill would keep this momentum going.   Here is the short of it: Right now, veterans are not allowed to use  their  [[Page H1176]]  GI Bill benefits to cover the cost of Department of Labor-approved pre- apprenticeship programs, such as training in welding or training in  carpentry. This bill would change that and allow those who have served  our country to learn skills that will better prepare them for  apprenticeships and, ultimately, the workforce.   This bill will continue the progress we have made to better the lives  of veterans who have served this country honorably, and I ask my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in this effort.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast my vote on the passage of  H.J. Res. 31 during the last vote series. I oppose the bill and would  have voted ``nay.''                             Personal Explanation
