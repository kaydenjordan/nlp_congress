 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of one  of my constituents, Robert Larson, and congratulate him on his  retirement.   For 27 years, Bob served as commissioner of the Port of Benton and  has dedicated himself to serving his neighbors and his community.   Thanks to Bob's efforts, the U.S. Navy and the Port of Benton were  able to partner to bring a section of the USS Triton submarine to  Richland in honor of veterans who served in Navy submarines.   From strengthening local supply chains to preserving the history of  the Hanford Site and so much more, Bob's contributions to the Port of  Benton, the greater Tri-Cities, the State of Washington, and our  country are a true testament to his spirit of service.   As a lifelong Washingtonian, on behalf of the people of the Fourth  Congressional District, I extend my heartfelt thanks to Bob for his  decades of public service and wish him all the best in retirement.                            ____________________
