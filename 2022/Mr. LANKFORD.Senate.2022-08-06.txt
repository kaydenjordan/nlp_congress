 Madam President, I yield myself 20 minutes from the  bill time.    Madam President, Hans Christian Andersen, in 1837,  wrote a story about group think. It is called ``The Emperor's New  Clothes.'' It begins with a leader who really loved his clothes. Some  unsavory characters saw that, and they set up a weaving loom to make  the finest clothes in the land, but they were actually weaving just  air; there was nothing to it. The catch was they had sold the story  that, if you can't see what they are weaving, it must be that you are  just not wise.   So the Emperor sends a couple of his advisers to go check out the  weaving to see what it looks like. They see, obviously, nothing because  there is nothing there, and they all declare ``Oh, it is beautiful; it  is lovely'' because they don't want to be seen as unwise.   Then it ends up with the Emperor preparing for a big parade, and that  is where I pick up the story. Let me read to you from Hans Christian  Andersen, from 1837, when he tries on the ``new clothes.''   These scoundrels, these unsavory characters who had sold him this  said:         ``How well Your Majesty's new clothes look. Aren't they       becoming!''        The advisers all chirped in. He heard on all sides, ``That       pattern, so perfect! Those colors, so suitable! It is a       magnificent outfit.''        Then the minister of public processions announced: ``Your       Majesty's canopy is waiting outside.''        ``Well, I'm supposed to be ready,'' the Emperor said, and       turned again for one last look in the mirror. ``It is a       remarkable fit, isn't it?'' He seemed to regard his costume       with the greatest interest.        The noblemen who were to carry his train stooped low and       reached for the floor as if they were picking up his mantle.       Then they pretended to lift and hold it high. They didn't       dare admit they had nothing to hold.        So off went the Emperor in procession under his splendid       canopy. Everyone in the streets and the windows said, ``Oh,       how fine are the Emperor's new clothes! Don't they fit him to       perfection? And see his long train!'' Nobody would confess       that he couldn't see anything, for that would prove him       either unfit for his position, or a fool. No costume the       Emperor had worn before was ever such a complete success.        ``But he hasn't got anything on,'' a little child said.        ``Did you ever hear such innocent prattle?'' said its       father. And one person whispered to another what the child       had said, ``He hasn't anything on. A child says he hasn't       anything on.''        ``But he hasn't got anything on!'' the whole town cried out       at last.        The Emperor shivered, for he suspected they were right. But       he thought, ``This procession has got to go on.'' So he       walked more proudly than ever, as his noblemen held high the       train that wasn't there at all.    When the facts come out, it is hard sometimes to admit you are on  display, that the bill actually doesn't do what the title says it is  supposed to do. This time, the bill is called the Inflation Reduction  Act. They say it is designed to be able to lower inflation and to  reduce the deficit except that now it has actually been scored. It  doesn't actually reduce inflation, and deficit reduction is as  invisible as the Emperor's new clothes.   The score for inflation stated in the public scoring that ``the  impact on inflation is statistically indistinguishable from zero.''   The CBO scored the bill and said it ``would have a negligible effect  on inflation.''   Remember, this is the bill titled: the ``Inflation Reduction Act.''  The score on the deficit end, after many on the other side of the aisle  here have said it would have $300 billion in deficit reduction, it is  less than a billion. But wait, there is more to the story on even that  $100 billion.   More than 200 economists wrote a letter to Senator Schumer detailing  how this bill will not reduce inflation nor reduce the deficit. Taxing  more and spending more will only make the problem worse.   They closed by saying this statement:         The bill deficit reduction is likely to prove illusionary       due to implausible spending phase-outs.        In summary, we agree with the urgent need to reduce       inflation, but the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a       misleading label applied to a bill that would likely achieve       the exact opposite effect.    What they said was, the Emperor has no clothes. It doesn't really  reduce inflation. At some point, the emperor has to make a decision: Am  I going to keep parading through the streets, when everyone knows the  Inflation Reduction Act doesn't reduce inflation or am I going to head  back and fix it?   Let me start with just the plan that is in this bill.   Here is the bill. It is titled: The ``Inflation Reduction Act of  2022.'' So the plan my Democratic colleagues have laid out--let me just  give you a couple of details in the plan to reduce inflation in the  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.   Here is one: Up to $4 billion has been allocated to study cow burping  and their production of methane. I am sure that that is going to bring  down the price of beef right away. As I have heard, even on the floor  today, this is going to bring down the prices at the grocery store by  having up to $4 billion allocated to study cow burping.   It adds $2 billion in construction grants to improve walkability in  context-sensitive projects. No one seems to know what the words  ``context-sensitive projects'' even mean or how $2  [[Page S4158]]  billion in construction to improve walkability will bring down  inflation.   There is $3 billion for environmental justice block grants to  facilitate workshops--workshops--to bring down inflation. Aren't you  confident that the price of eggs and bread will go down after $3  billion is spent on environmental justice workshops?   There is $17 million for consumer-related education and partnerships  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By the way, that is not reducing.  Those are partnerships to discuss reducing.   There is a brandnew tax credit for Elon Musk that is in this, though.  I am sure that it will bring down inflation. Tesla has used up all of  its credits for its electric vehicles so this bill renews it and does a  special perk for Tesla to give them an unlimited number of new tax  credits. I am sure Elon Musk is thrilled about his unlimited new tax  credits to him, and I am sure all of our prices will go down based on  Elon Musk's new multibillion-dollar tax credit that he gets. Again, the  bill is the Inflation Reduction Act.   There is a new fee on methane that will raise the price of natural  gas, which has been estimated to raise the price of our natural gas to  the consumer by 17 percent--a 17-percent increase on our natural gas.  Now, let me remind you that this is the Inflation Reduction Act that  will increase the price of our heating, of our cooking, and of our  energy production--17 percent.   There is a new tax on imported oil and new fees on domestic oil  produced on Federal lands.   There are new inspection fees and owners' fees on pipelines. I do not  understand how new fees and new taxes on oil and gas are supposed to  lower the price of natural gas and of gasoline, but that is what is  being declared in the Inflation Reduction Act. If only we had more  taxes on oil, gas, and natural gas, then prices would somehow magically  go down.   As has been mentioned multiple times on the floor, this Inflation  Reduction Act hires more than 80,000 new IRS auditors, with no limit on  whom they can audit. If you thought that there would be a limit to  those people making $40,000 or more on being audited, you were wrong.  Now, that could have been in this bill, but they chose not to put it in  this bill. There are no guardrails for who can be audited by the IRS  with billions of dollars being allocated to new IRS agents. Every  single American in every income bracket, every small business, and  every large company--everyone--is going to experience new IRS audits in  the days ahead.   Remember this night. Remember this night. In the next 10 years, when  you get an IRS audit, it was the Democrats in this body who sent the  IRS to your house. So keep your records because IRS audits are about to  dramatically go up due to the gift of the Inflation Reduction Act.   Maybe this bill should instead be called the CPA Hiring Act because I  assume millions of taxpayers who struggle under our complicated Tax  Code already will now have to hire a CPA knowing their chances of being  audited are greatly increasing now. They know the complicated rules of  the IRS. Most taxpayers I talk to submit their tax forms every year and  hope they get it right because it is so complicated, but because of  this night and this vote, there will be auditors coming after you to  make sure that you got it right.   The Democrats, in the days ahead, when the IRS comes to this body for  a hearing, will be asking them: Did they pull in additional money based  on the audits they gave them? They are not telling you this, but they  assume the IRS will collect $200 billion more once they give them these  new auditors. You can be assured that that is going to be a metric that  is going to be checked in the days ahead. The IRS will suddenly be like  the smalltown police force that has a quota for writing tickets on the  highway through their small town in order to help pay for the new city  hall. If you have to pay for city hall, you need to write more tickets  on the highway. It is about to be that way with the IRS. They need to  audit more and go get more because we gave you more people.   Remember, this is the Inflation Reduction Act. I have yet to figure  out how Americans getting more audits reduces inflation, but as has  been advertised, this is going to bring down the cost of groceries, and  this is going to bring down the cost of gas by more people getting  audited by the IRS.   One of the other interesting plans in this bill to reduce inflation  is to force more Americans to join a union. Now, I have to tell you  that I have no angst against unions. Unions are a choice. Those  individuals should be able to choose to join a union and be a part of  collective bargaining as an American right and privilege.   Let me say this: 10.3 percent of the American workforce is union-- 10.3 percent. In the energy portion of this bill, which is billions and  billions and billions of dollars, the unions get billions of dollars,  and nonunion workers get nothing. So, if you work in the energy sector  right now and if you are not a union employee, you are about to get cut  out because the way this bill is written it gives Federal payouts to  companies that use union laborers, which will make nonunion energy  companies uncompetitive and will force them out of business or force  them to unionize.   Quite frankly, this bill should be called the Mandatory Union Bill of  2022, not the Inflation Reduction Act, because I am not sure how  forcing more people into a union reduces inflation, but that is a major  portion of this bill.   I am confident the union bosses across the country are thrilled to  finally see a return on their investments since they gave heavily to  Democrats in 2022 to get them elected, and this is their payoff. There  will no longer be 10.3 percent of workers in unions. This is going to  force more companies to have to unionize or they will not be able to  survive because of the Federal credits that only go to companies that  hire union labor. Does forced unionization sound like the solution to  inflation reduction to you? It does to apparently half this body.   It creates a subsidy in health insurance to be announced right before  the fall elections this fall. And it is not for those who are in  poverty. Those who are in poverty, all the way up to 400 percent of  poverty, already get healthcare subsidies. Oh, no, this is not for  those folks at the poverty level--200 percent, 300 percent, or 400  percent of poverty; this is a family of four making $200,000 who will  get this healthcare subsidy.   What do the economists think will happen with this new subsidy? They  believe employers will drop their health insurance and will push  employees under the government Affordable Care Act policies and will  shift more and more people onto the government rolls. Remember, this is  the Inflation Reduction Act.   As homelessness increases across the Nation right now, the bill adds  $1 billion into HUD for zero emissions electricity generation in  affordable housing. That is what it is called, zero emissions  electricity generation in affordable housing. It is not about  increasing access to housing for those who are homeless; it is solar  panels in public housing. I am confident the people who are living on  the street, trying to survive a 9-percent inflation rate, are really  not hoping that they can find someplace with a solar panel, but that is  what is in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, solar panels in public  housing. That is their solution to solving inflation.   While many of us have been pushing back hard to block China from  buying more land in the United States, this bill actually gives ag  subsidies to land owners regardless of who is the owner of the land.  They don't have to be a U.S. citizen. They don't have to be American  ownership. We are literally opening up that to owners of land to be  able to get access to it.   I have also heard over and over again that there are no new taxes in  the Inflation Reduction Act. I have heard that in national media from  my Democratic colleagues saying it over and over again and on this  floor. Well, it seems to be true. If you are a green energy company,  that is true; there are no new taxes for you. They will have huge tax  breaks. And while there is a push for everyone to have a 15-percent  minimum tax, that is not exactly true for those folks who are in these  green energy companies that are major Democrat donors. They will not  have that same minimum tax standard.   But the Tax Foundation found this. This is their quote:   [[Page S4159]]              On average, tax filers in every quintile would experience a       drop in after-tax incomes.    Let me run that past you again. ``On average, tax filers in every  quintile would experience a drop in after-tax incomes'' if this bill  passes. That means everyone in the country, under $400,000 and over  $400,000 a year--everyone has a drop in after-tax income.   One of the new taxes that was just added into the bill today is the  stock buyback tax. This is to punish companies that are listed on our  stock exchanges that buy back stocks to raise the value of stock. Now,  they buy back stock so that the stock value goes up. They are putting a  tax on them to be able to punish them to try to prevent them from doing  this. They make it sound like they are hitting the big, fat cat  corporate CEOs and the guys on Wall Street, keeping the value of their  stock lower. They are going to really stick it to the man--except 60  million Americans are invested in a 401(k) plan for their retirement.  Sixty million. The largest owners of stocks in America are retirement  plans, insurance companies, and nonprofits. Google ``largest owners of  stocks.'' So the people who will be hurt the most in this new plan to  drive down the stock market prices are nonprofits, insurance companies,  and retirement plans. Fifty-eight percent of Americans own some kind of  stock.   This is a tax directly and deliberately designed to keep the price of  individual stocks from going up. Sure, that is going to hurt CEOs who  own their own stock, but it is also going to hurt everyday Americans  who just own stock on their own, and it is going to hurt all of those  retirement plans. But they seem not to care whom they hurt in this as  long as they can also hurt CEOs. Driving down the stock market will, I  guess, reduce inflation, if that is their plan in their Inflation  Reduction Act, is to drive stock prices lower for retirees and  nonprofits and individual investors.   Another new tax that was added today is a 15-percent minimum tax on  businesses that are funded by private equity. I have to tell you, this  one shocked even me when it got slipped in today. Most companies that  are funded by private money are small businesses, research companies,  small manufacturing companies. This adds a new 15-percent tax on those  small businesses.   Basically, if you are owned by private money or funded by private  money separate from the owner itself, you are considered a subsidiary,  and so you get this big tax laid on you.   Let me give you an example of this. I know directly a company in  Oklahoma that is a small manufacturing company. They are funded by  private outside money. During COVID, my Democrat colleagues had the  same vendetta against manufacturing that was funded by private equity.  This particular company, unlike every other company across the country  during COVID, could not get access to the Paycheck Protection Program  because Democrats said: If you are funded by private outside money,  then we are not going to get you access to that because you are in evil  private equity areas--even though they are vastly small businesses.   This particular manufacturing company in Oklahoma produces valves.  This valve company had hundreds of employees before COVID. Once COVID  happened and business dropped off immediately, because they couldn't  get access to the Paycheck Protection Program like every other small  business, they laid off hundreds of workers. Those workers weren't rich  folks. Those were folks turning a wrench and making a great product  that a lot of people wanted. They got laid off simply because of how  they were funded.   Now my Democratic colleagues want to jump right on top of them at the  end of COVID, as the company is finally starting to come back and they  are hiring people back, to now slap a brandnew tax on top of them that  no one has discussed, no one has evaluated, and no hearings have  occurred on it to determine how wide and how broad this will be.  Literally, the owners of this company will wake up tomorrow morning,  because in the middle of the night, a new tax got added onto them right  at the tail end of COVID simply because my Democratic colleagues don't  like any company--regardless of what they do, regardless of the workers  who actually work there, they don't like how they are funded through  private individuals who fund them.    This bill doesn't lower inflation. I listed a lot of things. Can a  single American go: Oh, that will take down inflation; that will work.  None of those things take down inflation.   It also doesn't reduce the deficit. Brace yourself for this. Their  plan for reducing the deficit is not doing programs they were already  not going to do. That is their plan. That is the deficit reduction.   Let me give you an example of this. Let's say you are going through  Walmart, shopping, and you are with your shopping cart. You step aside  to be able to get something off the shelf, and when you turn back  around, somebody has stuck in your basket a big bag of frozen brussels  sprouts. Now, you didn't put them in there; somebody else put them in  there.   As you go through the aisle, you look down and you see this big bag  of brussels sprouts. I don't know about you, I don't want frozen  brussels sprouts. Maybe some of you love those. Great. But if somebody  slipped a bag of frozen brussels sprouts into my cart, I would put it  back. I would put that away and say: No, I am not going to buy that.  Somebody else put that in my cart.   Here is what I wouldn't say. I wouldn't say: Somebody put a bag of  frozen brussels sprouts in my cart. I am going to put it back on the  shelf. That is deficit reduction in my cart. I wouldn't say that.   Here is what I mean by that. During the end of the Trump  administration, they laid the groundwork for seniors to get a rebate at  the pharmacy counter for Medicare prescriptions to make sure that every  senior got a discount at the pharmacy counter. That was the plan. That  is what the Trump administration put in place.   When the Biden administration came in, they didn't like that plan to  give discounts to seniors at the pharmacy counter, so they set that  plan aside and said: We are not going to do that. Instead, they have  come up with this new plan that I will explain in just a second. But  they are saying that because they didn't do the plan that Trump was  planning to do, because they didn't do that plan, that is $100 billion  in savings by not buying what they never intended to buy, ever.   Let me just tell you, if you don't buy the brussels sprouts, you just  don't have the brussels sprouts, but you are not saving the money from  that. You just didn't get them. That is not real savings. So when they  say it is deficit reduction, it is because they are not doing what they  never said they were going to do, and now they are magically calling it  deficit reduction. That is not real reduction of the deficit; that is a  budget gimmick in Washington, DC--a huge budget gimmick. Can I just  say, the Emperor has no clothes. It is not real.   In the place of this rebate rule, in its place, they have created a  real method of price controls for some drugs. And it is not price  negotiations; it is price controls. They are spending $3 billion to set  up a system for the government to be able to select prices on one of  the most used drugs in America.   By the way, it starts in 2026, is when this starts. I have heard some  people on the floor say: We are going to have lower prices right away.  This plan starts in 2026. It wouldn't actually affect anyone's  pharmaceuticals until 2027. So if you are planning on a reduction in  prices, it is not coming soon; it is 5 years away, if there is a price  decrease at all.   The way it is set up is the President, whoever that may be 5 years  from now, will have a new authority not to negotiate prices in the next  10 years. It is not a negotiation, it is setting the price, because if  you disagree with the next President, whoever the next President is,  and what they set on the price, they can raise the taxes on your  company 95 percent. So if you disagree with the price that they pick,  whoever the next President is, what they pick for the price, then your  company gets hit with a 95-percent tax. How does that sound for  government sheer power over a company, to crush whoever they choose?  That is how this is set up. You don't follow what I say, we will crush  your company.   What does that mean for the future? Drug companies will have new  incentives to not use existing drugs for new  [[Page S4160]]  treatments because here is how it typically works: If a cancer drug  works for lung cancer, then they start experimenting with other types  of cancer to see if it works on those. But in this system the Democrats  are setting up, if a drug works for lung cancer, they have a  disincentive to try it on other cancers because if the drug gets too  used, then it falls into this new negotiation category. So the  incentive for the drug companies is not to try new ways of using this  drug for fear of getting too big.   Can I tell you what this looks like in real life? I have a friend at  home whose wife has pancreatic cancer, and they are desperately trying  every treatment and trying to get into every clinical trial they can  get into, desperately. They are praying, and they are working, and he  is being an awesome husband, and she is being a tough warrior going  through nausea and pretty awful treatments. They are trying to get into  clinical trials, which is already hard. This bill will make it even  harder because existing cancer drugs will have a disincentive to test  out new ways to be able to serve their cancer. Thank you very much to  my Democratic colleagues who are reducing the number of cancer cures  for the future. How does that cure inflation in the Inflation Reduction  Act?   There is also a special little feature in it, in the way the drug  piece is set up, that it incentivizes more IV drugs and fewer oral  drugs because IV drugs get more time and oral drugs get less time. So  the incentive is to set up IV drugs instead--for the drug companies.   So for all of us who would prefer taking a pill than taking a drug  intravenously, tough luck. Democrats prefer IV drugs to oral drugs. So,  in the future, when you are taking an IV instead of an oral medication,  it is because of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.   Can I just remind everyone that Medicare has insolvency in 6 years-- 2028. This Inflation Reduction Act takes the savings from this new  prescription plan from Medicare and takes it out of Medicare. It  doesn't stabilize Medicare, which is going insolvent in 6 years. It  takes it out of Medicare and moves it over to the Affordable Care Act  subsidies.   It literally takes money designed for 76-year-olds on a fixed income  and gives them to 26-year-olds and their family making $200,000 a year.  That is the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. By the way, did I mention,  again, that those subsidies land right before the election this fall?   This bill is three-quarters of a trillion dollars that not a single  person in this Chamber has read--755 pages of it--that came out a few  hours ago. The media, which also hasn't read this bill, continues to be  able to talk about what a great plan it is for inflation reduction.  They continue to praise the bill, though they have read the same  things: It doesn't reduce inflation; it doesn't reduce the deficit.   They have joined in the chorus talking about the beauty of the  emperor's new clothes. I am willing to say what a lot of people in this  room know in their gut but they are afraid to say. It doesn't reduce  inflation. It doesn't reduce the deficit. The emperor has no clothes.   Let's reject this bill.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 5384 and  ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, the Biden administration continues to  declare that we are in a public health emergency because of COVID-19.  This public health emergency, first declared in January 2020, has been  renewed 10 times.   Title 42 is the health authority specifically designed to prevent  people from coming into the country during a pandemic. It is  nonsensical to say that we have a COVID health emergency everywhere but  on our southern border. If there is a public health emergency in this  country, then title 42 authority must remain in place.   Title 42 authority is the last line of defense that our Border Patrol  agents have to protect our Nation, and my Democratic colleagues said  they agreed with that idea back in April. The situation has only  worsened since that time so surely they will agree with me more today.   I urge the adoption of this amendment, that we would remain  consistent with title 42 authority in this Nation.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, well, I anticipate there will be a few  people who are going to vote for it before they vote against it, in  this case. What this is, is this is actually my title 42 bill, except  with one little tweak in it. It takes it out of Byrd compliance. So  this allows any individual to be able to vote for this one but actually  oppose the one that would have actually implemented the policy that was  actually Byrd-compliant.   This is the reason people get so angry at Washington, DC, because  people will say: Oh, I didn't really mean to do that; I meant to do  this.   Here is my concern. I think anyone should ask everyone, if they voted  one way one time and one way another, what is different on this,  because here is what I think happens next. What I think is about to  happen is, someone is going to stand and they are going to call a point  of order on this and to say this is not compliant with the Byrd rule.  And people are going to say: I tried to get it done, but that  Parliamentarian just knocked it down. So that is what I bet happens  next. We will see.    Mr. President, this is an amendment from Senator  Barrasso and me. It is very straightforward.   If you are a restaurant, you can deduct your business expenses. That  is normal tax code. If you are a hardware store, you can deduct your  business expenses. That is normal operation.   Since 1913, intangible drilling costs have been the tax deductions  for oil and gas. IDCs, or intangible drilling costs, since 1913, have  been set aside for preparing the space, doing all the labor costs, the  services, the normal business operations, for 100 years, until now.   Slipped into this bill yesterday, into the base tax, strips away the  tax deductions for oil and gas companies, what has been in place for  over 100 years. If you are a wind farm, you can use renewable energy  credits to take your tax rate down to zero because you can deduct your  normal business expenses as well. If you are a coal company, you can  use 45Q, but if you are oil and gas, your prices are going up.   Americans should remember this bill when they fill up in the days  ahead and when the people in their communities are trying to get a job  with oil and gas.
