 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 795, I call  up the resolution (H. Res. 789) censuring Representative Paul Gosar,  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H. Res. 789.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this resolution, which was referred to the Committee  on Ethics, seeks to censure Representative Gosar and remove him from  his positions on committees.   We are acting on this resolution today because Representative Gosar  recently used House resources to disseminate and celebrate a video that  depicts the murder of a fellow colleague.   I did see the video. I am sorry that the distinguished leader of the  Republican side apparently chose not to or viewed it and deemed it  something less than what it is, which is the horrific depiction of the  murder of a fellow colleague and threats to the President of the United  States.   We are acting on this resolution because Republican leadership has  not  [[Page H6340]]  taken responsibility for members of its own Conference.   When a fellow Member of Congress has been threatened with violence,  the House cannot wait indefinitely for Republican leadership to find  its collective conscience and condemn the threat. When our colleague  has been victimized, as women of color so often are, the House cannot  ignore that threat.   The full House must roundly reject Representative Gosar's conduct and  prevent the normalization of violent imagery and rhetoric directed  against Members of Congress.   Just 10 months ago, this very Chamber was attacked in an act of  brutal, bloody savagery. All of us experienced it firsthand. Some of us  were trapped in the upper gallery while an angry mob, wielding weapons,  tried to beat down the Chamber doors to disrupt certification of  President Biden's electoral college victory.                                time  1445    Since January 6, death threats against Members of Congress have  multiplied, and several individuals have been arrested. The threat of  actual violence against Members is real, and it is growing.   So this resolution is vital to protecting our Members' safety, but it  is also vital to stemming the pernicious wave of political violence  rising across this country, which is why Representative Gosar's video  and his subsequent failure to publicly apologize or take full  responsibility must be swiftly condemned.   Any Member who uses his public platform to depict physical violence  against another Member and the President reflects extreme discredit on  this body. Such conduct violates the most basic standards of  collegiality, civil discourse, and public decency.   Clause 1 of our code of conduct requires Members to behave ``at all  times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.'' If that  rule is to have any meaning whatsoever, and if we are to fulfill our  responsibility to uphold the reputation of the House, Representative  Gosar must face consequences for his conduct.   Our Republican colleagues make hollow appeals to process, claiming  that this resolution wrongly bypasses the Ethics Committee. But the  ultimate power to censure a Member and remove that Member from a  committee rests with this House.   The committee can recommend such a sanction to the full House, but  nothing in our rules requires the House to wait, nor should the House  wait in this instance. Not when there is a clear and present need to  remove Representative Gosar from a committee on which Representative  Ocasio-Cortez herself serves.   There are no unresolved questions of intent. It is clear from the  video, and from Representative Gosar's public comments minimizing it,  that censure is appropriate and his immediate removal from the Natural  Resources and Oversight and Government Reform Committees is warranted.   That is why the House must take this action today and why I urge my  colleagues to support the resolution. Madam Speaker, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier), the author of this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the House majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Escobar), a member of the House Ethics Committee.  [[Page H6343]]                                     time  1515     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the House majority whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jones), an Ethics Committee member.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips), an Ethics Committee member.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild), an Ethics Committee member.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the Assistant Speaker of the U.S. House of  Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Aguilar), who is the vice chair of the Democratic  Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), who is the chairman of the House Democratic  Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, none of us wants to be here today revisiting the  violent imagery and the vile, hateful content that Representative Gosar  delighted in disseminating over his official social media accounts-- material defended over and over and over today by our colleagues.   Had Republican leadership acted as they should have to hold their own  Members accountable when they breach the most basic standards of  decorum and decency, we wouldn't be here. Yet, the House cannot ignore  [[Page H6347]]  Representative Gosar's conduct as Republicans would have us do.   January 6 must serve as a reminder of just how important this action  is that we are about to take. On January 6, violence stoked by hateful  imagery and inflammatory rhetoric over social media found its way to  the steps of the United States Capitol and the doors of this Chamber.   On that day, insurrectionists broke those windows right near where I  stand. Capitol Police officers drew their weapons, and Members bravely  blocked the entrance. Heroes valiantly repelled the attack on our  democracy.   On this day, with our votes on this resolution, let us reject the  notion that it is ever acceptable for a Member of Congress to threaten  the safety of a fellow Member or depict the murder of a fellow Member.  Let this resolution serve as an unwavering statement that never in this  House should this type of horrific, violent imagery be deemed  acceptable.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  smash the partisan lens through which they view this behavior and this  debate. I ask all of my colleagues to support safety, civility, and  decency by voting for H. Res. 789.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
