 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to begin, I thank Representative Higgins for his hard  work on this legislation, and I support H.R. 5693, as amended.   This bipartisan legislation is a forward-thinking first step toward  better aligning VA's long-term care options with veteran preferences.   Medical foster homes are a solution for veterans that may not be  comfortable in a traditional institutional setting, such as a nursing  home, yet still need some form of daily assistance and care. These  homes provide caregiving services in a group setting for veterans that  lack access to caregiving services at home.   By allowing VA to cover the cost of medical foster homes, VA will be  able to ensure veterans are achieving the most appropriate level of  care in the most appropriate setting.   The care delivered at medical foster homes is less intensive;  therefore, less expensive. Additionally, the sense of community and the  familiar home-like setting can promote a veteran's physical and mental  health.   Again, I appreciate my colleague's hard work on this legislation and  look forward to voting in favor of the bill. I congratulate the  gentleman from Louisiana's hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), a member of the House Committee on Veterans'  Affairs, and let it also be known that prior to his coming to Congress,  he chaired a veterans committee in the California State Legislature.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 5693, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.
