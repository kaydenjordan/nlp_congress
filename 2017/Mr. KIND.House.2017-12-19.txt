 Mr. Speaker, if we are going to borrow $2 trillion from  China over the next 10 years, it better be for a very good reason. And  lavishing huge tax breaks to multinational corporations and to the most  wealthy amongst us is not a good reason.   I am very concerned about many of my fiscally conservative friends  across the aisle. So I offered an amendment that would have expanded  the endangered species list to include fiscally conservative  Republicans because they are about to go extinct under this bill.   And under this bill, they are creating a mess that is going to take  years to clean up because of the potential for fraud and abuse.   Consider this: They are pitting a hastily written bill, drafted  without one hearing, considered without feedback from people back home,  without proper vetting, all over the course of a few short weeks  against some of the smartest accountants and tax attorneys that money  can buy.   Who do you think is going to win that battle?   This is a bill that was drafted of, for, and by the powerful special  interests in Washington, and it should be rejected.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Once again, the Chair reminds Members to  direct their remarks to the Chair.
