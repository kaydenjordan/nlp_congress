 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  John Farr of DuBois, Pennsylvania.   John recently completed a 16-day, 898-mile bike ride to raise  awareness and support for Habitat for Humanity of Clearfield County.   On October 4, he arrived in Washington, D.C., for a much-needed rest  day before completing the final leg of his journey to Clearfield.   John started his cycling fundraising in 2001 when he signed up for a  2-day, 150-mile fundraiser sponsored by Habitat for Humanity New York.  Since then, he has completed 20 excursions.   John has always been involved in his community, from tutoring  students when he was in college to coaching sports. He enjoys giving  back.   He joined Habitat for Humanity in 1994, originally donating monthly,  to eventually joining the board and serving as president.   His cycling fundraisers have taken him across the United States and  even across the Canadian border. His rides have led him to raise more  than $150,000 for Habitat for Humanity.    Mr. Speaker, John's passion for helping others is admirable.  Congratulations on completing this journey.                            ____________________
