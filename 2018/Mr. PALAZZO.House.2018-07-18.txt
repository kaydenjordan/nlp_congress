 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very simple.   During committee markup of this bill, we were successful in adding a  restoration of $25 million to the CDFI fund. Because of the way the  amendment was drafted in committee, this secondary amendment is  necessary to designate the individual funds within the CDFI account.   The CDFI banks that this amendment seeks to assist provide essential  financial products to underserved populations, often the poorest of the  poor. Additionally, financial literacy education provided by CDFI banks  is an invaluable service to our most at-risk and disadvantaged  communities across the Nation.   Again, this amendment is purely clerical in nature and ensures that  the $25 million added at committee markup is equitably distributed  between the separate CDFI funds so it can do the most good for our most  needy.   Mr. Chair, I ask the House to pass this amendment to ensure these  reach their intended recipients, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Seeing no other speakers, I would like to thank the chairman and  ranking member for their support in committee for restoring the funds.   Mr. Chairman, I urge an ``aye'' vote on my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
