 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1142, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6784) to provide for removal of the gray wolf in the  contiguous 48 States from the List of Endangered and Threatened  Wildlife published under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill would accomplish what multiple  administrations have been attempting to do for over a decade by  delisting a species the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has deemed  recovered under the Endangered Species Act. It also empowers the States  to take a larger role in managing the species population.   The gray wolf has been protected in its original habitat in the  western Great Lakes region under the Endangered Species Act since 1974.  Beginning in 1994, the Federal Government began introducing species to  the Western U.S. by relocating wolves from Canada and releasing them in  Western States.   The reintroduced wolf population in the West expanded more quickly  than many had anticipated, and as a result, Western States began to  work with the Fish and Wildlife Service to better manage the species.  This successful State and Federal cooperation led to the Fish and  Wildlife Service's first attempt to delist the species under the  Endangered Species Act in 2009. Litigation activists struck back,  challenging the agency's delisting decision and halting further agency  action at that time.   In 2014, the Fish and Wildlife Service, after noting an even greater  increase in species population, attempted to once again delist the gray  wolf. Just as before, litigants immediately challenged the agency's  decision. That same year, gray wolves in Wyoming and the western Great  Lakes region were relisted by court order, citing inadequate State  management plans. This 2014 order was appealed, and in March of last  year, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the relisting decision  for the gray wolf, but in Wyoming only.   This underscores the extent to which the Fish and Wildlife Service  has been hamstrung in implementing the objectives of the Endangered  Species Act. Rather than spending its limited resources protecting  vulnerable species, litigation activists have forced the agency to  continuously defend every action.   In this case, despite scientific evidence collected under multiple  administrations from both sides of the aisle showing that the gray wolf  populations have recovered and thrived, the agency remains bogged down  in costly, never-ending litigation. We should be celebrating this ESA  victory instead of moving on to the next challenge.   This bill would prevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from  wasting further resources in responding to environmental lawfare by  affirming its previous rules to delist the gray wolf and shielding  these rules from further review.   Finally, the bill seeks to empower the States to manage their  individual gray wolf populations by directing the Secretary of the  Interior to issue a rule to delist the gray wolf in each of the 48  contiguous States and the District of Columbia. To ensure that States  are provided certainty when developing State management plans, this  bill would also exempt the delisting system from judicial review.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the commonsense bill that we have  here, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the sponsor of the bill, who actually lives in  an area where the wolves live.    Mr. Speaker, I would just say that the Endangered  Species Act delisting a species is based on science, and the science  has proven that this species is recovered. Twice under the previous  administration, Fish and Wildlife tried to delist the species based on  the science.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Peterson), who is also a cosponsor of the bill and from wolf country.    Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the gentleman from Oregon  is so passionate about wolves, and this bill would be fantastic for him  and his State.   It would allow their State natural resources folks to manage their  wolves. They could release some in Portland. They could let those wolf  populations get as large as they want to get. But the scientists at  U.S. Fish and Wildlife have said that the species is recovered, and we  are talking about letting other States have the opportunity to manage  those wolf populations in their States.   I wish we were doing a farm bill. I wish the Senate would do a farm  bill, because we have already done one out of here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers).   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, in my home in eastern Washington,  we have been living the real impact of large wolf populations for many  years now.   We see the impact on safety. We see the economic impact it is having  on our ranchers. Each year, we are losing hundreds of livestock to  wolves and costing our economy millions of dollars.   The gray wolf is recovered, and it is time for it to be removed from  the Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act has listed many  species.   This is not about a hatred or a fear of predators. This is about  actually recognizing that the Endangered Species Act has done its job,  and it is time for the wolf to be delisted.   In the fall of 2013, the Obama administration announced that the gray  wolf was recovered. President Obama's Fish and Wildlife Director Dan  Ashe has stated: The gray wolf ``is no longer endangered or threatened  with extinction. . . . As we propose to remove ESA protections, States  like Washington and Oregon are managing expanding populations under  protective State laws.''   Unfortunately, the gray wolf was not delisted. In eastern Washington,  and specifically in northeastern Washington, predation on calves has  become common. I regularly hear from people who are seeing wolves  around their property and from people who cannot defend themselves  without it being a felony.   Eastern Washington knows better how to manage our land and wildlife  than someone sitting here in a cubicle in Washington, D.C. What we are  proposing is that these management practices would be returned to the  State level, that we would allow the people who are closest to the land  and to the practices to be able to take action that would benefit  endangered and native animals while protecting farmers, ranchers, and  our way of life.    I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill because it is  important. It is important to our way of life. It is important to the  people in eastern Washington. It is important to our economy.   I thank Congressman Duffy from Wisconsin for his work and leadership  on this issue that impacts many communities across the country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about letting scientists make the  decision, not letting others make the decision. But right now, courts  are making the decision on the delisting of this wolf.   We have heard testimony that, even though it is a bipartisan bill,  even though it was people in the previous administration that first  suggested delisting the wolf, we have heard testimony that if you  support delisting the wolf, you must be an idiot.   I don't think supporting this legislation means you are an idiot or  you are trying to message something. I think it means that we want to  see science implemented. I think it means that we want to let the  scientists do their jobs.   Mention has been made about Yellowstone National Park. I was actually  in Yellowstone National Park this last summer and talked to scientists  out there about the big fire in the 1980s.   What many of us know about fire is that it is a natural occurring  phenomena, and it mimicked a huge clear-cut in Yellowstone National  Park. After the fire and all this vegetation started growing back, we  saw a huge increase in elk and deer herds, and the wolf population  increased right along with that.   As a matter of fact, the scientists at the park told me that the  greatest numbers of elk that they have had happened within about 10  years after the big fire out there. The greatest population of wolves  that they had happened after that. Now that the forest is growing back,  that ecosystem, that forest will burn again--it burns about every 100  years--but the science is being applied here.   We just want to let States make the decisions on how to manage these  wolves that the scientists have said are recovered and need to be  delisted.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous  consent that the balance of my time be managed by the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as we consider this bill and we talk about the science  behind it, again, we are basing this legislation on science, on letting  the scientists do their jobs. This bipartisan bill is exactly, exactly  the type of legislation that will save the Endangered Species Act.   The ESA aspires to recover imperiled plant and animal species. The  act was never meant to serve as a long-term management tool.   What my colleagues across the aisle should be celebrating is this ESA  success story. Not just once, but multiple times, U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service has determined the gray wolf recovered and attempted  to delist the species.                                time  1015    We know this wasn't a partisan decision because we saw these attempts  span multiple administrations from both sides of the aisle. Our  experts, our very own scientists, at Fish and Wildlife Service have  expressed to us again and again that the gray wolf is recovered and  ready to be delisted.   Unfortunately, instead of allowing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  to focus its resources on other endangered species, litigation  activists continue to force the agency to defend this scientifically- driven decision and delay the delisting.   We are nearly a decade past the agency's first attempt to delist the  recovered gray wolf species. To continue to list a species our own  experts have determined is recovered sends the message that the  Endangered Species Act doesn't work.   I appreciate the bipartisan support this bill enjoys, and I hope more  of my colleagues across the aisle will join us in helping strengthen  the Endangered Species Act in the long run by supporting this  legislation.   With that, I urge adoption of this commonsense bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
