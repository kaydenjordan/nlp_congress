 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on April 28.   In the 30 years I served as a community pharmacist, I saw  prescription drugs save lives. However, I have also seen these same  drugs, coupled with addiction, ruin careers, ruin families, and ruin  lives. Today, 89 people die in the United States every day from  prescription painkiller overdose.   Prescription drugs have become the target of theft and abuse, and it  is critical that we do everything we can to combat the epidemic by  safely disposing of unused medications. That is why I encourage you to  go through your medicine cabinets, find any unused prescription  medications, and bring them to your closest take-back location.   The DEA website allows you to easily search the closest collection  site. By disposing of your unused medications, you are saving lives in  your community.   Again, National Prescription Take Back Day is April 28.                            ____________________
