 Madam Speaker, as Americans, we should always honor and  support our veterans and Active Duty military personnel. This week,  Penn State University kicked off its 10th annual Military Appreciation  Week, holding a series of events and ceremonies on behalf of the brave  men and women who have served and fought for and continue to fight for  our country.   Military Appreciation Week at Penn State culminates this Saturday  with the annual military appreciation tailgate and football game at  Beaver Stadium. Penn State's Seats for Servicemembers program will give  7,000 complimentary tickets to veterans and servicemembers to enjoy the  game.  [[Page H6374]]    Moreover, Penn State is now home to the largest stadium in the United  States, honoring POW/MIA servicemembers with a chair of honor that will  forever remain empty honoring those brave Americans who never returned  home.   To Penn State University and the community members who have made this  week possible, thank you for your work. We are Penn State.                            ____________________
