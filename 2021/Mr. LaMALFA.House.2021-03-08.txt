 Mr. Speaker, this week our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle are proposing more gun control measures under H.R. 1446  and H.R. 8.   Mr. Speaker, our Constitution protects all your rights, not  selectively by the State or issue. One bill makes you ask permission  via background checks with no limits when and how you can purchase a  firearm. If they don't complete their work in time, then no gun for  you.   This is an indefinite delay of your rights.   Another supposed background check bill is designed to make criminals  out of Americans who are merely trying to help out others. Under this  bill if a neighbor with issues, domestic violence, or maybe a suicidal  situation decides to give you their gun for safekeeping, you could end  up with a fine and a year in prison--$100,000 fine and a year in prison  for helping them by possessing that gun for them.   The same if someone has a problem with stalking or domestic violence.  Maybe you loan a woman a gun. You could be also threatened with  prosecution under that guise.   Neither of these bills work because they violate a simple truth:  criminals don't follow gun laws. They are criminals. I have a more  reasonable path: amendments to guarantee your rights under the Second  Amendment.                            ____________________
