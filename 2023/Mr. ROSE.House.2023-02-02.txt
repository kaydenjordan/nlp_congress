 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to express my support for H.R.  139, the SHOW UP Act, which was introduced by my good friend from  Kentucky, the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and  Accountability, Mr. Comer, and passed on this floor yesterday.   Millions of Tennesseans show up to work every day. However, more than  half of Federal Government workers, who are expected to serve the  American people, still aren't showing up for work. This has led to  extremely long wait times and delays in services.   Veterans who showed up to work and served our country can't get their  proper VA benefits. Families are waiting months for their passports. In  my district, a father waited for more than 8 months to receive his tax  return. The entire time, he was left in the dark by the IRS.   Tennesseans deserve better, Mr. Speaker. The pandemic is over, and it  is time to get back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support like-minded measures.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 9,  which denounces the horrors of socialism in all its forms.   Whether it is communism, Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism,  anarchism, democratic socialism, ecosocialism, or liberal socialism,  all of these have failed, and none of these ideologies should, God  willing, ever be implemented in the United States.   By passing this resolution, we can send a message to the American  people that we reject these deadly ideologies, and our Nation will  always and forever be a bastion of freedom and a beacon of hope.   I pray for the more than 100 million lives that have been lost at the  hands of Communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal  dictatorships.   Socialism should never play any part in the American way of life. I  hope we can all agree on this commonsense resolution. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on its passage.
