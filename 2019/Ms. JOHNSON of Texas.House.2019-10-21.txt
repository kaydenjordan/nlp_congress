 Madam Speaker, I rise today to memorialize the  life of our honorable statesman and dear friend, Congressman Elijah  Cummings. During his tenure in the House of Representatives,  Congressman Cummings championed issues, including civil rights, access  to affordable healthcare, transportation, and congressional oversight.   Representative Cummings was irritated when I pushed him to take an  office in the Congressional Black Caucus until he went home that  weekend and he came back with a big smile and said that the people at  home had noticed it. He also succeeded me as chair of the Congressional  Black Caucus.   Madam Speaker, I join Members of Congress in extending our sympathies  to Congressman Cummings' wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, his family,  and to all who had the great pleasure of knowing him. The legacy of  Congressman Cummings will endure in this great institution as those  that live in the hearts of others never truly perish.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to memorialize the  life of an honorable statesman and dear friend, Congressman Elijah  Cummings.
