 Mr. Chairman, my amendment would reinstate the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure rule 11(c)(2) safe harbor provision, which  allows parties to avoid penalties, by withdrawing or correcting the  claims within 14 days from when the alleged violation of rule 11(b)  becomes known, anytime up until the end of the discovery period.   This bill would force attorneys to assess their case blindly as it  stands. Every attorney knows to assess their case based upon an  objective set of facts regarding the situation.   A good attorney would never overpromise a cause of action, but this  bill prevents even a fair assessment of a case. A full and accurate  analysis of the merits of the case must be done on day one, because  this bill requires mandatory sanctions with no grace period. We have  tried this already, and it did not work.   This bill will eliminate rule 11(c)(2)'s safe harbor provision, which  currently allows the target of a rule 11 motion for sanctions to  withdraw or correct the paper claim, defense, contention, or denial  that is the subject of the motion for sanctions within 21 days after  service.   Between 1938 and 1983, there were only 19 rule 11 filings. In 1983,  rule 11 was changed to the standard being proposed by this bill. In the  10 years without this safe harbor provision, nearly 7,000 motions for  sanctions were made. A 1989 study showed that roughly one-third of all  Federal civil lawsuits involved rule 11 satellite litigation, and  approximately one-fourth of all those cases on the docket involved rule  11 actions that did not result in sanctions. Thus, attorneys had a dual  job: one to try the case, and the other to try the opposing counsel.   We can't go back to a failed system. The amount of sanction  litigation that clogged the system was so extensive that in 1993, a  mere 10 years after this failed legal experiment began, a safe harbor  provision was established to unclog the system, and it worked. Since  then, the amount of rule 11 sanction satellite litigation has come  down, and the courts are now better able to focus on the case at hand.   In committee, Mr. Cicilline of Rhode Island, recommended the  reimplementation of the 21-day safe harbor provision.                                time  1000    Instead of following this commonsense proposal, the committee  rejected it by an 18-4 vote. I believe such an important provision  needs to be revisited, but with a compromise. That is why I drafted  this amendment that offers a 14-day safe harbor provision; and as a  measure to protect further abuse, my safe harbor amendment is only  available prior to the completion of discovery, yet another attempt to  have a compromise here.   The intent for this discovery provision is that an attorney, during  discovery, may realize a flaw in their case. Such a revelation should  allow an attorney to correct or withdraw their claim without having the  fear of having mandatory automatic sanctions imposed on them. Instead,  this bill, as written, immediately places sanctions on the mistaken  lawyer. This is well-intentioned, but it does not acknowledge the  realities of litigation or the legal process.   In the real world, clients can easily misrepresent a situation to  their counsel, and the truth won't be known until discovery. This bill  will have a stifling effect on the legal community and will lead to  denied justice because attorneys will not be willing to take a case  unless it is a guaranteed win.   We should take the lessons learned from the 1983 experiment and  preserve the safe harbor provision to protect well-intended plaintiffs'  attorneys and not stack the deck against those who seek justice.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.  [[Page H2031]]         Mr. Chair, there is a sanction in place. You have to remove  your claim or your assertion that is in question, and there is the cost  of time that any attorney has to put in. But at the end of the day, we  have already been down this road and it has failed. Now all we are  going to see is more litigation again without the requisite increase in  funding to our Federal courts.   And so what we are going to see is anybody who sued--whether you are  a plaintiff suing or defendant--is going to now have far more complex,  dual-track litigation, and that is going to increase costs on  businesses and on individuals who are facing litigation in our Federal  courts. I believe we need to keep the lessons learned from the past,  and I urge Members to adopt my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will  be postponed.                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in part A of House Report 115-29.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 3, beginning on line 19, strike ``shall consist of an       order to pay'' and all that follows through ``reasonable       expenses incurred'' on line 20, and insert ``may consist of       an order to pay the reasonable expenses incurred by the party       or parties''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 180, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me again emphasize our mutual  commitment to justice and why I think the underlying bill skews justice  and tips the scale of justice on Lady Justice.   I again refer you to the sitting experts, and that is the Judicial  Conference of the United States, comprised of Federal judges all across  America. I can't help but recite this sentence that strikes me as one  as strong as possible to have been cited in a letter.   Their referral to LARA, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act, in this one  sentence, recognizing the concern about frivolous lawsuits or filings,  they say:         But LARA creates a curse worse than the problem it is meant       to solve.    I think that that one sentence says it all. We are not here solving a  problem. We are here creating a problem.   I am particularly struck by the comments regarding small businesses.  My amendment improves H.R. 720 by preserving the current law and  practice of courts awarding attorneys' fees when justice requires.   As written, H.R. 720 would change the sanctions for violation of  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 11 to a cost-shifting sanction,  payable to the opposing party, an antiquated version of the rule in  effect from 1983 until 1993. That cost-shifting provision was  eliminated by the courts because it encouraged satellite litigation.   The Jackson Lee amendment would preserve the sanctions currently  available under rule 11, which provide the correct balance in punishing  unwarranted conduct--this is under the present status of rule 11-- without encouraging unnecessary litigation.   Specifically, my amendment will strike a provision of the legislation  that mandates the award of reasonable attorney fees and costs. Instead,  it restores judicial discretion to award such fees and costs when  warranted.   Take small business A, who is mad at big bank XYZ. They mishandled my  account, and they filed a lawsuit. Unfortunately, the bookkeeper--not  accountant--bookkeeper that the small business used really made the  mistake, but the judge, recognizing the small business had good  intentions, would not have to mandatorily force them to be sanctioned  and to pay attorneys' fees but might then have discretion. That is how  you help small business A.   I ask my colleagues to support the reasonable Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to explain the Jackson Lee  Amendment to H.R. 720.   My amendment improves H.R. 720 by preserving the current law and  practice of courts awarding attorney fees when justice so requires.   As written, H.R. 720 would change the sanctions for a violation of  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) 11 to a cost-shifting sanction  payable to the opposing party, an antiquated version of the Rule in  effect from 1983 until 1993.   That cost-shifting provision was eliminated by the courts because it  encouraged satellite litigation.   The Jackson Lee Amendment would preserve the sanctions currently  available under Rule 11, which provide the correct balance in punishing  unwarranted conduct, without encouraging unnecessary litigation.   Specifically, my amendment will strike a provision of the legislation  that mandates the award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and  instead restores judicial discretion to award such fees and costs when  warranted.   The Jackson Lee Amendment preserves the balance found in the current  version of Rule 11, which gives the court discretion to determine an  appropriate sanction.   H.R. 720 seeks a return to the failed and discredited sanction regime  rightly abandoned in 1993.   By eliminating the mandatory fee-shifting provision, the 1993 Rule  discouraged satellite litigation and encouraged parties to move forward  with the merits of the case.   Under the prior Rule 11, during the 1983-1993 time, mandatory fee- shifting was used to discourage plaintiffs from bringing meritorious  claims using novel legal theories in civil rights and employment rights  cases.   Reinstating this mandatory fee shifting rule, as H.R. 720 does, will  again have a chilling effect on plaintiffs claims, especially  individual plaintiffs taking on large corporate interests.   The Jackson Lee Amendment would preserve the current version of Rule  11(c) and restore the true balance between punishing unwarranted  conduct and deterring unnecessary litigation.   The old rule disproportionately affected plaintiffs, especially  plaintiffs in civil rights cases.   Sanctions were more often imposed against plaintiffs than defendants  and more often imposed against plaintiffs in certain kinds of cases,  primarily in civil rights and certain kinds of discrimination cases.   A leading study on this issue showed that although civil rights cases  made up 11.4% of federal cases filed, 22.7% of the cases in which  sanctions had been imposed were civil rights cases.   The imposition of mandatory fees and costs shifts the purpose of the  Rule from deterrence to compensation, encouraging parties to always  file Rule 11 motions in the hopes of gaining additional compensation.  [[Page H2032]]    For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  Jackson Lee Amendment.          Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the             Judicial Conference of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, April 13, 2015.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: We write to present the views of the       Judicial Conference Rules Committees on H.R. 758, the Lawsuit       Abuse Reduction Act of 2015.        As the current chairs of the Judicial Conference's       Committee on the Rules of Practice and Procedure (the       ``Standing Committee'') and the Advisory Committee on the       Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the ``Advisory       Committee''), we oppose H.R. 758, which seeks to reduce       lawsuit abuse by amending Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of       Civil Procedure. The bill would reinstate a mandatory       sanctions provision of Rule 11 adopted in 1983 and removed as       counterproductive in 1993. The bill would also eliminate a       provision adopted in 1993 that allows a party to withdraw       challenged pleadings. Our concerns mirror the views expressed       by the Judicial Conference in 2004 and 2005, and by the       Standing Committee and Advisory Committee in 2011 and 2013,       in response to similar legislation, and reflect our ongoing       daily experience with the practical operation of the rules.        We share the desire of the sponsors of H.R. 758 to improve       the civil justice system in our federal courts, including the       desire to reduce frivolous filings. But legislation that       would restore the 1983 version of Rule 11 would create a cure       worse than the problem it is meant to solve. Such legislation       also contravenes the longstanding Judicial Conference policy       opposing direct amendment of the federal rules by legislation       rather than through the deliberative process Congress       established in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C.       Sec. Sec. 2071-2077.        A decade of experience with the 1983 mandatory sanctions       provision demonstrated that it failed to provide meaningful       relief from the litigation behavior it was meant to address,       and instead generated wasteful satellite litigation that had       little to do with the merits of cases. The 1983 version of       Rule 11 required sanctions for every violation of the rule,       and quickly became a tool of abuse. Aggressive filings of       Rule 11 sanctions motions required expenditure of tremendous       resources on Rule 11 battles having nothing to do with the       merits of the case and everything to do with strategic       gamesmanship. Many Rule 11 motions in turn triggered counter-      motions seeking Rule 11 sanctions as a penalty for filing of       the original Rule 11 motion.        The 1993 changes to Rule 11 followed years of examination       and were made on the Judicial Conference's strong       recommendation, with the Supreme Court's approval, and       effective only following a period of congressional review.       The 1993 amendments were designed to remedy the major       problems with the rule, strike a fair balance between       competing interests, and allow parties and courts to focus on       the merits of the underlying cases. Since 1993, the rule has       included a safe harbor, providing a party 21 days within       which to withdraw a particular claim or defense before       sanctions can be imposed. If the party fails to withdraw an       allegedly frivolous claim or defense within that time, a       court may impose sanctions, including assessing reasonable       attorney fees. Under the 1993 amendments, sanctioning of       discovery-related abuse remains available under Rules 26 and       37, which provide for sanctions that include awards of       reasonable attorney fees.        Minimizing frivolous filings is vital. The current rules       give judges tools to deal with frivolous pleadings, including       the imposition of sanctions where warranted. Rule 12(b)(6)       authorizes courts to dismiss pleadings that fail to state a       claim. Section 1927 of Title 28 of the United States Code       authorizes sanctions against lawyers for ``unreasonably and       vexatiously'' multiplying the proceedings in any case. Other       tools to address frivolous filings include 28 U.S.C.       Sec. 1915(e), which requires courts to dismiss cases brought       in forma pauperis that are frivolous, malicious, or fail to       state a claim, and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915A, which requires       courts to dismiss prisoner complaints against governmental       entities, officers, or employees that are frivolous,       malicious, or fail to state a claim.        Some may ask, why not give courts another tool to deter       frivolous filings by reinstating the 1983 version of Rule 11?       The answer is that the very process Congress established to       consider rule proposals exposed the 1983 version of Rule 11       as superficially appealing, but replete with unintended       consequences, chiefly an explosion of satellite litigation.       Congress designed the Rules Enabling Act process in 1934, and       reformed it in 1988, to produce the best rules possible       through broad public participation and review by the bench,       the bar, and the academy. The Enabling Act charges the       judiciary with the task of neutral, independent, and thorough       analysis of the rules and their operation. The Rules       Committees undertake extensive study of the rules, including       empirical research, so that they can propose rules that will       best serve the American justice system while avoiding       unintended consequences. Experience has shown that this       process works well. Direct amendment of Rule 11 will not only       circumvent the effective Rules Enabling Act process Congress       implemented, but as the careful study of Rule 11 undertaken       by the Rules Committees over many years demonstrates, direct       amendment of Rule 11 as envisioned by H.R. 758 would work       against the laudable purpose of improving the administration       of justice.        Before proposing the 1993 amendments, the Advisory       Committee reviewed several empirical studies of the 1983       version of Rule 11, including studies conducted by the       Federal Judicial Center in 1985 and 1988, a Third Circuit       Task Force report on Rule 11 in 1989, and a New York State       Bar Committee report in 1987. In 1990, the Advisory Committee       issued a call for general comments on the rule. The response       was substantial and clearly called for a change. The Advisory       Committee concluded that Rule 11's cost-shifting provision       created an incentive for too many unnecessary Rule 11       motions. Amendments to Rule 11 were drafted by the Advisory       Committee and approved by the Standing Committee and Judicial       Conference. The Supreme Court approved the amendments and       transmitted them to Congress in May 1993 after extensive       scrutiny and debate by the bench, bar, and public in       accordance with the Rules Enabling Act process.        The amended rule has produced a marked decline in Rule 11       satellite litigation without any noticeable increase in       frivolous filings. In June 1995, the Federal Judicial Center       conducted a survey of 1,130 lawyers and 148 judges on the       effects of the 1993 amendments. The Center found general       satisfaction with the amended rule, and that a majority of       the responding judges and lawyers did not favor a return to       mandatory sanctions when the rule is violated.        In 2005, the Federal Judicial Center surveyed federal trial       judges to get a clearer picture of how the revised Rule 11       was operating. A copy of the study is enclosed. The study       showed that judges on the front lines--those who must contend       with frivolous litigation and apply Rule II--strongly believe       that the current rule works well. The study's findings       include the following highlights:        More than 80 percent of the 278 district judges surveyed       indicated that ``Rule 11 is needed and it is just right as it       now stands'';        87 percent prefer the existing Rule 11 to the 1983 version       or the version proposed by legislation (e.g., H.R. 4571 (the       Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2004) or H.R. 420 (the Lawsuit       Abuse Reduction Act of 2005));        85 percent strongly or moderately support Rule 11's safe       harbor provisions;        91 percent oppose the proposed requirement that sanctions       be imposed for every Rule 11 violation;        84 percent disagree with the proposition that an award of       attorney fees should be mandatory for every Rule 11       violation;        85 percent believe that the amount of groundless civil       litigation has not grown since the promulgation of the 1993       rule (for judges commissioned before 1992) or since their       first year as a federal district judge (for judges       commissioned after January 1, 1992); and        72 percent believe that addressing sanctions for discovery       abuse in Rules 26(g) and 37 is better than in Rule 11.        The findings of the Federal Judicial Center underscore the       judiciary's united opposition to legislation amending Rule       11. Lawyers share this view. The American Bar Association has       opposed H.R. 758. Indeed, of the 200 lawyers, litigants,       judges, and academics who participated in the 2010 conference       at Duke University Law School convened by the Advisory       Committee to search for ways to address the problems of costs       and delay in civil litigation, nobody proposed a return to       the 1983 version of Rule 11.        Thank you for considering the views of the Standing       Committee and Advisory Committee. We look forward to       continuing to work with you to ensure that our civil justice       system fulfills its vital role. If you or your staff have any       questions, please contact Rebecca Womeldorf, Secretary to the       Standing Committee.            Sincerely,      Jeffrey S. Sutton,        United States Circuit Judge Sixth Circuit,Chair, Committee       on Rules of Practice and Procedure.      David G. Campbell,        United States District Judge District of Arizona, Chair,       Advisory Committee on Civil Rules.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
