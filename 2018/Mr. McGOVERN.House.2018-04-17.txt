 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House Agriculture Committee  will mark up the Republican farm bill. This incredibly partisan  proposal was drafted in secret. Almost nothing in the bill reflects the  23 hearings our committee held on SNAP.   We heard from 90 experts, and not a single one of them, liberal or  conservative, suggested eliminating State flexibility through broad- based categorical eligibility and worsening the benefit cliff.   Not a single one of them said to us: Kick 400,000 working families  out of the program and 265,000 children off of free school meals.   Not a single one of them told us to add hurdles for families with  heating and cooling costs, and not a single one suggested we kick  vulnerable adults off of benefits when they can't find work.   Yet that is exactly what this bill does. The reckless Republican  proposals in this bill cut SNAP benefits by over $20 billion, reducing  or eliminating benefits for 2 million kids, veterans, working families,  and other vulnerable adults.   Make no mistake, this bill will make hunger worse in our country. I  plead with the Republican leadership of this House: Stop beating up on  poor people.                            ____________________
