 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4790, which  makes important changes to our financial regulatory system that will  provide clarity and consistency for our community financial  institutions.   I want to thank my colleague from Arkansas for bringing this  important legislation forward. The Volcker rule, a creation of the  Dodd-Frank Act, sought to prohibit reckless trading and investment  strategies to protect consumers. Instead, it has led to yet another  overly complex one-size-fits-all regulatory regime that adds additional  pressure on our already overregulated community banks.   The complexities of this rule and its unintended consequences have  been acknowledged by the current and prior administration as well as by  Members on both sides of the aisle. The mere fact that five different  agencies: the Fed; the FDIC; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,  the OCC; Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC; and Commodity  Futures Trading Commission, the CFTC, are responsible for implementing  and enforcing one rule should tell the American people everything they  need to know about how fragmented and confusing the Volcker rule can  be.   That is why I am pleased to see H.R. 4790, the Volcker Rule  Regulatory Harmonization Act come before the House today to provide an  exemption for our small community financial institutions and to  streamline the regulatory authority of the Volcker rule.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will free up banks on Main Street Minnesota  and in towns all across the country, allowing them to spend more time  lending to consumers and small businesses and less time wondering if  the heavy hand of the Federal Government is going to come crashing down  on him.   Again, I thank Mr. Hill for his hard work on this issue and urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4790.
