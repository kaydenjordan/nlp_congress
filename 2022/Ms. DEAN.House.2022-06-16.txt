 Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, May 26, an explosion erupted in  the tight-knit community of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, destroying two  homes and, tragically, killing five people, a grandmother and four of  her grandchildren, and also seriously injuring their parents.   Today, I want to remember Francine White, 67, and her grandchildren,  Alana Wood, 13, Jeremiah White, 12, Nehemiah White, 10, Tristan White,  8.   It is hard to paint a picture with words of the devastation of a  home, the people who lived there and dreamed in it, reduced to rubble,  a family gone, suddenly.   Now, there is a deep hole in Hale Street, and a huge hole is left in  the hearts of their neighbors. They have made a vigil on their block  and spent countless hours trying to make sense of the tragedy.   Pottstown, I know you have always been a strong community. You are  Pottstown Strong. Know that I will be with you, with your neighbors, as  we figure out how this happened to be sure it never happens again.   My prayers are with the family and the entire community of Pottstown.  May their memories be a blessing.                            ____________________
