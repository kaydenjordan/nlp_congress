 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to the  Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which would increase funding  for USSOCOM to provide for additional training of Special Operations  Forces. Simply put, I never want our men and women in uniform to be in  a fair fight. My amendment would allow for an increase in the training  budget to ensure, whenever our forces are deployed, they have been  fully prepared and are ready to fight, win, and return home safely.   Mr. Chairman, one of the greatest honors of my life is representing  Fort Bragg, the epicenter of the universe, and home of the airborne and  of the Army Special Operations Command. The units stationed here  represent the best of the best and have a vast footprint across our  Nation.   As our Nation continues to fight terrorism around the world, while  simultaneously preparing for the threats of near-peer adversaries, our  training requirements increase and diversify.   As a result, we must ensure that we are ready for any situation at a  moment's notice. Readiness cannot be built overnight. A Green Beret  cannot be built overnight. In order to conduct their mission set  effectively, we must provide them with a steady stream of predictable  resources to enable them to train and prepare for the dangerous tasks  our Nation asks them to perform.   We must never underestimate the most important asset our military  has: the individual. My amendment would ensure that we continue to take  care of that asset by providing them every edge, every bit of  preparation, and, yes, every bit of training that they require.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairwoman Granger for her excellent work on  this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
