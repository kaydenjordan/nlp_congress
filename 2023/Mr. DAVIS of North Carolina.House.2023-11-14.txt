 Mr. Speaker, the Agriculture Labor  Working Group has conducted numerous sessions where we engaged with  producers, workers, and stakeholders, all to understand the challenges  they face within the H-2A program.   As a co-chair of the working group, we released an interim report  this past week summarizing the various insights from these sessions.  The witnesses we met with provided recommendations on how they believe  the program can work better to ensure our growers can continue to feed  and clothe the American people and beyond.   I look forward to continuing to work with Co-Chair Crawford and the  other dedicated members of the working group to craft a final report  that offers bipartisan solutions to address the issues faced by our  agriculture community and ensure a stronger and more resilient future  for all.                            ____________________
