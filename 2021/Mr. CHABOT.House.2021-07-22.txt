 Mr. Speaker, nearly 20 years ago, I introduced  legislation in this House, which passed the House and the Senate.  President George W. Bush signed it into law, and it went all the way to  the U.S. Supreme Court and now is the law of the land. It banned  partial-birth abortion in this country.   While that was landmark legislation, today, it is more important than  ever that we protect innocent unborn life.   That is why, a little over a month ago, the city of Lebanon in my  congressional district back home became one of more than 30 cities  across the country, and the first in Ohio, to become a sanctuary city  for the unborn.   It is why I have consistently and enthusiastically supported  legislation which would get rid of the funding for Planned Parenthood  and its affiliates and supported legislation like H.R. 18, which  codifies the Hyde amendment to ensure that Federal taxpayer money does  not fund abortions.   And it is why, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion Act, and I ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   We should not allow tax dollars to go for funding other people's  abortions.
