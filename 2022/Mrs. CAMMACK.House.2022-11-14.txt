 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in overwhelming support for  the passage of S. 2159, or H.R. 1960, a bill designating the Florida  Veterans Affairs Clinic in Middleburg, Florida, the Andrew K. Baker  Department of Veterans Affairs.   First, I thank the entire Florida delegation for their support of  this legislation, the entire Clay County community, the local elected  officials who participated in this process, and all of the many  veterans who call Clay County home.   Of course, my biggest thanks go to Ms. Tina Baker, the widow of Chief  Andrew K. Baker.   Without a doubt, today's legislation would not be here for a vote  without my colleague from Florida, Senator Marco Rubio, who ushered  this legislation through the Senate Chamber earlier this year. I thank  Senator Rubio for his work on this bill.   This bill honors Antisubmarine Warfare Chief Andrew Kenneth Baker of  Middleburg, Florida. Tragically, he lost his life in service to our  great Nation. On March 13, 1997, Chief Baker's H-60 Seahawk crashed at  sea during a SEAL training exercise. The mix of rough seas, the pitch  of a frigate, fatigue, and visual disorientation caused by the night  vision goggles they were all wearing were all factors in the accident.   As a result of his death, the Navy launched a formal review of its  training policies and has since made drastic changes with regard to  night vision training.   His widow, Tina, not wanting her husband's death to be in vain, has  worked hard to make sure his memory and service didn't get lost in time  and paperwork. Today, we have the chance to make sure that her husband  is remembered forever.   Chief Baker served on the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Coral Sea as  the ship's serviceman and completed training in Search and Rescue  Swimmer School at Pensacola, and Fleet Replacement Aircrewman training  at NAS Jax, where he earned his ``Wings of Gold.''   Chief Baker then reported to HS-9, serving on the USS Nimitz, then on  HS-3, where he was assigned as the Training and Operations Chief.                                time  1415    At home in Middleburg, Chief Baker was an avid fisherman, always  scouring the waters of Black Creek and the St. John's River as much as  he could. He coached his son's Little League and served as the troop  leader for the local Cub Scouts. He was a devoted husband to his wife,  Tina, and sons, Andrew and Jacob.   As a personal point of privilege, I say that this clinic has been a  large part of my professional life for the past decade. Back in 2015,  as the deputy chief of staff serving this district, our team worked  hard to secure the appropriations funding for this clinic. Once we  succeeded in getting this project funded, finding the building that met  the required specs was an entirely new and frustrating battle. After  multiple failed attempts to secure a building, we finally succeeded.   This clinic has been a blessing to my beloved Clay County and to the  veterans who call her home. With today's legislation as the final task  outstanding, I can say with confidence to Chief Baker's widow, Tina:  Now, he will always be remembered.   Mr. Speaker, I urge unanimous passage of this legislation and look  forward to it being signed into law to honor this incredible  servicemember and his family.  [[Page H8446]]
