 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the PFAS Action Act.   As the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, I  have participated in many hours of hearings during the previous  Congress where we explored issues involving PFAS materials and heard  from witnesses spanning many perspectives on this important issue.   As legislation and regulations are advanced to address PFAS issues,  it is critical that we ensure that these efforts define the chemicals  of concern consistently, adequately, and properly as supported by sound  science. In the current bill, however, what is ultimately classified as  a PFAS material is either left open to interpretation by EPA or broadly  defined. Using either approach risks subjecting potentially thousands  of chemicals to unnecessary regulation or restriction.   As we have heard previously in the House Oversight and Reform  Committee, and as we have heard on the floor this week during debate on  various amendments, a broad definition of PFAS could subject such key  products as lithium-ion batteries, semiconductors, refrigerants, and  medical devices, to name just a few, to regulation and restriction. All  these products provide important benefits, and some, in the case of  batteries and semiconductors, have been specifically highlighted by  President Biden as part of his efforts to review and reshore critical  supply chains.   It is, therefore, essential that we properly define PFAS, so that  implementing regulations can focus on those materials, such as PFOA and  PFOS, where there is scientific consensus for regulation, while also  ensuring that unnecessary regulations are not placed on key uses of  PFAS.   I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the definitions and  criteria that are being put forward as the basis for PFAS regulation  and to take steps to ensure that these classifications are carefully  tailored and supported by sound science.
