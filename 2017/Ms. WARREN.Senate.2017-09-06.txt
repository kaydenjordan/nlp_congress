Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, our country is in trouble. America--and  this government right here in Washington--works great for people at the  top, works great for corporations that can hire armies of lobbyists and  lawyers, but for everyone else, America isn't working so well. For  decades, expenses have gone up while wages have been flat. Economic  opportunity is slipping away from too many Americans.   We know how to fix what is happening--by kicking the lobbyists and  the lawyers and the rich donors and the giant companies out of the room  and putting working families first. The President of the United States  isn't interested in doing that. His first major legislative initiative  was to try to boot tens of millions of people off their health  insurance. His second major legislative initiative is to try to give  giant tax breaks to rich folks and enormous corporations while working  people pay for them.   I suppose it is not surprising that the President has no intention of  helping working families. After all, he is a rich donor, and he  personally profits every single day from a giant company he named after  himself.   Here is Donald Trump, a man who promised over and over during the  Presidential campaign that he would be on the side of working people.  Here is Donald Trump doing the exact opposite of what he told the  American people he would do. It is the exact opposite of what the  American people need him to do. Sooner or later, it is going to catch  up with him. President Trump wants to delay that reckoning for as long  as possible. From the day he first announced his Presidential campaign,  it has been obvious how he plans to do it--by turning us against each  other, by telling everyone that the real problem in America is the  neighbor who doesn't look like you, the coworker who doesn't worship  like you, the guy in the grocery store who doesn't sound like you.   Nowhere has this been more obvious than on the politics of race. In  November, President Trump named Jeff Sessions--a man considered too  racist to  [[Page S4990]]  be a Federal judge--as our Nation's Attorney General. In January,  President Trump rolled out an unconstitutional Muslim ban. In August,  after White supremacists marched in the streets, President Trump  defended hate. Also in August, he used his first Presidential pardon to  shield a racist former sheriff who broke the law.   Yesterday morning, the President continued his campaign to turn us  against each other when he decided to end the DACA Program. DACA gives  800,000 young people who were brought to the United States as children  the chance to live, work, get an education, and become valuable members  of our society. The President said he would end the program. That means  over 800,000 young people who have been here their entire lives, who  came out of the shadows to contribute to our economy, could be deported  to countries they barely know.   Divide and conquer is an old story in America. It is a cold,  political calculation. Those with money and power have used it time and  time again to keep us fighting with each other--fighting over religion,  fighting over race, fighting over anything that keeps us from coming  together to fight back against a rigged system.   President Trump wants us to turn our backs on 800,000 Dreamers,  including nearly 8,000 Dreamers in Massachusetts. He doesn't want us to  look at these young people and see them for who they are; he just wants  us to see them as threats. After all, he launched his campaign by  calling immigrants rapists and criminals, and that is exactly what he  wants everyone else to see. I would like to introduce three Dreamers  from Massachusetts and let the American people decide if that is true.   Reina Guevara fled from El Salvador when she was only 11 years old.  She is a model student. She won a scholarship, and right now she is  working on her bachelor's degree at UMass Boston.   Before the DACA Program allowed her to come out of the shadows, Reina  worked up to 70 hours a week in a restaurant for a boss who sexually  harassed her. On multiple occasions, he propositioned her to have a  sexual relationship with him, threatening to call immigration on her if  she refused his advances. The harassment became so frequent and so bad  that Reina decided to quit her job, forgoing critical income. Knowing  there was no one for her to tell, her boss refused to pay her for her  last 2 weeks of work.   Reina was an easy target. A woman without official immigration status  was a woman who couldn't complain to HR when she was assaulted,  underpaid, or made to work in dangerous conditions. A woman without  immigration status was a woman who knew that speaking up could mean  immediate deportation.   When Reina entered the DACA Program, her life changed. It meant she  could stand up for herself without being afraid that she would be  kicked out of America.   I asked Reina what DACA means to her. This is what she told me:  ``DACA to me means the opportunity to be the first one in my family to  graduate with a Bachelor's Degree, to work without the fear of being  humiliated and exploited due to my status.'' Donald Trump wants Reina  banished from our country.   Bruno Villegas McCubbin was 6 years old when he left his home. Like  most parents, Bruno's mother and father wanted to keep their children  safe. That wasn't easy when Peru's economy collapsed. Bruno's father,  who was a traveling salesman, was forced to travel to more remote and  more dangerous places. It got so dangerous that on one trip, Bruno said  he was attacked by armed robbers and injured by flying glass from  gunshots.   After that, Bruno's parents decided they should escape to America.  Bruno's family settled in Garden Grove, CA, where Bruno and his sister  and his parents shared one room in his uncle's two-bedroom apartment.  Bruno's parents, who had white-collar jobs in Peru, worked 12-hour days  in low-wage jobs just to keep food on the table. While his parents were  hard at work, Bruno was building dreams. He threw himself into his  studies. When he graduated from high school, he was second in his  class. Bruno did a lot more than just study; he founded an organization  to help struggling students. He served as a tutor. He played the  saxophone.   Bruno was in high school when the DACA Program began. Today, he is a  junior at Harvard, where he serves as a student coordinator for the  Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which provides financial aid  information to promising high school students from low-income families.   I asked Bruno what DACA means to him. He said: ``It means the  opportunity for many of us to work here legally and achieve the  American Dream that this country still boasts, so we can then give back  to our families that have sacrificed so much for us, and to the country  that helped form us into what we are today.'' Donald Trump wants Bruno  banished from our country.   I could do this all night, but others want a chance to tell their  stories as well. So I am just going to do one more: Elias Rosenfeld.  Like Bruno, Elias was 6 years old when his parents brought him and his  sister to the United States. He remembers hearing stories every day of  violence in Venezuela. A gun was pulled on his mother while her car was  at a stoplight, and his grandfather was robbed after making a bank  withdrawal. To keep her kids safe, Elias' mother transferred to a  company in Miami on a visa that allows executives and managers from  other countries to work in the United States and then to apply for  permanent resident status. But she never got the chance to apply for  permanent resident status because when Elias was 11, his mother died of  cancer. When he lost his mother, Elias lost his protected status  without even knowing it.   In high school, Elias took tough classes, including 13 advanced  placement courses. He worked hard, and he earned nearly straight A's.  He served in student government and on the speech and debate teams. He  volunteered with the Children's Trust and also with the Homeless Trust.  The activities director at Elias' high school called Elias his hero. He  said: ``I've been teaching here for 20 years and I've never seen a  student like this young man.''   Elias' commitment to academic excellence earned him a Myra Kraft  Transitional Year Program scholarship to attend Brandeis University.  Earlier this year, Elias worked as an intern in my office. I asked  Elias what DACA meant to him. He said it has been a ``source of  optimism and a light of protection.'' He wrote:         For years, before DACA arrived I would sleep in bed at       night with a constant fear of deportation, imagining in my       head the visual of ICE breaking through my door to deport       myself or my sister. When DACA came, this fear stopped. . . .    But Donald Trump wants Elias banished from our country.   America asked people like Elias, Bruno, Reina, and nearly a million  young people all across this country to come out of the shadows. We  made them a promise: Work hard, play by the rules, contribute to  America, get an education, defend our country, help us build an economy  that works, and in exchange we won't knock on your door in the middle  of the night and rip you from your home and ship you off to a foreign  country you barely remember.   President Trump decided to break that promise. He is hiding behind  Jeff Sessions and some flimsy lawyer nonsense, but he is breaking that  promise, pure and simple. That means he is failing in his basic, moral  duty to protect these people, these children of America.   That is not who America is. America is not a place that punishes  children for the sins of their fathers. America is not a place that  boots out smart, hard-working, decent young people who have spent  nearly all their lives here and who are a core part of our Nation's  future.   Donald Trump wants to turn us against each other. He wants to banish  Reina, Bruno, Elias, and hundreds of thousands of other young people  from our country. He says that is how we will build a better America.   Well, Donald Trump is wrong. He wants to build a hateful and  frightened America. But we have the chance to turn away from the hate  and fear. We have the chance right here in Congress to take an  important step toward building a stronger, more vibrant America. We  have the chance to make DACA the law so that Donald Trump cannot take  away the dreams of 800,000  [[Page S4991]]  young people like Reina, Bruno, and Elias. We can and we must pass the  Dream Act now.   Thank you, Mr. President.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.
