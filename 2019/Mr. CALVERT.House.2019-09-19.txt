 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and chairwoman  for their good work.   I rise today in support of the continuing resolution. Like many of my  colleagues, we are hopeful that, once we had a budget deal, we would  move to conference and the appropriations bills and pass them, if not  on time, close to on time. Unfortunately, the Senate needs more time,  and this will give the Senate the time and the House time to do their  work.   The CR expires November 21. There is more than enough time to sit  down with our colleagues in the Senate to work out our differences. In  fact, I would hope we can still move quickly and, if able, pass  conference bills before the end of the CR--most importantly, for our  U.S. servicemembers.   Our military has moved quickly to restore readiness and modernize.  Secretary Esper has demonstrated his commitment to a modern, more agile  Department that can quickly respond to threats, and he needs our  support to continue his efforts.   I am confident that once the chairman and I have had a chance to sit  down with our Senate colleagues, we can quickly work out our  differences and write a bill that keeps the military on the path toward  meeting the challenges posed by our adversaries, which there is no lack  of.   Recent events demonstrate that the world needs our leadership and  presence. I urge my colleagues to vote for this CR and avoid the  devastating impacts of a government shutdown. Let's get to work on the  fiscal year 2020 bills to ensure the continuity of vital efforts at the  Department of Defense. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
