 First, Madam President, I thank my colleagues who are  on the floor today--Senator Tuberville for his leadership, Senator  Budd, and Senator Ernst--for their efforts in the protection of women  and girls in sports. As a doctor, I share their concerns, share their  passion in terms of fairness, in terms of safety, and I congratulate  them on their efforts and continue to join them in those efforts to  provide the protection for women and girls in sports.                                    Energy    Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about the high  price of Democrats' misguided energy agenda. It is a high-price crisis  entirely of President Biden and the Democratic Party's own making.   Last year, when energy prices were already at historic highs, what  did Democrats do? Well, they voted 10 times--time after time after  time--against increasing American energy production. Instead, Democrats  jammed through the Senate and the House the largest climate bill in  American history. The climate extremists applauded this.   Let me just say, hold the applause, because the American public is  suffering. Families all across this great land are hurting. Democrats'  reckless spending in the past 2 years has driven up the cost of energy  and, of course, as everyone knows, this has fueled inflation.   Inflation reached a 40-year high because of Democrats' spending.  Prices today are over 15 percent higher than they were the day Joe  Biden took office. Energy prices have gone up even more than that.  Americans are paying 36 percent more for energy today than they were in  January of 2021. Gas prices to fill the tank are up 46 percent. That is  a 5-month high. They are going to continue to go up during this  summer's driving season.   The lower gas prices that the administration desperately and  irresponsibly depleted our Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to  achieve last year has hurt our economy and has hurt our country and has  hurt our national security.   Democrats were wrong to raid our emergency supplies of petroleum  products in a desperate attempt to lower gas prices leading up to the  November 2022 elections.   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is our Nation's emergency reserve.  Now it is out of gas. It is down to the lowest level it has been at in  40 years. Not refilling it. Oh, no.   Joe Biden knew we needed more energy than that. So he went on bended  knee to foreign dictators, begging them to produce more oil to help  lower gas prices here in America but not letting us produce it here at  home--and we have plenty.   This President did everything he could to try to lower gas prices  except the thing the American people know would work, and that is to  produce more American energy. So American families are once again  facing that double whammy of an energy crisis coupled with an inflation  crisis.   Democrats are doing absolutely nothing to help solve the problem.  Remember, the Biden administration began working on day No. 1 to choke  off America's energy resources: killed the Keystone XL Pipeline,  canceled oil and gas leases.   America's energy revolution turned us into the world's energy  superpower. Our economy had a wonderful, competitive advantage. It is  good for families, good for workers.   We challenged dictators without having to worry about our energy  supply. We had affordable, reliable, and available American energy.  This administration and the Democrats in this body squandered the gains  that we had achieved.   They attacked American oil, natural gas, and coal at every turn along  the way. Then they raised taxes to make it even more expensive. They  instituted burdensome regulations to make it more difficult to produce  the American energy.   They have put up roadblock after roadblock on every type of American  energy. And yet Joe Biden and the Democrats, open-mouthed, looked with  surprise: Why have the prices skyrocketed?   Anybody could have predicted that choking off our energy supply would  lead to record-high energy prices and to increase dependence on our  adversaries--Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela.   Last week, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm testified before the  Energy Committee. I specifically asked her about the administration's  plan to lower gas prices and energy prices across the board, because  they are up across the board. They are up for heating energy; they are  up for driving energy.   Her solution: government mandates, phase out anything powered by oil,  [[Page S1368]]  natural gas, or coal. Take away our gas stoves, take away our gas- powered water heaters, force-feed us expensive electric cars that don't  work for many people across the country.   They may be OK for rich people in the big cities who don't have to  drive very much, who can afford to pay $16,000 more for a vehicle than  for a traditional car. But for Wyoming families and Wyoming farmers and  Wyoming ranchers, they just don't work.   People want affordable, reliable vehicles. And for people all around  rural America, electric cars are not it.   Americans don't support the Democrats' climate extremism. Look at the  polls. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say they don't want to buy an  electric car. They don't want to be force-fed by Joe Biden. They don't  want to have the government in the driver's seat.   They say the price is too high. It is $64,000 on average. The  batteries are unreliable. Charging them is inconvenient. It is time- consuming. It takes a long time to get a battery charged, and it can't  go all that far.   And then who benefits from all of this? China. That is because most  of the critical minerals that are needed to build these batteries come  right out of China. Just look for the ``made in China'' sticker on the  batteries of the electric vehicles.   This country should be focusing on strengthening our energy  independence, not finding ways to become more dependent to China or  Russia.   So the reality of Secretary Granholm's so-called solution to lowering  prices is that Americans will just pay more; not really concerned about  affordability, but I didn't hear that word at all.   The way to lower prices is to unleash American energy. Now, the House  recently passed legislation to do just that. And I support their  efforts.   Senator Capito and I are going to soon introduce our own legislation  in the Senate. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee is going to  hold a hearing on the critical issues in the coming weeks.   We can only unleash American energy if we fix our broken permitting  system process. Right now, new energy projects are bogged down by a  maze of redtape and lawsuits.   Our legislation is going to include enforceable timelines on  environmental reviews and filing legal challenges. We are going to move  forward faster with an all-of-the-above American energy agenda. We need  it all.   My Democratic colleagues have stated before that they do want  permitting reform. Well, we will see. They are going to have an  opportunity to speak up and to vote; because if they are serious, real  reform is possible. If they are serious, we can tell the American  people that real relief is on the way.   We do need a long-term commitment in this country to American energy.  Making life more affordable for every American should be a bipartisan  priority. It hasn't been for the first 2 years in the Biden  administration and now going into the third.   We need to get back to a point where we can make energy affordable,  available, and reliable--instead of focusing, as the Democrats do, on  only renewable energy, regardless of the cost and regardless of the  consequences.   I yield the floor.
