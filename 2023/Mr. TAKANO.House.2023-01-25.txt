 Madam Speaker, I was unable to cast my vote on H. Con.  Res. 7--Commedning the bravery, courage, and resolve of the women and  men of Iran demonstrating in more than 133 cities and risking their  safety to speak out against the Iranian regime's human rights abuses.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 36.
