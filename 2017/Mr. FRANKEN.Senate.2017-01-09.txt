 Mr. President, like my colleagues here today, I rise to  talk about the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable  Care Act. I have been talking to a lot of people in Minnesota who have  health insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, or whose lives are  changed by the protections in the ACA that benefit every American.  Frankly, they are scared, hard-working people for whom this is  literally life or death. If their health insurance is taken away, they  do not know what they are going to do.   Today, on their behalf, I have one request for my Republican  colleagues: Show us your health care plan. You must have one. We would  like to hear it. We would like to see it now. You can understand the  question, right? If your child had cancer and the Affordable Care Act  was the reason you could get health insurance, you wouldn't want to rip  up the ACA before knowing what would replace it. I am not the only  Senator with constituents whose lives are on the line here, so I know  that you don't intend to rip up the Affordable Care Act and leave them  with nothing. You have to have a plan, right? So let's just see it.   Last week, President Obama said that if Republicans produce a plan  that is ``demonstrably better than ObamaCare,'' he would support it,  and so will I. Just show it to me. President-Elect Trump clearly has a  plan. He laid it out, laid it all out during his campaign. His plan  was, he said, to ``repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something  terrific.'' That is what he said. Then he went into a little more  detail and explained that ``something terrific'' would be ``so much  better, so much better, so much better.''    Terrific. So much better. That sounds great. Let's see it. One of  Trump's top advisers said on MSNBC: ``We don't want anyone who  currently has insurance to not have insurance.'' Great. Neither do we.  Speaker Ryan said that there will ``be a bridge so that no one is left  out in the cold, so that no one is worse off.'' That is wonderful. No  one being worse off is exactly what we want to see.   I am sure Speaker Ryan's staff was mistaken when they later told a  reporter that the ``no one worse off'' applied only to the transition  period, not to the replacement period. Show me the plan, please. Please  show me the plan that keeps coverage for the 20 million people who have  gained coverage that would continue to bend the cost curve so the cost  of the entire health care system continues to grow less quickly than it  did before ACA was adopted, the plan that would ensure that nobody gets  denied coverage when they need it or has to unfairly pay more than  someone else because of their gender or a preexisting condition. Show  me that plan.   I know Republicans have put forward some different plans, a lot of  different plans, but a lot of plans is not a plan. A lot of plans is  not a plan. We want to see the plan, you know, the one you have been  working on for 6 years. I was here in 2009 when we passed the ACA. I  know how hard it was. If I could, let me offer you something. Some of  your Republican friends actually did come up with a health care plan a  while ago. It all started at the Heritage Foundation, which is a bona  fide conservative think tank.   Over at Heritage, they did not like the idea of single-payer health  care insurance, where the government is everyone's insurer. So what  they wanted to come up with was a way to use the magic of the  marketplace to solve the problem of providing everyone access to  insurance.   Here is what they came up with, a three-legged stool. The first leg  is, insurance companies can't deny coverage to people with a  preexisting condition. They can't charge them more. We can all agree on  that, right? President-Elect Trump and I agree on that, for sure. It is  a great idea--great idea--but there is a catch. If you can not turn  people down because of preexisting conditions, you cannot charge them  more, well then everyone would just wait to buy health insurance until  they get sick and need care. But the whole idea of health insurance is  that at any given moment, most of the people paying premiums are  healthy. So their premiums cover the cost of the people who are sick.   If the only people with insurance are sick, the premiums will  skyrocket. So you need a way to get healthy people into the system to  bring the cost of insurance down, which brings us to leg No. 2.  Everyone has to be insured, otherwise known as the individual mandate.  Everyone has to be insured. The Heritage Foundation said that. They  called it the free rider syndrome. They said, no, everyone has to be  insured.   This is what conservatives now say they hate; that the government  says everyone has to buy insurance. But if you have to sell everyone  insurance, then everyone has to buy it or the cost explodes. Now, look,  if you have a better way to keep people covered and keep costs down,  show me the plan. Show me the plan. But this is the best one the  Heritage Foundation could come up with.   But wait, what if someone can't afford that health insurance? That  brings us to the third leg. The government will subsidize insurance for  people who can't afford it. Voila. There you have it, the Heritage  Foundation plan, which a Republican Governor then implemented in a  State to huge success.   Let me ask you, my Republican friends, is that your plan? Because if  it is, it works for me. Guess what. Then we don't even have to repeal  the Affordable Care Act in order to replace it with this plan because  this plan was the model for the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable  Care Act is not perfect. Premiums went up a lot this fall for people  buying insurance through the marketplace.   It is often ignored that subsidies cover the cost increases for about  70 percent of those folks, but for many those increases genuinely hurt.  That is a real problem. Then the solution to it is to recognize that  subsidies don't provide enough help and don't go to enough people.  Let's fix that. There are places where there is not enough competition.  The best and most direct solution that I know of is to introduce a  public option.   If my Republican colleagues have another idea about how to address  these costs and competition issues that would ensure that people don't  lose their coverage, I am ready to roll up my sleeves and go to work.  While we are honest about the shortcomings, let's not forget the bottom  line. As a primary care doctor for Indiana University's Health  Physicians said, ``I've been a registered Republican my whole life, but  I support the Affordable Care Act because it allows patients to be  taken care of.''   For 6 years, you have been blasting the ACA, promising to replace it  with something better. Let's see what you have, but don't just tell me  your plan. I want you to join me on a trip to Minnesota to see Dolly.  Dolly is one of my constituents who wrote to me about her husband's  pulmonary embolism. Before the ACA, she and her husband both had jobs  that did not offer health insurance, but once the ACA passed, they were  able to buy insurance and go to the doctor.   The doctor discovered her husband's embolism and saved his life. I  would like you to look Dolly in the eye and explain how your plan--your  plan--will ensure that her husband's life will not be endangered.   I would like you to join me in talking to Gina. Before the ACA became  law, Gina's father was undergoing treatment for leukemia. Then one day  he was told he had hit the lifetime maximum on his insurance coverage.  From that point on, the family would have to  [[Page S149]]  pay for his treatment out of pocket, but they did not have the money so  they stopped treatment. Gina's father died 3 days later.   Since then, Gina's fiance was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. So I  want you to explain to Gina how exactly under your plan Gina will not  face the same kind of impossible financial situation with her future  husband's condition that she did with her dad. Sit down with Gina and  tell her that.   Now, once you are done calming Gina's concerns about what your plan  might do to her family, we will go over and talk to Leanna. Leanna's 3- year-old son Henry has been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic  leukemia. His treatment will last until at least April of 2018. He  often needs around-the-clock care to manage his nausea, vomiting, pain,  and sleepless nights. Little Henry's immune system is so compromised  that he is not supposed to go to daycare. So Leanna has left her job to  take care of him. They are supported by her spouse, but they could not  pay for his treatment on one salary.   Leanna says:         It is because of the ACA that Henry gets proper health       care. Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to       maintain his health and work towards beating cancer. Henry is       still with us because of the ACA.    Let me say that again. ``Henry is still with us because of the ACA.''  I want you to sit down with Leanna, as she holds her precious 3-year- old son, and explain how Henry will still be with us under your plan.  Show us your plan. Show us your plan.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
