 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to lead  this critical Special Order to speak about the lack of family values  demonstrated by the Trump administration and the GOP, their choice to  mismanage, and to offer a counternarrative to the wayward path they are  leading us down.   Black people have no permanent friends or permanent enemies or  permanent interests, as so eloquently stated by former Congressman  William Lacy Clay, Sr.   Mr. Speaker, the President asked Black Americans: What do you have to  lose?   The Congressional Black Caucus responded with a document that was  hand-delivered to him that is titled, ``We Have a Lot to Lose.''   Over the course of the 2016 Presidential election, time and time  again, then-candidate Donald Trump asked the Black community a larger  question: ``What do you have to lose?''   The inquiry presupposes that the experience of all African Americans  is destitute and that we live in fear. In fact, President Trump  declared some African Americans' communities are  [[Page H5636]]  worse than war zones, demonstrating a lack of understanding of both  constituencies.   The election has come and gone, and the time for the campaign calls  is over. Now President Trump represents all Americans and must govern  this Nation for the good of all Americans, whether they are Black or  White, rich or poor, conservative or liberal.   So as the conscience of the Congress, the voice of the 78 million  Americans and 17 million African Americans, the Congressional Black  Caucus is obligated to answer President Trump's questions.   The answer: The African Americans have a great deal to lose under the  Trump administration, and we have already lost a lot.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our chairman, Chairman Richmond, for  allowing me this opportunity to conduct this Special Order.   Over the next hour, we will speak about some of the issues that have  faced the Congressional Black Caucus and Black people in this Nation. I  say that to you because of this document I have in my hand, ``We Have a  Lot to Lose.'' In this document that was presented to the President of  the United States, it outlines those various issues.   What are we losing?   Based on last week's passage of the farm bill here in the House, we  have lost benefits under the SNAP program. Thank God for the Senate,  Mr. Speaker, because the Senate has passed a different version. I hope,  Mr. Speaker, that that version will be the version that becomes the law  of this land.   The Senate passed a version 20-1 out of committee, and they will  bring that up for a vote because, Mr. Speaker, I believe that  represents better the views and values of Members of this body. I do  not believe the version that we passed in the farm bill represents this  body.   I am disappointed that the GOP leadership had the unmitigated gall to  bring this highly partisan and warped bill to the House floor for a  second vote, posing as a farm bill. Nothing changed in the bill since  the last time it came to the floor, so you have to wonder what was  offered or said to those Members who voted ``no'' just a month ago to  change their votes.   The partisan approach of the majority has produced a bill that will  hurt thousands of people in the city of Philadelphia and the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Agriculture Committee, I submitted  letters from the mayor of the city of Philadelphia. In that letter, the  mayor of the city of Philadelphia laid out specifically the impact that  that particular bill that came out of the House Agriculture Committee  would have on the people of the city of Philadelphia. You are talking  about affecting over 200,000 to 300,000 people in the city of  Philadelphia.   In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 1.8 million people can be  affected. In Montgomery County, in the county I represent, 50,000  people are affected.   So, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that that bill that passed this House by  only two votes was misguided and was heading in the wrong direction.   It is also clear, Mr. Speaker, that people who are on SNAP do not  fight to be on SNAP. They understand clearly about the challenges that  they face.   Forty-two million Americans are on SNAP. No, Mr. Speaker, those  people are not fearful of work. They understand if there is a great  opportunity available for them, they would take advantage of the  opportunity.   I think it is clear to me, Mr. Speaker, that, again, this  administration and the GOP were lacking some sense of connection to  what people's values are. As a result, you saw that vote that took  place last week. It again sends us in the wrong direction. It raises  serious questions about the lack of family values from a party that is  always talking about family values; but now, all of a sudden, Mr.  Speaker, it seems like family values have gone out the window. Under  this version of the farm bill, people will go hungry in my city and  around the Nation.   As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes, the House bill  breaks with the long history of bipartisan efforts to improve and  reform SNAP. It is clear, Mr. Speaker, there were 23 hearings on the  issue of SNAP, and not one single time in the 23 hearings did they  suggest that there should be a different direction in terms of SNAP.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats are for work. We are very clear. Members of  the Congressional Black Caucus understand the importance of work. We  know what it means to work. But to me, Mr. Speaker, that was a  wrongheaded policy in terms of the farm bill. It did not justify that  action, and it should not have even gone anywhere.   But as usual, Mr. Speaker, some people don't realize the election is  over. We need to work together--Democrat, Republican, conservative,  liberal, whoever it may be--because hunger is a problem, Mr. Speaker.  It is not a problem just in certain communities; it is a problem across  this Nation.   In spite of the employment numbers and in spite of what is told to us  about the economy, there are a lot of people who are hungry. There are  a lot of people who are left out of the process. This is not something  that we should take lightly.                                time  2030    This is something that we would recognize and something we should  work together on.   So, Mr. Speaker, I say to you today that it is clear to me that the  Republicans and the Trump administration have gone in the wrong  direction. When you talk about the issue of families and what needs to  take place, this is not about family values.   I stress to you, Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, millions of  Americans who receive SNAP are consumers and are important parts of the  economy who our farmers and ranchers depend on as a part of our farm  and food economy.   Mr. Speaker, I have consistently said that food is medicine. Food is  medicine and food policy is foreign policy. It is not something we  should take lightly.   So today, the Congressional Black Caucus is going to talk about the  importance of values, and particularly family values, and how all of a  sudden there is amnesia when it comes down to the question of values.   We are saying to you today, Mr. Speaker, we want to make sure that  people understand that the 42 million people who are on SNAP across  this Nation are of all colors, of all races. It can happen to any of  us. It is not something that we should sit back and all of a sudden  think that this couldn't happen to anyone. This could happen to our  brothers and our sisters. And we are our brother's and sister's keeper.  It is not something that we should just willy-nilly suddenly say to  ourselves that we shouldn't worry about. Yet, the GOP not only failed  them, they failed America last week.   In addition, healthcare is one of the most important issues for our  country, as seen by the mass rejection of the efforts by the GOP to  repeal the Affordable Care Act last year.   Think about this, Mr. Speaker. Healthcare. Everybody has the right to  a healthy life, regardless of age, race, gender, or preexisting  condition. Medical issues are personal matters. Whether it affects  physical or mental health, it should not result in financial ruin. We  all should know and recognize that it is clear that any of us can have  a health episode. No one is above it. It is something that we should  not take lightly.   Mr. Speaker, we as the Congressional Black Caucus know and  understand. And that is why we have fought so hard for healthcare. We  have stressed over and over again that this, too, can happen to you.   We understand that, with preexisting conditions and the challenges  that we have in our community of high blood pressure, diabetes, and  other types of diseases, this is something we should address. We should  make sure that people know and can take advantage of a healthcare  system that is open and available. We should not be bankrupting people,  Mr. Speaker, on the issue of healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, when the President and the GOP talk about family values,  they seem to forget that when it comes down to the question of  healthcare, that is something that we all should be ensuring everybody  has. That is not a Democrat or Republican issue. That is an American  issue. That is something right up there that we all should recognize  that healthcare should be available to everyone. When we look at it and  think about it, this is something we have to work for.  [[Page H5637]]    There is no simple answer to dealing with the question of healthcare,  but we do believe the Affordable Care Act is a great foundation. We  believe that the Affordable Care Act basically laid a tone and a  foundation for this entire country.   As we all know, we have healthcare here in this House, in the United  States Senate, and the President of the United States has healthcare.  And that is provided for by the taxpayers of this country.   So it is not something we should take lightly. It is something that  we should all understand that health issues can affect us all. When you  really think about it, in terms of getting a job, how can you do that  if you are not healthy? How can you take care of your family if you are  not healthy? How can you do anything if you are not healthy?   This is something we believe is a family value and this is something  that we all have said over and again. I believe healthcare is a  fundamental right and not a privilege. No one should ever be afraid  that taking care of their physical or mental health will cause  financial hardship or be inaccessible to them for any reason.   I want to repeat that again, Mr. Speaker. I believe that healthcare  is a fundamental right and not a privilege. No one should ever be  afraid that taking care of their physical or mental health will cause  financial hardship or be inaccessible to them for any reason at all. We  need to think about that. We need to carefully think about exactly what  that means.   When we talk about it in this day and age of family values, what is  more important to a family than the health of the breadwinner, male or  female? What is important to someone who is looking for an opportunity  and they are prepared to go on that job?   It is very important, Mr. Speaker, that under the Affordable Care Act  it allowed people to stay on their parent's healthcare until age 26.  Also, the part about preexisting conditions. Don't take that lightly,  Mr. Speaker. That is something that we all could be affected by.   It seems to me that over and over again in this House we seem to  neglect to think about the conditions that we all face. Mr. Speaker, in  healthcare, we have those moments where it can be with anyone and any  condition they could be under. It is something that we should really  understand and recognize. It is something that we shouldn't take  lightly.   Healthcare is, to me, the most essential issue we face today. It is  something that we all should be fighting for, no matter what party we  come from, no matter what part of the country we come from. We should  all understand what it means.   I will continue to be a voice for the voiceless to ensure adequate  healthcare for all. That is something I believe is extremely essential,  Mr. Speaker.   When I thought about giving these words, I basicall said, again, we  are going to speak about the lack of family values demonstrated by the  Trump administration. The Trump administration and the GOP talk about  family values a lot. How can you talk about family values when you want  to eliminate the SNAP program? How can you talk about family values  when you want to reduce people's healthcare?    You can't talk about family values when, in the very same breath, you  are talking about destroying people's healthcare and access to food.  There is something fundamentally wrong with that.   So, Mr. Speaker, I stress to you today that this is not a partisan  issue. Feeding people and healthcare is not Democrat or Republican. It  is not conservative or liberal. It is something that we all need to be  concerned with. If we are talking about moving America forward, then we  will move it forward when we bring others along. I stress this is  something that we all should be concerned with.   Turning to more hypocrisy from the party of family values, the Trump  administration's unilateral decision to separate migrant children from  their parents at the Southern border is just the latest example of the  majority party refusing to practice what it preaches.   Just think abut it. Migrant children. Migrant children. Migrant  children. Migrant children. I said that four times. I said that four  times because I think it hasn't gotten through.   When you talk about separating children from their families, there is  something wrong with that, Mr. Speaker. When you talk about using that  for a political purpose and you talk about using them as an example of  children and families, there is something wrong with that, Mr. Speaker.  That is not the kind of America we want. We do not want an America  where we are going to separate children and families. Children and  families should be united. We should bring them together.   Mr. Speaker, when we hear the statement that Democrats want to  basically just let anybody in the country, we know that is just for  political rhetoric. Remember, I said earlier, going back to when we  passed this book out that says we have a lot to lose, we said, Mr.  Speaker, in the very beginning of this book, that the election is over.   I understand in 132 days there will be an election. Well, let the  election speak for itself, Mr. Speaker. Let the results speak for  themselves.   But there is no way you can talk about separating families. There is  no way you can talk about separating children. There is no way that  2,300 to 2,500 children who are spread wherever they maybe, that is not  the kind of America we want. That is not family values.   So if you talk about reducing SNAP and you talk about reducing  healthcare and you talk about separating families, there is something  wrong with that, Mr. Speaker. There is something wrong when we are now  at a point where we are separating families.   Mr. Speaker, there have been a number of Members who have gone to the  various borders and seen for themselves firsthand what is taking place.  This is not the kind of America we want.   For a party that professes to understand the importance of advancing  policies that promote family values, we now have a preponderance of  evidence to the contrary.   I just ticked them off: SNAP, healthcare, and now separating  families. If you take those three areas, there is something wrong with  the context of talking about family values.   It is clearly that whether it is an excessive punitive immigration  policy, changes to the free lunch program eligibility, proposals to cut  Supplemental Security Income, or the refusal to adopt comprehensive  criminal justice reform, the Republican policy agenda deliberately  targets families, especially those in underserved communities of color.   Mr. Speaker, we are, in my view, in a very challenging time. We are  probably, in my lifetime, in the most challenging time I have ever  seen. This requires a different kind of leadership. It requires a  leadership that puts America first. And in order to put America first,  that means we must work together. We must work together on a farm bill  that is bipartisan and that doesn't reduce SNAP. We must work to ensure  healthcare is available. And we must be clear, Mr. Speaker, that we  have an opportunity to make these things happen.   So I stress to you with the things that I have just stressed, that  clearly we have got a chance to do something about these things. These  problems persist even in the wake of the administration's immigration  policy reversal and the so-called executive order.   Several members of the CBC have expressed concerns about the  Republicans' inability to devise a coherent reunification plan for the  children and parents separated by the President's misguided policy.   An American crisis is happening right now in front of us. Children,  from the toddlers at the border to Dreamers losing DACA to American- born children of immigrant parents, have become the victims of Trump's  America.    Let me repeat that. An American crisis is happening right now in  front of us. Children, from the toddlers at the border to Dreamers  losing DACA to American-born children of immigrant parents, children  have become victims in Trump's America. This is not what should be  happening in America.   Mr. Speaker, yes, we have our challenges, but the fact of the matter  is that we need to work together. So as a member of the Congressional  Black Caucus, I stand here, Mr. Speaker, saying to you that the  Congressional  [[Page H5638]]  Black Caucus is ready to work together to make a difference.   The practice of punishing parents who are trying to save their  children's lives and punishing children for being brought to safety by  their parents by separating them is fundamentally cruel and un-America.  That should not be accepted, Mr. Speaker.   For this next hour, we, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus,  are standing up to shine light on this situation.   We are determined to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that people understand  that this should no longer be acceptable; we should not continue to pit  this section against that section; and that we all understand, when it  is all said and done, that we are in this together. Although, as Dr.  King said, we may have come over on different boats, we are in the same  boat now. That is called America--an America that is inclusive.   The Department of Homeland Security denied that they were breaking  the sacred bond between parents and children until The New York Times  reported that more than 700 children have been separated from their  moms and their dads since October.   Family unity is recognized as a fundamental human right enshrined in  international law. The Trump administration's proposed action to  separate immigrant families flies in the face of this law. It must  stop. It must stop, Mr. Speaker. The practice of separating children  from parents as a deterrent to seeking asylum is inhumane and cruel.  Seeking asylum is not illegal. In fact, it is written into U.S.  immigration law to ensure that those with a credible fear of  persecution that they can present their case.                                time  2045    The American Academy of Pediatrics opposed DHS's proposal that would  separate mothers from their children arriving at the border, saying  that, in a time of anxiety and stress, children need to be with their  parents, family members, and caregivers.   I stand here tonight, on the 6-month anniversary of the tax bill. But  before I speak on that, I have a colleague of mine from the great State  of Texas. She has been in the forefront. I have watched her in the  short period of time I have been here. When she speaks, there are many  who listen to her.   She is relentless. I have watched her be relentless, driven,  purposeful, and focused. She is the great lady from the State of Texas.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas, Congresswoman  Sheila Jackson Lee.    Mr. Speaker, can you tell me how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask one quick question then.   Ms. Jackson Lee has visited some of these locations. Can she  describe--because I haven't been there, or maybe for people who  haven't--exactly what is going on in those centers.    Mr. Speaker, I want to end with that comment by the great  gentlewoman from the State of Texas on Chairman Richmond's leadership  of the Congressional Black Caucus. There is no better way to end than  that comment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
