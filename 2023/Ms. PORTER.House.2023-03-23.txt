 Mr. Speaker, across the country, too many Americans are  competing for too few homes. Building material shortages push up  development costs, slow construction, and leave families scrambling.   Cities, States, and industry cannot alone overcome these staggering  obstacles. They need Federal cooperation, and Washington is failing to  be a good partner.   Last Congress, we had a real shot at getting this done. I backed a  bipartisan proposal to give States more tax credits to build affordable  homes. It would have modernized bond financing requirements to fund  more housing with less debt.   These actions could have helped build more than 300,000 homes in  California. We would lower costs for families, bring new jobs to our  communities, and grow our entire economy.   Americans are struggling because of the housing crisis, a crisis of  cost and supply. Californians have a message for Washington: We need  help with housing.                            ____________________
