 Madam Speaker, I would like to address my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle and reiterate President Washington's warning to  the Republic 223 years ago.   The Constitution rightly sets a high bar for impeachment, but the  integrity of the process also depends on the ability of the legislators  to vote their minds, independent of party politics.   Removing a President is too important and lawmakers are given too  much latitude to define ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' for it to be  any other way. Otherwise, excessively partisan politicians could  overturn an election simply because the President is a member of the  opposite and opposing party.  [[Page H12156]]    It is in regard to this impeachment process that George Washington  forewarned us as a nation at this moment in history. When political  parties ``may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the  course of time and things, to become potent engines by which cunning,  ambitious, and unprincipled men'' and women ``will be enabled to  subvert the power of the people to usurp for themselves the reins of  government. . . . ''    How wise he was.   Vote ``no'' on this assault to our Republic, the Constitution, and  against President Trump.
