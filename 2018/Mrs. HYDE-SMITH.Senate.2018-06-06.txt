 Mr. President, I am pleased to commend LTC Mariah  Smith, U.S. Army, for her more than 18 years of service to the Nation.   Lieutenant Colonel Smith has distinguished herself for the past 2  years as a senior congressional liaison for the Assistant Secretary of  the Army, Financial Management and Comptroller. In this capacity, she  has worked successfully to build and uphold the critical relationship  between Congress and the U.S. Army.   Lieutenant Colonel Smith managed the military personnel portfolio,  which involves over 1 million soldiers, almost $60 billion in assets,  and more than 40 percent of the Army's total appropriation. She  approached this task with the dedication expected of an exceptional  Army leader: She acted on opportunities to take care of soldiers. She  has been notably proficient in resolving innumerable inquiries into  individual soldier issues. In the same manner, she enabled Members of  Congress to remain devoted to the care of their constituents, while  also supporting congressional efforts to shape personnel policy.   Lieutenant Colonel Smith is recognized as a mentor and leader among  her peers, with an outstanding depth of service in the legislative  affairs area, having previously served as a congressional fellow,  military legislative assistant for a Member of the House of  Representatives, and a legislative liaison for the NATO training  mission in Kabul, Afghanistan. Her tenure in the Army includes almost 5  years of leading soldiers in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and the Horn of  Africa. Her significant contributions to the Army's budget liaison  office are a credit to herself, the Army, and the Nation she serves.   I am pleased to commend Lieutenant Colonel Smith for her many years  of distinguished service as a congressional liaison and to wish her  well in her continued service.                            ____________________
