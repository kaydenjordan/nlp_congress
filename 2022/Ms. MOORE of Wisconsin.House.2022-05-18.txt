 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Access to Baby Formula Act, bipartisan legislation in response to the  infant formula shortage that is affecting the most vulnerable in our  communities, our children.   This legislation recognizes the important role that WIC plays in  meeting the health and nutrition needs of our nation's mothers, babies,  and children.   WIC is the premier public health nutrition program that provides  supplemental food aimed at improving the health and well-being of  millions of pregnant mothers, infants, and children.   In FY 2021, average monthly WIC participation in my state of  Wisconsin was 80,000, including about 19,000 infants.   Studies have proven time and again food is medicine, and that  availability of nutritious food reduces adverse maternal and infant  health outcomes.   Unfortunately, families across the country are struggling to find  formula that their babies need.   The Biden Administration has acted to respond to this shortage and I  am pleased that today Congress will build on and support those efforts.   With around half of the formula purchased through WIC benefits, our  WIC families are particularly vulnerable which is why it is critical  that Congress pass this bill swiftly.   What can be more important than feeding our babies?   This bill authorizes new flexibilities to respond to supply chain or  other disruptions such as a recall that adversely affects the ability  of WIC agencies and programs to meet the needs of those who rely on the  program.   We must do everything in our power to ensure that all babies have  access to formula that they may need to start life strong and that  includes giving WIC programs and the incredible people who staff them  the flexibility they need to provide immediate relief to the families  they serve.   I urge support of this bill.
