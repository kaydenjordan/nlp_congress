 Madam Speaker, last Sunday, March 8,  Gunnery Sergeant Diego Pongo and Captain Moises Navas made the ultimate  sacrifice while serving their country in north-central Iraq.   Both were marines and assigned to the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion,  Marine Forces Special Operations Command, or MARSOC, which is located  in  [[Page H1599]]  Camp Lejeune in eastern North Carolina in my district. They were both  killed in action while supporting Iraqi forces in clearing out a tunnel  of ISIS fighters.   Given the current coronavirus situation, it is easy to lose sight of  the sacrifices of our servicemembers and their families, but we  absolutely cannot allow this condition to make us forget about our men  and women in uniform here and abroad.   The deaths of these two brave marines are a somber reminder that our  servicemembers and their families sacrifice so much for us each and  every day, no matter the circumstances, so that we can live in peace  and freedom.   My thoughts and prayers are with MARSOC, Navas' and Pongo's brothers  in arms, and especially their families and loved ones.                            ____________________
