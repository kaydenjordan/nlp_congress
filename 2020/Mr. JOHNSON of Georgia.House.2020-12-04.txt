 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the MORE  Act. The war on drugs targeting communities of color, primarily, has  resulted in the advent of the prison industrial complex that has fed on  and consumed the lives of countless individuals and families. Too many  Black and Brown children in our country have grown up without a parent  because of government-sponsored crony capitalism which saw profits and  policies that put people in prison rather than dealing with drug abuse  as a public health issue.   The criminalization of marijuana was used to disenfranchise an entire  generation of Black men and women. The MORE Act is an important step  forward toward more enlightened policy. I am proud to vote in favor of  this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.
