 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Earth Day and recognize Mrs. Sweeney's sixth grade class at Ferndale  Area Elementary School in Cambria County, Pennsylvania.   In March, Mrs. Sweeney's class wrote an article called ``Stewards of  the Environment.'' Her students were inspired to start the ``Every  Bottle Back'' schoolwide recycling program. The class set a goal of  recycling 1,000 bottles, and, as of today, they have collected 1,486  bottles.   Mrs. Sweeney's class decorated receptacles and spread the word  throughout the school. The students kept track of their progress with a  tally sheet, and every 2 or 3 days educators took the plastics to the  Roxbury or Geistown recycling center.   The actions of these sixth graders continue to inspire others in the  community. In fact, these sixth graders have inspired the local high  school to start a similar program. They have set a great example  proving that the littlest of actions can make a big difference.   Thank you, Ferndale Area Elementary School, for your hard work and  dedication to recycling.   Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Earth Day, let us use Ferndale Area  Elementary School as an inspiration to reduce, reuse, and recycle.                            ____________________
