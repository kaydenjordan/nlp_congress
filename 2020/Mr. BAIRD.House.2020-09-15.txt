 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the timeless American  principles of freedom, equality, and opportunity. These principles are  the foundation on which our Nation was built.   Unlike the nations and the empires that came before, the United  States was founded on an idea, an idea that men are created equal and  have certain inalienable rights given by our Creator. This idea turned  into a dream, a dream that, no matter what circumstances you come from,  you can come to America and be free to pursue your dreams and be equal  to your peers in the eyes of the law.   There are some among us who think this system of self-government has  failed. There are some who believe socialism is a better tool to  achieve the American Dream, and they think, by tearing down our  institutions, by tossing aside the Constitution, and by giving the  government more control that they will somehow achieve utopia. Using  history as a guide, we know this to be wrong.   Our Constitution is special because it limits the power of government  while safeguarding our freedoms and our civil rights. I will do my best  to follow their example and keep our America as the shining city on the  hill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I thank my friend  from Texas for giving me this opportunity.
