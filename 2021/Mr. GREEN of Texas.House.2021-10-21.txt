 Mr. Speaker, it is always a preeminent privilege  to be in the company of Chairwoman Waters, especially when she has  taken up a cause that is not only worthy but noble. I greatly  appreciate what she is doing tonight.   I would say this, housing is infrastructure, and housing is  infrastructure for a multiplicity of reasons.   I neglected to say ``and still I rise.''   And still I rise to talk about housing is infrastructure. Housing is  infrastructure.   If we traverse the highways and byways across our country, in our  urban areas, we will find persons who are sleeping under overpasses,  sleeping under bridges, sleeping along the roads, the roadways.   Overpasses and bridges have become housing. The infrastructure itself  now has become housing. It is my belief that if an overpass can become  housing, which is infrastructure, then the housing itself can be  infrastructure. It is time for us to fully fund these housing programs.   I would mention but one that I think is very important to us, and  that is the housing choice voucher program. This is an important  program, because I had my staff to compile some statistical information  for me, and here is what they have called to my attention. We need to  know who actually benefits. Over 40 percent of these voucher recipients  are households with children, 29 percent are the elderly, and 36  percent are nonelderly people with disabilities.   This myth that people are, for some reason, deciding that they will  just make their way through life on the backs of others, is something  that I call inanity. It is close to insanity to say this when you  examine the empirical evidence.   We also find that, yes, the wait time is long, averaging 2.5 years  nationally. Many of the lines are closed, with the 50 largest housing  authorities having wait times of a year or more and some up to 8 years.   Madam Speaker and Madam Chair, there is much more to be said, but the  time is limited. I would simply say this, vouchers have shown to reduce  homelessness, help people pay rent, reduce poverty, help children exit  the welfare system, help persons find and keep employment, help  children do better in school, help people with disabilities maintain  their health, help people achieve greater economic mobility, help  people build wealth, and help families enter the middle class. It is  time to fully fund the voucher system.                                time  1900
