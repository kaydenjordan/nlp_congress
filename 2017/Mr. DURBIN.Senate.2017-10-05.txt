Mr. President, over 2 weeks ago, Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands were devastated by Hurricane Maria. This was less than a  month after the islands felt the impacts of another powerful storm,  Hurricane Irma. Hurricane Maria has left a wake of destruction across  the islands. In Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, too many  Americans remain without power, clean drinking water, or a method of  communicating with their relatives and first responders.   Last week, I met with leaders in the Puerto Rican community in  Chicago to discuss local efforts to provide aid. This week, I met with  a delegation from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to discuss relief  efforts and what we can do at the Federal level to help them rebuild.  The stories they shared about friends and family in Puerto Rico were  heartbreaking. These people, our fellow American citizens, are facing a  life and death situation. Sadly, the lives of at least 16 people have  been claimed.   The situation in Puerto Rico is dire, and aid cannot wait. The 3.5  million people who live on the island of Puerto Rico are our fellow  U.S. citizens, and it is our duty to provide aid to them in their time  of need.   Yesterday, Congress received a supplemental aid request from the  administration to provide much needed disaster relief to our fellow  Americans. Now, Congress must come together to help these Americans  rebuild homes and businesses, restore critical infrastructure, and  access life-sustaining supplies.   Providing emergency disaster assistance to people in need is not a  local issue. It is an American issue.   Just as I expect my colleagues to come to the aid of the State of  Illinois when we are faced with a natural disaster and just as Congress  came to the aid of Hurricane Harvey victims a few short weeks ago, the  people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands expect us to rally behind  them as they work to respond to Hurricane Maria.   I urge my colleagues to quickly pass a clean aid package that will  help all Americans whose lives have been impacted by these natural  disasters. Any supplemental appropriations bill that includes aid for  States impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma must also include aid for  Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and western States that have been  devastated by wildfires.   I was heartened to hear that the Illinois National Guard has deployed  teams to provide telecommunication assistance, food, water, tents, and  cots to Puerto Rico. I was also glad to see that individual assistance  is now available for all 78 of the municipalities on the island,  ensuring all individuals in Puerto Rico can receive assistance from the  Federal Government.   The Federal response to this disaster has taken far too long, and we  must do more to help our fellow American citizens during this  humanitarian crisis.   In Congress, our top priority should be making sure the people of  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have the funding they need to  rebuild and recover. We cannot delay providing this much needed funding  any longer.   It has been tragic to see thousands of shipping containers held at  ports, which have been full of critical, life-sustaining supplies that  are not reaching those most in need. There continue to be reports of  families in Puerto Rico who are stranded and isolated. We must  prioritize quickly distributing supplies to reach every individual in  the days, weeks, and months to come. The U.S. citizens who live in  Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are at risk of running out of food,  water, and fuel. It would be unconscionable for us to abandon them in  their time of need.   Our thoughts are with the many people who have lost their loved ones,  their homes, and other property. I want to recognize the hard work of  the volunteers, local officials, and Federal employees that have come  forward in this time of need and pitched in at every level.   We can and should do more to help the people of Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands rebuild and recover. I have no doubt that the  people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands will be able to clean  up and rebuild, and they will be stronger for it. The entire Nation  must come together as an American family to give them the aid and  support they need at every step along the way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there are a lot of issues roiling our  Nation these days. I want to talk about an issue that may not get all  the headlines, but that has seen dramatic and troubling changes this  year: our Nation's higher education policy.   Over the last several weeks, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has  continued her assault on students and their families.   Previously we had seen her rescind reforms that would improve  customer service for students and hold student loan servicers  accountable for their treatment of borrowers; rescind a policy  prohibiting debt collectors from charging borrowers 16 percent fees to  bring their loans out of default; halt the processing of borrower  defense loan discharge applications from students defrauded by for- profit colleges and throwing out rules intended to help students get  the discharges to which they are entitled to under law; rewrite the  gainful employment rule, which is meant to protect students from  programs for-profit colleges that saddle students with too much debt  compared to their income; propose eliminating public service loan  forgiveness, which helps students afford to serve their communities,  States, and country while repaying their student loans; propose dumping  $38 billion in additional student loan interest on needy students by  eliminating subsidized undergraduate loans; and propose freezing the  maximum Pell grant award so that their award covers even less of what  it costs a student to attend college.   That is just the beginning.   Several weeks ago, I joined Senators Brown, Murray, and Warren in  calling on Secretary DeVos to appoint a credible, well-qualified,  independent chief enforcement officer to lead the Department of  Education's enforcement unit.  [[Page S6350]]    The unit was created after the collapse of Corinthian to improve  oversight of higher education institutions and enforcement of Federal  laws.   Robert Kaye, a respected investigator and consumer expert from the  Federal Trade Commission, was selected to be the first chief. Kaye left  the post in March.   Secretary DeVos allowed this critical position to remain vacant for  more than 4 months until earlier last month, when she finally announced  the appointment of Dr. Julian Schmoke, Jr.   At first glance, Dr. Schmoke meets none of the requirements for the  job that my colleagues and I set out in our letter.   As chief enforcement officer, Dr. Schmoke will be charged with  ensuring that institutions of higher education are following Federal  laws and regulations.   This will mean paying special attention to an area that poses the  most risk to students and has demonstrated systemic abuse: for-profit  colleges.   These are the colleges that enroll 9 percent of all postsecondary  students in America, but take in 17 percent of all Federal student aid  and account for 33 percent of all Federal student loan defaults.   Beyond the infamous Corinthian and ITT Tech examples, there are  countless examples of for-profit colleges defrauding students, whether  it be Ashford, Westwood, or DeVry.   Last year, DeVry agreed to pay the Federal Trade Commission $100  million for defrauding students and agreed to a separate settlement  with the Department of Education.   Guess who Dr. Schmoke previously worked for? You guessed it, DeVry  University.   In fact, there are reports that DeVry is still under investigation by  the very unit Dr. Schmoke has been appointed to lead. How is that for  the fox guarding the henhouse?   If that wasn't enough, there is no discernable evidence on Dr.  Schmoke's resume of any experience conducting or overseeing  investigations.   Shortly after his appointment, I joined Senators Brown, Warren,  Blumenthal, and Whitehouse in writing to Dr. Schmoke raising these  concerns and asking him to meet with us. We are still waiting.   As Betsy DeVos orchestrates a corporate takeover of the Department of  Education by for-profit interests, State attorneys general and other  Federal agencies are even more important in providing aggressive  oversight to protect students and taxpayers.   Betsy DeVos is doing what she can to disrupt that, too.   On September 1, the Department of Education provided notice to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that it was terminating its  existing data-sharing agreement with the CFPB.   The Department took exception ``to the CFPB unilaterally expanding  its oversight role . . .'' into areas that the Department viewed as  within its jurisdiction.   The CFPB has been a leader in protecting student borrowers harmed by  Federal loan servicers like Navient and predatory lending practices by  institutions like Corinthian and ITT Tech.   This political stunt makes clear that Secretary DeVos would rather  initiate a turf war than work with other Federal agencies to fulfill  the Federal Government's collective oversight responsibilities.   In announcing Dr. Schmoke as the new chief enforcement officer,  Secretary DeVos said, ``Protecting students has always been my top  priority.''   Well, Madam Secretary, your actions just don't back up that  statement.   Nearly every time you have had the opportunity to stand up for  students, their families, and taxpayers, you have turned your back on  them.   Commonsense protections for students and taxpayers shouldn't be a  partisan issue.   Secretary DeVos, I urge you to abandon this assault on students and  instead work with us to strengthen America's system of higher  education, to deal honestly with wrongdoing by for-profit colleges, and  to increase opportunities for all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I reintroduced the Adjunct Faculty  Loan Fairness Act, a bill that would enable faculty working less than  full-time to participate in the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness  Program.   Contingent faculty members are like full-time instructors. They have  advanced degrees. They teach classes and spend many hours outside the  classroom preparing for class. They hold office hours, grade papers,  and give feedback to students. They provide advice and write letters of  recommendation. Students rely on them. Since most adjuncts have  advanced degrees and, as the 63 percent of graduate degree recipients  who borrow have an average of almost $59,000 in student loans, they are  among the 44 million Americans with student debt.  [[Page S6362]]    The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is meant to encourage  graduates to go into public service by offering student loan  forgiveness for eligible Federal loans after ten years of full-time  work in government or the non-profit sector. Public service fields like  nursing, military service, and public health qualify. And many  education jobs qualify, including full-time work at public universities  and part-time work at community colleges in high-needs subject areas or  areas of shortage. But other faculty members, those who work part-time,  are not eligible for loan forgiveness because the law requires an  annual average of 30 hours per week to qualify for the program. For  adjunct faculty working on a contingent basis--many of whom may only  teach one or two classes while holding down other part-time jobs to  make ends meet--this requirement can be difficult or impossible to  meet, even when they are putting in more than 30 hours of work each  week.   The number of faculty hours given for each class is calculated  differently at different schools. Some schools give one hour per hour  in the classroom while others actually take into consideration the time  required outside the classroom. So, even as these faculty members are  working hard to provide quality instruction for their students, often  without the option of moving into a tenured, full-time position, their  public service is not recognized by the current Public Service Loan  Forgiveness program.   The Adjunct Faculty Loan Fairness Act of 2017 would solve this by  amending the Higher Education Act to expand the definition of a  ``public service job'' to include a part-time faculty member who  teaches at least one course at an eligible institution of higher  education. They would still have to meet all the other requirements to  qualify for the public service loan forgiveness program, including  making 120 on-time payments while employed at a qualifying institution,  and they could not be employed full-time elsewhere at the same time. I  believe it corrects a major flaw in the current system and rewards  individuals for their contribution to public service rather than  penalize them for the number of hours they work.   This bill would benefit someone like Brittany, an adjunct professor  in southern Illinois. Brittany finished her graduate degree in 2013 and  still has over $70,000 in student loan debt today. This debt has  prevented her from attending law school, her longtime dream, and makes  it challenging to put money aside for her retirement. This debt is also  putting her children's future at risk--Brittany will still be paying  off her own loans when it is time for her now four-month old child to  attend college. This bill would ensure that Brittany, and thousands  like her, could secure their family's financial future by earning  credit towards the Public Service Loan Forgiveness for loan payments  made while teaching, regardless of the fact that she isn't full-time  faculty.   Unfortunately, for all their contributions to their colleges and the  students they work with, adjunct faculty like Brittany often don't have  the same employment benefits or job security as their colleagues. The  number of classes they teach every semester varies. To make ends meet,  these professors often end up teaching classes at more than one school  in the same semester, getting paid about $3,000 per class and making an  average annual income that hovers around minimum wage. This also means  that, in some parts of the country, they spend as much time commuting  as they do teaching.   Nationally, over half of all higher education faculty work on a  contingent basis. In the past, these were a minority of professors who  were hired to teach an occasional class because they could bring  experience to the classroom in a specific field or industry. Over time,  as university budgets have tightened and it has gotten more expensive  to hire full-time, tenure track professors, higher education  institutions have increasingly relied on adjuncts.   From 1991 to 2015, the number of part-time faculty in the U.S.  increased two and a half times from 291,000 to over 743,000. At the  same time, the percentage of professors holding tenure and tenure-track  positions has been steadily decreasing from 45 percent of all  instructors in 1975 to only 29 percent in 2015. The number of full-time  instructors, tenured and non-tenured, now makes up less than half of  all professors on U.S. campuses. Today, a majority of the 1.5 million  faculty employees at public and non-profit colleges and universities in  the United States work on a part-time, contingent basis.   Illinois colleges rely heavily on adjuncts. In 2015, 52 percent of  all faculty at all Title IV degree-granting institutions in the state-- more than 31,700 faculty employees--worked on a part-time basis. This  is a 32.4 percent increase in part-time faculty in Illinois compared to  a 7 percent increase in full-time faculty since 2002.   This bill does not fix the growing reliance by our higher education  system on part-time professors who are underpaid and undervalued. But  it would ensure that members of the contingent faculty workforce are no  longer unfairly excluded from the loan forgiveness program for public  servants. I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Al Franken from  Minnesota, for joining me in this effort. I hope my other colleagues  will join us to ensure this program benefits faculty members who  provide our students with a quality education.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1927         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
