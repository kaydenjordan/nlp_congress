 Mr. Speaker, the opioid epidemic is devastating  communities within my district and across the country. In the last year  alone, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, has lost 232 individuals in drug- related deaths; a staggering 26 percent increase from 2016.   As vice-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, I am proud to rise  today in strong support of H.R. 5812, the CONNECTIONS Act.   While my district is just one area in the Nation that is struggling  to cope with the opioid crisis, I believe the CONNECTIONS Act will  provide officials on the ground the necessary training techniques and  resources they need to turn the tide on this epidemic.   As a longtime proponent of States fully utilizing prescription drug  monitoring programs to track controlled substance purchases, I am proud  of the PDMP enhancements in this bipartisan bill.   Our Nation's drug epidemic is a complicated issue, Mr. Speaker, and  our response must be multifaceted. This means a reduction in the  unnecessary dispensing of prescriptions, which could be accomplished by  tracking and reporting information that allows physicians, pharmacists,  and other health professionals to make informed clinical decisions and  to identify troubling trends.   I would like to thank my colleague from Virginia, Mr. Griffith, for  his leadership on this important piece of legislation, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the passage of the  CONNECTIONS Act.
