 Madam Speaker, a 12-year-old from Highlands Ranch, Nate  Holley, explained that he was in his classroom's closet with his hand  on a baseball bat because he was going to go down fighting if he was  going to go down.   In the span of 2 weeks, two students were killed lunging at shooters  in their classrooms to defend their classmates. Their names: Kendrick  Castillo, 18 years old, just 3 days away from his high school  graduation, and Riley Howell, 21 years old, an ROTC cadet at UNC  Charlotte.   These young men are heroes, but they shouldn't have to be.   The Senate majority leader won't even allow a vote on any gun safety  bills. What is it going to take? How many shootings, how many more  young lives cut short, until we take action?   The STEM School Highlands Ranch shooting marked the 30th incident of  gun violence on K-12 school grounds just this year. Our kids deserve  leaders who will do everything in their power to end gun violence in  America.   No more heroes. No more victims.                            ____________________
