 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  incredible athletic achievements of the Salt Lake Community College  men's soccer program. This past season, their hard work and collective  determination earned them the NJCAA Division One national championship  title following a thrilling overtime victory in the final match.   The Salt Lake Bruins accomplished this feat after an undefeated  conference season, tallying an ultimate record of 16-1-1 under the  impressive leadership of Mark Davis and the entire coaching staff. On  their path to the final, the Bruins were crowned champions of Region  18, West District, and the Scenic West Conference.   On June 10, 2021, Davis and his talented squad of young athletes, a  union of Utahns and international footballers proudly representing the  Bruins banner, faced top ranked Iowa Western in the final. Despite  conceding early, the Bruins clawed back thanks to a sensational left- footed strike by Ryen Jiba. In overtime, Paul Richnow headed home the  game winner to deliver the program its first ever championship trophy.   Champions are forged by years of supreme dedication to individual and  collective improvement on and off the pitch. These athletes of diverse  backgrounds demonstrated their ability to excel as one team, and they  should be immensely proud of their accomplishment. For their efforts,  Bruins players and coaches earned numerous accolades, including Mark  Davis being named SWAC and West District Coach of the Year, as well as  Coach of the Tournament. His staff, including Cassie Ulrich, Ty  O'Connor, and Jordan Carver, earned United Soccer Coaches Staff of the  Year and four All American selections. Sophomores Levonte Johnson,  Samuel Owusu, and Paul Richnow were named NJCAA First Team All  Americans, and Richnow also earned MVP of the National Tournament. An  additional 12 players have committed to playing at the NCAA level.   Individual performances and accolades are built on the strong  foundation of a great team. Recently crowned champions also include  freshman Jose Arellano, Christian Olivares, Daniel Tareke, Mason McRae,  Taimu Okiyoshi, Jermaine Muirhead, Sergio Martinez, William Greener,  Negue Kante, Santiago Delfino, Ethan Coleman, Hogeun Jee, Kai Phillip,  and Samson Ahisu. Sophomores also include Omar Gomez, Freddy Cano,  Brandon Cervantes, Jason Chavez, Andres Bermudez, Azriel Johnson,  Johnathan Castro, and Rafael Calderon.   I extend my congratulations to the entire SLCC men's soccer program  for their historic season and wish them the best of luck in their  continued athletic and academic pursuits.                            ____________________
