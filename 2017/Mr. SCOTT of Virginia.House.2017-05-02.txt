 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a  remarkable woman who has dedicated the last 40 years of her life to  serving the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia--my friend,  closest adviser, and chief of staff, Joni Ivey.   Joni was born and raised in Newport News, Virginia. She grew up in  Newsome Park and was one of seven children of Willie and Carnetta Ivey.  She graduated from Carver High School in 1971, the last graduating  class of the segregated high school that was closed when local schools  were racially integrated. Joni went on to attend Christopher Newport  University and graduated from Norfolk State University.   I first met Joni in 1976, when she was working on Reverend Henry  Maxwell's unsuccessful campaign for the Newport News City Council. I  was impressed with her work ethic, her dedication to her community, and  her political acumen. I was so impressed that I asked her to serve on  my first campaign for the House of Delegates in 1977. That started a  40-year friendship and working relationship that took us to the House  of Delegates after that election to the Virginia Senate in 1983, and  ultimately to the United States Congress in 1993.   Joni has served alongside me every step of the way and has been a  selfless, behind-the-scenes public servant for the citizens of  Virginia. Serving the public and helping those most in need has always  driven her. Her passion in this regard has helped ground me and our  staff to focus on what we can do every day we are fortunate enough to  be in a position to make better the lives of those we serve.   Joni's commitment to this ideal is not just at work. Joni spends  nearly every waking moment of her free time outside of the office  helping others, either through her involvement in her church, Ivy  Baptist Church in Newport News, or work with the local NAACP where she  once served as branch president, by tutoring young people in Newport  News, working with the local food bank, or through her service in The  Links, Incorporated. Joni has always given back to her community.   Even with all that she does in her community, she always has time for  her family. She is a proud aunt to her nieces and nephews, a dedicated  daughter to her mother, and a caring sister to her siblings.  [[Page H3008]]    Over the last 40 years, she has also mentored hundreds of members of  our staff and helped guide them in their careers. Thanks in part to her  leadership with my office, a vast majority of our current and former  permanent staff members got their start in our office as interns or  fellows and grew into talented and instrumental staffers. Joni showed  them how they could make a real difference working in government. Her  dedication to our staff has helped make me a more effective legislator,  and I am forever grateful for that.   Mr. Speaker, Joni LaVerne Ivey retires from her service to the United  States House of Representatives and to my office this week. This will  be a hard-earned and well-deserved retirement, and I know that she will  remain as active in Newport News and around Hampton Roads as she is  now, but perhaps a little less restrained now that she no longer has to  worry about me or our office.   I know Joni has never sought public recognition for her hard work,  but on behalf of our entire current and former staff and the citizens  of the Third Congressional District of Virginia, I thank her for her  dedicated and selfless service to our community, our Commonwealth, and  our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, under current law, if an employee wants to work  overtime, put the money in the bank where it can earn interest, and use  it to cover the cost of taking some time off later with the permission  of the employer, he can do that today without this bill.   But under H.R. 1180, instead of getting paid for overtime work in the  next scheduled paycheck, the employee might not get paid until as much  as a year later, when his employer decides to let him take that comp  time.   This legislation simply weakens the protections available in the Fair  Labor Standards Act--the original family-friendly workplace law--at the  very moment that we really ought to be strengthening the law.   Under H.R. 1180, it would be legal to withhold workers' overtime pay  for a long time. This would be otherwise a violation of the Fair Labor  Standards Act.   The bill would allow you to undermine the 40-hour workweek by  creating a mechanism that allows employees to earn time off to be with  their families only if they spend extra time at work beyond a 40-hour  workweek.   It undermines a worker's ability to earn overtime pay, which many  workers rely on to send their children to college, save for retirement,  or make a down payment on a house.   Because the legislation makes it cheaper for employers to assign  overtime to employees who agree to accept comp time instead of actual  cash wages, this legislation makes it extremely likely that the only  employees who will be asked to work overtime are those who agree to get  comp time instead of actual time and a half paid cash.   Furthermore, the legislation creates significant uncertainty for  workers. An employer could decide that an employee cannot take comp  time on the dates requested because the employer said it would be an  undue disruption to business operations.   My Democratic colleagues and I are working on a Working Families  Agenda with real solutions that would boost wages for working people  and help them balance work and family life. An employee should be able  to earn time off without sacrificing overtime pay. This is exactly what  the Healthy Families Act would do. It would allow workers to earn up to  7 paid sick days.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, 92 groups that actually represent working  people sent a letter urging the Committee on Education and the  Workforce to oppose the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter which is led by the  National Partnership for Women & Families. It points out that we should  be taking up real solutions, such as legislation, to raise the minimum  wage, Schedules That Work Act, family and medical leave, and other  responsible solutions. These solutions would truly help working  families, yet the majority has refused to support any of these  initiatives.                                                        May 1, 2017.        Dear Member of Congress: We, the undersigned organizations,       urge you to oppose the so-called Working Families Flexibility       Act (H.R. 1180/S. 801), a smoke-and-mirrors bill that would       offer working people a pay cut without any guaranteed       flexibility or time off. As members of Congress on both sides       of the aisle acknowledge, people today are struggling to       manage the demands of job and family, and to make ends meet       and plan for the future. We urgently need lawmakers to update       our nation's workplace policies to meet 21st century       realities, but the Working Families Flexibility Act would be       a grievous step in the wrong direction. It is, at best, an       empty promise that would cause considerably more harm than       good.        The Working Families Flexibility Act would offer a false       choice between time and pay. Supporters claim the bill would       give hourly workers more flexibility and time with their       loved ones by allowing them to choose paid time off, rather       than time-and-a-half wages, as compensation for working more       than 40 hours in one week (``comp time''). But people would       only get more time with their families after spending extra       hours away from them at work, and the bill does not guarantee       that workers could use the time they earn when they need it.       Moreover, the bill would do nothing to address the need all       working people--not just those who work overtime--have for       guaranteed access to paid sick days and paid family and       medical leave. Too few employers provide these protections       now, especially to their hourly workers.        The Fair Labor Standards Act currently allows employers to       provide flexibility and  [[Page H3040]]       time off without compromising workers' right to be paid       fairly for the hours they work. The types of flexibility       allowed under the FLSA include alternative start and end       times, compressed or variable work hours within a week, split       shifts, work at multiple locations, and paid or unpaid time       off. Proponents of the Working Families Flexibility Act set       up a false dichotomy that would force workers to choose       between flexibility and overtime pay when, in reality, the       FLSA does nothing currently to prevent employers from       offering both.        The ``worker flexibility'' offered by the Working Families       Flexibility Act would magnify the power imbalance between       employees and employers. The proposal would give the       employer, not the employee, the ``flexibility'' to decide       when, and even if, comp time could be used. The bill would       allow employers to deny requests if an employee's use of comp       time would ``unduly disrupt'' operations, or grant leave on a       day other than the one requested. This means the Working       Families Flexibility Act would provide no guarantee that       workers could use their earned time to care for a sick child,       attend a parent-teacher conference, or help an aging parent.       Employers could veto an employee's request to use their time       even in cases of urgent need. The bill would also allow       employers to ``cash out'' an employee's comp time in excess       of 80 hours, or discontinue the comp time program altogether,       with just 30 days' notice. This means an employee's carefully       crafted plan to bank time for a child's birth or surgery       could be thwarted by an employer's decision to cash out the       employee's time.        The Working Families Flexibility Act would put workers'       economic security at risk and provide an interest-free loan       to employers. An employee who does not participate in an       employer's comp time program could be penalized with fewer       hours, bad shifts and lost overtime hours. The bill would       permit employers to defer compensation for unused comp time       for as long as 13 months, creating an interest-free loan for       employers and hardship for workers. It also would not provide       any protections for employees when firms collapse or go       bankrupt, meaning workers could lose the value of their       unused comp time altogether.        The Working Families Flexibility Act would provide few       protections for workers and no additional resources to the       U.S. Department of Labor for education, investigation and       enforcement. The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL's) Wage and       Hour Division already struggles to enforce the Fair Labor       Standards Act (FLSA) with too few investigators and a small       budget--and DOL is facing a draconian reduction in funding       that threatens its ability to maintain current operations,       let alone engage in robust enforcement. This bill would add       significant new provisions to the FLSA, but it would not       provide additional funds for education and enforcement       efforts the new provisions would require. Workers would have       few remedies in cases of employer misconduct pursuant to the       bill, and would not be able to rely on an under-resourced       Wage and Hour Division for assistance. Wage theft (nonpayment       or underpayment of wages for hours worked) would be       exacerbated because it would be easier for employers to avoid       overtime compensation obligations without consequences.        Instead of wasting time on smoke and mirrors, Congress       should focus on policies that would meaningfully improve       people's economic security and provide the time they need. We       urge Congress to adopt:        The Healthy Families Act (H.R. 1516/S. 636), which would       make earned paid sick days available to millions of workers       and build on the success of paid sick days laws that have       been, or will soon be, implemented in seven states and 32       localities;        The Family And Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act (H.R.       947/S. 337), which would create a national paid leave       insurance program--modeled on successful state programs in       California, New. Jersey, Rhode Island and, soon, New York and       the District of Columbia--that would allow workers to take       paid time to care for a new child; care for a seriously ill       family member; address their own serious health condition; or       manage certain military caregiving responsibilities;        The Schedules That Work Act, which would give workers more       control over their schedules and incentivize predictability       and stability in shifts and work hours; and        An increase in the minimum wage, including the elimination       of the sub-minimum ``tipped'' wage, which would lift millions       of families out of poverty.        People simply should not have to work more than 40 hours in       a week and forgo pay to earn time to care for themselves or       their loved ones. We urge Congress to reject the Working       Families Flexibility Act and instead adopt family friendly       workplace policies that provide true flexibility--not an       empty promise that would make life appreciably more difficult       for people who are already struggling            Sincerely,        1,000 Days, 9to5, National Association of Working Women,       9to5 California, 9to5 Colorado, 9to5 Georgia, 9to5 Wisconsin,       A Better Balance, American Federation of Labor and Congress       of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), American Association       of University Women (AAUW), American Federation of Government       Employees, American Federation of Teachers, (AFL-CIO),       California Work & Family Coalition, Center for Law and Social       Policy (CLASP), Center for Popular Democracy, Coalition for       Social Justice, Coalition of Labor Union Women, Coalition on       Human Needs, Communications Workers of America (CWA),       Connecticut Working Families Party, Connecticut Women's       Education and Legal Fund (CWEALF), Daily Kos, Demos, Economic       Policy Institute Policy Center, Economic Progress Institute,       Faith in Public Life, Family Forward Oregon, Family Values @       Work, Feminist Majority.

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the vice ranking member on the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Subcommittee of the  Appropriations Committee.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill  which would give workers less flexibility and less pay. The economic  challenge of our time is that people are in jobs today that just don't  pay them enough to live on. They are struggling to make  [[Page H3042]]  ends meet. This bill would make that worse.   It forces workers to decide between time-and-a-half overtime pay and  paid time off when they work more than 40 hours a week. It enables  employers to exert more control over employees' wages and hours that  hinders a worker's ability to plan family time, to have flexible and  stable schedules, and, yes, to make ends meet.   Rather than helping American workers earn better wages and more time  off, this bill creates more power for employers to delay paying  overtime wages for as long as 13 months. For people who need to work  extra hours to pay those bills, this legislation forces them into an  impossible choice between time and money with no guarantee of time off.   This bill is nothing more than a false promise of time off and a pay  cut. Working Americans deserve better. We have an obligation to pursue  public policy that puts workers before corporations. Instead of forcing  bad choices for workers about their time off, we ought to bring the  Healthy Families Act to the floor which would enable workers to earn  paid sick days, because no one should have to choose between getting  healthy and putting food on the table.   Instead of considering this legislation which will hurt workers and  their ability to earn fair wages, we should be considering the FAMILY  Act, which would create a national paid leave insurance program to  allow workers to take time off while they are caring for a new child, a  seriously ill family member, or their own serious health conditions.   Instead of undermining workers' schedules, we should be considering  the Schedules That Work Act, which gives workers more control over  their schedules, offers them real predictability and stability in their  shifts and in their work hours.   These are the policies that workers need, policies that reflect the  realities of working in America today, the challenges that workers  face. This bill goes in the opposite direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the  Workforce Protections Subcommittee of the Education and the Workforce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, there was mention about the legislative history back in  the 1980s. The fact is there was no mention in legislative history that  Congress passed the comp time legislation to be family friendly or to  provide flexibility. The legislation was passed purely to respond to  States' and localities' concerns about fiscal pressures created by the  Supreme Court case Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transportation  Authority. So I think it ought to be clear that these are entirely  different issues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Espaillat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the  gentlewoman to show where in the bill the penalties are actually more  than they are today?    I yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina.    And how is that different from what the  Federal law is now?    And how is that different from what the  Federal law is now?    Mr. Speaker, in the meanwhile, I yield 2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds just to  include in the Record section 216 of the Fair Labor Standards Act,  which says essentially the same penalties are available in the present  law as in the bill.       Sec.  216. Penalties         (a) Fines and imprisonment        Any person who willfully violates any of the provisions of       section 215 of this title shall upon conviction thereof be       subject to a fine of not more than $10,000, or to       imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. No person       shall be imprisoned under this subsection except for an       offense committed after the conviction of such person for a       prior offense under this subsection.        (b) Damages; right of action; attorney's fees and costs;       termination of right of action        Any employer who violates the provisions of section 206 or       section 207 of this title shall be liable to the employee or       employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum       wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may       be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.       Any employer who violates the provisions of section 215(a)(3)       of this title shall be liable for such legal or equitable       relief as may be appropriate to effectuate the purposes of       section 215(a)(3) of this title, including without limitation       employment, reinstatement, promotion, and the payment of       wages lost and an additional equal amount as liquidated       damages. An action to recover the liability prescribed in       either of the preceding sentences may be maintained against       any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or       State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more       employees for and in behalf of himself or themselves and       other employees similarly situated. No employee shall be a       party plaintiff to any such action unless he gives his       consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is       filed in the court in which such action is brought. The court       in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to       the plaintiff or plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney's       fee to be paid by the defendant, and costs of the action. The       right provided by this subsection to bring an action by or on       behalf of any employee, and the right of any employee to       become a party plaintiff to any such action, shall terminate       upon the filing of a complaint by the Secretary of Labor in       an action under section 217 of this title in which (1)       restraint is sought of any further delay in the payment of       unpaid minimum wages, or the amount of unpaid overtime       compensation, as the case may be, owing to such employee       under section 206 or section 207 of this title by an employer       liable therefor under the provisions of this subsection or       (2) legal or equitable relief is sought as a result of       alleged violations of section 215(a)(3) of this title.

I include in the Record letters from AFSCME and the National  Education Association in opposition to the legislation.                                                         AFSCME,                                                      April 4, 2017.      Subcommittee on Workforce Protections of the Committee on         Education and the Workforce,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose H.R. 1180, the       Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017. H.R. 1180 claims to       help American workers better balance the needs of family and       the workplace by allowing employers to offer private-sector       employees the choice of paid time off in lieu of cash wages       for overtime hours worked. But contrary to its stated       purposes, the proposed law will result in more overtime hours       for employees for less money and without any guarantee of       compensatory time when needed.        For over 80 years and counting, the Federal Labor Standards       Act (FLSA) establishes the basic requirements for wage and       hour protections including overtime compensation. Under FLSA,       overtime compensation must be provided for covered employees       working more than the maximum period of 40 hours per week.       However, H.R. 1180 provides no guaranteed right for an       employee to use banked compensatory time when needed, even in       the case of a personal or family emergency. Instead, this       legislation gives discretion to the employer to permit use of       compensatory time only ``within a reasonable period after       making the request if the use of the compensatory time does       not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.''        This legislation calls for an irresponsible change to the       FLSA that will negatively impact worker's actual take home       pay, and the valued time spent with their family when both       are needed for workers' financial stability and to address       family obligations. Also, if an employee's request to use       comp time is denied because the employer unilaterally decides       it is ``unduly disruptive'', the law provides no recourse.       And then, even when provided the compensatory time, the use       of that time is controlled solely by the employer. In short,       employees can be denied overtime pay, and effectively be       prevented from meeting their family needs.        Our experience in the public sector has revealed that       employers' control over the use of compensatory time inflicts       very real hardships on the public employees entitled to       compensatory time for their overtime work. Employees request       specific dates for valid reasons. Employees need the earned       time off for milestones such as children's birthdays, family       and friends' weddings, funerals, scheduled vacations and       other date-specific activities.        Giving the employer veto power has been burdensome and       abused by employers in the public sector and it has been       cause for litigation. In theory, employees may take       compensatory time within a reasonable period after making the       request. In practice, it creates problems for employees       denied the time when they need it and the language of the law       becomes a false promise.        Balancing the demands of family and the workplace are       already a challenge for far too many workers. At a time in       our country when our priority should be investing in stable       jobs with good wages and benefits, our attention should not       be on legislation that would further hurt workers who are       already subjected to very little formality with respect to an       agreement to take compensatory time off in lieu of overtime       pay.        Nothing in the current compensatory time-off application of       the FLSA prevents employers from giving leave to employees       who work long hours. Neither does the new proposal offer the       critical protections workers need in the 21st century.       Workers need solutions that actually help them manage work       and family responsibilities; not a law that will provide less       flexibility to a workforce under the guise of providing more.        H.R. 1180 attacks workers' paychecks, time off and       flexibility; and AFSCME strongly opposes this bill.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                   National Education Association,                                                        May 1, 2017.      U.S. Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the three million members       of the National Education Association and the 50 million       students they serve, in advance of this week's vote we urge       you to vote NO on the Working Families Flexibility Act (H.R.       1180). Votes on this issue may be included in NEA's Report       Card for the 115th Congress.        This deceptively named bill would hurt, not help, working       families. Instead of extra pay for overtime, low-wage workers       could receive ``comp'' time--paid time off. But the employer,       not the employee, would decide when time off is granted.       There is no guarantee workers could take time off when they       need it most--for example, to care for a sick child, attend a       parent-teacher conference, help an aging parent, or other       attend to other pressing responsibilities. Employers could       defer compensation for unused comp time for up to 13 months,       a real hardship for low-wage workers who struggle to make       ends meet. Employers could also unilaterally decide to ``cash       out'' comp time in excess of 80 hours or discontinue their       entire comp time program with just 30 days' notice, leaving       employees in the lurch.        In short, in exchange for longer hours at lower pay,       workers get the possibility--but no guarantee--of extra time       to care for their families or time off when they really need       it.        All working people--not just those who spend more than 40       hours a week on the job--need guaranteed access to paid sick       days and paid family and medical leave. Too few employers       provide these protections now, especially for employees paid       by the hour. Again, we urge you to vote NO on the Working       Families Flexibility Act and focus instead on truly family-      friendly policies that reflect the realities of the 21st       century workplace.            Sincerely,                                                         Marc Egan,                                  Director of Government Relations.     Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that AFSCME,  the NEA, ATU, and other public service unions have written letters in  opposition.   One from AFSCME: ``Our experience in the public sector has revealed  that employers' control over the use of compensatory time inflicts very  real hardships on public employees entitled to compensatory time for  their overtime work. Employees request specific dates for valid  reasons. Employees need the earned time off for milestones such as  children's birthdays, family and friends' weddings. . . .''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30  seconds.   ``Giving the employer veto power has been burdensome and abused by  employers in the public sector and it has been cause for litigation. In  theory, employees may take compensatory time within a reasonable period  after making the request. In practice, it creates problems for  employees denied the time when they need it and the language of the law  becomes a false promise.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the debate on the  floor, and I want to join my fellow colleagues--women and men of the  Democratic Caucus--on opposing the Working Families Flexibility Act of  2017.   I just have one anecdotal story that reflects the constituents that I  represent. Take that woman who I saw--when going to my elementary  schools, visiting them, I saw a mother who got up at 4 in the morning  to take three buses to drop her young child off at an elementary  school, and then get two buses back to work, an hourly wage maker. She  does it because, one, she is supporting her child and, two, she has got  to work.   This bill is a complete undermining of all of the hardworking men and  women who need their money to pay a light bill, to pay rent, maybe even  a mortgage, to pay the normal expenses that many take for granted. And  this bill wants to substitute compensatory time for overtime pay.  [[Page H3047]]    So I cannot imagine that anyone with a heart would have this  legislation as a substitute for this hardworking mother to be paid  overtime. I just can't imagine that compensatory time off cannot pay  the light bill, cannot pay rent, cannot pay healthcare costs, which we  see are immediately being taken away from 24 million Americans.   So I oppose this legislation because I want to stand on the side of  the hardworking mother who needs her resources for a school uniform, a  school trip, a rent payment, a light bill.   Mr. Speaker, this bill should be opposed. It does not serve the  American people.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 6\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I include in the Record a letter from the Amalgamated Transit Union  against the bill.                                      Amalgamated Transit Union,                                     Silver Spring, MD, May 1, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Amalgamated Transit       Union (ATU), the largest labor organization representing       public transit workers in the United States, I am urging you       to oppose the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017 (H.R.       1180). The title of the legislation is extremely misleading,       as the bill actually provides flexibility only to employers--      not workers--and hurts working families who are already       struggling to make ends meet.        In response to an epidemic of workers plagued by mandatory       excessive hours, Congress in 1938 made the wise decision to       pass the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), establishing the       40-hour workweek that we all take for granted today. This       landmark legislation, requiring that employers pay a time-      and-a-half cash premium for overtime work, serves as the only       deterrent from employers demanding excessive hours by making       overtime work more expensive for them. H.R. 1180 would remove       this barrier.        Forced overtime is already a serious problem in the transit       industry, and many of ATU's bargaining units are increasingly       in the private sector and thus subject to FLSA rules. If       privatized transit operations were provided with the       ``flexibility'' to offer workers comp time instead of being       paid time-and-a-half for overtime, we would see prolific       abuse of overtime. Intercity bus operators are already exempt       from FLSA overtime provisions, and as a result, there has       recently been one horrific crash after another on U.S.       Highways caused by driver fatigue. In fact, according to the       National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), driver fatigue       is responsible for a staggering 36% of fatalities due to       intercity bus crashes. If H.R. 1180 is passed, it would lead       to widespread fatigue throughout the transit industry as       well. Quite simply, more buses will be involved in crashes       due to fatigued drivers, and innocent people will die.        Moreover, the so-called flexibility under this bill is one-      sided, putting management in total control. Private transit       companies, which generally cast safety concerns to the wind       and have no regard for anything other than the bottom line,       would be able to decide if a requested absence on a       particular day would ``unduly disrupt'' business operations       and specify an alternative date which is not at all       convenient for an employee.        The need to discourage working people to the brink of       exhaustion is as necessary today as it was nearly 80 years       ago. America needs to maintain the disincentive for employers       to force workers to spend more time away from their families.       If additional hiring is needed, then workforces should be       expanded. In the transportation industry, this is a matter of       life and death.        H.R. 1180 is bad for workers, dangerous for transit       passengers, and another example of a solution in search of a       problem. Please oppose and work to defeat this ill-advised       legislation.        Thank you for your consideration of our views.            Sincerely,                                                Lawrence J. Hanley,                                           International President.     Mr. Speaker, under this bill, there are no  advantages to the employee. Without this bill, an employee can work  overtime, make the money, and then have enough money to afford to be  able to take subsequent time off without pay. That is about what this  bill does.   But with the bill, it allows the employers to work people overtime  and avoid paying the overtime wages. The employer just lets the people  take their comp time when work is slow, so the employer never has to  pay the overtime.   This bill allows the employer to decide when the comp time can be  taken. The employee can request, but the employer has the final word  because the bill says that the comp time can be denied if the time off  unduly disrupts operations.   And guess who gets to decide that measure?   Those employees who want to work extra time to make extra pay will  lose that opportunity to fellow employees who agree to ingratiate  themselves to the employer by saving their employer money by accepting  comp time instead of overtime pay. There is no coercion. Preference is  just given to those who will accept the comp time and not the real  wages.   Mr. Speaker, this bill offers nothing to the employees. It offers the  employer the opportunity to avoid paying overtime. That is why all of  the representatives of workers oppose the legislation, and I think we  should, too.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?    Yes, I am opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Scott of Virginia moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1180       to the Committee on Education and the Workforce with       instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith,       with the following amendment:        At the end of the bill, add the following new section:       SEC. 7. MINIMUM SICK DAYS.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not       apply to any employee who does not receive from his or her       employer fewer than seven paid sick days, which days may be       used to seek medical care for a pre-existing health       condition.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to  the bill, which will not kill the bill nor send it back to committee.  If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill would undermine workers' access to  overtime pay and provide them with no real benefit in return, and that  is why all of the groups representing workers oppose it. So, instead of  undermining employment protections that boost wages for working  Americans such as overtime pay, we should work towards ensuring that  American workers can remain healthy while on the job.   Critical to that goal is guaranteeing true workplace flexibility by  ensuring that workers do not have to choose between their health and  their paycheck. So, if the majority is truly concerned about American  workers, then the majority should work with us to provide workers the  paid time off they need to care for themselves and their families. They  could easily do that by supporting the Healthy Families Act, which  would give workers the right to earn up to 7 paid sick days.   This motion to recommit would protect workers by ensuring that only  employees who are subjected to this comp time arrangement would be  those who have at least 7 paid sick days. Providing paid sick days is  not only good for working families, it is also good for business,  public health, and our overall economy. Providing paid sick days  decreases employee turnover and prevents illness from being spread  throughout the workplace.   If we are truly concerned about workers, we should not ask them to  spend more time away from their families and forfeit their overtime pay  in order to take the time off when they are sick or when they need to  care for a sick child.   Mr. Speaker, while we are considering this bill, we are also  considering healthcare legislation that Republicans are trying to pass  which would rob American families of protection under the Affordable  Care Act that requires coverage for preexisting conditions.   We know that President Trump has promised to repeal the ACA on day  one, and Republicans have spent 7 years complaining about the law and  voting time after time to repeal all or parts of the law, but they have  never developed a comprehensive proposal to actually deliver on their  promises of better care at lower costs.   If we are going to make changes to the Affordable Care Act, we should  improve health care for working families, not make it worse.  Incredibly, every proposal the Republicans have come up with actually  makes things worse.   Under the recent Republican plan, 24 million fewer people would be  covered, and everybody else will pay more and get less. While their  plan inflicts pain on those most in need, the wealthiest 2 percent of  Americans get massive tax cuts.   Under that plan, the typical working family would suffer an increase  in healthcare coverage costs of about $2,000 a year, for the average  family with a head of household age 55 to 64, the bill would increase  costs by over $7,000.   Recent changes in the Republican health plan would unravel many of  the protections that American families currently enjoy in their  healthcare coverage, including ending current protections for people  with preexisting conditions. The Republican health plan would return us  to the days when health insurance coverage was unaffordable for many  individuals with preexisting conditions. That bill directly violates  the commitment made by President Trump and House Republicans to protect  individuals with preexisting conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to drop their attempts to take away  quality health insurance coverage for those with preexisting  conditions. Instead, we should adopt this motion which takes a small  step in ensuring that workers can access paid sick leave that allows  them to remain healthy, including accessing medical treatment needed to  treat or address preexisting conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the motion, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by  5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered; and agreeing to the  Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.
