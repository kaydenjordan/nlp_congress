 Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I feel like I am in the movie ``Groundhog Day.'' My  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are repeating one of their  famous mantras, ``Not this mine, not this place,'' their standard  refrain because they do not support any mining anywhere.   This amendment is nothing short of a full-scale attack on the  livelihoods of many of my constituents. It sets back our Nation's  national security and strengthens Putin's Russia. This amendment  imposes a million-acre land grab permanently banning mining in an area  nearly the size of Delaware. However, none of this land is in the  district of the sponsor of this amendment, Mr. Speaker.   My colleagues falsely frame this amendment as an effort to protect  the Grand Canyon, which is, of course, completely disingenuous. No one  wants to mine within the Grand Canyon. This entire area is miles away  from the boundaries of the buffer around the Grand Canyon National  Park.                                time  1600    Bipartisan negotiations led to the Arizona Wilderness Act in 1984,  which set aside this area for multiple-use activities, including  mining. It placed 387,000 acres of land into the National Wilderness  Preservation System in exchange for leaving 540,000 acres for multiple  use, which now makes up a large portion of this withdrawal.   Estimates show that the passage of this amendment would cost the six  directly affected counties in Arizona and Utah between 2,000 and 4,000  jobs and $29 billion in economic activity. This would completely and  utterly devastate these rural communities.   The area in question is home to the highest grade and largest  quantity of uranium deposits in the country, so this amendment does not  just negatively affect Arizona, it harms the national security of the  entire country.   By passing this amendment, we play right into the hands of Russia,  who along with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, are deliberately trying to  corner the global uranium market. China is also joining in the game,  buying up uranium mines in Africa.   Successful uranium mining occurred in the 1980s in this exact area.  These mines were reclaimed so well that you can't even tell where they  once existed. And there was no damage done to the Grand Canyon  watershed--in fact, it may have improved it.   Mr. Speaker, I think this House is slowly becoming fully aware of the  problem we face as a nation when it comes to our reliance on foreign  sources of critical minerals, especially in light of the current  pandemic. In fact, many Democrats are starting to come to the table to  work with us to rectify this problem.   However, there are still many hurdles to cross, like the fact that my  colleagues continue to try to block mining in northern Arizona, much  like they do in northern Minnesota and the Resolution Copper Mine in  the southern part of my district.   There is no question that this amendment will hurt local revenues,  kill jobs, and undermine American energy security. It is opposed by the  people of my district, and, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join  me in opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters: one being a veto  threat from the administration related to the bill form of this  amendment, H.R. 1373; and the other being a letter from a number of  industry groups opposing this amendment.  [[Page H3373]]                          Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 1373--Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act--Rep. Grijalva, D-AZ,                             and 122 cosponsors         The Administration strongly opposes H.R. 1373, the Grand       Canyon Centennial Protection Act. This bill would permanently       make more than 1 million acres of Federal lands in Arizona       off limits to development and uses that would otherwise be       permissible under Federal laws governing public lands,       mining, mineral, and geothermal leasing. The Administration       opposes such a large, permanent withdrawal, which would       prohibit environmentally responsible development, as       determined through site-specific analysis, of uranium and       other mineral resources.        The United States has an extraordinary abundance of mineral       resources, both onshore and offshore, but this legislation       would restrict our ability to access critical minerals like       uranium in an area known to have them in large supply.       Moreover, the size of the withdrawal included in H.R. 1373 is       inconsistent with the Administration's goal of striking the       appropriate balance for use of public lands described in two       executive orders. This withdrawal would conflict with the       objectives set forth in Executive Order 13783, Promoting       Energy Independence and Economic Growth, and Executive Order       13817, A Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and Reliable       Supplies of Critical Minerals. Development of our Nation's       mineral resources is essential to ensuring the Nation's       geopolitical security, and this bill would not help us       achieve that goal.        If H.R. 1373 were presented to the President, his advisors       would recommend that he veto it.                                   ____                                                   October 29, 2019.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Chairman, House Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Ranking Member, House Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop: The       signatories to this letter urge you to vote in opposition to       the ``Grand Canyon Centennial Protection Act'' (H.R. 1373),       an act that fails to acknowledge our nation's alarming       reliance on foreign sources of minerals and would further       weaken the already vulnerable supply chains for key U.S.       industry sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure,       energy and defense.        Federal lands--predominantly in the western U.S.--are the       source of much of our nation's mineral endowment. Of these       federal lands, half are either off limits or under       restrictions to mineral development. While mining is       certainly not appropriate on all federal lands, maintaining       responsible access to the very resources that drive       innovation, feed economic growth and improve our nation's       quality of life is essential. Given the vast amount of       federal lands already closed to mining operations, caution       should be exercised when determining whether additional lands       should be placed off limits.        H.R. 1373 targets over a million acres of mineral rich       lands, including world-class uranium ore deposits that are       located well beyond the boundaries of the Grand Canyon       National Park. The park as created already includes a built-      in buffer zone to protect park resources from activities       taking place outside the park boundaries and an additional       million-acre buffer zone is not justified. H.R. 1373       deliberately disregards our dangerous dependence on countries       like Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Niger to meet our       nation's need for uranium to fuel our nuclear Navy and supply       20 percent of our nation's electricity.        Furthermore, H.R. 1373 ignores not only the comprehensive       framework of federal, state and local environmental       regulations that govern every aspect of mining but the       findings of the Department of the Interior that the park was       not at risk from mining given these existing protections.       This unwise and unwarranted mineral withdrawal is bad public       policy that ignores the vast sectors of our economy that       depend upon a reliable and secure supply chain of minerals       and metals. Access to our nation's vast and diverse resources       and fair regulatory policies that promote certainty in the       mine permitting process are the elements of sound public       policy that should be considered when addressing resource       development on federal lands. We urge you to vote against       this misguided bill and support policies that promote       responsible resource development.            Sincerely,      American Exploration & Mining Association.      Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry.      Arizona Mining Association.      National Mining Association.      Wyoming Mining Association.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, this is about the management of  the land. As we stated earlier, the buffer around the Grand Canyon,  this is miles away from this.   And this is about national security. Critical minerals, uranium, they  are very important to the makeup of this country and its energy sector.  We cannot be reliant, and we saw that all too easily displayed in this  COVID crisis. We have to be the purveyors of our future.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to vote against this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment,  floor amendment No. 154 of the NDAA.   Currently, the United States relies on China for 20 different  critical minerals, which includes several rare earth materials defined  by the Department of Defense.   Rare earth materials are used in numerous modern technologies,  including missile guidance, control systems, lasers for enemy mine  detection, satellite communications, radar, and sonar on submarines, to  name a few. Any interruption of rare earth exports from China would  drastically impact defense manufacturing, American economic growth, and  overall combat readiness.   Madam Speaker, as a producer of nearly 80 percent of the world's rare  earth materials, China wields considerable leverage against our country  and its allies and did so with Japan earlier. My amendment would direct  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to issue  guidance that ensures the elimination of the United States dependency  on rare earth materials from China by fiscal year 2035.   This very same amendment was made in order last year and passed by  voice; however, it was not included in the final conference report.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge adoption of my amendment.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article from Department of  Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette.                       [From the Hill, July 20, 2020]          A Safe, Prosperous Nation Requires Secure Supply Chains                            (By Dan Brouillette)         The coronavirus pandemic opened Americans' eyes to the       vulnerability of our supply chains and our over-reliance on       critical goods from foreign nations. Many people suddenly       realized, at the height of the pandemic, that the important       medical products we urgently needed--like masks and       ventilators--were coming from abroad.        And it is not just medical products. We are dependent on       countries that are not reliable trading partners for       automotive parts, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and even       naturally occurring materials like uranium and critical       minerals.        The United States must take strong action to secure our       most critical supply chains, and, predominantly through       research and development, the Department of Energy (DOE) is       playing an important role in the Trump administration's       efforts to do just that. Three areas of recent focus, in       which DOE is striving to reduce import reliance, are critical       minerals, uranium, and critical infrastructure components.        Critical minerals, including rare earth elements (REEs),       are used in electronic products like smart phones, computer       and TV  [[Page H3500]]       screens, and LED lights. But they are also needed to build       important defense systems like aircraft and guidance systems,       make batteries, and refine crude oil. Currently, the United       States imports more than half of the annual consumption of       nearly all critical minerals, and we rely on China for 80       percent of REEs. Our lack of domestic supply for these       minerals is an economic security threat we must take       seriously.        DOE is developing solutions to our critical mineral       challenges by finding ways to diversify supply, develop       substitutes, and drive recycling and reuse of critical       minerals and REEs. One promising project will test the       economic viability of extracting these minerals from our coal       reserves in Appalachia and the western basins. Our research       shows that there may be as much as 10 million tons of       critical minerals in these reserves. Another effort underway       involves using a highly absorbent material to capture       lithium--a key component in batteries--from the working fluid       used in geothermal power production. And there are numerous       other ongoing projects which we believe in time will greatly       reduce America's reliance on foreign-sourced critical       minerals and REEs.        After decades of neglect, the U.S. commercial nuclear       sector is at risk of insolvency. Meanwhile, other nations,       notably Russia and China, are moving to advance their nuclear       capabilities and export their technology to gain increased       geopolitical influence. If we are to regain our place as a       world leader in nuclear technology, we must start at the       beginning of the nuclear fuel cycle and start mining and       converting uranium on a wide scale again.        The element uranium not only fuels 95 civilian reactors,       providing about 20 percent of U.S. electricity each year, it       powers the U.S. Navy's fleet of nuclear submarines and       aircraft carriers. Despite its importance, the United States       currently relies on imports for 90 percent of its uranium.        Our lack of a significant domestic uranium supply chain       threatens energy reliability and national security.        To reverse this trend and reinvigorate the entire nuclear       energy industry, DOE recently unveiled the Nuclear Fuel       Working Group's ambitious ``Strategy to Restore American       Nuclear Energy.'' An important component of the working       group's strategy is boosting domestic uranium mining and       conversion. To that end, the working group recommended, and       the president's 2021 budget included, funding to establish a       domestic uranium reserve. Like the Strategic Petroleum       Reserve, the domestic uranium reserve will boost the domestic       uranium mining industry, support strategic nuclear fuel cycle       capabilities, and provide critical assurance of uranium       availability in the event of a market disruption.        Finally, we must secure our Nation's Bulk Power System       (BPS) supply chain from the threat of foreign interference.       The BPS includes power substations that transmit electricity       to the distribution system before it reaches homes and       businesses, and the automated industrial control systems that       are used in water treatment facilities and manufacturing       operations. Our BPS may be vulnerable to malicious advanced       cyberattacks by countries like Russia, Iran, and China,       threatening the backbone of our nation's electric power grid.        To meet the challenge, President Trump recently signed an       executive order directing DOE to lead an interagency effort       aimed at eliminating vulnerabilities within the existing       system and developing policies to keep it safe for years to       come. The first important action we will take is to prohibit       future use of BPS equipment from any country or individual       deemed a foreign adversary by our national security experts,       the failure of which would pose a risk to the safety of       Americans. The department will also review federal energy       infrastructure procurement to ensure that safeguarding       national security is at the foundation of our policies.        A safe, prosperous nation requires secure supply chains.       The Department of Energy is leading the way in protecting our       economic and national security by advancing the Trump       administration's policies to produce more critical minerals       and REEs, uranium supplies, and BPS components within the       United States' borders.
