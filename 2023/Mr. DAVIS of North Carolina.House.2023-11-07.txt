 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate  the town of Bethel in Pitt County, North Carolina, on its remarkable  150th anniversary.   This past weekend, Mayor Carl and Mrs. Wilson, board members and  staff, former Mayor and State Representative Gloristine Brown, Pitt  County Board of Commissioners Chair Mary Perkins-Williams, Sheriff  Paula Dance, town residents, and others far and near joined to  commemorate the significant milestone.   Bethel is not just a town. It is a place of cherished experiences,  stories, and enriched traditions that have enhanced countless lives.  Indeed, Bethel offers old-time charm and exceptional family-friendly  amenities.   Madam Speaker, I wish the town residents many more years filled with  joy, unity, and prosperity.                            ____________________
