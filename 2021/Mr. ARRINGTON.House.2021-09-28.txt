 Mr. Speaker, to my colleague, my Democrat colleague:  From west Texas, our heartfelt condolences to Corporal Lopez and his  family for that ultimate sacrifice.   I am about to really launch into the debate over the tax-and-spend  bill, but we stand united for our troops and for those who are willing  to give up their tomorrow, or their today, so that we can have a future  in this country.   God bless the Lopez family, and I thank the gentleman for his  remarks.               Congratulating Wylie Little League Baseball Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a few  outstanding members of the next generation of west Texans.   The Wylie Little League baseball team from Abilene, Texas,  represented not only District 19 well but the whole State of Texas in  the Little League World Series there in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.   This team knows what it is like to compete in true west Texas  fashion. The success of this team is unprecedented, winning against  teams from Washington, New Jersey, and Nebraska.   To the Wylie All-Stars, their proud parents and coaches, and  especially Manager Reggie Regala, west Texas is so proud of you, all of  your achievements, and your outstanding representation of west Texas  and Congressional District 19. Thank you.   Go All-Stars. And God bless west Texas.                           A Tax on Every American     Mr. Speaker, we are, as a Nation, looking down the  barrel of the largest tax-and-spend proposal in the history of the  United States, this while our Nation suffers from a recession and major  runaway inflation on account of policies from my Democrat colleagues to  sideline labor by paying people more to be on unemployment than to go  to work. So you have labor sidelined, which distorted supply and  demand.   You also had a bill that was $2 trillion, with the flag of COVID  relief wrapped around it, to bail out union pensions and blue States  and blue cities that were broke before COVID ever hit our shores. This  has created inflation, a tax on every American.   The answer from my Democrat colleagues is to tax the middle class, to  chase jobs back overseas. After the tax cuts lifted 6 million people  out of poverty, gave us the largest wage increase in 20 years, the  largest household income increase on record, we want to tax our job  creators. We want to load the working man and woman and families with  lower wages, with higher cost of goods and services. That is what the  tax will translate into for these folks.   This is not only the largest tax increase; it is not only the largest  spending boondoggle; it is the largest redistribution of wealth, the  largest expansion of government, the most radical reimagination of our  government's role in the American people's lives in the history of our  country. I believe that. I don't think that is hyperbole.                                time  1015    What are we taxing? To make America less competitive and to put more  burden on the American people? To what end? To pay for the green new  [[Page H5467]]  disaster, in my humble opinion, their extreme environmental policies  based on the premise that we will have an apocalyptic end of the Earth  in 10 or 15 years, trillions of dollars, while we cede economic  leadership to the likes of China and Russia. We give them the keys to  the kingdom, and we end up defaulting our energy independence, which is  such an important part, not only of our economic prowess, but of our  national security. We are racking up debt that is completely  unsustainable.   Mr. Speaker, this bill represents $27,000 per household on top of  $200,000 per household already of the $28 trillion in debt. This bill  will not be paid for. We continue to put a deferred tax on our  grandchildren, and we rob them of their freedom and their future in  this great country. All of this is because of an income inequality  crisis or a climate crisis. Before, it was the COVID crisis.   Let me tell you the crises the American people are concerned about:  the chaos and lawlessness at the southern border, along the border of  my home State.   They are concerned about the runaway inflation and the crisis of  being able to make ends meet.   They are concerned about the crisis of the debt that will be borne by  their children and grandchildren.   They are concerned about the sustainability of the safety net for our  seniors, Medicare and Social Security. Both are insolvent in less than  10 years, and my Democrat colleagues didn't spend a dime, not a dime,  of the trillions of dollars, to make sure that wasn't the case and that  we could fulfill that promise.                            ____________________
