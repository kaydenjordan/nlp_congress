 Mr. Speaker, there is nothing bipartisan about this bill.  Speaker Pelosi made it clear: Whatever far left socialist priorities  didn't make it into this bill would be taken care of in reconciliation.  That is what we are really here to do today.   The total price tag of this infrastructure bill plus reconciliation  is $4.7 trillion. American people, listen: 4.7, t, trillion dollars.   It is difficult to visualize a number so mind-bogglingly wasteful. If  we started stacking $4.7 trillion bills one on top of each other, that  stack would be 317,971 miles tall. That is enough to go to the Moon and  a third of the way back.   This is beyond wasteful. It is disgusting, irresponsible, and  unnecessary. The bill would put our national debt over $30 trillion.   When is enough enough? This is saddling our children and  grandchildren with debt that literally goes to the Moon.
