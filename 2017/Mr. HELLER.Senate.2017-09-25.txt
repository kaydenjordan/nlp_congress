 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Stan  Wilmoth, whose relentless commitment and service to his community makes  us all proud to call him a fellow Nevadan.   This month, the American Cancer Society will pay tribute to Mr.  Wilmoth by presenting him with their first-ever ``Spirit of Hope  Award.'' This prestigious award is given to individuals who are  dedicated to their community, wellness, education, quality of life, and  who advocate on behalf of the American Cancer Society.   Mr. Wilmoth is well-deserving of this award as he has an extensive  record of giving back to Nevada. Whether it is serving as a volunteer  fireman in Lemmon Valley for 10 years or helping advance construction  of the Ronald McDonald House, we are grateful for Mr. Wilmoth's many  contributions to our community and his involvement in programs like  Head Start. In addition to serving as a member of the Reno-Sparks  Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Wilmoth has also held several other leadership  board positions, including chairman of the Nevada Bankers Association  and presenting sponsor of the American Cancer Society's annual  fundraiser. For the past 10 years, he has been instrumental in the  development of the Suits & Sneakers Gala, offering guidance and support  of the American Cancer Society's mission.   For 17 years, Mr. Wilmoth has served as president and chief executive  officer of Heritage Bank, which serves as a lifeline in our State's  economy. Under his leadership, Heritage Bank has played a large role in  getting small businesses off the ground and making northern Nevada a  better region to live, work, and raise a family. In fact, the bank  earned the title of ``SBA Lender of the Year in Northern Nevada'' for  the past 6 years, assisting many businesses and their families.   Before joining Heritage, Mr. Wilmoth served as vice president,  northern Nevada regional loan manager for Nevada State Bank, and  assistant vice president/commercial account officer and commercial  service officer for U.S. Bank. He also served on the Federal Reserve  Board for Community Banks for multiple years.   Mr. Wilmoth's dedication and community involvement in Nevada is a  true testament to his character, and we are privileged he is one of our  own. His commitment and hard work in the fight for a world without  cancer is truly admirable.   In closing, I am honored and proud to recognize Stan Wilmoth for his  leadership and advocacy on behalf of Nevada. I congratulate him on this  remarkable achievement and wish him the best in his future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Business Council of Douglas County for 25 years of striving toward a  ``diverse, sustainable and healthy economy'' for Douglas County, NV.   The Business Council of Douglas County started in September of 1992  and consists of business owners, professionals, and industry leaders  who collaborate with State, local, and Federal government institutions  to identify and resolve critical matters in the business community.  Ultimately, the partnership formed increases the ability of small  businesses to grow, expand, and hire in Douglas County and across  northern Nevada.   In 1996, Douglas County adopted a 20-year master plan designed to  provide guidance to the county's future development. Just 4 years into  their existence, the council was instrumental in helping to shape that  plan. Their involvement presented them with a unique opportunity to  share their input and better shape the county's economic future.   In addition to providing advice and insight to government entities,  the Business Council of Douglas County plays a prominent role in  educating the community and serving as a catalyst for debate on  relevant and timely issues. By holding townhall debates and educational  forums on critical issues like water and transportation, as well as  forums for candidates running to serve in public office, the council  has helped facilitate a community where everyone has a vested interest  in the county's future.   Furthermore, the Business Council of Douglas County is striving to do  more and encouraging businessowners in northern Nevada, as well as  community members, to participate in the organization's efforts and to  stay informed. To accomplish this, the council distributes a weekly  newsletter on topics of importance to the business community, relevant  government meetings, votes, projects, and news. The council's general  membership hosts a monthly breakfast with guest speakers at no charge  because all meetings are open to members and their invited guests. They  also host an annual critical issues conference. This year's conference  is another way for them to discuss important issues to the county and  its ability to grow the economy.   The Business Council of Douglas County's efforts and priorities go  hand-in-hand with my fight in Washington, DC, to foster an economic  climate that allows small businesses to invest, grow, and hire across  the State. Having served in the Nevada Legislature and currently as our  State's senior Senator, I can attest to the significance of the council  and the partnership they have formed with all levels of government.   In closing, I am honored and proud to recognize the Business Council  of Douglas County for 25 years of tireless advocacy on behalf of the  entire community. Through years of hard work, planning, and educational  efforts, the Douglas County business community has an open and  transparent dialogue with their State, local, and Federal officials.  The partnership that has developed will not only continue to grow but  benefit the community for years to come.                            ____________________
