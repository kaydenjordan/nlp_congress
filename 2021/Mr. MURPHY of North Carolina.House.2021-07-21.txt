 Mr. Speaker, freedom-loving Cubans have  taken to the streets to protest the socialist, Marxist Castro regime  that has held a deadly grip over Cuba for 60 years.   Cubans are protesting to secure the blessings of liberty that now so  many in this country are showing disdain for. The socialist Castro  regime embraces a backward economy that prides itself on taking  everything it can from the people until there is nothing left. There  are no means for justice, no opportunities for success outside the  bounds of tyranny, and no consideration for the God-given rights of  their people.   Let this be a lesson to the world and to my socialist colleagues  across the aisle. Communism does not work. There is no example in  history of any modern society benefiting from Marxist rule, and any  attempt to paint socialist and communist dictatorships as anything but  cruel is peddling lies and fiction.   The pro-democracy demonstrations in Cuba are sending a powerful  message: Communism is oppressive and denies people their basic freedom.   Cubans deserve our strong, unwavering support, and I will always  stand up for freedom fighters around the world.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, when you pull into a gas  station or visit a grocery store this week, you will notice something  different. Consumer prices are up across the board. Make no mistake,  this financial strain is a direct result of the Biden administration's  out-of-control spending. It is hurting millions of Americans across the  Nation. In fact, nearly 9 in 10 Americans have reported a serious  concern about the rise in prices. The reality is inflation, perhaps  more accurately called Biden-flation, which is climbing at the highest  rate in 13 years. Gas prices are up 45 percent; used car prices up 45  percent; and the cost of breakfast, lunch, and dinner has gone up for  every single family.   These staples are necessities for every family in this country and  their prices are rising because of the Democrats' reckless spending  agenda. There is no doubt that the Democrats' nonstop Big Government  spending is placing tremendous financial stress on the American family.  What is worse, Democrats have failed to acknowledge that their  outrageous spending has the most devastating impact on low-income  Americans, many of whom have to spend beyond their means to afford the  basic cost of goods and services.   Let me make this very clear. Inflation is a regressive tax that  disproportionately affects the poor. Democrats are completely out of  touch with the American people. To them, inflation is transitory;  nothing to worry about. To the North Carolinians that I represent and  speak with every day, inflation is now a real and present problem.   What is the Democrats' solution to soaring prices and high prices?  Borrowing more money, another $3.5 trillion of taxpayer money to put  toward new spending and tax hikes.   There is a life lesson here. If you are in a hole, stop digging.   Republicans understand that in most households, every dollar counts.  But in Biden's economy, all Americans are having to pay more now to get  less. We must reverse these disastrous policy decisions to save jobs,  protect long-term investments, sustain economic progress, and most  importantly, keep more money in taxpayers' pockets.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
