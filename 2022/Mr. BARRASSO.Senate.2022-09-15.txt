 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of  Margaret ``Megan'' Michael Debranski Kelhart. Megan passed away on  August 19, 2022, after a heroic battle with cancer.   Megan spent her career as a dedicated public servant. Megan most  recently worked as head of congressional and legislative affairs for  the Bureau of Reclamation. Prior to that, she worked for the U.S. Fish  and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Senate. In these roles, she worked  with nearly every congressional office.   Megan was born on December 2, 1975, in Norfolk, VA. In 1994, Megan  graduated from Lakeland High School where she excelled as a student and  was a standout tennis player on a State champion tennis team. She was  also a cheerleader, school band member, and prom queen. Megan later  studied political science at Virginia Tech, where she was an active  member of the Alpha Chi Omega sorority and later received her master of  science degree in natural resources.   In 2001, Megan met her husband Matthew, while playing in the Senate  summer softball league. The couple married in October of 2003.  Together, they enjoyed college football and travelling the world  together. In 2009, Megan and her husband welcomed their son, Matteson  Michael Donnan Kelhart.   Megan is survived by her husband Matthew and their son Matteson of  Alexandria, VA; father Dr. Michael Debranski and mother Margaret  Debranski of Suffolk, VA; grandmother Margaret Beamon of Suffolk, VA;  father-in-law and his wife Joseph and Lily Kelhart of Bethlehem, PA;  and mother-in-law and her husband Terri and Joseph Costa of Perkasie,  PA; and many other loved ones.   I ask our colleagues to join us in honoring the life of Margaret  ``Megan'' Michael Debranski Kelhart.                            ____________________
