 Mr. Speaker, regardless of what the Republicans say,  their budget paves the way for trillions of dollars in tax cuts for  millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations.   And who would pay for it?   It would be the middle class families, children, seniors, and people  with disabilities. It would slash Medicaid by $1 trillion, threaten  healthcare for one in four Americans. It would slash Medicare by $470  billion. And this budget proposes, yet again, to repeal the Affordable  Care Act.   Under the Republican tax plan, 1.9 million Illinoisans would no  longer be able to claim State and local tax deductions; and nationwide,  47 million people in middle class households making between $50,000 and  $150,000 a year would pay more in taxes.   So I ask my colleagues: Did you really come to Congress to take away  healthcare and reduce income for middle class families?   If you care about anyone other than millionaires and billionaires,  you need to vote ``no.''
