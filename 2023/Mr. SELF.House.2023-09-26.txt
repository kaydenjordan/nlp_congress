 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise to support my very simple amendment,  which would prohibit any funds from this bill from being used toward  the Civilian Climate Corps.   The Biden administration continues to prioritize programs like the  Civilian Climate Corps, which pushes Green New Deal policies that have  proved to be costly and ineffective.   Instead of pushing their Green New Deal agenda, this administration  should instead focus on cutting wasteful spending and securing our  southern border, rather than wasting taxpayer dollars on indoctrination  on a leftist ideology that provides nothing of value to the economy.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland.    Madam Chair, we borrow $6 billion a day. We throw the $2  trillion number around all the time but, frankly, most of us don't  understand a trillion.   We borrow $6 billion a day toward that $2 trillion. We discuss a lot  of inputs on the floor of the House, which means government spending,  Federal spending. We rarely discuss outputs, and in this case there is  very little output. We are talking about some inputs, Federal spending,  but no outputs.   This is simply an indoctrination program to the Green New Deal.   Now, we also have a lot of noble sounding ideas coming across this  floor, but in this case there is nothing positive. There is only  spending.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
