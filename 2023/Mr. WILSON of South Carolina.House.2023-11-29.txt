 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize  the 2023 Army Congressional Fellow, Major Gustavo Caruso, for his  service to the office of the Second Congressional District of South  Carolina.   His yearlong service in Congress is ending, and Gus will be missed.  He has been an indispensable contributor to legislative goals,  including the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act. He  has been a valued team member for the military and veterans.   Gus has received deserved awards in his 14 years of service,  including combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was deployed to the  Poland-Ukraine border to face the murderous invasion of Ukraine by war  criminal Putin.   Gus hails from Georgia, has a bachelor's degree from the University  of Hawaii, and holds two graduate degrees. His next assignment will be  at the Pentagon, where Gus will continue his promotion of peace through  strength.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who have successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America. Senator Tommy Tuberville is  correct that there will be 9/11 attacks ``every few days'' due to  Biden's open borders for terrorists.                            ____________________
