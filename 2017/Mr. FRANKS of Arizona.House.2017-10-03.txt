 Madam Speaker, for the sake of all of those  who founded this Nation and dreamed of what America could someday be,  and for the sake of all of those since then who have died in darkness  so that all of us as Americans could walk in the light of freedom in  this moment, it is so very important that those of us who are  privileged to be Members of this United States Congress pause from time  to time and remind ourselves of why we are really all here.   Thomas Jefferson, whose words marked the beginning of this Nation,  said: ``The care of human life and happiness, and not their  destruction, is the first and only object of good government.''   The phrase in the Fifth Amendment encapsulates our entire  Constitution. It says, no person shall ``be deprived of life, liberty,  or property, without due process of law.''   The 14th Amendment says, no State shall ``deny to any person within  its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.''   Madam Speaker, protecting the lives of all innocent Americans and  their constitutional rights is why we are really all here, and yet  today a great and tragic shadow looms over America.   More than 18,000 very-late-term abortions are occurring in America  every year, placing the mothers at exponentially greater risk and  subjecting their little, pain-capable unborn babies to torture and  death without anesthesia or Federal protection of any kind; this in the  land of the free and the home of the brave. It is the greatest and most  insidious human rights atrocity in the United States today.   Almost every other major civilized nation on Earth protects pain- capable unborn babies at this age, and every credible poll of the  American people shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of  protecting them, and yet we have given these little babies less legal  protection from unnecessary cruelty than the protection we have given  farm animals under the Federal Humane Slaughter Act.   Madam Speaker, it seems like we are never quite so eloquent as when  we decry the crimes of a past generation. And how is it that sometimes  we are so staggeringly blind when it comes to facing and rejecting the  worst atrocities in our own time?   Today, Madam Speaker, I am especially thankful, because the winds of  change are now beginning to blow and the tide of blindness and blood is  finally turning in America.   There is a new leader who lives in the White House, and he is deeply  committed to protecting the least of these, our little brothers and  sisters.   Madam Speaker, today we are poised to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn  Child Protection Act in this Chamber. No matter how it is shouted down  or what distortions or deceptive what-ifs, distractions, divisions,  gotchas, twisting of words, twisting of subject, or blatant falsehoods  the abortion industry hurls at this bill and its supporters, this bill  is a deeply sincere effort, beginning at their sixth month of  pregnancy, to protect both mothers and their pain-capable unborn babies  from the atrocity of late-term abortion on demand, and ultimately it is  a bill all humane Americans will support if they truly understand it  for themselves.                                time  1615    Madam Speaker, this will be a vote that all of us remember for the  rest of our lives. It will be a time now for the U.S. Senate to find  the courage and humanity to take a stand for these, the most helpless  of all human victims. The Senate's action will be considered in the  annals of history and, I believe, in the counsels of eternity itself.   Madam Speaker, passing this bill really shouldn't be so hard because,  in spite of all the political noise, protecting little pain-capable,  unborn children and their mothers is not a Republican issue and it is  not a Democratic issue. It is a test of our basic humanity and who we  are as a human family.   It is time for the Members of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate to  open our eyes and our souls and remember that protecting those who  cannot protect themselves is why we are really all here. It is time for  us, all of us as Americans, Madam Speaker, to open our eyes and our  hearts to the humanity of these little pain-capable children of God and  the inhumanity of what is being done to them.
