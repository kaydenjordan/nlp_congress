 Mr. President, West Virginia lost one of its truly  beloved sons when G. Ogden Nutting of Wheeling passed away on August 25  at the age of 87. To call him a community leader doesn't come close to  capturing the leadership, dedication, and inspiration he provided the  city of Wheeling, the State of West Virginia, and the entire Tri-State  region of West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. I rise today to pay  tribute not only to his legacy, but also to the enduring one of his  beloved wife, Betty Woods ``Snookie'' Nutting, who survives him. The  two of them, both Wheeling Hall of Fame inductees and also  Distinguished West Virginians, exhibited the best of West Virginia for  seven decades.   G. Ogden Nutting served in many capacities at his family's business,  Ogden Newspapers, Inc., for more than 60 years. His contributions, both  professional and philanthropic, benefited numerous organizations in  Wheeling to include the Oglebay Foundation, the Wheeling Park  Commission, the Salvation Army, United Way, the Elks and Rotary clubs,  Bethany College, West Liberty University, and West Virginia University.  Ogden was recognized by national organizations for his excellence in  and passion for the newspaper industry and for setting standards for  future generations of journalists.   His partner throughout has been his wife Betty Woods ``Snookie''  Nutting. Her commitment to historic preservation literally changed the  face of Wheeling, helping to save and rehabilitate dozens of Victorian- era buildings in West Virginia's first capital city. She recognized  excellence and beauty in the city's historical architecture while  epitomizing it in the way she lives her life and serves her community.   I am proud to have called Ogden Nutting a friend to me and my family  and am humbled to extend my deep gratitude to Snookie for her loyal and  selfless dedication to making our State a better place. To their family  and friends, I share in your grief in Ogden's passing, celebrate his  life, and am enriched by the example these two fine West Virginians  have set for all of us. Wheeling and the entire State of West Virginia  are a better place because of these two fine people.                            ____________________
