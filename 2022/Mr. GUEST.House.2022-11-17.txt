 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100-year  anniversary of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation.   The Mississippi Farm Bureau is the largest agriculture organization  in the State and represents the social and economic interests of  farmers, ranchers, and rural communities.   Its statewide grassroots structure allows it to be an effective  organization, representing and promoting 17 commodities in Mississippi.   The organization is a valuable resource on issues of importance to  our farm families, and it works with Federal and State lawmakers to  advocate for these priorities.   I look forward to continuing to work with the Mississippi Farm Bureau  on important agriculture issues in the future.   May God bless our farmers, and may God continue to bless the  Mississippi Farm Bureau.                            ____________________
