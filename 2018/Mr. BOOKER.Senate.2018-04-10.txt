 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the votes on  the  [[Page S2034]]  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 539 and the motion to invoke  cloture on Executive Calendar No. 728.   On vote No. 65, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 539.   On vote No. 66, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 728.                            ____________________
