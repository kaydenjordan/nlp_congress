 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Brain  Injury Awareness Month.   Since 2014, over 470,000 veterans have been diagnosed with a TBI, a  traumatic brain injury.   Last year, through appropriations, I submitted an amendment  requesting a $10 million increase to the Defense Health Program to fund  research for all servicepersons returning home with a TBI. I am happy  to report this amendment was passed into law.   In February of this year, the GAO released a report entitled  ``Veterans' Use of Long-Term Care is Increasing, and VA Faces  Challenges in Meeting the Demand.''   The brave people who serve this country should never find difficulty  in locating a facility or a program that fits their needs.   This year, I ask my colleagues to support my request for further  investment into research so the VA can develop TBI long-term care  programs, so we can honor our commitment to those who have sacrificed  so much for our country.                            ____________________
