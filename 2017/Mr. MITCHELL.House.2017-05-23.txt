 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Juvenile  Justice Reform Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I believe in opportunity. I believe that, given tools,  anyone can change their situation for the better. Too often at-risk  youth end up in the school-to-prison pipeline. When designed  effectively, juvenile justice programs can help reset a troubled  youth's path to successful adulthood. That is why I support the  Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2017. This legislation will help youth  in the juvenile justice system get on the right path by focusing  programs on approaches that work using evidence-based strategies and  proven track records. It strengthens accountability and oversight to  deliver positive outcomes.   It also provides communities with greater flexibility to deliver  services that meet the specific needs of youth in their communities.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation to help youth  break from their troubled pasts and turn their lives around and become  an asset in their communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Improving  Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act.   My wife and I have six children. Our youngest is just 7 years old. We  would do anything to protect them. I can't even imagine the pain of  having a child go missing, or to learn that they have been hurt or  abused in any manner.   Tragically, this is a reality for far too many children and too many  families in America. Last year, there were more than 465,000 reports of  missing children in the United States. To put that number in  perspective, about 700,000 people live in Michigan's 10th Congressional  District, my home.   Even one child going missing or being abused is too many. We must  recognize the seriousness of this problem and we must do everything we  can to protect our children.   This important bill will assist NCMEC in locating missing children  and in identifying abductors. It will help prevent children from  becoming the victims of exploitation online and increase awareness  about how to recover missing children.   Mr. Speaker, today we come together to support America's children. I  am proud to be a sponsor of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues  to support it.
