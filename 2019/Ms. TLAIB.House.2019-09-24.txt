 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support hundreds of  communities across America, both rural and urban, that are being forced  to endure PFAS contamination.   Every week, we learn more and more about the toxicity and ever- widening scope of this man-made crisis.   Not one but two PFAS sites have been discovered in my own district,  the 13th Congressional District, first seeping from the sewers in  Melvindale and then at the construction site of the Gordie Howe  International Bridge in Detroit.   As a representative of people living in those areas, and from the  State with the most PFAS sites in the country, it is my moral  obligation to stand before you all today and say time is now for  Congress to act. Include provisions to clean up contaminated sites, to  stop PFAS from polluting our drinking water in the future, and to  protect our servicemembers and first responders in the final NDAA that  is on its way.   We have waited long enough to help families whose drinking water is  at risk, who have been exposed to these toxic chemicals, and whose  future is very much threatened.                            ____________________
