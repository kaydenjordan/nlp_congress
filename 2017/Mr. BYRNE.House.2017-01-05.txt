 Mr. Speaker, I rise to share my strong support for this  rule and the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, there is no greater friend to the United States than  Israel. Israel is a beacon of hope in a very dangerous part of the  world. They are an important economic and military partner of the  United States, and they play a critical role when it comes to fighting  radical Islamic terrorism.   Given the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship, I was deeply  disappointed to see the United States recently passed a flawed anti- Israel resolution that will only make it more difficult to achieve  peace in the Middle East. Even more disappointing was the fact that the  United States just stood by and did nothing as it happened. Instead of  vetoing the resolution, the United States Ambassador abstained from  voting at all.   In other words, the United States turned its back and looked the  other way as the U.N. passed a flawed resolution attacking Israel. This  represents a  [[Page H116]]  dangerous break in a longstanding and bipartisan policy to protect our  sole democratic ally in the region from one-sided resolutions at the  U.N.   Let's be clear, this resolution does absolutely nothing to make peace  more likely in the region. Instead, it muddies the water and only  further complicates what is already a very complex issue.   No solution to the ongoing problems with Israel and the Palestinian  Authority is going to come from an international body like the United  Nations telling them what to do. Any real solution must come through  negotiations between the involved parties.   Honestly, given the many blunders of the Obama administration on the  world stage, I guess this most recent action shouldn't be all that  surprising. But this action is one of the most irresponsible acts ever  by an outgoing President. It will be a dark stain on an already  disastrous legacy.   By abstaining and allowing this resolution to pass, the Obama  administration has upset decades of bipartisan policy as it relates to  Israel and put a pathway to peace even further out of reach. Now is the  time to be standing up for Israel, not turning away from them.   It is my hope and my belief that under President-elect Trump the  United States will once again stand arm in arm with Israel, and this  resolution is an important step in that direction.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule and the  underlying legislation.
