 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Trump shutdown is now in its 32nd  day. Essential government services are straining under the lack of  resources--airport security, food safety, our Federal courts, our  national parks. The economy is taking a serious hit. It was even  revealed today that FBI investigations--law enforcement--are being  curtailed, and, of course, 800,000 public servants who are dedicated to  their jobs and their country continue to languish without pay.   The personal financial crisis President Trump is inflicting on these  patriotic Americans is worsening by the day. He is hurting the 800,000  dedicated public servants, the millions who depend on them, and the  entire country. This must stop. The government shutdown must end.  President Trump and Leader McConnell need to come to their senses and  reopen the government. Instead, over the weekend, President Trump made  a televised address to outline an immigration proposal that is going  nowhere fast.   It is clear that the President has realized he has put himself and  the country in an untenable position. Everyone knows the President said  he would be proud to shut down the government. Everyone knows that he  and Leader McConnell are the only obstacles to opening it back up.  Across the board, the polling shows it. Even a good chunk of  Republicans is getting disillusioned with the President and the  Republican Senate because they persist in keeping the government shut  down because they demand that they get their way or else. The leader's  attempts--that I just heard on the floor--to blame the Democrats for  the shutdown are futile. They are so far from reality that no one takes  the leader seriously when he says it. The American people know  President Trump is responsible for the shutdown, and now they have  learned Leader McConnell is a coconspirator in the shutdown.  [[Page S319]]    In his realizing he is hurting the public and hurting the economy and  in the underlining of the fact that his Presidency has far too much  chaos and too little order, direction, and certainty, the President has  had to make a proposal to try to shake things up. It is not a good- faith proposal. It is not intended to end the shutdown. The President's  proposal is one-sided, harshly partisan, and has been made in bad  faith.   The President single-handedly canceled DACA and TPS protections. He  did it himself, on his own, a while back. Now the offering of some  temporary protections in exchange for the wall is not a compromise--it  is more hostage-taking. When the President says: ``I will give you DACA  and TPS partially''--even though he created the problem on his own-- ``in exchange for the wall,'' it is like bargaining for stolen goods.  The President didn't offer the DACA protections in good faith. The  President's team sold the DACA protections as the BRIDGE Act--a  temporary fix originally proposed by Senators Durbin and Graham. It  turns out the actual legislation is even more limited than the BRIDGE  Act and would barely restore the protections that President Trump  himself took away.   The New York Times reported that Stephen Miller, the architect of the  President's harshest policies on illegal immigration, intervened to  narrow the DACA proposal as much possible. When Stephen Miller is  crafting the policy, you can be darned sure it is not a compromise.   Worst of all, we found out this morning that the legislation includes  incredibly partisan changes to our asylum system so as to make it  nearly impossible for migrants to claim asylum at our border. This is a  dramatic change in what America has been all about--a dramatic turning  around from what America has always had as its symbol--the Statue of  Liberty. The asylum changes are a poison pill, if there ever were one,  and show a lack of good faith that the President and now Leader  McConnell have in trying to make a proposal   The President and his team have tried to spin this proposal as a  reasonable compromise with there being concessions to the Democrats.  That defies credulity. Nothing could be further from the truth. There  were no serious negotiations with the Democratic leaders or any  Democrat to produce this proposal. Let me say that again. There were no  serious negotiations with the Democratic leaders or any Democrat to  produce this proposal. The President didn't ask what the Democrats  needed in a bill to achieve our support. He simply laid his proposal  down on the table and proclaimed it a compromise.   You can't have a compromise when one side declares: This is what we  want, and this is what you want. You can't have a compromise when one  side is determining not only what it wants in the bill but what we want  in the bill without even seriously negotiating with us. That is not how  negotiating works. That is not the ``art of the deal.'' What we have  here is just another one-sided, partisan proposal from the President.   Contrary to the President's claims, it hardly represents a softening  of his position. If anything, it is even more radical. First, President  Trump said: Give me the wall or I will shut down the government. Then  President Trump said: Unless you give me the wall, I will keep the  government shut down. Now President Trump is saying: Give me the wall,  and make radical changes to legal immigration or I will shut the  government down.   No one can call this new effort a compromise. The President's  proposal is just wrapping paper on the same partisan package and  hostage-taking tactics. When you take off the wrapping paper, it is the  same partisan, narrow, unacceptable package that cannot pass the House  and that cannot pass the Senate.   So far, there is only one piece of legislation that has a chance of  arriving at the President's desk, and that is for the Senate to take up  and pass any of the appropriations bills that have already been passed  by the House. These bills are noncontroversial, and there are no  surprises or poison pill riders. In essence, what is in those bills has  been supported by Republicans already, and each of them would reopen  the government and allow us to continue our discussions on border  security. The sooner Leader McConnell allows a vote on those bills, the  sooner we can end this pointless shutdown and reopen the government.   President Trump and Leader McConnell, the American people and 800,000  workers are asking and waiting for you to act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending  amendment be set aside, and I call up my amendment, No. 6.     I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.     Mr. President, I thank the Republican leader.    The Republican leader has just announced an agreement we have  reached about the schedule for the two votes on Thursday, both of which  will be amendments to the House-passed continuing resolution. First,  the Senate will vote on the President's proposal, and then we will vote  on an amendment that is identical to the underlying bill.    The President said his proposal was a reasonable compromise. In  fact, it is neither reasonable nor a compromise. There was no serious  negotiation with any Democrat about what went into the proposal. That  is because the proposal was never intended to pass. It is only a thinly  veiled attempt by the President to save face. Anyone who looks at the  legislation can tell it was designed to fail. In exchange for the wall,  the President offers only limited temporary protections for DACA and  TPS--protections he single-handedly removed. So it is sort of like  bargaining for stolen goods. On top of that, he has proposed new,  radical changes to our asylum system without consulting any Democrats-- changes that controvert our Nation's most fundamental and precious  values. I hope that it will be roundly defeated on Thursday.    The good news is that after that vote, we will have a second  amendment that could break us out of this morass we are in. The Senate  will proceed to an amendment to the House bill that is identical to the  underlying legislation. In other words, for the first time, we will  have a vote on whether to open up the government without any decision,  one way or the other, on border security. The proposal also adds  necessary disaster aid to several States that were recently ravaged by  natural disasters.    People are asking: Isn't there a way out of this mess? Isn't there a  way to relieve the burden on the 800,000 Federal workers who are not  getting paid? Isn't there a way to get government services open first  and then to debate what we should do for border security?    There is a way, and that will be the second vote that will occur on  Thursday. It would reopen all of the portions of the government until  February 8--open them briefly, but open them it will--and it would  allow workers to get paid and get their backpay. It would allow us to  then debate--without hostage-taking, without temper tantrums, without  anything--how we can best do border security. We would get that done,  hopefully, by February 8 and keep the government open.    If you are looking for a way to open up the government, this is the  way. I hope my Republican colleagues--many of whom were circulating a  letter that does, basically, the same thing as does this proposal but  without the disaster aid--will sign, will vote yes. The American people  are looking for a solution. I am glad that we will have a vote that  will bring us nearer to that solution, much closer to that solution.  That will be the second vote here, which will open up the government  and then will allow us to debate border security.    Again, I urge enough of my Republican colleagues to join us  Democrats in voting for the proposal, which has already passed the  House, that could open up the government.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
