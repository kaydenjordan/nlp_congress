 Madam President, I am pleased to commend  George King of Washington County, MS, for his service and contributions  to the State of Mississippi while serving as the 82nd president of the  Delta Council.   Founded in 1935, Delta Council is a widely-respected economic  development organization representing business, professional, and  agricultural leaders in the Delta region of Mississippi. I commend  Delta Council for its continuous role in improving the quality of life  in this unique part our country.   George King's tenure as council president began in May 2017. The  Delta Council under Mr. King's leadership has benefited from this  extensive experience as a strong voice for the region on farm policy.  He is an important private-sector leader in water resource  developments, which are vitally important to this highly productive  agricultural region of Mississippi.   Mr. King graduated from Leland High School and earned an agronomy  degree from Mississippi State University. He is a partner in Nelson- King Farms, a diversified row-crop farming operation. In addition to  his leadership in Delta Council and farm production activities, Mr.  King has served as Director of the National Cotton Council, and Cotton,  Incorporated. He is also past president of the Southern Cotton Ginners  Association, and a former Chairman of the USDA-Farm Service Agency  County Committee.   I am pleased to offer congratulations to George King and to share  this appreciation with his wife, Lisa, and their four children, Walt,  Caroline, Caitlin, and Nelson, as the 83rd annual meeting of the  membership of Delta Council convenes on June 1 at Delta State  University.                            ____________________
