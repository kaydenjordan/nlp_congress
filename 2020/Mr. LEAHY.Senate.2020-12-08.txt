 Madam President, I know we are about to vote, and I will  speak further at another time about Senator Udall, but I just want to  tell him what I told you--all of you--what I said to him when he  finished speaking: In my 46 years here, it is one of the finest and  most moving, heartfelt, honest speeches I have heard. I have also sent  a note, I say to Senator Udall, to Jill Udall to tell her how great you  are, but I think she probably knew it. But I will speak further at  another time.    I yield the floor.
