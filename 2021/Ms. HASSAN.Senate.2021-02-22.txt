 Mr. President, during this impeachment trial, our country  has re-lived the chilling and un-American assault on the foundations of  our democracy. New video footage reinforced both the brutality of the  rioters and also the heroism of members of law enforcement who--just  barely--prevented further loss of life. The personal threat of that  day, however, is not nearly as troubling as the threat to our  democracy.   After listening to the arguments from the House Managers and former  President Donald Trump's defense, I voted to convict the former  President. As dangerous as Donald Trump's actions were over the course  of the months, days, and hours leading up to the violent insurrection,  my vote was less about holding Trump as an individual accountable than  it was about protecting our country from similar threats in the future,  at his hands or at the hands of others.   Impeachment is not designed to punish--it was included in our  Constitution to protect the Republic from abuses of power and tyranny.  I voted to protect the America that we know and love because January 6,  2021, will be our future if we tolerate what the impeachment trial  showed was Trump's concerted campaign to prevent the peaceful  transition of power.   Of all the things former President Trump did, it is actually what he  did not do once he knew the Capitol was being attacked and his own Vice  President, among others, was being threatened that was most troubling.   Should there be any doubt that Trump intended to disrupt the  certification of votes and encourage the violence that desecrated the  Capitol, his decision to allow it to continue for hours should dispel  that uncertainty.   If he had not intended the violence when it began, his failure to  exercise his power to secure the Capitol and protect those inside was  itself a violation of his oath of office and merits conviction and  disqualification from holding future office.   Before Trump's refusal to engage in the peaceful transfer of power,  the public could gather outside the Capitol; families could play soccer  on the weekends, and tourists could take photos of this temple of  democracy. Before COVID, the public could even walk right in, after  being properly screened. But throughout the impeachment trial, we came  to work through fences and barbed wire. There was no open space for the  public because we have lost the common understanding that the Capitol  is place where we spar with words, not physical violence.   It is fitting that the trial concluded right before we mark the  birthday of George Washington, who helped establish some of the bedrock  principles of our democracy not simply through his service as our first  President, but by voluntarily surrendering the office, peacefully.   Our union that Washington helped birth and that Lincoln managed to  preserve is still fragile, and it cannot be taken for granted. We will  need to continue the work of investigating what led to the grim events  of January 6 as well as what happened on that day, and we will need to  take steps to make clear that acts of tyranny will not be tolerated in  our country.   We have considerable work ahead to bring our country together and  strive for greater opportunity for all, both in the face of this  pandemic and beyond. I am committed to continuing that work and showing  the American people and the world that we are resilient, strong, and  willing to renew our commitment to government of, for, and by the  people.   Thank you.                            ____________________
