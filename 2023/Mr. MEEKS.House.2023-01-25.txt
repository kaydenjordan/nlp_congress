 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. Let me  first thank Representative Tenney and former Representative Malinowski  for their hard work on this bill. We wanted so much to get it done in  the last Congress, but it is important that it is one of the first  things that we get done in the 118th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, last year, the world held their breath as Iranian women  took to the streets protesting the devastating murder of 22-year-old  Mahsa Amini, who was detained for allegedly violating the Islamic  Republic's strict dress code. The world thought maybe, just maybe, the  regime would be ushered by their own people into the dustbin of  history.   The protests quickly escalated into calls for the overthrow of Iran's  theocracy and posed one of the most serious challenges to the ruling  clerics since the 1979 revolution that brought them to power.   Although today the protests have slowed some, and the regime remains  firmly in place, something has changed. The Iranian people have a new  understanding of their power. Despite bullets, despite arrests and the  threat of execution, they have persisted. Cracks have been formed  within the Iranian leadership elite.   The regime is not willing to meet the people's demands, and the  people are not willing to accept the status quo forever. This is going  to be a long, drawn-out domestic conflict.   The Supreme Leader is a corrupt old man who has stolen from and  killed his own people for decades. The Iranian people know it. The  Iranian President has not delivered on any of his promises and has left  the Iranian economy in tatters through mismanagement, corruption, and  international pressure. And guess what? The Iranian people know it.   It will not be instant, and it will not be easy, but change will  come. Brighter days await the Iranian people.                                time  1400    The Iranian people, and also this regime know, it is only a matter of  time. This resolution commends the bravery, the courage, and the  resolve of the women and men of Iran who have participated in the  protests to defend their human rights, their dignity, at the risk of  their own safety to speak out against the horrific abuses committed by  the Iranian regime.   It asks the Biden administration to continue its important work to  support the people of Iran, as well as encourages the private sector to  do even more to help Iranians to communicate with one another in a safe  manner.   Also, this resolution before us today sends a clear message to the  Iranian people that we in the United States Congress and the millions  of Americans that we represent stand with them in their time of  struggle for freedom. We want the Iranian people to know that we see  you. We know the risk you are taking and the danger that you face. Stay  strong. Stay strong, as freedom will always win over tyranny.   Mr. Speaker, we want the Iranian people to hear our voices. We want  the world to hear our voices that the United States of America, in a  bipartisan way--I know it is bicameral--and people all across this  country stand with those brave people.   It reminds me of struggles of others when they had to fight for their  freedom in the streets. Freedom will come in the morning because the  voices of the people cannot be deterred.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to point out that this is a bipartisan  bill in which we are working together. Just last week, the Biden  administration hit Iran with fresh new sanctions.   Not only did he do that individually, as he has been doing throughout  the world, but he is bringing others together so that we can speak with  one voice. Of course, the European Union was a part of it. Of course,  he brought along other countries so that the world is speaking with one  voice, collectively, keeping us together.   As things go on, we are continually ratcheting it up so that the  people of Iran can get their freedom. In fact, the only thing that was  somewhat changed and was done in this bill is where it encouraged the  private sector, following  [[Page H310]]  the recent clarification by the Biden administration of sanction  exemptions or communication technology, to work with the Biden  administration to ensure protesters and activists have access to tools  needed to circumvent government surveillance and repression.   The only thing that was eased some, so that we can make sure we are  communicating and allowing the Iranian people to communicate with  others as they protest, is what is in this bill. I think, in a  bipartisan way, we agree with that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Torres).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 7 commends the brave people--the brave  Iranian freedom fighters--for their fight against the brutal Iranian  regime and demonstrates that the United States' commitment is with  them, standing with the men and women of Iran.   In the face of so many human rights abuses, the Iranian people have  remained strong.   I say to our Iranian friends: Though change won't happen overnight,  continue to stand strong because the time of this regime will soon be  up.   The international community recognizes--and that is us pulling  together, all of the people of the United States and the international  community around the world--the bravery and the strength of the Iranian  people in the fight for their human rights, for their freedom from  tyranny, and for a better tomorrow.   We have got to keep our voices.   Dr. King once said that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice  everywhere.   We have got to stand together, and that is what this resolution does.  It puts the regime on notice that its people are on the march because  freedom cannot be denied.   So, Mr. Speaker, I am sure that there will be a resounding voice by  this United States Congress by passing this bill to say to the Iranian  people who put everything on the line that we hear you, we see you, and  we stand with you until you get your freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
