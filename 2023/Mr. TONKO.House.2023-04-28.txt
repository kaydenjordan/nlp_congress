 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Eda DiCaprio in  honor of her 90th birthday. Eda and her twin sister, Eleanor, were born  on May 10, 1933, in Amsterdam, New York.   She worked for New York Telephone then General Electric after  graduating from Wilbur H. Lynch High School.   In 1956, she gave birth to her daughter, Roberta. An exceptionally  hardworking and loving mother, Eda worked a number of jobs over the  years while Roberta was in school, including those at Mohasco, Miles  Catering, and Lorenzo's on Union Street before working alongside her  twin sister at Travelers Insurance.   She joined St. Mary's Hospital Auxiliary in 2006 and around the same  time began volunteering in human resources, where she secured  employment and continues to work to this day.   Congratulations to Eda on many decades of committed service to the  community and a happy 90th birthday.                            ____________________
