 Mr. President. We rightfully honor the sacrifice of  veterans and servicemembers and as a member of the Senate Armed  Services Committee, I am proud of the work we do to ensure that we have  the best equipped and most successful fighting force in the world.  Military families are critical to the success and readiness of our  military, but are too often unrecognized for their support to our  servicemembers and left without necessary programs and assistance to  help them succeed. Military families frequently face financial  insecurity due to spousal unemployment, which impacts the overall  success of our military. Somewhere between 12% and 25% of military  spouses are unemployed.   Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleagues Senators Boozman  and Tester the Jobs and Childcare for Military Families Act of 2018.  This legislation encourages businesses to step up and play a bigger  role in hiring military spouses who sacrifice so much by expanding the  Work Opportunity Tax Credit to also include military spouses.  [[Page S1248]]  The bill also further addresses a real obstacle to professional success  for many military families: access to quality, affordable childcare by  establishing a flexible spending account for military families to use  to reimburse themselves for out of pocket child care costs.   Addressing these issues will help military spouses advance in their  careers despite frequent moves. Being a military family member will  never be easy, but if we can do something to ease the burden in any  way, we should. This legislation follows the introduction of another  bipartisan bill earlier this month, the Military Spouse Employment Act  of 2018, which provides direct employment opportunities and additional  access to childcare, improves educational opportunities and extends  transition and counseling services. I believe if we make it bipartisan  priority to support military families, we will see an improvement in  the readiness of our military and reap the economic benefits of  supporting this underutilized and resilient workforce of military  spouses. I hope to see many of the provisions of these two bills  incorporated into this year's National Defense Authorization Act.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Flake, Mr.          Heinrich, Mr. Toomey, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. King, Mr. Nelson, Mr.          Manchin, and Mr. Kaine):   S. 2458. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to deny the  transfer of firearms and explosives and Federal firearms and explosives  licenses and permits to known or suspected terrorists; to the Committee  on the Judiciary.

Career and technical education (CTE) programs are an essential  component to each student's education, giving students the opportunity  to gain knowledge, skills, and credentials needed to secure careers in  growing, high-demand fields. Today, approximately 12 million students  are enrolled in CTE across the country with CTE programs in thousands  of CTE centers, comprehensive high schools, career academies, CTE high  schools, and community colleges. Through applied learning, these  students obtain technical and employability skills that parallel  workforce demand.   According to the American Federation of Teachers, 94 percent of  parents approve of expanding access to CTE and other programs that  prepare students for jobs. CTE ensures that competitive and skilled  workers are ready, willing, and capable of holding jobs in high-wage,  high-skill, and in-demand career fields. Throughout Virginia, I've  heard manufacturers express discontent with shortage of qualified  skilled production employees--roles that require the instruction and  training offered in CTE classrooms. It is vital that we heighten  awareness of CTE's role in helping the United States to meet the very  real and immediate challenges of economic development, student  achievement, and global competitiveness.   This is why today, with my Senate CTE Caucus co-chairs Senator  Portman, Senator Baldwin, and Senator Young and 41 colleagues in the  Senate, I am proud to introduce a bipartisan resolution to designate  February as Career and Technical Education (CTE) month. CTE Month  offers an opportunity for students, parents, counselors, educators and  school leaders to become more informed about the educational  opportunities attainable in their communities, and acknowledge the  importance of CTE in cultivating a skilled and well-educated workforce  in our nation.   Through formal recognition of CTE Month through this resolution, it  is our hope that we can foster greater support for the importance of  improving access to high-quality CTE for millions of America's students  and our country's continued economic competitiveness.
