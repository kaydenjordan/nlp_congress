 Madam President, across the country, people are  experiencing the ramifications and women are feeling the pain of Roe v.  Wade being overturned and having lost fundamental rights and freedoms  overnight.   In my home State of Wisconsin, women are living with dire, real-life  consequences. Two constituents, Erica and Scott, have been trying to  get pregnant for years--something many Americans can relate to--and,  finally, they were successful.   But 13 weeks into her pregnancy, Erica learned the heartbreaking news  that the fetus had a rare condition that caused the skull not to fully  develop and the fetus could not survive--an absolute nightmare for  expecting parents.   Instead of being able to get immediate care and mourn their loss,  Erica and Scott had to figure out the logistics of how to get the  healthcare they needed--an abortion--out of State. Let me say that  again. Expecting parents learned that they lost the baby they had tried  years to conceive, and instead of being able to mourn their loss, they  had to navigate a complicated legal and medical landscape and play  travel agent.   They had a challenge even to get somebody on the phone and struggled  to find an appointment sooner than 2 to 3 weeks out. In the end, Erica  was forced to stay pregnant for a week with a fetus that she knew could  not survive.   She said:         Every day I was still pregnant was just an ongoing reminder       of our loss.    Sadly, Erica is not alone. One Wisconsin woman bled for more than 10  days from an incomplete miscarriage after emergency room staff said  they would not treat her. Another, whose water broke at 17 weeks, was  sent home without the abortion care she needed, only to return 2 days  later with a life-threatening infection.   All of this is because Wisconsinites have really been sent back to  the year 1849. What do I mean by that? In 1849, Wisconsin's 1-year-old  legislature banned abortion, making it a felony to provide abortion  care in almost all circumstances. At the time of the vote, exactly zero  women were present to debate that misguided law, let alone vote for or  against it. In fact, it would be 70 years before women even had the  right to vote.   Yet, 174 years later, an activist Supreme Court ripped away the  constitutional rights of millions of Americans, and, last year, this  abortion ban in Wisconsin that predates the Civil War went back into  effect, denying hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites the right and  freedom to control their bodies.   This archaic law has doctors and medical professionals afraid to  administer the lifesaving care they are trained to provide for fear  that they might be prosecuted. In fact, lawyers are now deciding what  care can and cannot be provided. This law is leaving women with no good  options and wondering how, in 2023, they could have found themselves in  a position with fewer rights than their mothers and their grandmothers.   Women who have the means and the ability can seek care out of State,  sometimes traveling hundreds of miles and often being forced to take  off time from work. Some others are being forced to self-administer  medication abortions without medical supervision. Those who cannot  afford the cost of travel and lodging, childcare, or time off work--a  reality for so many Americans, especially women of color and those in  rural areas--are being forced to carry pregnancies that they did not  choose.   Wisconsinites are not alone, unfortunately. Across the country, 14  other States have already implemented near total bans on abortion,  leaving one in three American women without access to a safe and legal  abortion.   And anti-choice extremists in States across the country are  continuing their crusade. They are continuing to try to take away  bodily autonomy by pushing bills that include medically unnecessary  restrictions that limit access to abortion care. This all flies in the  face of an overwhelming majority of Americans who support women having  control over their own bodies and their futures and their families.   That is why I, alongside a record number of my colleagues, am proud  to be leading the introduction of the Women's Health Protection Act.  This legislation would protect the right to perform and access abortion  care, free from arbitrary waiting periods, biased and scientifically  inaccurate counseling requirements, mandatory ultrasounds, and absolute  bans on abortion earlier in pregnancy.   Our legislation makes sure that the life and health of the mother are  paramount, just as it was prior to Roe being struck down by the U.S.  Supreme Court and as the American people overwhelmingly support.   The Women's Health Protection Act would return the life-altering  decision to have a baby to women and their doctors, without  interference from politicians.   For Wisconsinites like Erica, whose rights and freedoms have been  stripped away, this bill is not just a political exercise; it is a  necessary response to a very real crisis.   Having the freedom to control your healthcare, your body, and your  future, free from government interference, is a fundamental right, but  in Wisconsin, it is no longer a reality. It is time to pass the Women's  Health Protection Act.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S701]]
