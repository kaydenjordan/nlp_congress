 Mr. President, let me join my dear friend and colleague  from New Hampshire in paying tribute to so many things about Johnny  Isakson.   I know we are supposed to abide by the rules, address remarks to the  Chair, and not speak to each other, and if I occasionally look over at  the senior Senator from Georgia and call him Johnny, I will apologize  in advance to the Chair and to the keeper of the rules.   I think one of the points that Senator Shaheen was making about the  bipartisan barbecue lunch every year is that we ought to do this more  often. We choose sides so many times, and for those of us on this side  of the aisle, it is three times at lunch every week--Tuesday,  Wednesday, and Thursday. The senior Senator from New Hampshire and I  never have a chance to have lunch together because we are there with  our leadership talking about what our folks are going to do.   Johnny Isakson decided at least one time a year, when he was in  charge of making that decision, that he would invite Republicans and  Democrats. Sometimes we got pushback from the leadership of both  parties because they didn't have us captive that particular hour, and  some of us who tried it didn't do it year after year after year. Johnny  Isakson has done that and has been an example of bipartisanship.  [[Page S6981]]    I hope, Johnny, we are not making you weary of speechmaking, but I  did want to make an extra point that perhaps others haven't made and  give a quotation that Senator Johnny Isakson has made about others that  he would never have made about himself because he is too modest.   I first became aware of Johnny Isakson in 1990, and he and I had not  met at that point, but I was in Atlanta, GA, for some party function.  Johnny Isakson was a successful businessman and a member of the Georgia  senate. He was the Republican nominee for Governor that year, and it  was pretty well known that he was not going to win that race. But he  came before us and gave a rip-roaring talk, very impressive, and I said  to myself: You know, he may not win this year, but this Johnny Isakson  fellow has a future, and he is going to go places.   It turned out that the impression I had that day was correct. He  would go on to serve for some time in a bipartisan way in Georgia, and  then, when the Speaker of the House of Representatives resigned from  office, Johnny Isakson was there to win the special election and became  my colleague in the House of Representatives.   During that time when we served in the House together, we were on the  deputy whip team together. And, Johnny, it was usually you and I  sitting next to each other at each of those weekly meetings of the whip  team.   I began to realize on a personal, day-to-day basis what an  outstanding leader he was, what an articulate leader he was, how  persuasive he was, and how able he was to actually come up with some  accomplishments in the Congress.   Boy, it is hard to get a bill passed, and Johnny Isakson has gotten  bill after bill after bill passed for our Nation's veterans, of which I  am proud to be one--a list as long as my arms. I am proud to be a  veteran. I am proud to be the father of an Air Force major and the son  of an Army-Air Force veteran from World War II. We all appreciate in  our family, down through the generations, the efforts that Johnny has  made.   He has been so effective because he understands people, because he  understands the business about building consensus and using strong  relationships and treating each and every one of us on both sides of  this center aisle with dignity and respect--the kind of respect that we  would hope to be treated with always.   Senator Isakson enjoys poetry, as do I, and I have been known to  quote a line or two from a poem, but today I want to quote from a poem  entitled ``Sermons We See'' by Edgar Guest.   The reason I want to do this is that from time to time, when we have  honored people Johnny Isakson admired, he would cite this poem or a  verse or two from it as a way of honoring and pointing out the virtues  of the person being honored. He would never be so bold as to quote the  poem about himself.   I submit today for the Record the entire poem, and ask unanimous  consent that it be admitted.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                               Sermons We See                              (By Edgar Guest)       I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day;      I'd rather one should walk with me than merely tell the way.      The eye's a better pupil and more willing than the ear,      Fine counsel is confusing, but example's always clear;      And the best of all the preachers are the men who live their             creeds,      For to see good put in action is what everybody needs.      I soon can learn to do it if you'll let me see it done;      I can watch your hands in action, but your tongue too fast             may run.      And the lecture you deliver may be very wise and true,      But I'd rather get my lessons by observing what you do;      For I might misunderstand you and the high advise you give,      But there's no misunderstanding how you act and how you live.      When I see a deed of kindness, I am eager to be kind.      When a weaker brother stumbles and a strong man stays behind      Just to see if he can help him, then the wish grows strong in             me      To become as big and thoughtful as I know that friend to be.      And all travelers can witness that the best of guides today      Is not the one who tells them, but the one who shows the way.      One good man teaches many, men believe what they behold;      One deed of kindness noticed is worth forty that are told.      Who stands with men of honor learns to hold his honor dear,      For right living speaks a language which to every one is             clear.      Though an able speaker charms me with his eloquence, I say,      I'd rather see a sermon than to hear one, any day.     Mr. President, I will read the first two verses of  ``Sermons We See'' by Edgar Guest.         I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day;        I'd rather one should walk with me than merely tell the       way.        The eye's a better pupil and more willing than the ear.        Fine counsel is confusing, but example's always clear;        And the best of all the preachers are the men who live       their creeds,        For to see good put in action is what everybody needs.        I soon can learn to do it if you'll let me see it done;        I can watch your hands in action, but your tongue too fast       may run.        And the lecture you deliver may be very wise and true,        But I'd rather get my lessons by observing what you do;        For I might misunderstand you and the high advise you give,        But there's no misunderstanding how you act and how you       live.    Those are first two verses of ``Sermons We See.''   I am so grateful for the sermons I have been able to see as a Member  of the House of Representatives, as a fellow colleague of Johnny  Isakson's here in the U.S. Senate.   He has demonstrated, in the way he has acted, the way we should  always act. He has shown us how to be a gentleman and how to be an  accomplished gentleman in the way he has lived and the way he has  worked across the aisle. How he ends this chapter gives us an  opportunity to say thank you for the way he has made the Nation better  and the way he has made life better for millions and millions of his  fellow Americans. Thank you, Johnny.   I yield the floor.
