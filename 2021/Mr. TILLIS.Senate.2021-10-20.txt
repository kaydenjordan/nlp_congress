 Mr. President, this weekend, thousands of law enforcement  officers and their families came to our Nation's Capital to celebrate  Police Weekend. And while Americans were paying tribute to our men and  women in blue here in DC, North Carolina, once again, received the  tragic news of a brave officer lost in the line of duty.   Officer Ryan Hayworth was only 23 years old. He had a bright and  promising future ahead of him. He tragically lost his life on Sunday  night, just 3 months after joining the Knightdale Police Department.   He and his training officer were investigating a single-vehicle  incident on Interstate 540 when a drunk driver crashed into their  parked SUV, taking Officer Hayworth's life.   Cody Hagler--his training officer--was seriously injured and remains  hospitalized; but, thankfully, he is expected to recover.   This senseless tragedy is another reminder of the constant dangers  our brave men and women in law enforcement face every single day. A  routine call to respond to an accident resulted in a young officer  losing his life in the line of duty.   Although he was only 23 years old, Officer Hayworth already had a  distinguished record of service. He served in the U.S. Army, and then  in the National Guard. And then he answered the call once again by  becoming a police officer.   It is not surprising to anyone who knows the Hayworth family, though.  Officer Hayworth's father was a longtime chief of the Zebulon Police  Department, and his brother is a firefighter.   A member of his family church told a local news outlet:         He wanted to be a police officer like his dad. They're       good, God-fearing people. They care about the community and       it's sad something this tragic happened the way it did.    Knightdale Police Chief Lawrence Capps has noted the high standards  Officer Hayworth met and exceeded as a new member of the force.   Police Chief Capps said:         When we hire police officers, we are looking for       individuals that embody the best of this profession--all that       is good, all that is wholesome, all that is pure, all that is       righteous, and Ryan embodied those things.    It is no surprise to see the outpouring of support to honor Officer  Hayworth. People from across the State have stopped by the Knightdale  Police Department to place flowers at a memorial created by his  colleagues. Other local police departments are now assisting the  Knightdale Police Department in their patrols during this difficult  time.   I am grateful that the vast majority of North Carolinians truly  appreciate the service and the sacrifice of law enforcement. They  recognize the men and women serving are good people who put their  uniforms on every day and take extraordinary risks to protect others.   Officer Hayworth is an officer who took those risks to protect  others, and he made the ultimate sacrifice in doing so. I know the  community of Knightdale will never forget his service and sacrifice.  And I know that all North Carolinians join me in keeping Officer  Hayworth's loving family and his many friends and colleagues in our  prayers.   May God bless Officer Ryan Hayworth and all of our Nation's brave law  enforcement officers.   Thank you, Mr. President.
