 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time,  and I want to recognize the gentlewoman from Texas for her remarks  because, as a fellow member of the Judiciary Committee, we all stand  for the rule of law. I, too, carry a Constitution with me.   The Constitution explicitly creates a system that is representative  of the people, where the people are elected by their constituents to  come up here and represent their views in Congress and vote for them.  It is not to come up here and to hand off control, to hand their vote  to the majority leader, to the Speaker, and to the majority whip and  let them vote for them and for the people of their district whether or  not to go to court.   The votes to enforce subpoenas, the votes to hold in contempt should  be votes of the Representatives of the people. That is why this  resolution today is such a travesty.                                time  1545    Mr. Speaker, I have only been a Member of this body for a few months,  and I was proud to be named a member of the Judiciary Committee, but  unfortunately, the circus that I have witnessed over the last few  months is shocking, as the Democratic majority tries to find some  reason, any reason, to impeach this President now that the Mueller  investigation has wrapped up with no crimes found.   If they want to go back and repeat the last 2 years of the  investigation, the millions of dollars, the hundreds of subpoenas, they  are certainly entitled to do that, but I would argue it would be a  waste of time for the American taxpayer and the American people.   Mr. Speaker, we had a hearing earlier today on the 9/11 Victim  Compensation Fund, and the chairman did a masterful job of arguing in  favor of that legislation, of which I am a cosponsor. It is bipartisan  legislation. It is going to be marked up tomorrow. That is the way that  this Judiciary Committee should operate.   Instead, we have hearings with empty chairs for the Attorney General,  we have a hearing with an empty chair for the White House counsel.   Finally, yesterday we had a hearing with people in the seats, but  they were all MSNBC and CNN commentators.   Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty of justice. I would urge my  colleagues to defeat this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank the American people  for sending a message to this Congress that they do not want the pay  raises for Members of Congress to go through. However, their work is  not done, and they need to keep it up.   They have successfully delayed the Legislative Branch appropriations  bill from being considered as part of this omnibus bill that is going  to be considered tomorrow, but it has only been delayed. It hasn't been  removed just yet, so stay on the phones, stay on the emails, and stay  on Facebook.   Get in contact with Members of Congress to let them know that their  constituents don't think that they deserve a pay raise. They have more  work to do. There is much to be done, in terms of addressing the crisis  at the border and continuing in the economic success that we have.  Instead, we have many committees that are holding officials in contempt  of Congress.   We have more to do, so I ask the American people to keep up the great  work.                            ____________________
