 Mr. President, let me start by thanking my colleague  from Delaware for outlining the urgency of the moment and reminding us  that the United States is not an island; that we have to address these  issues together. And I am pleased to see President Biden reasserting  American global leadership on all sorts of fronts, including the  healthcare front.   Mr. President, I come to the floor today to support the budget  resolution that is before us. As our country together fights the COVID- 19 health crisis and the economic fallout, more than 450,000 of our  fellow Americans have died of COVID-19--200,000 more than the country  that has experienced the next highest death toll. It is an unacceptable  toll of suffering, and the economic fallout is painful as well.   Main Street is struggling. We have seen thousands of small businesses  shuttered. Our students are facing an ever-widening education gap.  Families are contending with mounting bills and food insecurity. It is  a crisis that has upended every part of American life and which has  disproportionately harmed working families, communities of color, our  children, and the elderly.   I am glad that this Congress has been able to come together on a  bipartisan basis before to deliver important emergency relief, but now  is not the time to pat ourselves on the back and say we are done and  throw in the towel. We need to go big, and we need to do it before it  is too late, so we can beat this virus, get help to those who are  hardest hit, and put our economy on the road to recovery. We must pass  a package that meets the moment, and that is what the Biden proposal  does: beating the pandemic by accelerating the delivery of vaccines and  testing, helping to get our students back into school as fast as  possible, and do it safely, and get our economy moving again--an  economy that continues to suffer the wounds of the pandemic that has  killed jobs and ballooned unemployment.   Right now, we are seeing a K-shaped recovery, a tale of two  economies. Some people are bouncing back just great, like a V shape,  but many others are flatlined or actually going further and further  under. At the very top, the wealthy are doing just great. The stock  market had a good year in 2020. The S&P 500 went up 16 percent. But it  is no secret that stock holdings are concentrated among the very elite  and that almost half of all American households have no stock holdings  at all, including in 401(K) or other retirement plans. So don't tell me  that the country is doing well because the stock market is up because  the stock market conceals the whole other economy.   Here is a little story that illustrates the point, which is that in  Baltimore City, per capita income is roughly $54,000, but if last year  Jeff Bezos moved to Baltimore City, the average per capita income would  be $175,000. People struggling in Baltimore City would be no better  off, but it would appear that way if you simply look at the averages.   So, as we look at these economic figures, let's remember that  averages conceal the real hurt being experienced by so many people. In  fact, over 18 million of our fellow Americans are relying on  unemployment benefits right now to sustain themselves and their  families, and that relief will begin to expire in mid-March if we don't  act.   Four million Americans have been out of work and looking for a job  for at least 6 months. The harsh reality is that the longer someone is  unemployed, the harder it is for them to get a new job, and when they  do, it is often at a much lower wage, and that lower pay then follows  them for decades. That is the story of countless American families  holding on today against the torrent of financial hardship.   So to those who claim ``Don't worry. This is all going to blow over.  Let's just delay our efforts to provide urgently required relief'' or  ``Let's provide less,'' I say let's look at the hard facts.   If you look at the projections that just came out from the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, they indicate that  unemployment will remain above 4 percent until the year 2025 unless we  do something different. That means that even after the last vaccine  shot goes into the last arm, we may be caught in the wake of this  economic down tow for years unless we act now.   So we shouldn't get complacent. We shouldn't look at those overall  average numbers. We shouldn't look at the stock market. We should  listen to the stories of people who are suffering, and if we don't act,  they will be suffering for much longer than they have to. That is why  it has been said that the risk is not that Congress might do too much  but that we might do too little.   I remind my colleagues that we have been in this place before. Many  of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle have scar tissue  from 2009. Remember, we were facing a financial meltdown that was  taking the entire economy under, and here in the U.S. Senate at that  time, then-President Obama was working to get a big economic relief  package through. They had plenty of Democrats--at least 57 Democrats  were on board; a majority of this body--but needed just some  Republicans to join in this effort. Well, what happened was that the  proposal, the bold proposal, got negotiated down and down and down and  then barely squeaked by the U.S. Senate.   Even after all that long, bipartisan negotiating, in the House of  Representatives, not a single Republican Congressperson voted for that  bill. So we ended up with a divided Congress and an inadequate recovery  bill, and our Republican colleagues spent the next many, many years  complaining that the economic recovery after the downturn had taken too  long. It was the longest and slowest economic recovery in history, when  if we had been permitted to go big and bold, we could have changed that  trajectory.   That is why Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said that now we  have to go all in. She said:         Neither the President-elect--    This was her earlier testimony--       nor I propose this relief package without an appreciation for       this country's debt burden. But right now, with interest       rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act       big. In the long run, I believe the benefits will far       outweigh the costs, especially if we care about helping       people who have been struggling for a very long time.    Even President Trump's former top economist, Kevin Hassett, supported  that assessment and has said that if we don't act now, we could end up  in a negative spiral for the economy.   The American public sees this very clearly. If you just look at  recent polls, 70 percent of the American public is fully on board with  President Biden's bold plan. That is reflected in a Quinnipiac poll  that came out just today. The Navigator data said the same thing. The  American public recognizes that we have to act big and we have to act  now to make sure that we beat this pandemic and that we get our economy  back on track just as soon as possible.   We all would like to have our Republican colleagues as partners in  this effort. President Biden has made that very clear. But the  overriding priority must be to meet the moment and take care of the  needs of the American people. That is what the American people are  telling us. I hope all of us will listen.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I opposed amendment No. 54 proposed by  Senator Young because it could prevent more than 3.5 million American  citizens with Social Security numbers, including 2 million children,  from receiving vital relief if anyone else in their household lacks a  Social Security number or uses an Individual Taxpayer Identification  number to file their taxes. Before Congress passed an omnibus Covid  relief package in December 2020, these mixed-status families were  excluded from receiving economic impact payments, including their  American citizen children. It is simply wrong and constitutionally  suspect to discriminate against this group of American citizens.                               Amendment No. 48    Mr. President, I opposed amendment No. 48 proposed by Senator Blunt.  Getting our kids back in school is an urgent priority. Children,  parents, and educators all struggle with remote learning, especially  when far too many children don't have adequate access to the internet.  But if we are to open safely and keep kids in school, we must follow  evidence-based public health guidance from experts that protects all  members of our school communities: students, parents, educators, and  staff, alike. Vaccines for educators is a critical step, but schools  must have the necessary guidance and resources to implement mitigation  strategies to safely reopen, including funds for ventilation  improvements, PPE, and robust testing and contact tracing. This  amendment would be counterproductive--dangerously penalizing schools,  disregarding State and local public health guidance, and blocking  access to billions of dollars for our educators and students when they  need it most.   The Biden administration has called for cross-agency collaboration to  provide guidance and for Congress to provide an additional $ 130  billion in emergency K-12 funding, so our schools can safely return to  in-person learning. American families, children, and educators can't  afford for us to waste any more time; it is time for Congress to act.
