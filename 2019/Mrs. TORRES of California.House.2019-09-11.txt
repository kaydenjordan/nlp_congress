 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives  Maloney and Nadler for organizing this Special Order to mark a day that  is engraved in the memory of every American, September 11, 2001.   Eighteen years later we honor the lives of the fallen, the  firefighters and the law enforcement officers who ran towards danger  when everyone else was running away from it. And we recognize the 911  dispatchers who were working around the clock behind the scenes to  organize emergency response across our Nation.   I was working at the LAPD 911 center that morning. It was all hands  on deck, and I didn't know when I would be able to go home. My first  assignment that day was to assemble two mobile field force units and  send them out to protect places of worship, water treatment plants,  cell phone towers, and anything that could be considered a target.   I had no idea what would come next. None of us did. But like every  first responder working that day, 911 dispatchers had to cast their own  fears aside. They had jobs to do. They had to protect and secure their  communities, just like firefighters and police officers. And they had  to be the calm reassuring voice on the other side of the line for every  person who dialed 911, for every resident who was fearing the worst,  for every child who was calling to ask should I go to school or stay  home. We received calls from all over the world at our 911 center that  day.   So as we pause today to remember that tragic, dark day, let us not  forget the unsung heroes, the 911 dispatchers who are always heard and  never seen.
