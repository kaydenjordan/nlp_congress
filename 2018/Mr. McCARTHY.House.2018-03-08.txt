 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On  Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for  legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. On  Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour  and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet at 9  a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no  later than 3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   One worth highlighting is H.R. 4909, the Student, Teachers, and  Officers Preventing School Violence Act, sponsored by former sheriff,  Representative  John Rutherford.   Mr. Speaker, all Members of this House were saddened and horrified by  the tragic events in Parkland, Florida. Sheriff Rutherford's bill will  provide local communities with critical resources to upgrade our  schools and keep our children safe. I look forward to the House  speaking with one bipartisan voice next week and passing this important  bill without delay.   Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider several bills from the  Financial Services Committee. This includes two bills sponsored by  Representative Scott Tipton: H.R. 1116, the TAILOR Act; and H.R. 4545,  the Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act; as well  as H.R. 4263, the Regulation A+ Improvement Act, sponsored by  Representative Tom MacArthur.   Taken together, these bills will consider House Republican's work to  create an economic environment that is both pro-competition and smart  and balanced in its regulatory approach.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible,  including potential legislation making further appropriations for FY  2018. I will be sure to inform all Members as soon as any additional  items are added to our schedule.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I have great respect for the gentleman, and there were a lot of  questions inside there, I believe.   Out of my respect for the gentleman, I am quite concerned that if he  is fact-checked, he is going to get quite a few Pinocchios, so let me  walk through, first, how he started the debate.   The gentleman started and the first question was concerning  government funding to March 23. He then felt that work was not being  done, and he used the phrase--and I may get it a little incorrect, but  he said we only were able to pass a budget agreement because of the  majority of the Democrats, and not the majority on the Republican side,  passing it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   So I think it would just be helpful on the record to actually state  what the vote was.   There were 167 Republicans who voted for that budget agreement, 67  who did not. There were 73 Democrats who voted for it, but the majority  of Democrats, 119, voted against it, which Mr. Hoyer was in that group,  as well, voting against it. So I would make one point, and that is 71  percent of Republicans voted for this budget agreement.   And just to make the facts correct, Mr. Hoyer's concern about the  appropriations process, this House passed all 12 appropriations bills,  and we did it on time and we sent it over to the Senate. In the  meantime, the Democrats shut the government down before we could ever  get there. So I think history should actually play to facts.   Yes, I am concerned about the March 23 deadline, but I am pushing  hard. I would actually like to take those bills up next week. And as  Mr. Hoyer knows, being a member of the Appropriations Committee as he  was in the past, when you get to this point where we already have the  numbers set, it is really what is called a four corners, the four  leaders.   Now, the committees are all working through it. They are actually  making great progress. There are a few things left to actually close  out. I would like to get it done a week ahead of time, and I hope Mr.  Hoyer's side would as well.   So let's walk through some others.   First of all, I was a small-business owner. The idea is having a bill  on this floor that creates more jobs, that brings more access to  capital. Mr. Speaker, I heard from the other side, the leader, she  thought crumbs was the idea of Americans getting $1,000 in a bonus.  That is about equal to what I am hearing, and I am offended by it. It  is not insignificant that someone wants to create a job and have access  to capital. The gentleman is wrong about that.   Then the gentleman talks about our Speaker. Our Speaker has worked a  great deal, and, yes, he has kept his word.   Mr. Hoyer was in that meeting with me when we were in the White  House. Before we left that bipartisan, bicameral meeting with the  administration, we agreed to work on this issue in four areas, and we  have had numerous meetings in my office about that as well.                                time  1115    I don't know, maybe you forget to state that we are a rule of law  Nation. In doing so, that is why we are in this position we are today,  because there was a past executive branch that thought they were a  legislative branch and they did something that everyone would agree  they do not have the power to do. So the current President said to move  it to the legislative branch like it should be because there are court  cases coming. In doing so, that is what we are working on.   The courts have now come back, giving further time. The Supreme Court  has now given a timeline that wants to make sure the Ninth Circuit  before there--so this gives us time to solve the problem.   I am more concerned about solving a problem than just passing a bill  for some political favor. I do not want to be back at this place in  another 2 years and having kids sitting here who are questioning where  they are going to go.   I know you raised some issue about individuals. Not one person is in  jeopardy that is registered within DACA. You have been in meetings  where you heard that from the Secretary of Homeland Security, where you  heard that from the Chief of Staff to the President as well.   The President even went further than talking about DACA to even  making the point solving, but he also had three other pillars. As you  know, we need a secure border. You also know the current law does not  treat everybody equally who comes here illegally, so you are going to  perpetuate the problem if you maintain the current law.   Thirdly, the idea that we want to make sure the nuclear family is  closer together sooner--you have got a 30-year wait when someone wants  to come in and petition a brother and sister.   Why don't we help them be able to bring their children and their  spouses in together?  [[Page H1492]]    That is one of the proposals as well.   Then the whole concept of merit. Those are all common sense. I think  they could be bipartisan. And the sooner we solve that problem, we will  solve it for a long term.   So on this side of the aisle we want to get this job done long before  the courts even have to act. I think that would be the proper thing to  do. So, yes, that is what we have been working upon.   Now, another issue you brought up was about guns, and you talked  about this Congress. I first want to give you a few little facts. I  appreciate that you always mention my book. That is why I smile. We  don't get any royalties from it, but the veterans do, so please mention  it as much as you like.   If I take--and let me just give you the numbers. Quorum does this.  Some bright kids out of Harvard created a company and it is all about  data.   There are more bills out of committee, 643 in this Congress; and  there are more bills out of this House, 558, than any Congress in the  last 25 years. And in that meantime, we also passed tax reform that  hasn't been done in three decades.   I know some people on your side of the aisle refer to it as crumbs or  Armageddon, but I will tell you, to those families out there that got  extra money, that are actually fixing their car or actually paying  their hospital bills, or those 1.2 million people who just work at one  company that now have a longer maternity leave, they don't think it is  crumbs, and they don't think having a bill on the floor that let more  people take a risk and create a small business is insignificant.   Now let me talk to you about what we did because we believe  background checks are important as well. Let me give you a little  background. The background check is only as good as the database of  what you have.   The National Instant Criminal Background Check System, referred to as  the NICS database, is currently administered by the FBI. If the NICS  check indicates a person as being in a prohibited category, the FBI  will signal a deny on the firearm transfer. However, the NICS database  is incomplete and outdated.   For example, on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the  First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Devin Patrick Kelley  murdered 26 and injured 20 others. Kelly was prohibited by law from  purchasing or processing firearms or ammunition due to a domestic  violence conviction in a court martial while in the United States Air  Force. However, the Air Force failed to record the conviction in the  FBI NICS database.   That is why this House, this Congress, this majority acted. We put  the Fix NICS bill in December--it is sitting in the Senate--which would  strengthen our background check system and make it more accurate. It  would require Federal agencies to certify twice per year that they are  uploading criminal record information to NICS, requiring agencies to  establish an implementation plan to ensure maximum coordination and  reporting of records. Now you are on record to voting against that.   We have another bill on the floor from a former sheriff from  Jacksonville, Florida. He is looking at school violence. Let me walk  you through that one.   As I mentioned, Congress will vote next week on the STOP School  Violence Act. This bill is proudly supported by Sandy Hook Promise, who  note that it will ensure that millions more schools will be trained in  prevention and lives will be saved.   Now, this isn't the only thing we are doing. Just this week, we are  having oversight. We took the Oversight and Government Reform Committee  in this Congress and the Judiciary Committee in this Congress this  week, and brought the FBI in, and they will come back again; because  there is not one person in America who wants to see what happened in  Florida to happen again.   But let's walk through this situation, because I think it is  important that we examine it because we want to solve these problems.  There were multiple red flags that were raised to the FBI about the  behavior of Nikolas Cruz.   The very first red flag: On September 25, 2017, a YouTube channel  host took a snapshot of a comment under his video that said: ``I am  going to be a professional school shooter.'' He sent that comment to  the West Virginia FBI tip center, where all tips are supposed to go,  which deemed it a credible threat and opened an investigation.    FBI agents searched for files on Nikolas Cruz, but they were unable  to identify the individual and did not even reach out to YouTube in an  attempt to recover records on Cruz, so on October 11, 2017, the FBI  formally closed the inquiry. That was one red flag, but that is not  where it ended.   A second red flag: On January 5, 2018, a second tip came via a phone  call to the FBI from a concerned family member. They described in  detail problems with Cruz he was showing with regard to social media,  cruelty to animals, school trouble, and dealing with a recent death in  the family.   When the FBI searched the database again for Nikolas Cruz, the  previous tip popped up. However, despite the call from a family member,  from a previous red flag, from a YouTube comment from the individual  himself that he wanted to be a professional school shooter, they closed  the investigation. The shooting happened on February 14, 5 months after  the first tip.   This House has not stopped to act. This House acted in December. The  background checks have to be fixed. That is why we passed it and put it  into the Senate. That is why we are taking up more action now for the  schools and adding that to what we already took up in this House. Those  aren't insignificant.   I believe there is a path forward. Just as we did all appropriations  bills, just as we have been through numerous meetings when it comes to  DACA, there is not one child in jeopardy today. The only jeopardy that  we will have is if we don't get together and solve the problem.   We have narrowed it to four areas. You and I know what has been said  in those meetings. You and I know where it is. We can find compromise.  We can solve this problem. But let's make a pledge to the American  public that we don't do a bill for the sake of something politically.  We create law that solves something so we are not back here in a future  Congress taking up the exact same issue putting other people in  jeopardy. That is my promise, and that is what I will continue to work  for.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   That would be the same outcome that is already sitting in the Senate.  The Senate has the Fix NICS bill now. We will add more to it.   I hope you are just as frustrated with the Senate as I am.   Why can they not pass something?    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   Let me give the gentleman a few facts. There are 426 bills that have  passed this House that sit over in the Senate. Of those 426, there is  less than 10 that are partisan. The rest of them all have bipartisan  votes.   There are more than 200 votes on bills that sit over in that Senate  that were passed here by voice unanimously. So I am not one to do  something politically just so somebody else feels better that now they  can vote for something because they voted against it before. I am for  making law and saving children.   So from this point, we are going to pass the STOP School Violence  Act. We are going to send it to the Senate, just the way they already  have our Fix NICS bill over there. And let's have the Senate--and I  will take you up on this. Let's work together right now to get that  bill back over here.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  actually have the same question. I don't know what we have to do.   You know, we come here quite often to have these colloquies. They are  supposed to just be for what is happening the next week, but we talk  about more issues. For a long time, I heard: What about the Children's  Health Insurance Program? You know what, this House brought it up  early. We tried to work through committee. The Speaker knows how many  times I went on the other side.   They wouldn't even let their committee work on it. So what did we do?  We took the ideas that the Democrats had, we put it in the bill; we  passed it bipartisan; they still said no. They didn't say no once, they  said it numerous times to the Children's Health Insurance Program. And  I sat here wondering: What more do we have to do?  [[Page H1494]]    Disaster relief. I know, Mr. Speaker, the heart of the minority whip.  We went together to Puerto Rico. We went together to the Virgin  Islands. We went to Florida. What more do we have to do? Then we  brought it to the floor, and he still said no. But you know what? We  still got it done.   Government funding. He started this whole discussion about government  funding. He misspoke and said it was because of the Democrats that we  were able to make this plan. He said a majority of them; and it was not  a majority, it was a minority.    It was a majority of the House.    Legitimately, may I respond?    May I ask the gentleman: Are you stating that we  brought CHIP up just weeks before it expired?    After?    With all due respect, I think you might want to ask  your staff before you put that on record, with all due respect. Well, I  am not sure you are correct because we brought it, and it passed this  House.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know  you reclaimed your time the time before, but let me finish what I was  saying.   With all due respect, what do we have to do? Yes, we have Fix NICS  sitting over in the Senate. And, yes, we are going to add to it for  school violence. We know that it does not have to be partisan, but the  background check system is broken. Let's not make it partisan. Let's  get it done.   When it comes to the challenge for DACA, we are just down to four  items. Border security. Not one person in here would probably argue  against that. And I know my friend across the aisle, Mr. Speaker, I  know his heart. He is a good man. He was, as he stated earlier,  majority leader. They had the majority here. They had 60 votes over in  the Senate. They had a lot of Members in the Senate, and they had the  Presidency. Same problem at that time, too. They did not fix it.   I don't want to be in that same place in the future. My commitment is  to fixing this problem. So let's sit down. Let's talk about border  security, but let's make sure our borders are actually secure.   When I look back--and people talk about that Gang of Eight bill--you  put more money in there for border security than was even being  requested today. But people still, on the other side, say no, Mr.  Speaker.   But the other point, too, is, if somebody comes from Mexico or Canada  and illegally comes across the border, why are they sent back to their  country but everybody else is not? Let's secure the border correctly.  Then, when it comes to really protecting the nuclear family, why don't  we make it a little faster that you could have your children and your  spouse with you? And do you know what that would do? I think that would  make everybody a little stronger.   When it comes to the idea of coming to America, should it just be the  luck of a lottery, or should it be merit? I think merit is a fairer  process for everybody's opportunity.   Now, I don't think anybody out there that is listening or can hear  this later would say those are partisan ideas. But when we sat in the  White House and we discussed it and we said let's narrow it to those  four items, I know the way our government is designed.                                time  1145    It is not designed that one person gets all their way. It is based  upon compromise.   This city, our capital, was because of a compromise. The creator of  the banking system, Alexander Hamilton, made this our capital. George  Washington, our first President, never served here. He was sworn in on  Wall Street and served his second term in Philadelphia.   As my good friend knows, Mr. Speaker, when a bill comes out of  committee, it gets worked on, then it is brought to the floor. That is  exactly what is happening with Mr. Goodlatte today, so we can bring  something to the floor and pass it, that everybody, hopefully, can vote  for.   This Congress has acted on so many items, but so many times this year  it has felt like the election has never ended. I know the heart of many  of the Members on the other side. They wanted to vote for disaster  relief. They were so frustrated that they shut the government down.  [[Page H1495]]    Do you know what? We have all learned from that lesson before. It is  not productive.   I also watched people when they talked about health facilities. They  wanted that funding, but they couldn't vote for it.   Then they said the whole problem was, when we brought all 12  appropriation bills to the floor, that they couldn't vote for them  because they needed a budget agreement. They needed more money. So,  yes, it took a long time to work that out because you want to hold that  with other issues as well.   Finally, after the shutdown, that was able to be broken apart. But  when we finally got that budget agreement that really is negotiated by  both sides, even the individual on the other side of the aisle, Mr.  Speaker, came to the floor and said she was going to vote ``no,'' but  she negotiated and wanted to tell how she got victories inside the  bill.   That is not compromise. You can't sit in a room and say, ``Okay, I  will give here and you give there,'' and based upon the formation of  our government, with the Senate as well, we come to an agreement.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know what goes on in people's minds and why they  wanted to be there. I will make this promise to the American public: I  will stay in the room, I will take the ups and downs, but at the end of  the day, I want to solve a problem. I don't want a political bill.   I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker. I have been in the room many times  with this President. He said on this very floor, he went beyond DACA.  For those in the American public must understand. It is a much higher  number. And for him to find that compromise, he just asked for three  other things. That doesn't mean we are going to get them all, but that  does mean we could find compromise in those three.   Mr. Speaker, the one sad part, if we had this debate with the  American public, they would find compromise with those three items.  They would probably find it very fast. They would want their borders  secure; they would want the nuclear family closer together sooner; and  they would probably want to see some merit.   So I know there are times here that we get heated, but the majority  of bills that pass this floor are bipartisan.   As I stated earlier, more than 200 of those more than 400 bills that  are sitting in the Senate passed by voice, all the Democrats and all  the Republicans.   We are going to differ on some items, and that is right. I want you  to keep your principles. But there is a window, and there is an  opportunity. And I know, as the days get closer, the election will be  sooner, but let us make a promise to one another. Let's keep that  election on the outside, and let's find solutions on this side, in this  House.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow, and  further, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on  Tuesday, March 13, 2018, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
