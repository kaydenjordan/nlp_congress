 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I thank Representative Brownley for  introducing this legislation to help our veterans and their families.   Madam Chair, I am offering this amendment to clarify that the  childcare benefit be made available for veterans while they are  actively participating in VA healthcare services, i.e., when they are  traveling to or attending VA appointments, and not at any other time.   This small clarification will ensure that the childcare assistance is  reserved for veterans who need it most and that it does not  accidentally replace more long-term childcare programs.   If there is a need for an expanded childcare program, I believe it  should be created separately, and I would be happy to work with my  colleagues on that.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. David P. Roe).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    That is a good question, and that is something we are  going to have to work on.
