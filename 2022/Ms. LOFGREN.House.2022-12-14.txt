 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 5229) to direct the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library  to remove the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court  Chamber of the Capitol and to obtain a bust of Thurgood Marshall for  installation in the Capitol or on the Capitol Grounds, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 5229         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF BUST OF ROGER BROOKE TANEY WITH                     BUST OF THURGOOD MARSHALL.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) While sitting in the Capitol, the Supreme Court issued       the infamous Dred Scott v. Sandford decision on March 6,       1857. Written by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, whose bust       sits inside the entrance to the Old Supreme Court Chamber in       the Capitol, this opinion declared that African Americans       were not citizens of the United States and could not sue in       Federal courts. This decision further declared that Congress       did not have the authority to prohibit slavery in the       territories.        (2) Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney's authorship of Dred       Scott v. Sandford, the effects of which would only be       overturned years later by the ratification of the 13th, 14th,       and 15th Amendments to the Constitution of the United States,       renders a bust of his likeness unsuitable for the honor of       display to the many visitors to the Capitol.        (3) As Frederick Douglass said of this decision in May       1857, ``This infamous decision of the Slaveholding wing of       the Supreme Court maintains that slaves are within the       contemplation of the Constitution of the United States,       property; that slaves are property in the same sense that       horses, sheep, and swine are property; that the old doctrine       that slavery is a creature of local law is false; that the       right of the slaveholder to his slave does not depend upon       the local law, but is secured wherever the Constitution of       the United States extends; that Congress has no right to       prohibit slavery anywhere; that slavery may go in safety       anywhere under the star-spangled banner; that colored persons       of African descent have no rights that white men are bound to       respect; that colored men of African descent are not and       cannot be citizens of the United States.''.        (4) While the removal of Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney's       bust from the Capitol does not relieve the Congress of the       historical wrongs it committed to protect the institution of       slavery, it expresses Congress's recognition of one of the       most notorious wrongs to have ever taken place in one of its       rooms, that of Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney's Dred Scott       v. Sandford decision.        (b) Removal of Bust of Roger Brooke Taney.--Not later than       45 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Joint       Committee of Congress on the Library (referred to in this Act       as the ``Joint Committee'') shall remove from public display       the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court       Chamber of the Capitol and the plinth upon which the bust is       placed. The bust and plinth shall remain in the custody of       the Senate Curator.        (c) Bust of Thurgood Marshall.--        (1) Obtaining bust.--Not later than 2 years after the date       of enactment of this Act, the Joint Committee shall enter       into an agreement to obtain a bust of Thurgood Marshall,       under such terms and conditions as the Joint Committee       considers appropriate and consistent with applicable law.        (2) Placement.--        (A) In general.--The Architect of the Capitol, under the       direction of the Joint Committee, shall permanently install       the bust obtained under paragraph (1) in a prominent location       in the Capitol or on the United States Capitol Grounds, as       described in section 5102 of title 40, United States Code.        (B) Priority for location.--In determining the location for       the permanent installation of the bust obtained under       paragraph (1), the Joint Committee shall give priority to       identifying an appropriate location near the Old Supreme       Court Chamber of the Capitol.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of this bill.   This bill, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent last week,  directs the Joint Committee on the Library to remove the bust of Chief  Justice Roger Taney, which now sits in the Old Supreme Court Chamber  and to add a bust of Justice Thurgood Marshall here in the Capitol  complex.   S. 5229 is the Senate's version of H.R. 3005, a bill which, for the  second Congress in a row, passed the House in an overwhelmingly  bipartisan vote.   The United States Capitol is a beacon of democracy, freedom, and  equality. It is visited by millions of people each year. What and who  we choose to honor in this building should represent our values.   Chief Justice Taney, who in the infamous Dred Scott decision declared  that African Americans could never be citizens of the United States and  had no constitutional rights, does not meet this standard.   As Senator Charles Sumner said during the 1865 debate on the bill  originally authorizing the Taney bust, and I quote Senator Sumner, ``I  speak what cannot be denied when I declare that the opinion of the  Chief Justice in the  [[Page H9818]]  case of Dred Scott was more thoroughly abominable than anything of the  kind in the history of courts. Judicial baseness reached its lowest  point on that occasion.'' More than 150 years later, those words still  ring true.   Who better to add to the Capitol complex than Justice Thurgood  Marshall? Justice Marshall was a pillar of the civil rights movement  and a tireless fighter for justice and equality. From his early days as  a litigator, fighting to end Jim Crow and school segregation, to his  appointment as the first African-American United States Supreme Court  Justice, Justice Marshall is among the most important figures of  American history.   Although I am disappointed that S. 5229 does not go as far as the  House-passed bill did to rid the Capitol of statues and busts of white  supremacists and those who served the Confederacy, we should not allow  the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Let's take this opportunity to  rid our Capitol of the bust of the man who does not deserve the honor  and add one of a man who unquestionably does.   Now, some may argue that this action is an attempt to erase and  forget our history. Nothing could be further from the truth. We must  never forget our Nation's shameful periods of slavery, segregation, and  racism, but this is about who we choose to honor, who we choose to  literally put on a pedestal and display as emblematic of our values.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 5229, and I  reserve the balance of by time.    Mr. Speaker, I will note that I currently chair the  Joint Committee on the Library, and I welcome the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), our majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my colleague on the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I would simply ask that all Members support  this bill.   There have been a lot of really bad Supreme Court cases over the  years, but I don't think it can be said better than Senator Charles  Sumner said all the way back in 1865: The Dred Scott decision was more  thoroughly abominable than anything of its kind in history.   Chief Justice Taney, the author of this dreadful decision, is really  a scar on America and should not be in a place of honor in our Capitol.   Support this bill, and we will remove that stain.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
