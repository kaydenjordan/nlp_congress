 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Gallego  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, what Congressman Gallego didn't say is, first of all,  both of us are veterans, and we serve on Active Duty in the United  States military because we believe in this country, we believe in  America, we believe we are an exceptional nation.   But Scott Pruitt has made a joke of Federal service. He is under 12  investigations. He has wasted taxpayers' money, he has used taxpayers'  money to enrich himself, and he has used taxpayers' money to help his  wife.   Based on what Congressman Gallego said about this lotion thing, he  had his personal security detail, paid for at taxpayer expense, drive  around to Ritz-Carltons to try to find lotion. That is why I have a  picture here of the Ritz-Carlton lotion.   There is also this thing, by the way, known as the internet. You can  just go on the internet and search for Ritz-Carlton lotion. The first  link will take you to the Ritz-Carlton shops, and he could have just  ordered it without using his taxpayer-funded staff to drive around to  find this lotion. This is just an example of the joke he has made of  Federal service.   Mr. Gallego and I are going to break down for the American people  today the top 10 scandals of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.    Mr. Speaker, number nine is the dinner  reservation. It was publicly reported that EPA Administrator Scott  Pruitt asked the security detail to turn on lights and sirens so that  they could drive him down the crowded traffic streets of Washington,  D.C., and get him to dinner at Le Diplomate restaurant.   That is an abuse of taxpayer funds, and that is not what sirens are  for. They are for actual emergencies, not to make sure that a Trump  Cabinet official can make his dinner reservation on time.    Mr. Speaker, number six is the lotion,  which we have already talked about. But what we didn't talk about is,  in  [[Page H5009]]  using his security detail, you should know, this is a really expensive  security detail 24/7. They have already spent $3.5 million on that  security detail in 2017.                                time  1300    This is, again, just a waste of taxpayer funds. No other Cabinet  official has this kind of security, and it is something that we really  should look at if we had a functioning GOP House oversight structure.   Unfortunately, the majority here in the House has refused to look at  EPA's Scott Pruitt scandals, and I don't even know how they can defend  him at this point.    Number four, the $43,000 soundproof phone  booth: So EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is so paranoid that he wasted  $43,000 of your taxpayers' money to build a soundproof phone booth for  him to make phone calls.   So if the President doesn't want to fire EPA Administrator Scott  Pruitt for his corruption, I think the President should just fire him  for being super weird, right? You have got Scott Pruitt using a  security detail to get lotion at the Ritz-Carlton, to have his staff  trying to find used Trump Hotel mattresses, and he has built this  private phone booth. That is just creepy and strange.    Number two is the sweetheart condo deal  with lobbyists.   So Scott Pruitt got this deal with lobbyists that no ordinary  American could have gotten. It was a $50-a-night deal on a condo in  Washington, D.C., near the Capitol, and market rates were much higher  than $50 a night.   But in addition, he structured a lease so he only had to pay for the  nights that he was there. So many nights that he wasn't there, the  landlord just had to eat those costs. That is not a lease that any  normal American could have gotten.   The reason that Scott Pruitt got this is because he was dealing with  these lobbyists, who also lobbied on issues before him. This is what  most people would call corruption.   And before we go to the last one, which is about the Chick-fil-A  restaurant, I just want to say the fact that Chick-fil-A--I can't even  say this without laughing. Maybe Ruben Gallego can talk about this with  a straight face.    Again, Congressman Gallego and I served  on Active Duty in the military. We are veterans. We believe in this  country. That is why we are up here.   Some of the things we said today may have sounded funny, because we  are trying to point out the absurdity of why EPA Administrator Scott  Pruitt is still in office.   Scott Pruitt has wasted taxpayer funds, he has abused taxpayer funds  for his personal profit, he has abused his relationship with lobbyists  to personally profit, he has also abused his relationships to help his  family profit.   Scott Pruitt, at the end of the day, is not just an embarrassment to  us, he is an embarrassment to the Republicans in this House, to the  Democrats in this House, to the Trump Cabinet, and to the United States  of America.   Scott Pruitt has to go.
