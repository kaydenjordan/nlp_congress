 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  a very special tradition taking place this Saturday, December 16.   Every year on the third Saturday of December, thousands of volunteers  set out across the country and the world in a coordinated wreath-laying  ceremony.   This ceremony is known as National Wreaths Across America Day.   In 1992, Morrill Worcester from Harrington, Maine, noticed he had an  abundance of holiday wreaths and decided to take the opportunity to  honor our country's fallen soldiers.   After contacting his Senator, arrangements were made for the wreaths  to be placed at Arlington in an older section of the cemetery. This  tradition would quietly continue until 2005 when a photo of the  tombstones decorated with wreaths and covered with snow went viral.   From there, this quiet annual tribute to remember those who made the  ultimate sacrifice transformed into a mission to remember, honor, and  teach.   Since the viral photo, Wreaths Across America continues to grow. This  Saturday volunteers will lay wreaths at more than 2,500 locations in  the United States, abroad, and at sea. This simple gesture is a way for  all of us to express our appreciation during the holiday season.   Earlier this week, what has become known as the country's longest  veteran's parade, Wreaths Across America's annual Escort to Arlington  kicked off.   The official route will travel down the East Coast, stopping at  schools, memorials, and other locations along the way to remember the  fallen, honor those that serve, and teach the next generation the value  of freedom.   Stops with public events will be held in Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode  Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and  Washington, D.C., before arriving at Arlington National Cemetery on the  morning of Saturday, December 16, National Wreaths Across America Day.   This pilgrimage to Arlington National Cemetery represents the very  best of our Nation. Tractor trailers will haul more than 250,000  wreaths to their destination.   Mr. Speaker, as many Americans will volunteer this weekend, it is a  reminder that our freedom is not free. These men and women paid the  ultimate sacrifice, and this small gesture is one of the many ways we  are able to thank them for their service.

The Painter sisters are  fourth-generation farmers who started an organic skyr yogurt brand to  preserve their family's Pennsylvania farm in 2020.   Painterland Sisters Yogurt now sells across nearly 2,000 locations at  grocery stores, including Giant, Whole Foods, Sprouts, and Gristedes.   They also sell the cream left over when making yogurt to make ice  cream.   Earlier this year, Painterland Sisters was named on the Forbes 30  Under 30 Food and Drink List. The Painter sisters, like many younger- generation farmers, were looking for a way to carry on their family's  agricultural legacy while making it their own.   Their family's farm is home to 400 cows who graze all over the  property. The Painter sisters' dedication and passion for the family  farm and business have led to tremendous success.   I congratulate the Painter sisters on this magnificent  accomplishment. Keep making delicious and nutritious yogurt.   Farmers feed. Nutrition matters. Whole milk heals.                            ____________________
