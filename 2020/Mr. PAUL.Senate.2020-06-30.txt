 Madam President, I think it is a terrible thing that the  government pays checks to dead people. The problem is that Social  Security is not sharing that information with Treasury. I have a bill  to do that and will ask unanimous consent for it to be joined with  Senator Carper's bill and Senator Kennedy's bill.  [[Page S3999]]    At this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of S. 4104, introduced earlier today. I ask  further that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Madam President, at this point we have a pending motion.    Madam President, I am asking, are there any objections? If  there are no objections, I guess it passes.    Thank you.
