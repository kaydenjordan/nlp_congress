 Madam Speaker, the prevailing thought has been ``things  will get worse before it gets better,'' and recently, it appears the  ``worse'' part is here.   Necessary measures are being taken as we have learned more about this  virus. We now have a new term: ``social distancing.''   Small businesses, though, are suffering, and tourism, the economy in  general. This outbreak is causing a lot of hurt.   Now more than ever, it is important to support our local small  businesses. They are the backbone of our economy and are experiencing a  decline that we haven't seen in a long time from the recent coronavirus  outbreak in their towns.   Their failure will result in a much larger problem for a country that  has proven to be quite resilient.   The SBA is offering disaster assistance loans to small businesses  impacted by the virus.   The issue is to ease and cushion our economy so that, in a few weeks,  we can start our bounce back. And, indeed, we will bounce back.   Last week's measure will help our health providers. Hopefully, this  week's economic package is not chock-full of socialist wish lists by  the Democrats but is something that will actually be helpful to save  lives and the economy and is affordable at the same time.   I hope we can accomplish good work this week.                            ____________________
