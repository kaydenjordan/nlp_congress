 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight with a heavy heart as the  citizens of my district and, especially, Loudon County mourn the loss  of Sergeant Chris Jenkins, a military veteran and long-time member of  the Loudon County Sheriff's Office.   Sergeant Jenkins was killed last week. He was hit by an intoxicated  driver behind the wheel of a semitruck. His life was cut way too short,  but the impact he had on his community will live on long into the  future.   Sergeant Jenkins served with honor, proudly going to work every day  in service to others and knowing that any day he could be asked to make  the ultimate sacrifice.   Today, I had the privilege of speaking on the phone with Sergeant  Jenkins' sweet mother, Faye, and his son Clay, who is also a Loudon  County Sheriff's deputy. Many of my friends in the Chamber know that  those are the hardest calls to make.   To me, our servicemembers and first responders are all heroes. But  talking to mothers like Faye, Madam Speaker, you are reminded that  these heroes are so much more: they are mothers and fathers, sons and  daughters, brothers and sisters.    So, Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the  life and service of Sergeant Chris Jenkins and offer up a prayer  tonight that his family find some comfort in their loss.                            ____________________
