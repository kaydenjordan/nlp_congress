 Madam Speaker, Ben Franklin said that necessity never  made a good bargain.   This is necessity. For the first time since 1789, our MAGA GOP  friends are putting us at risk of default.   However, we have a solution, and it is sitting right here, right next  to me. It is a discharge petition, and we only need five of you.   Madam Speaker, I see about 80 of my Democratic colleagues in front of  me, and I only see one Republican, you.   We only need five. So, I welcome you back to Washington. Come on.  Join us. Sign the petition. We will keep the lights on, but will you?                            ____________________
