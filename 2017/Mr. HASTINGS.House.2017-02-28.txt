 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my friend, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to debate the rule for consideration. As my  friend across the aisle has already noted, this rule bundles together  two unrelated pieces of legislation. We are developing a pattern here  of doing that in the Rules Committee.   The first of these is H.J. Res. 83, a Congressional Review Act  resolution of disapproval that seeks to overturn a Department of Labor  rule on workplace injuries, undermining workplace safety and health in  the process.   The second measure is H.R. 998, the SCRUB Act, which establishes a  new commission to review Federal regulations with the aim of needlessly  politicizing and, thereby, undermining the regulatory framework that  keeps our air clean and our water safe to drink.   I note that my friend on the other side of the aisle did not mention  that this commission will cost $30 million for work that last night's  presenter at the Rules Committee said that Congress can do, the  argument being that Congress doesn't have enough staff so we are going  to send it over to nine people and pay $30 million, starting, to have  them do the work that we in Congress should be doing.   Beginning with the CRA resolution--the 14th such resolution  considered by the House this month--the Republican leadership is  continuing its onslaught against well-thought-out and measured  regulations. I get it. Republicans control the House, the Senate, and  the White House. They are desperately trying to ram through their  priorities before anyone notices what they are doing.   It is interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, where the Republican majority  has focused its attention throughout the past month. I can't help but  notice that 40 days into Donald John Trump's administration, he has not  put forth one single jobs measure. Democrats, on the  [[Page H1365]]  other hand, continue to talk about the need for good, well-paying jobs.  The United States Senate put out the Democrats' trillion-dollar jobs  plan that anybody can read on their website on where we stand when it  comes to well-paying jobs.   Yet, as we advocate for our plan to rebuild our Nation's  infrastructure and create over 15 million jobs in the process,  Republicans pass measures to drug-test applicants for unemployment  insurance and repeal rules that require Federal contractors to disclose  violations of Federal labor and worker safety laws.   This resolution repeals a Department of Labor rule pertaining to the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The rule in question  requires employers to keep and maintain accurate records of every  recordable injury and illness in federally mandated logs for a period  of 5 years.   It is worth mentioning that this policy has been upheld in cases  dating back to 1993. The rule, when implemented, added zero new  compliance obligations, zero new reporting obligations, and cost a  total of--you guessed it--zero dollars. Yet, once again, this is what  we are spending our time on this week: repealing a thoughtful rule  designed to protect workers.   I am particularly concerned by this resolution as it actually  jeopardizes workplace safety by allowing employers to avoid penalties  for the underreporting of injuries over many years. Longstanding  workplace hazards will and can certainly be masked.                                time  1230    This makes it less likely that employers or employees will take  corrective actions or that OSHA will find the hazards when they do an  inspection, leaving workers in danger.   It is also worth noting that due to its very small budget, OSHA is  only able to inspect a workplace, on average, once every 140 years. You  heard me correctly, once every 140 years. That makes data even more  important. Yet, by diminishing the reliability of a worksite's injury  data, which some employers systematically underreport, this resolution  also takes away OSHA's ability to protect workers from the most  significant hazards.   Mr. Speaker, throughout the past week, concerned Americans attended  town halls across the country, and for those who were actually able to  meet with their Republican representative in Congress, the  conversations focused on protecting health care, creating jobs, and  protecting the environment. At these meetings, constituents did not ask  for fewer workplace protections, they did not ask for Congress to act  to make it easier for people with severe mental illness to purchase  guns, they didn't ask for Congress to ease disclosure requirements for  oil companies making payments to foreign governments, and yet these are  the things the Republican majority has already chosen to focus on this  month.   Watching the news, I did not hear one person say: if only Congress  would repeal anticorruption rules, undermine my retirement security,  and then allow endangered animals on national wildlife refuges to be  killed using inhumane methods, if only Congress would do these things,  my life would be better. Not one person, Mr. Speaker. Yet, in the past  month, the House voted to do all of the things that I just mentioned. I  submit to the American people watching at home right now that this is  the face of today's Republican Party. Tell me who you think is really  on your side.   Turning our attention to the SCRUB Act, this bill would establish a  $30 million commission with unlimited subpoena authority that is  empowered to dismantle long-established, science-based public health  and safety standards. The SCRUB Act would undermine the ability of  agencies to react to immediate public health threats by adopting the  regulatory CutGo process. The CutGo system is, in my opinion,  completely detached from reality. This requirement will prohibit  agencies from issuing any new rules, even in the case of emergencies or  imminent harm to the public, until they repeal an existing rule to  offset the cost. Along with bills that have already come to the House  floor under this Republican Congress, as well as Donald Trump's  executive actions mandating a regulatory freeze, this legislation  demonstrates a continued attack on standards set in place to protect  American families.   I guess it is not all that surprising that my Republican friends are  pushing through legislation that prioritizes corporate profit over  health and safety of the American people. Whether it is denying access  to women's health care or rolling back environmental protections,  Republicans are making it clear where their allegiances lie. For a  party that prides itself on being anti-red tape, the SCRUB Act  strangely duplicates existing requirements to conduct retrospective  reviews of rules, rules on top of rules on top of rules. Our regulatory  system should work for all American families and encourage companies to  run safe, forward-thinking businesses. This legislation would move us  in the opposite direction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the passion of my friend from Georgia. I would suggest  to him that I am amused that he would get in the weeds in a rather  substantial legal opinion. A portion of it he correctly cited, but he  omitted the continuing part of the judge's remarks that said that,  indeed, you could go back and put forth a resolution.   I find it particularly amusing that my friends on the other side,  after not granting that judge a hearing so that he could become a  Supreme Court Justice, now want to say what a great judge he is and  what a great amount of work he does. Shame on everyone who did not give  him an appropriate hearing. But I understand what it is to steal a  Justice of the Supreme Court, and that is what my friends on the  Republican side did. This judge's opinion continued on to say that you  could establish regulations.   Mr. Speaker, up until now, every President since Gerald Ford has  disclosed his tax return information. These returns have provided a  basic level of transparency that has helped to ensure the public's  interest is placed first. The American people deserve the same level of  disclosure from Donald John Trump. If they continue to refuse to  provide it, it is incumbent upon us, as the people's elected  representatives, to hold the executive branch accountable.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring Representative Anna Eshoo's bill which  would require Presidents and major party nominees for the Presidency to  release their tax returns.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), my good  friend and classmate, to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), my good  friend and classmate, to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This evening, Donald John Trump will address a joint session of  Congress. I expect we will hear some version of the same message we  have heard throughout the first month of his chaotic administration-- talk of jobs and American workers and protecting our country--but that  is all it has been up to now, just talk. Instead of actually doing any  of those things, Republicans are sowing chaos trying to turn their  absurd campaign speeches into something that resembles policy; and,  frankly, that just will not fly.   Donald John Trump's campaign rhetoric doesn't fit the actual  challenges of governing, and I believe my friends on the other side of  the aisle are starting to come to this realization. If they haven't,  may I urge upon them that the rubber is going to hit the road with the  debt ceiling and with tax reform and with repeal and replace of the  Affordable Care Act. I ask the American public to watch the divisions  on the other side when the rubber hits the road.   Mr. Speaker, with every action they take, reality and facts keep  stopping them in their tracks. The un-American Muslim ban was put in  check by the judicial branch. Their attempts to repeal ObamaCare have  been checked by their own constituents at their own townhalls. The  majority needs to wake up and realize that these are not sound  policies, but reckless chaos.   It is past time for the majority to get serious about the serious  business of governing. And yet, with these measures here today, all we  continue to see are antiworker, antienvironment, and, in the final  analysis, anti-American proposals. The American people want solutions,  not a governing party that just checks the box of unrealistic, chaotic,  and harmful campaign promises.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying  measure.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
