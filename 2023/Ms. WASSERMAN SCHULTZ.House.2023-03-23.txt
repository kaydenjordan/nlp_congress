 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  H.R. 5, which we should really call the politics over parents act.   As a mom of three, let me be clear about what this legislation would  do. It opens the door to gagging educators, parents, and students, and  turns classrooms into archaic tools for a vocal extremist minority.   Worse, it undermines what any mother wants for her child, a  supportive classroom space that provides a fact-based education and  practical life skills and critical-thinking skills.   Just look at the colossal education nightmare unfolding in my home  State of Florida right now. Governor DeSantis and his stooge Florida  lawmakers propose prohibiting girls from discussing their menstrual  periods with one another while in school. They are already banning  books, and they are barring certain elements of African-American  history from being taught in school.   Governor DeSantis and his radical allies are also waging a cruel  campaign to marginalize Florida's LGBTQ+ community, and suppress the  histories of others they deem unworthy.   The Republican revival of the Lavender Scare includes shutting down  businesses and passing a ``Don't Say Gay'' law that bans classroom  discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity, even in high  school.   Like a cancer, this hateful law has spread, with Republicans now  censoring educators on a wide variety of topics, so it is no surprise  my colleagues across the aisle want to export these same dangerous  policies across America.   Make no mistake, H.R. 5 undermines teachers, and instead of offering  students more support, it effectively denies it. The result of this law  in Florida has cleared bookshelves and canceled coursework and an AP  exam on African-American history.   As a mother whose children attended public schools, I speak for  millions of moms when I say all we want for our children is a safe  learning environment that ensures they discover the wider world, and  not force them to grow into narrow-minded, ignorant adults.   This legislation just hands a vocal and extreme minority of parents  the power to dictate what every American child learns.   To all my business-friendly Republicans, every classroom move to  censor  [[Page H1365]]  and ban leaves our children even less competitive on the global stage.  Mark my words.   Take it from this mom: We should reject this misguided legislation  and, instead, unite to build classrooms where every child gets the  resources and support they need to succeed in the 21st century.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the First Focus  Campaign for Children.                                                     March 20, 2023.      Hon. Julia Letlow,      Member, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      Chair, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Ranking Member, Committee on Education & the Workforce, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Letlow, Speaker McCarthy, Leader       Jeffries, Chairwoman Foxx, and Ranking Member Scott: I am       writing on behalf of First Focus Campaign for Children, a       bipartisan children's advocacy organization dedicated to       making children and families a priority in federal budget and       policy decisions, to express opposition to H.R. 5, the       Parents Bill of Rights Act. We do not believe this bill       strikes the right balance between the duties of schools, the       rights and responsibilities of parents, and the oft-ignored       but important rights of children.                       Parental Engagement Is Critical         First, let's be clear: Parents are fundamental to the       upbringing of children and absolutely should be engaged and       involved in the education of their children. In fact,       children have better outcomes when their parents are       involved. As a parent of four children myself, I have engaged       with my children's schools by voting in school board       elections, attending all parent-teacher conferences,       volunteering in my children's classrooms, scheduling time to       meet with teachers and administrators when important issues       arise, serving on the PTAs at my children's schools, serving       on athletic booster clubs, and volunteering as an assistant       boys and girls basketball coach for two county schools.        In addition to my personal experiences, I have learned a       great deal over the years from both of my parents, my step-      mother, step-brother, my uncle, and several cousins, who are       all educators. Consequently, I have immense respect for the       work, talent, dedication, and concern that the vast majority       of teachers and educators bring to their profession on a       daily basis--all with the goal of educating our nation's       children to best achieve their hopes and dreams while also       trying to provide a place of safety and compassion for       each and every one of their students.        Again, we strongly support parental engagement in       education, but parents should not control all curriculum and       educational decisions. Doing so is unworkable.        For example, imagine an elementary school of 500 students       where 12 parents oppose the teaching of evolution, 8 parents       believe the early is flat, 21 are Holocaust deniers, 14       oppose learning about slavery, 7 believe in racial       segregation, 17 believe in the concept of schools without       walls, 27 believe in corporal punishment, 12 want Harry       Potter books to be banned, 25 want books banned that mention       the Trail of Tears, 31 believe parents should be allowed to       overrule a physician's decision that a child with a       concussion should refrain from participating in sports, 39       oppose keeping kids out of school when they have the flu, 4       believe that a child with cancer might be contagious, 34       believe students should be ``tracked'' in all subject areas,       12 believe students should not be taught how to spell the       words ``sinal tap'', ``quarantine'', or ``isolation'' because       they are too ``scary of words''. 41 don't like the bus       routes, 45 want a vegan-only lunchroom, 4 demand same-sex       classrooms, etc. Even though most parents oppose these       demands by some parents and many of them are completely       false, undermine the purpose of education, threaten the       safety of children, or promote discrimination, H.R. 5 would       seek to push their accommodation in some form.                     The Real Parents Agenda for Children         We must all do better by our kids.        By an overwhelming 77-11 percent margin, a May 2022 poll by       Lake Research Partners found that parents believe ``policy       involving children should always be governed by a `best       interest of the child' standard.'' By a 60-19 percent margin,       the American people believe we are spending too little as       opposed to too much on public education. And when it comes in       investing in children, 9-in-10 voters (90-7 percent) agreed       with the statement that ``investing in children helps improve       their lives, development, and outcomes.''        When it comes to children's policy overall, a nationwide       survey by Global Strategy Group in February 2023 found that       American voters have strong priorities in favor of ``creating       more effective childcare options for all families'' (87-8       percent), ``expanding family and medical leave'' (82-12       percent), bringing back the improved Child Tax Credit (76-13       percent), and ``expanding universal preschool for all 3- and       4-year-olds'' (73-16 percent). The support for this agenda       stands in sharp contrast to the opposition that American       voters express to an agenda that would call for ``passing       legislation banning transgender-focused health care options       for young Americans'' (41-47 percent), ``banning books that       some parents find to have questionable content'' (32-57       percent), and ``banning high school classes like AP African-      American history'' (21-68 percent).                     Children Have Fundamental Rights Too         Before diving into the details of H.R. 5, it is important       to acknowledge that children need the support BY parents and       government to be successful, and that they also sometimes       need protection FROM parents and government.        The fact is that children have unique and fundamental human       rights that should not be ignored or dismissed. These include       the right to an education, the right to health care, the       right to be protected from abuse and violence at home and in       schools, the right to be protected from gun violence and       school shootings, the right to not be discriminated against       because of their race, ethnicity, gender (including gender       identity and sexual orientation), economic status,       disability, religion, immigration status, or age.        As for parental rights and H.R. 5's attempts to modify the       Protection of Pupil Rights Act (PPRA) and the Family       Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), it is important to       highlight that PPRA was originally enacted nearly 50 years       ago (in 1974) and has been modified several times, including       in 1978, 1994, and 2002, in order to broaden access and       consent requirements.     H.R. 5 Adds New Bureaucracy to Schools and Detracts from the Time,                Attention, and Funding Dedicated to Students         While the impetus for aspects of H.R. 5 are well-      intentioned, our first concern is that the language is       duplicative of language already in federal law, policies in       state law, and general practice by school districts all       across this country in many respects but also potentially       adds new bureaucracy and red tape to schools and school       districts all across this for no apparent benefit.        Unfortunately, these proposed changes may potentially harm       children. Any funding, time, and attention that is shifted       away from students and their learning toward added       bureaucracy and red tape can be detrimental to students. But       H.R. 5 provides no funding to address the many newly imposed       bureaucratic requirements upon schools.        For example, H.R. 5 proposes new reporting requirements for       schools to include in their ``local educational agency report       card'' a budget that is detailed ``for each elementary school       and secondary school served by the local educational       agency.'' Requiring detailed accounting of costs, some of       which are shared across school campuses (e.g., school nurses,       bus drivers, etc.), for the more than 90,000 public schools       across this country will likely greatly increase the       employment of accountants. However, H.R. 5 does not provide       funding to pay for such a mandate. Before proceeding, we       should acknowledge that this newly-imposed mandate detracts       from the funding, time, and attention school districts and       educators have for improving the education and well-being of       children.        First Focus Campaign for Children supports tracking funding       that is allocated for children's programs as a share of       government spending, and thus, annually produce a Children's       Budget that analyzes the funding of more than 250 federal       programs. We share this report with Congress to raise the       awareness and transparency of funding for children. However,       we would urge Congress to focus as many of those dollars as       possible on the children themselves and not on excessive       accounting and reporting measures that consume much of the       attention and focus of H.R. 5.      H.R. 5 Promotes Book Bans Rather Than Access to Books and Reading         Another important concern is language from Sec. 104 and       Sec. 202 that would require schools to share with all parents       of students at every school ``a list of books and other       reading materials available to the students of such school in       the school library.'' Again, compiling, cataloging, and       sharing such information to all parents would come at great       time and expense that is not paid for by H.R. 5. That money       and time would come at the expense of librarians and other       educators focused on the education of children. Parents       already have the right to visit their child's school and its       library, to request such information, and to ask their own       children what they are learning and reading in school.        Rather than adding the burdens of more bureaucracy and red       tape to schools and creating a chilling effect through       increasing incidences of censorship and book bans, we should       be working together to pass legislation to encourage students       to read and learn through greater access to books, such as       Reach Out and Read, First Book, Reading Is Fundamental, and       other literacy programs. An individual parent should not       solely be allowed to object to a book and cause its       censorship for all of the children in a school or school       district. This violates the parental rights of the vast       majority of parents who do not support book bans or       censorship.        Even more importantly, it violates the fundamental rights       of children. As Justice  [[Page H1366]]       Abe Fortas wrote in his majority opinion in Tinker v. Des       Moines Independent School District (1969):        Students in school as well as out of school are ``persons''       under our Constitution. They are possessed of fundamental       rights which the State must respect, just as they themselves       must respect their obligations to the State . . . In the       absence of a specific showing of constitutionally valid       reasons to regulate their speech, students are entitled to       freedom of expression of their views.        Justice Fortas adds:        It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers       shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or       expression at the schoolhouse gate.        In the Supreme Court case Island Trees School District v.       Pico (1982), the Court ruled that children have a fundamental       right to an education and access to learning that is not       limited by the censorship of books based on ``narrowly       partisan or political'' grounds. As Justice William Brennan       writes:        Our Constitution does not permit the official suppression       of ideas. Thus, whether petitioners' removal of books from       their school libraries denied respondents their First       Amendment rights depends upon the motivation behind       petitioners' actions. If petitioners intended by their       removal decision to deny respondents access to ideas with       which petitioners disagreed, and if this intent was the       decisive factor in petitioners' decisions, then petitioners       have exercised their discretion in violation of the       Constitution.   H.R. 5 Threatens Access to Health Care, Privacy, and Confidentiality of                                  Students         Concern about access to health care for our children leads       us to oppose the language in H.R. 5 with respect to school       health. There were more than 4 million children in this       country that were uninsured in 2020. In 2016, the Children's       Health Fund estimated that over 20 million children lacked       ``sufficient access to essential health care.''        Therefore, the role of school based health clinics, school       nurses, school counselors, coaches, social workers, and       physical trainers in schools is critically important to the       health, education, and well-being of children. The language       in H.R. 5 appears to dramatically expands the potential       incidences in which all of these school personnel would have       to seek out parental notification and consent prior to       performing care, such as to check whether a student has a       fever, has an ankle sprain, may have experienced a       concussion, or need to check for a possible broken bone. In       many cases, these may not be considered emergencies, but in       the meantime, children languish or must wait while school       personnel spend large amounts of time trying to track down       parents for consent.        In the report accompanying H.R. 5, the House Education and       Workforce Committee majority write, ``Americans should never       be forced to relinquish these parental rights to government--      whether that involves curriculum decisions or personal       medical choices'' (emphasis added).        We strongly disagree.        First, such a statement would threaten the health, safety,       and lives of some children in our country. For example, based       on that statement, does the Committee majority reject the       ability of schools to set graduation requirements? Oppose the       teaching of evolution? Allow parents to send children to       school even if they are vomiting, have a fever, diarrhea, or       have a communicable disease? Does the Committee majority now       oppose school vaccine mandates? School concussion protocols?
