 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to show my appreciation for the  wildland firefighters who are working to protect communities and, most  importantly, lives throughout Utah.   Many of these firefighters are the same men and women who risk their  lives to protect our homes and businesses every day in our towns and  communities across Utah.   This fire season has been one of the worst in recent memory,  including six active fires that have consumed over 85,000 acres of  land. The Dollar Ridge Fire, located in Duchesne and Wasatch Counties,  has consumed over 50,000 acres alone. I drove by this fire last week  and saw the devastation firsthand, unable to fully imagine the  heartbreak families experience as they watch the fire approach their  homes and their livelihoods.   While combating these dangerous situations, wildland firefighters put  themselves in harm's way to keep others safe. They work in extreme heat  and unpleasant conditions to protect our communities. I will continue  to support strong funding for the fire suppression-related activities  that these firefighters rely on.   Today, it is important that they receive the recognition that they  undoubtedly deserve. Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking the  wildland firefighters of Utah for their continued bravery in keeping  Utahns safe.                           Helping Small Businesses     Mr. Speaker, today, I am pleased to introduce the Small  Business Access to Capital and Efficiency Act, also known as Small  Business ACE Act.   As a member of the Small Business Committee and a former small  business owner myself, I am proud to introduce a bill that will help  reduce burdensome and conflicting regulations that are keeping small  businesses from growth and access to capital.   The Small Business Administration's 504 loan program helps small  business owners grow their company and stimulate job creation, at no  expense to taxpayers. Many favorite businesses like Magleby's  Restaurant, Market Street Grill, Chobani Yogurt, FatBoys Ice Cream, and  so many more, have expanded operations and hired new employees because  of the SBA loan program.   I love hearing the success stories of businesses like Premier  Building Supply located in Lindon, Utah, a company that started in a  garage back in 2009. Since then, Premier has quickly become a leader in  supplying the Utah building industry and, with the help of an SBA 504  loan, has now grown into a 50,000-square foot facility with 150  employees.   This is just one example of the many small businesses in Utah that  have great potential for tremendous success if they have access to  capital. However, as we see far too often, the Federal Government has  maintained burdensome and conflicting regulations that weigh down the  504 program with uncertainty, and ultimately hurt the very businesses  it was meant to help.                                time  1030    The Small Business ACE Act will eliminate and harmonize conflicting  Federal regulations burdening the program to ensure small businesses  more efficiently have access to capital without costing the taxpayer a  single dollar.  [[Page H6119]]    I am grateful to have the support of Chairman Chabot and stakeholders  like NADCO, Mountain West Small Business Finance, and Utah CDC, who  know better than anyone just how critical the 504 program is.   I am squarely on the side of helping small businesses and am  committed to keeping the Federal Government from getting in the way of  their success. I believe the Small Business ACE Act is a great step in  the right direction, and I encourage my colleagues to support this  commonsense bill.                            ____________________
