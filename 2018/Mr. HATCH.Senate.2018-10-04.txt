 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, nearly 3 months ago, I came to the Senate  floor for the first time to support President Trump's nomination of  Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. Here is what I had to say at  that time:         Judge Kavanaugh is among the most distinguished and most       influential judges in the entire country. The Supreme Court       has adopted the positions in his opinions no less than 11       times. He has authored multiple dissents that ultimately       prevailed in the Supreme Court.        He has taught courses at Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown.        It bears mention, liberal and conservative justices alike       have hired his former clerks, which shows the respect he has       across the ideological spectrum.        Truly, there is no one more qualified and more prepared to       serve on the Supreme Court than Brett Kavanaugh.    A lot has transpired in the last 3 months. We have received and  reviewed more documents for Judge Kavanaugh than for any other Supreme  Court nominee in our Nation's history. We have had 5 days of public  hearings. Judge Kavanaugh has answered more than 1,300 written  questions--more questions than all previous Supreme Court nominees  combined.   We have had protesters in halls and hearing rooms and elevators. We  have even seen the miraculous return of Spartacus, and we have had the  lowest, most vile, most dishonest attempt at character assassination I  have ever seen in my whole 42 years of service in the Senate.   We may never know who leaked reports of Dr. Ford's allegations to the  press. We do know it was someone in the Democratic orbit. This was  followed by the most appalling smear campaign imaginable. No accusation  was too heinous, no claim too far-fetched.   My Democratic colleagues like to pretend that Judge Kavanaugh's  understandable indignation at last week's hearing was a reaction only  to Dr. Ford's allegations but, of course, that is not the case. In the  days immediately preceding that hearing, Judge Kavanaugh was accused of  drugging women, of sexual assault, and even of gang rape.   Judge Kavanaugh told the committee investigators it was like the  twilight zone. I sure wish my Democratic colleagues would stop trying  to rewrite history to excise the slew of garbage they unleashed on  Judge Kavanaugh and the American people, and I hope they will start  talking to their friends on the outside and start acting like Americans  again and quit this kind of divisive activity.   I would like to say a word here about Dr. Ford. It is clear now that  we will never know what happened 36 years ago. Dr. Ford offered a  moving account of what she says happened between her and Judge  Kavanaugh back when they were teenagers. Judge Kavanaugh, in turn,  offered a forceful, impassioned rebuttal of her claims. Some have  criticized Judge Kavanaugh for being too forceful in his response. My  gosh, if that were me, I would be even more forceful than he was, to  have false accusations like that, especially at this particular time in  this process.   Interestingly, almost without exception, these critics had announced  their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh even before Dr. Ford's allegations  were leaked to the press. So let's not pretend these critics are  neutral observers.   In any event, Judge Kavanaugh's indignation at what he clearly  believes are false and unjust accusations was both understandable and,  in my view, entirely proper.   Dr. Ford's allegations are serious. If true, they should disqualify  Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the Supreme Court. But neither Dr. Ford  nor her attorneys nor any member of news media has been able to provide  any corroboration for her claims. To the contrary, every alleged  eyewitness or partygoer she has named has either denied her allegations  or failed to corroborate them. This includes her lifelong friend Leland  Keyser, whom Dr. Ford says was present at the party that night. Ms.  Keyser says that not only does she not remember such a gathering ever  taking place but that she does not even know Judge Kavanaugh.   Questions have been raised in recent days about certain elements of  Dr. Ford's testimony.   She says she first told others that Judge Kavanaugh had attacked her  around the time of a house remodel to add a second front door to her  home, but permit records show that the door was added 4 years prior to  her first alleged mention of Judge Kavanaugh.   She testified that she had never given advice on how to take a  polygraph test. A former boyfriend of hers, however, disputes that  statement.   Dr. Ford has also offered inconsistent accounts of when the attack  took place and how many people were present at that party.   There are other aspects of her story that are also confusing. She  does not remember where or when the attack took place, but she  remembers with crystal clarity how much alcohol she had consumed. This  appears to be the only fact unrelated to the alleged attack that she is  able to recall with certainty.   Dr. Ford also testified that after the attack, she ran out of the  party. The location of the party had to be some distance from her home.  She was too young to drive, so she would have had to have gotten a ride  home, but she does not recall who drove her home. And given that this  was long before the era of cell phones, it is unclear how she would  have contacted someone to come pick her up after she ran out of the  party.   Even more puzzling, her good friend, Ms. Keyser, apparently never  asked Dr. Ford why she disappeared from the party.   Given that there is no corroborating evidence for Dr. Ford's claims,  all we have to go on is her story. Although not dispositive, the  questions and inconsistencies and puzzling aspects that I have just  outlined call into question the reliability of her account. This is  simply not enough to conclude that Judge Kavanaugh is guilty of the  heinous act Dr. Ford alleges. It flies in the face of the life he has  lived as a judge and how effective he has been as a judge on the second  highest court in the land.   Against the thinness of Dr. Ford's accusations, we have an entire  lifetime of good works and honorable public service by Judge Kavanaugh.  We have received dozens of letters and hundreds of people attesting to  Judge Kavanaugh's good character and unimpeachable credentials. His  clerks, students, and former colleagues have all praised him as a man  of the highest integrity. He has made the promotion and encouragement  of women lawyers a focus of his time on the bench. He volunteers in his  community and mentors young athletes. This is a good man. He is a very  good man, and he does not deserve this kind of treatment or behavior.  What Dr. Ford alleges is entirely out of character with the entire  course of Judge Kavanaugh's life.   The recent sideshow stories about his drinking habits in high  school--my gosh--and college over 30 years ago from people who never  liked him in the first place are just a distraction. That this  confirmation process has turned into a feeding frenzy about how nice  Judge Kavanaugh was to his freshman roommate is an embarrassment.    That said, the Senate has taken these allegations seriously, as we  should. We invited Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh to testify, and they  did so. Committee investigators spoke with numerous individuals who  said they  [[Page S6514]]  had relevant information to share. The committee also took statements  under penalty of felony from the alleged witnesses Dr. Ford named.   In addition, the FBI recently completed a supplemental background  check of Judge Kavanaugh, and the FBI found no corroborating evidence  for any of the recent allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. Let me  repeat that. The FBI found no corroborating evidence for any of the  recent allegations against him--not a single piece of corroborating  evidence.   Now that the FBI has found no corroborating evidence, some of my  Democratic colleagues shamefully have taken to calling into question  the credibility of the FBI and its investigators. These attacks are  irresponsible, to say the least. Indeed, contrary to what my Democratic  colleagues have said, the FBI conducted a thorough, professional, and  expeditious investigation. The FBI talked to the people it needed to  talk to. What agents did not do is talk to someone who says he talked  to someone more than 30 years ago who now doesn't remember seeing  anything. They didn't investigate whether Judge Kavanaugh was, in fact,  spotted near a punch bowl at a high school party, and they were right  not to do so. An FBI investigation is not a wild goose chase.   Some of my Democratic colleagues are also complaining that the FBI  did not interview Dr. Ford or Judge Kavanaugh during the supplemental  investigation. Well, Dr. Ford testified in a public hearing for nearly  3 hours. She told the committee that she had given us all of the  information she could remember. The FBI does not need to repeat  questions that have already been asked and answered, particularly when  a person has already said she shared everything she can remember.   Judge Kavanaugh, likewise, testified publicly at the hearing. He also  spent several hours answering questions from committee investigators  under penalty of felony on several different occasions. He has been  thoroughly interrogated under oath in public and in private about these  allegations.   Some of my Senate Judiciary Committee colleagues made the unfortunate  choice last night to smear Judge Kavanaugh with yet another piece of  innuendo. Eight members of the committee sent a letter in which they  incorrectly implied that the six previous background checks on Judge  Kavanaugh contained information concerning sexual improprieties or  alcohol abuse. In so doing, they took advantage of rules that protect  the confidentiality of witnesses to score cheap political points.   Although we should all be disquieted by my colleagues' unscrupulous  conduct, the American people can rest assured that no such information  exists. If it did, Democrats would have raised it before now. Of that,  we can certainly be certain. Indeed, after weeks of nonstop mudslinging  and attempted character assassination by Senate Democrats and their  media allies, no one--no one--has been able to find any charge against  Judge Kavanaugh that sticks. And you can believe they have tried. Boy,  can you believe they have tried. This has been the worst example of the  Washington smear machine that I have seen in all my 42 years of Senate  service.   So we are left back where we were before this whole sordid saga  began. Judge Kavanaugh is eminently qualified, unquestionably  qualified, to serve on our Nation's highest Court. He is among the most  distinguished, influential judges in the entire country. His opinions  have received widespread acclaim and have won approval by the Supreme  Court on multiple occasions--multiple occasions. The American Bar  Association interviewed more than 100 fellow judges and lawyers who  know Judge Kavanaugh and who have appeared before him, and they all  spoke with virtual unanimity in praising his integrity, his work  product, and his judicial temperament.   As somebody who tried cases in Federal court, I would have been happy  to have had Judge Kavanaugh, who I know would give a fair shake to both  sides. He is the kind of a judge I would have admired in every way, and  I do, but I would have admired him in every way as a practicing trial  lawyer who had quite significant experience.   I hold the highest rating, the ABA rating from Martindale-Hubbell,  which is the rating service that rates attorneys without their  knowledge by going to other top lawyers in their area. I have had that  highest rating in two States--in Pennsylvania and in Utah. So I take  these matters very seriously. I believe in the Federal courts. I think  they do a terrific job in this country. I have nothing but admiration  for them. There are very few exceptions. And I think it is just a  terrible, ridiculous problem that has arisen here because people are  playing politics with this judge and this judgeship.   I am sorry that Judge Kavanaugh has had to go through this ordeal. He  did not deserve this. He is a good man. He spent decades building a  reputation of decency and fairness. His opponents have attempted to  destroy it with 3 weeks of smut and unsubstantiated allegations. It  makes me sick to see this type of stuff. It certainly does when some of  my colleagues buy into it, which they shouldn't. They should not.   I know Brett Kavanaugh. I know him well. He is a man of great  resilience and firm conviction. He is going to be a great Justice-- perhaps one of the greatest we have ever had. He will bring to the  Supreme Court the integrity, honor, and intellectual rigor he has  demonstrated throughout his entire career. And soon enough, he will  have rebuilt his reputation. He will earn the respect of his colleagues  and the American people through his writings and his decisions--of  that, I have no doubt.   I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. He is unquestionably  qualified. He has gone through the most thorough vetting process I have  ever seen. It has been a miserable, retched process in some respects,  but he has come through, and we all give him credit for that. Hundreds  of thousands of documents produced. Five days of hearings. Seven FBI  background checks. We know what we need to know. The American people  know what they need to know.   It is time to vote. It is time to confirm this good man to the U.S.  Supreme Court, and I hope this body will get to that decision-making  process as soon as it can. It is time to end this charade. It is time  to back this really good man. I predict he will make one of the great  Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.   I am grateful to my colleagues who have given him the benefit of the  doubt and who know him and know these things are not true.  I am  grateful for the privilege of serving in the Senate. I sure hate to end  my service with further smears to a good man like Judge Kavanaugh.    I yield the floor.
