 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  congratulate the Honorable Mike McIntyre, former Member of the House  from 1997 to 2015  [[Page H3249]]  for his induction into the University of North Carolina's Order of the  Golden Fleece, the oldest and highest honor society at UNC, where Mike  received both a bachelor of arts and a juris doctorate.   After graduating from UNC law, Mike practiced as an attorney in his  hometown of Lumberton until he was elected to Congress in 1996. During  his 18 years representing Robeson County and other parts of  southeastern North Carolina, Congressman McIntyre acquired a reputation  for excellent constituent service and advocacy for rural communities,  including his work on the Agriculture Committee and his coauthoring the  landmark Tobacco Buyout legislation, as well as fighting for full  Federal recognition of the Lumbee.   For Mike, country over party was not just a slogan, it was his  approach to leadership. I am honored not only to carry on his work  serving the rural southern Piedmont of North Carolina, but also to  strive to emulate his example as I do so.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mike on this appropriate recognition.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
