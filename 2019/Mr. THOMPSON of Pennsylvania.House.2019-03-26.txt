 Mr. Speaker, this week, our Nation  celebrates Public Schools Week. It is a time when we acknowledge the  diversity and success of our public schools and the sound education  that they provide. Strengthening America's public schools is the best  way to ensure our children's future success and our country's  prosperity.   Ninety percent of American children attend public schools. This week,  supporters across the country will share stories of the many schools,  students, and professionals who make public schools such vital  components of our communities. This includes parents who are working  hard to improve educational outcomes for children. Advocates nationwide  will share scores of stories about public school students and their  successes.   Mr. Speaker, public school teachers truly make a difference in the  lives of our students. They prepare them for bright and successful  futures. It is  [[Page H2801]]  their dedication to our students that builds strong public schools and,  therefore, strong communities.   As a senior member of the Education and Labor Committee and a product  of public schools, I know the incredible role our schools play in  communities across the Nation.   Public schools today have much good news to share, from increasing  graduation rates and reduced dropout rates, to improved ratings given  by communities on school performance.   Public schools welcome every child, regardless of ability, race,  wealth, language, country of origin, or needs. By strengthening the  public school system, we strengthen the democracy of our country.   Supporting public schools today will build a stronger workforce for  tomorrow. The future of our Nation to produce in the manufacturing  industry, the farm, and the information age will be based on the  investment we make today in supporting public schools. Schools today  are integrating the new ideas that are being explored by businesses and  industry.   Strong public schools are vital to our national security. Our  military's success is dependent on members who can apply their  knowledge and skills to navigate the increasingly complex tools that  keep our country safe.   In many communities, the school district is the largest employer.  Teachers, bus drivers, administrators, cafeteria workers, coaches, and  facilities management all depend on the school district, and all these  jobs contribute to the fabric of a community. Communities are stronger  and schools are better when we all work together to support public  education.   Public schools also make sure kids receive at least one nutritious  meal a day. More than 30 million school lunches are served each day,  including 20 million free and 2 million reduced priced lunches. For  some students, the only meal that they receive will be the one that  they get at school.   Mr. Speaker, a child's opportunity for success should not be left to  chance. Every child needs a quality, well-equipped school right in  their neighborhood, where they can learn, be inspired, and thrive.   Public education has always been the great equalizer in the United  States. I am grateful for the contribution of our public schools, and I  know that, together, we will continue to work to strengthen them for  our most precious resource: our children.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak  about the essential role community health centers play in neighborhoods  throughout the Nation.   America's health centers serve 28 million patients who have the  greatest difficulty accessing healthcare. This includes 24.9 million  low-income patients; 3.5 million patients in or near public housing;  1.4 million homeless patients; nearly 1 million patients who work in  agriculture; and 6.2 million uninsured patients.   Madam Speaker, community health centers are located in areas of high  need and are open to everyone, regardless of insurance status or  ability to pay.   Congress recently made historic investments to the Health Center  Program, which increased access, expanded services, and improved  quality.   Health centers also play an important role in rural America where the  need is great, but services are often scarce.   And, each year, community health centers generate approximately $54  billion in economic activity and save the healthcare system an  estimated $24 billion within our most underserved communities.   Madam Speaker, we must ensure that all Americans receive the services  they need, regardless of where they live, and community health centers  do that.                            ____________________
