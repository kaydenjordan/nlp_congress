 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support  of the fiscal year 2018 appropriations measure before us today. The  committee, as the chairman said, has worked at a historic pace to  produce a bill that reflects the priorities of the American people.  Chairman Frelinghuysen should be recognized for his leadership in  bringing this legislation through committee and before the House in  record time.    While the entirety of the package should be supported, I want to  highlight, Mr. Chairman, the funding provided for the Department of  State and Foreign Operations. This portion of the bill reduces  international diplomatic and development programs by $10 billion, a 17  percent reduction from fiscal year '17. In a tough budget environment,  the bill strikes a delicate balance between fiscal responsibility and  support for continued U.S. leadership and foreign aid.   First and foremost, over $6 billion is allocated for embassy  security, which will enable the State Department to safeguard American  diplomatic facilities overseas, in line with the recommendations of the  Benghazi Accountability Review Board.   Second, the bill contains $8.4 billion for security assistance to  support key U.S. allies and partners. The U.S.-Israel Memorandum of  Understanding is fully funded at $3.1 billion. The bill also maintains  foreign military financing for Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia; and it increases  security assistance for Ukraine, and provides extra support for other  countries facing Russian aggression.   In our own hemisphere, the bill will help counter transnational  criminal organizations and the flow of illegal drugs by supporting our  partnerships with Colombia, Central America, and Mexico.   Third, the bill promotes American values around the world by  maintaining funding for key democracy programs.   Fourth, the bill continues our country's strong tradition of helping  the most vulnerable, providing $8.3 billion for global health programs  and over $5.9 billion for humanitarian assistance. At the same time,  the bill protects and preserves life by embracing an expanded Mexico  City policy, prohibiting funding for the U.N. Population Fund, and  continuing all pro-life riders carried in prior House bills.   Finally, at a time when we must remain focused on balancing Federal  spending, this bill eliminates many programs, aims to improve oversight  [[Page H6837]]  and management, and makes our government more accountable. No funds are  provided for President Obama's Global Climate Change Initiative.  Funding for the U.N. is reduced by $900 million, and international  banks and financial institutions are cut by over $800 million.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chairman, this legislation advances both  our national security and economic interests. I urge support for the  bill.                                time  1645
