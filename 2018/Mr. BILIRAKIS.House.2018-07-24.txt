 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a group of  unsung heroes who help keep our country and communities safe.   Public safety aircrews fly every day across the Nation to ensure the  safety of our domestic airspace, often in very hazardous conditions.  They also support first responders during disaster response and rescue  missions throughout the country.   We honor the commitment of those public servants, both past and  present, and recognize that some have made the ultimate sacrifice. It  is only fitting that a day be set aside to honor the thousands of  public servants, both past and present, who have served.   To this end, I introduce H. Res. 991, to recognize June 26 of each  year as National Public Safety Aviation Day.                            ____________________
