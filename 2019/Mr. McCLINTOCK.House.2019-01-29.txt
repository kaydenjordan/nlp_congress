 Mr. Speaker, I believe the President's decision to  temporarily resolve the shutdown was the correct one. The Democrats'  refusal even to discuss a path forward had created a crisis of  governance, in addition to our ongoing crisis on the southern border.   The President had offered many compromises to the Democrats. He  reduced his funding request, altered the design, and added nearly $1  billion of humanitarian aid. Yet, the Democrats spurned all of these  good faith overtures.   When the President invited congressional Democrats to the Oval Office  to hear their views, they refused to go. They had plenty of time to  vacation in Puerto Rico with 100 lobbyists during the shutdown, but  they couldn't seem to fit a simple meeting with the President into  their busy schedules in order to resolve it.   Based on their past behavior, I am skeptical their position will  change over the next 3 weeks.   They tell us there is no crisis. Well, the facts speak for  themselves. Between 16 million and 29 million people now are living  illegally in the United States, costing American taxpayers well over  $100 billion a year to support. Sixty thousand more are illegally  crossing our border every month. In 2017, illegal aliens murdered 1,800  Americans and violently assaulted 48,000 more.   The congressional Democrats who oppose the President's wall insist  that they support border security, but they say a wall is a costly and  ineffective way to stop illegal immigration. Well, it is hard to take  either of their claims seriously.   These same politicians have long advocated for providing a wide range  of services for illegal immigrants, ranging from healthcare and legal  counsel to education and housing, all at taxpayer expense. It is hard  to believe they want to discourage illegal immigration while they  reward those who illegally immigrate.   The Democrats long ago ceased to call illegal immigration what it is:  illegal. Many have gone so far as to advocate abolishing the agencies  that defend our borders and enforce our immigration laws. They have  enacted sanctuary laws that protect dangerous criminals from  deportation. They have opposed mandatory employment verification to  hold employers accountable for hiring illegals. And they have opposed  visa tracking of foreign nationals entering our country.   They tell us that walls are medieval and what we really need are  sophisticated cameras. Well, we don't want to watch them crossing our  border; we want to stop them.   Walls have been used for thousands of years to impede unauthorized  entry for one reason: They work, and they still work. When Israel built  a 143-mile wall to protect its southern border, illegal immigration  fell 99 percent. The cost of building a wall is a fraction of the cost  incurred by American citizens every year to support the illegal  population already in our country.   It doesn't address the whole problem, but a wall would be a  tremendous force multiplier for border enforcement agencies. It would  protect them from the violent attacks to which they are constantly  subjected and allow them to apply their slender resources more  efficiently and effectively.   If the Democrats continue to oppose serious measures to defend our  borders and enforce our laws, I urge the President to use the authority  Congress granted in 1976 to reprogram already appropriated but  unobligated military construction funds for the defense of our Nation.  What is more fundamental to national defense than the security and  integrity of our own borders?   Some argue that this would divert money from other Defense Department  projects. Well, it is an odd logic that argues that defending the Iraqi  border is more important than defending our own.   Others have worried that a Presidential order would provoke a  protracted legal challenge. Isn't that true of any course the President  could take?   Others worry that leftist activists would misuse this precedent.  Well, let me ask you: When have such activists  [[Page H1248]]  ever relied on precedent to expand their power?   Using this authority would not only build the wall, it would avoid  the need to meet any demands to further diminish or dilute our current  immigration laws.   If the next 3 weeks produce the unreasonable demands and  intransigence that we have come to expect from the Democratic  leadership, I strongly urge the President to use his existing  authority. Countries that either cannot or will not enforce their  borders simply aren't around very long. Let that not be America's  epitaph                            ____________________
