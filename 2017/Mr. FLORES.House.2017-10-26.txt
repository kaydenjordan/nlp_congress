 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Black and her committee  for all the great work that they have done in putting forth a budget  that moves America in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I have been astounded by the rhetoric that we have heard  from the other side for a plan that they haven't really seen. They are  making up their facts as they go along to suit their wishes.   Mr. Speaker, I support the fiscal year 2018 budget resolution. While  I think the Senate's version falls far short of the great work we did  in the House and our budget, it is still the key thing that we need to  have to move forward with tax reform for the American people.   Our tax reform plan includes tax cuts for the working class Americans  who have been struggling for the last several years under a broken Tax  Code.   It also makes America's businesses the most competitive in the world  instead of having to struggle with the world's least competitive tax  system.   Mr. Speaker, in summary, this budget provides a way for a tax plan  that provides for bigger paychecks, more jobs, a stronger economy, and  a balanced budget. I strongly urge our colleagues to support this  budget.                                time  1000
