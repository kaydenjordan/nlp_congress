 Mr. President, I am glad to have the opportunity to talk  for a bit on the floor of the U.S. Senate on U.S. policy toward China  because there has been no better friend for Chinese interests likely in  our lifetime than President Donald J. Trump.   Articles suggest that when you survey Chinese Communist Party  leaders, they are, to a person, rooting for the reelection of this  President. I don't need to go through the litany of ways in which China  has become more influential and more powerful all around the world  because of this administration's policies, but at the top of that list  is the abdication of the United States' traditional leadership role on  human rights, which has allowed the Communist Party to march on the  Uighurs and others. It is a failed trade policy that has allowed China  to extend its influence into places like Africa and throughout the Silk  Road. It is America's break with Europe that has shattered our ability  to negotiate together the future rules of the economic order.   But what China is really ecstatic about is this President's  performance since March in the wake of a virus that now shows the  United States as having 25 percent of the world's COVID cases while  having only 4 percent of the world's population.   My friend Senator Blackburn recited the early moments of this virus  outbreak in China, and she is right that China was nontransparent and  unhelpful in those early days. But do you know who the greatest  cheerleader for China was in the first 2 to 3 months of COVID-19's  outbreak there? President Donald Trump. On 45 occasions he went on  social media or gave statements to the press in which he lauded China's  response. He talked about how transparent they were and how they were  doing a great job. The world community couldn't put pressure on China  to open up with respect to what they knew about the virus in large part  because the leader of the Nation's most powerful country was doing the  bidding of the Chinese Government.   The second thing that this President has done that makes China very,  very pleased is to essentially make the argument for the Chinese that  the autocratic model that they are perfecting is the best method by  which to organize society around the world, because they say: Listen,  we got this virus under control in a matter of months, and the world's  greatest democracy is still dealing with an epidemic that looks to be  raging newly out of control. So as we engage in this broad fight  between models of governance, our inability--this administration's  inability--to get this virus under control is maybe the greatest gift  that this President has given to China.   Here is what makes it so unconscionable: We know that democracy is  inefficient. We know that capital markets can sometimes be inefficient  when pressed up against the wall by emergencies. So we built into the  statutes of the United States emergency powers to give to this  President--to any President--so that when they are faced with an  emergency, they can cure some of the inefficiencies of democracy.   We are on the floor today--Senators Baldwin, Stabenow, Brown, and I-- to talk about one particular power this President has. It is an act  called the Defense Production Act, and it allows the President during  moments of emergency to commandeer parts of the manufacturing supply  chain in this country to make sure we are making everything we need in  order to repel a foreign invader. Sometimes that may be an army, but in  this case it is a pathogen.   What we have known from the very beginning is that there was no way  for this country to have enough personal protective equipment--masks,  face shields, gowns, and gloves--and there was no way for this country  to be able to have enough tests to know who has it so that we can track  it and get rid of it without the Federal Government stepping up and  utilizing the Defense Production Act.   Twenty percent of nursing homes today have less than a week's supply  of PPE.   Doctors at one hospital in Houston, where the outbreak is raging out  of control, are being told to wear their N95 masks for 15 days in a row  when it is recommended for a single use.  [[Page S4382]]    The national strategic stockpile once had 82 million gloves. Today  they have less than 1 million.   Guess what. It is going to get worse. More people need to be tested.  Schools are about to reopen. The superintendent of the 100,000-student  Jefferson County school district in Louisville, KY, says that he needs  $10 million to order face masks alone. It is going to cost schools  across this country $25 billion to purchase medical supplies, and these  medical supplies are going up in price because the supply is so low. We  have a solution: the Defense Production Act.   We also don't have enough tests. It now takes 7 to 10 to 14 days to  get a test back. In Connecticut, it used to take just 1 day. You can't  beat this virus if you don't get results for 7 to 10 days. That person  who gets tested goes out and spreads it during that time.   James Davis from Quest Diagnostics said:         We would double our capacity tomorrow . . . but it's not       the labs that are the bottleneck. [It] is our ability to get       physical machines and . . . our ability to feed those       machines with chemical reagents.    That is equipment that could be produced in the United States if the  President took control of the manufacturing supply chain--not forever,  but to the extent of this crisis.   So the Medical Supply Transparency and Delivery Act, which Senator  Baldwin and my colleagues will talk more about, essentially picks up  the ball the President has dropped and commands the President to  operationalize the Defense Production Act and put somebody in charge of  its effectuation to make sure we are producing in this country all of  the medical equipment--the masks, the gloves, the testing reagents, the  cartridges--that it is possible to produce in this Nation   The level of gleeful, willing, knowing, purposeful incompetence from  this administration is absolutely stunning, and no one should normalize  an administration that has the power to save lives and refuses to  operationalize it.   Why won't this administration take control of the supply chain? Why  are they willing to let people die? States can't run the supply chain  by themselves. It is a national and international supply chain.  Hospitals can't create their own supply chain. They need to be focused  on saving lives, not being miniprocurement organizations.   We know that democracies and capitalist economies are by nature and  design often inefficient when faced with these urgent crises. That is  why we give Presidents these enormous but temporary powers to smooth  out the inefficiencies of a multibranch, multijurisdictional democracy.   When it comes to calling in the Federal troops to beat the hell out  of protesters, this President seems perfectly willing to exercise his  powers as Commander in Chief, but when it comes to making sure that my  kids' teachers or my local doctor has a mask this fall, this President  is all of a sudden impotent. It falls to us, Members of the U.S.  Congress, to stand up and pass legislation, the Medical Supply  Transparency and Delivery Act, to make sure--to make sure--that we are  using the extent of the statutes provided to this government and this  President to make sure that people are safe and make sure people are  tested in the middle of an ongoing epidemic.   I am glad to be joined on the floor today by a number of my  colleagues to talk about the need to pass this legislation. We are  going to offer a unanimous consent request. Senator Baldwin will do  that. I have been very pleased to be a partner with her in developing  this legislation to require the operationalization of the DPA, but  before she speaks, let me turn it over to my colleague and our caucus's  leader on issues of healthcare, Senator Stabenow.
