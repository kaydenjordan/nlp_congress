 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 479 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 479         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (S. 475) to amend       title 5, United States Code, to designate Juneteenth National       Independence Day as a legal public holiday. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Oversight and Reform or their respective designees; and (2)       one motion to commit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time is yielded  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, today, the Committee on Rules met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 479, providing for consideration of  S. 475, the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, under a closed  rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform and one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider an important and timely  bill, S. 475, which parallels H.R. 1320 introduced by our colleague,  Sheila Jackson Lee from Texas. This bill would make Juneteenth a  Federal holiday.   We are happy and not a little surprised to see that the Senate was  able to quickly pass this bill with unanimous consent. It is not every  day that one sees the Senate move more quickly than the House, and it  is my hope that today the House of Representatives would be able to act  with similar swiftness.   Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June 19th, celebrates a seminal moment  in Black American history, and it is well past time that our country  recognizes the importance of this day by making it a Federal holiday.   While the Emancipation Proclamation outlawed slavery in the South,  and the Civil War effectively ended with the surrender of the  Confederacy in April of 1865 at Appomattox, slavery did not immediately  end throughout the United States.   During the Civil War, many slaveholders migrated to Texas to avoid  conflict and continued to hold Black Americans in bondage after the  formal end of the Civil War.   On June 19, 1865, Union troops finally arrived in Galveston Bay,  Texas, to ensure that slaves were freed, a full 2\1/2\  [[Page H2856]]  years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President  Lincoln.   On that date, Major General Gordon Granger issued General Order No.  3, which announced that, in accordance with the Emancipation  Proclamation, all slaves are free.   In the years following, Black Texans began to celebrate Juneteenth,  also known as Emancipation Day, Jubilee Day, and Juneteenth  Independence Day. Over time, they developed time-honored traditions for  celebration, including parades, cookouts, family reunions, prayer  gatherings, historic and cultural readings, and musical performances.  As Texans emigrated to other parts of the United States, those  traditions came with them and became enshrined in Black communities  across our country.   Today, Juneteenth is celebrated by communities throughout the United  States. Forty-eight States and the District of Columbia recognize  Juneteenth. It is time for the Federal Government to do the same.   My own district in southeastern Pennsylvania takes great pride in its  Juneteenth celebrations. From parades and flag raisings and picnics to  musical performances and community gatherings, our community will  celebrate at dozens of events throughout the district this weekend.   On a planning call this week for one of our local celebrations, a  resident from the Eastwick neighborhood in southwest Philadelphia  proclaimed that ``Juneteenth is the holy grail'' of celebrations for  the community because it represents America's true day of freedom.   Upon hearing the news that this bill would come up for passage today,  one of my staffers said: ``As an African-American woman raising five  beautiful children, it would mean so much to make Juneteenth a Federal  holiday. . . . It allows people to reflect on what my ancestors had to  deal with. It gives the history of how they fought and continued to  fight as they passed the torch on to the next generation.''   Another community member just shared: ``I hope this provides an  accessible, teachable moment so people across the country can talk with  their neighbors about why we need this holiday and how it helps to  address the erasure of Black contributions to humanity and history.''   I know that this move to make Juneteenth a Federal holiday will mean  so much to members of the Black community in my district, and I am so  excited to have the great honor of returning home to celebrate this  weekend after we pass this bill.   Juneteenth, like many of our other Federal celebrations, serves as a  day of remembrance and reflection and a celebration of emancipation and  freedom.   So, as we consider the rule today, and as we approach this year's  Juneteenth celebrations, I ask my colleagues in this Chamber to think  and reflect on our Nation's complicated history, the events that led us  to where we are, and what we need to do to reckon with our past and  continue to work toward creating a more equitable and inclusive  society.   America has historically failed to fully address the horrors of the  abuse wrought upon enslaved people during the early years of our  country, and to this day, we live with the long-term effects and  consequences of slavery in America.   Racism, both interpersonal and institutional, continues to plague our  country. And despite monumental efforts, from the Civil War to the  civil rights movement and beyond, to get our Nation to live up to the  ideals proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence, Black Americans  still face disparate treatment and disparate outcomes across our  society, from housing and healthcare to education and the workplace.   To move forward with the work of dismantling institutional racism  that continues to disenfranchise Black Americans, it is essential that  we start by looking critically at how we get here.    If we all truly commit ourselves to striving toward a more perfect  Union, where all people are not only legally equal but actually have a  fair shot at achieving the American Dream, we must recognize our  current failings and take the necessary steps to end racial  discrimination, the racial wealth gap, and racial injustices in our  social, economic, environmental, and judicial institutions.   While some may feel that making Juneteenth a Federal holiday is a  purely symbolic act, symbols hold power. Holidays hold power.   While millions of Americans already celebrate Juneteenth and use the  day to reflect on our collective past and future, this is an important  step to formally commemorate a crucial part of our culture and history  that for too long has been canceled.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on other meaningful  steps we can take to honor the legacy of enslaved people who  contributed so much to our history and to address the lasting impacts  of this cruel chapter in our history that still persist today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I now recognize my distinguished colleague,  the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland  Security in the House Committee on the Judiciary. Representative Sheila  Jackson Lee is a tremendous advocate and leader in the fight for racial  equity and an inspiration to many of our colleagues, including myself.  Coming from the great State of Texas, she is all too familiar with the  history and importance of Juneteenth for African Americans and for all  Americans to recognize and reconcile our history.   In Congress' past, Representative Jackson Lee led the charge to  recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday by introducing legislation  to federally recognize this historic day. In the 117th Congress, she,  again, introduced H.R. 1320, which I understand formed the basis for  the Senate bill.   Through the tireless work of her and her Senate colleagues, we now  have the privilege of voting on this historic legislation. I applaud  the tremendous work of the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I  want to echo the remarks of my distinguished colleague, Representative  Sheila Jackson Lee, in mentioning Pennsylvania's history in this  moment. I want to highlight Philadelphia's role in our Nation's  abolitionist movement, the Quakers, Lucretia Mott, who embraced that  movement and pushed this country forward, the role of our residents in  fighting and winning the Civil War, and being the birthplace of  American ideals at Independence Hall.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that in passing this rule and the underlying bill  we will take a collective step forward in achieving those goals that  all Americans are equal under the law, treated fairly in our schools,  our workplaces, our courts, and our public institutions.   Symbols hold power. Holidays hold power. While millions of Americans  already celebrate Juneteenth and use the day to reflect on our  collective past and future, this is an important step to formally  commemorate a crucial part of our culture and history. I urge, again,  that all my colleagues vote for the rule and the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
