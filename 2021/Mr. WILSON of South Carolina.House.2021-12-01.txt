 Madam Speaker, the Biden-supported,  Democrat-passed, irresponsible spending scheme is the most reckless tax  and spending bill in history.   Americans are suffering from Biden inflation, and build back bankrupt  will make it worse. Young Americans will be saddled with unimaginable  debt, destroying jobs. For older Americans, Biden inflation is  devaluing retirement accounts, undermining Social Security, and  compromising Medicare.   House Democrats have misled Americans about the cost. The  Congressional Budget Office says it will add $367 billion to the  deficit. All this confirms that the Democrat elite think they are  smarter than everyone and think Democrat voters are ignorant to believe  that $4.5 trillion costs zero dollars. They pay with Biden inflation.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Remember the Waukesha murders in Wisconsin.                            ____________________
