 Madam President, right now, the Senate is debating, having  been started by our colleague Senator Sanders, whether it is OK to pay  starvation wages in the United States. You  [[Page S1223]]  heard that right, starvation wages. Receiving that starvation wage,  single moms are skipping meals as they try to make rent and buy  groceries for their family. These moms get paid $7.25 an hour, often  work two jobs, and go to bed every night worried that the next morning  is going to bring financial calamity.   Senators, is this OK in a country as rich and strong as ours? Here in  the U.S. Senate, nobody has got to worry where their next meal is  coming from, but that is an everyday struggle for too many families  across the land.   Senators, let us think about those who are hurting as the vote on the  Sanders minimum wage amendment approaches. It is time for that single  mom to get a fair wage for a fair day's work, a living wage, not a  starvation wage.   There has never been a stronger case for a $15 minimum wage than  there is right now during the pandemic. I think about grocery store and  pharmacy workers, home health aides, food processing and packing  workers, restaurant employees interacting with maskless customers. So  many workers in Oregon and across the country are going to work in a  dangerous environment each day. Many of them are Black and Latino  workers, people from the communities that have suffered the most from  COVID-19. They have kept our country going through the last year.   I have heard a whole lot of Members of the Senate, Democratic and  Republicans, talk about those workers as heroes of the pandemic. So the  question is, Will the Senate stand up and give those heroes of the  pandemic the raise they deserve, the raise they have waited for, for 12  years?   There are 30 million Americans who earn less than $15 an hour. It  would be closer to 40 million if not for the fact that the coronavirus  put so many Americans out of work. That is just immoral and  unacceptable.   Now, if you want to see inequality baked into the law, just look at  how the country treats its lowest income workers compared to those at  the top. The minimum wage has been stuck for 12 long years, and a flat  minimum is nothing but a slow-moving pay cut for those who make the  least.   Minimum wage workers cannot afford the average rent in any State in  America, not one. It doesn't account for utilities, food, gas, car  payments, medical bills, school supplies. Here is a fact: Living is  expensive for the poor in America. Meanwhile, the most well-to-do keep  winning with their investments in the stock market. The entire Tax Code  is rigged to favor the income of billionaires over the income of wage- earning families.   Republicans passed the $2 trillion Trump tax law promising trickle- down benefits. They have been talking about that for decades, even  though those magical benefits never actually trickle down.   The Trump administration actually made it A-OK in the eyes of the law  for corporations to steal from their employees' tipped wages. A country  that aspires to be pro-work should not be this anti-worker.   Members of the Senate might forget it now, but minimum wage used to  go up all the time. It happened 22 times since the minimum wage was  enacted in 1938. Through the fifties, sixties, and into the seventies-- the post-war period that many looked as the boom years of the 20th  century--the minimum wage went up all the time, and Congress expanded  the range of workers it covered.   Now, colleagues, these increases did not lead to the end of Western  civilization back then, and raising the minimum wage isn't going to do  it today either. That is because--folks might want to sit down when I  say this--it is good for everybody when there are fewer poor people in  America. This is the longest the Congress has gone without raising the  minimum wage since its origin.   In recent years, the grassroots movement has picked up the slack and  made a lot of progress in cities and States all over the country,  including my home State of Oregon. But the Congress cannot wait any  longer. The powerful could pull the levers around here in a hurry, and  they get more than their share of benefits and attention. Right now,  the Congress has a chance to prove, to actually prove that it is  looking after working people, and that means raising the minimum wage  to $15 an hour. Every single Senator says they want to incentivize hard  work, and, folks, a living wage does just that. The single mom skipping  meals to feed her kids deserves better. The Senate can do better  starting today.   I appreciate my colleague Senator Sanders leading the effort to raise  the wage for years and years. As chairman of the Senate Finance  Committee, I am all in with Senator Sanders on this fight. Senators,  support our amendment. Give tens of millions of America's hard-working  people a raise. And before I yield the floor, I just briefly want to  provide an update with respect to the issue of trying to make sure that  folks who have been laid off, laid off from their jobs through no fault  of their own, are going to be able to get an unemployment benefit where  they can make rent and pay groceries.   We are having conversations now, bringing people together, I believe,  around two core principles. One is avoiding a cliff in August where you  would have something like 11 million people lose their benefits. We  have to do that. It defies common sense to have a cliff in the middle  of August when you have the Senate out of session.    Second, we are making a lot of progress on preventing an unemployment  tax surprise. This is a matter that Senator Sanders and I have spoken  about at length for weeks. A number of colleagues on both sides of the  aisle have a great interest in this. I think we have made a lot of  headway. We will have more to discuss with the Senate, but I am really  hopeful that this can bring all sides of this debate together.   I have personally felt the benefit should be $400. It should  certainly run into September, but I know some of my colleagues feel  otherwise. So what we are looking at is making sure that we can get a  benefit so that people can make rent and pay groceries, that we prevent  that cliff, and, by God, we sure as hell shouldn't let folks who are  unemployed pay taxes on those unemployment benefits that they secured  in 2020.   Senator Sanders and I will continue to prosecute this question of tax  forgiveness very strongly as well. I appreciate his leadership.   I see Senator Murray, the chair of another important committee with  jurisdiction over this matter.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, later today the Senate will vote on an  amendment put forward by Senator Carper and myself dealing with an  extension of enhanced unemployment benefits.   Some Members of the Senate wanted to hold the enhanced weekly benefit  at $300 per week. My preference would have been to set it at $400 per  week on the longest extension possible and then later tie benefits to  economic conditions on the ground with automatic triggers. With the  amendment coming later today, I believe Members have reached a solution  that accomplishes two key goals.   First, it is a longer extension of benefits than the House bill that  avoids creating a new August cliff. It would extend the weekly benefit  at $300 per week into early October, including pandemic benefits for  gig workers and the self-employed. I have said time and again that  having an expiration in the middle of August, when Senators are home,  would be a prescription for trouble, and this option avoids the  potential of benefits expiring for millions of Americans with no way to  extend them.   Second, it would prevent a tax surprise for millions of Americans who  received unemployment benefits in 2020. The first $10,200 of the  unemployment benefits they received last year would be exempt from  income tax. People who already filed their taxes and found out that  they owed tax on their unemployment income would be able to file an  amended return to get back the difference.   This will wipe out taxes owed on last year's unemployment income for  most people who received it, saving them potentially thousands of  dollars. That is a big economic benefit for the people hardest hit by  the COVID crash, and jobless Americans will also have the certainty of  enhanced benefits running into October. My understanding is, the  Republican side will offer an amendment that will not prevent this tax  surprise.   I am going to keep working on automatic triggers. In my view, that is  the best way to manage this program going forward. But as for this  debate, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam President, yesterday, the Senate learned that there  were 745,000 new unemployment claims--higher than the worst week of the  great recession. Yet the Portman amendment is a double whammy on  workers--a much faster cutoff of benefits and absolutely no help with  the nasty tax surprise millions of working families will find when they  file their taxes in the next few weeks.   For example, if you have been laid off from your job through no fault  of your own and you are struggling to make ends meet, you do not have  $1,000 to pay a surprise tax bill, and the party that claims to be for  tax relief for working families offers you absolutely nothing.   Since the pandemic, Senate Republicans have been pushing working  families deeper into an economic hole. We have an alternative that  doesn't hang working families out to dry, and we will be offering it  shortly.   Working families deserve better than the Portman amendment. Don't  shortchange those working families tonight. I urge opposition to this  very flawed amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1092     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I do.    Mr. President and colleagues, the number of COVID-19  deaths among nursing home residents and staff is tragic. That is why  President Biden's and the Democrats' plan goes forward with an  investment in preventing nursing home infections and deaths, including  more PPE strike teams to address infections, testing, contact tracing,  and more.   We take a backseat to no one when it comes to timely and accurate  reporting in COVID-19 cases, and deaths will continue to ensure such  reporting. However, it would be a grave mistake to hold hostage this  badly needed support for strike teams to ensure residents' and  employees' safety in nursing home facilities. These funds are essential  to helping ensure the safety of seniors and staff that are at the  frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.   This amendment, colleagues, is punitive, and it doesn't further the  goal of transparency. It would hurt the very people we seek to protect.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I urge my colleagues to do  the same.    Mr. President, 30 seconds?    Mr. President, on this side of the aisle, we have led the  fight for transparency with respect to the kind of information my  colleague is talking about. That is not what this amendment is about.   This amendment is about making sure that President Biden and  Democrats can make these necessary investments in these strike teams  that are going to ensure more safety in these long-term care  facilities.   I urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1378 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 6 minutes,  evenly divided, to discuss this amendment.    Mr. President, on this side, our goal has been to secure  the strongest possible protections for jobless Americans that could  pass the Senate. This amendment has two essential features that make it  far better for working families than the Portman amendment.   It ensures that millions of working families get their benefits at  least through September 5. It protects unemployed workers from being  hit with a big surprise tax bill with no way to pay for it.   Republicans have been standing in lockstep against tax relief for  Americans with a few hundred dollars in the bank after demanding  billions in write-offs for wealthy investors. On the other hand,  Democrats have led the effort to add hundreds of dollars in weekly  benefits and covering gig workers and the self-employed.   This is the boldest action the Congress has ever taken--ever taken-- to support jobless Americans during an economic crisis, and at every  stage, as Democrats proposed that help for working families, Senate  Republicans opposed us. This goes back, colleagues, to the CARES Act,  when Republicans had just one amendment. That was to gut the jobless  protections.   Finally, the whole process underscores the need to stop jumping from  one economic cliff to another. There would be no need to predict the  level of economic support needed 6 months from now if benefits were  tailored to match economic conditions.   We look forward to discussing this idea of triggers for economic  support  [[Page S1235]]  with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, but tonight it is vital, as  the pandemic continues, that the Senate pass this amendment, an  economic lifeline for Americans who would strongly prefer to be back at  work.   Instead of attacking Americans as lazy individuals who don't want to  work, these are responsible adults with a strong work ethic who will  help us build back better in the days to come.   I strongly urge support for our amendment.   I yield.    Mr. President, I am going to ask for 15 seconds.    Mr. President, first of all, with respect to the facts  about unemployment, every week--every week since last March,  unemployment claims have been higher than the worst week of the great  recession. And the fact is, we have got millions of Americans who,  every single week, are walking an economic tightrope. They are  balancing the food bill against the fuel bill and the fuel bill against  the rent bill. And we want to give them a modest amount of tax relief  for the typical working person, and the party that claims to want to  help workers on their taxes won't lift a finger. That is why it is so  important that this amendment pass.   I yield.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, to speak in opposition, the Capito motion  to commit the bill to the Finance Committee instructs the committee to  do two things. The first is to dedicate funds to pay for bipartisan  transportation legislation. The other is to cut the funding currently  provided in our bill to provide relief to State and local governments.   I would like to say that the reason we oppose this is that this,  colleagues, is a false choice. If we are talking about major  legislation to improve our infrastructure, including roads, bridges,  airports, broadband, and more, count us in. In fact, I think one of the  first areas we ought to be focusing on, if we finish this bill, is  infrastructure, but this does not have to be at the expense of relief  to State and local governments. These two are not mutually exclusive,  colleagues. We can do both. We can address infrastructure and help our  State and local governments that have been hammered by COVID and a  struggling economy. They have had to lay off police, teachers, EMTs,  and many others.   I urge opposition to the Capito motion.    Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Romney  amendment.   First, colleagues, this amendment would be a drastic cut to the  relief in the bill. Specifically, it would limit the number of  firefighters, municipal workers, and teachers who would actually get  their jobs back in the coming weeks and months.   Second, the amendment doesn't take into account the full impact the  pandemic has had on State budgets and the costs they are going to  continue to incur in the months ahead.   Our view is, this is just the wrong time to start hacking away at  State and local funding because the job losses are stacking up. As we  have heard again and again from independent economists, those losses  are going to continue if the Senate doesn't go big, as this bill does.  Saving jobs and rehiring laid-off workers is what this portion of the  bill is all about.   So, colleagues, I would strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the Romney  amendment.   I yield.    Madam President.    Can I have 30 seconds to briefly respond?    First of all, we can't even really determine the formula  that is used under the Romney amendment. It is clear to us there are  going to be costs to States as a result of this legislation.   Colleagues, the reality is, the pandemic is a public health  nightmare, and this provision is designed to specifically address the  challenge of making sure that firefighters, municipal workers, and  others who are responding day in and day out at risk to themselves are  going to be able to get their jobs back in the coming weeks and months.  The fact is, this amendment is going to reduce the money the States  have to address those critical needs.   I urge colleagues to vote no.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Colleagues, the underlying bill has significant improvements in the  child tax credit. All told, the bill cuts child poverty in half. But  this amendment would set us back. True, it expands the child credit in  some ways, but to pay for these expansions, it dramatically cuts back  on what is known as refundability.   Here is the problem, colleagues: Refundability is what helps the  families at the lower end of the income scale. So to expand the child  tax credit in several ways, the Lee amendment reduces benefits to the  working families who need them most.   I want to close by way of saying that I will be glad to work with my  colleague from Utah and the Senator from Florida. I would also note  that the other Senator from Utah has been interested in these issues.   This amendment sets us back because it reduces benefits to working  families who need them most.   I yield back.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1381     Mr. President, I rise in opposition.   Colleagues, this is what this amendment would do: It would deny  premium assistance to many middle-class families, forcing them to pay  more for healthcare--the last thing they need in the middle of a  pandemic.   Now, in 2020, the average cost of health insurance was $17,244 for a  family of 4. That is a hefty bill to pay without assistance for most  middle-income families, especially those who live in higher cost areas.  ACA premium tax credits can mean the difference between affordable  health insurance and doing without coverage.   I urge colleagues to oppose the Lee amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1331     Madam President, Section 605 of the State and Local  section of the American Rescue Plan requires further explanation on its  intent. Below is the salient language of Section 605, Local Assistance  and Tribal Consistency Fund:         ``(b) Authority to Make Payments.--        ``(1) Payments to eligible revenue sharing counties.--For       each of fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the Secretary shall       reserve $750,000,000 of the total amount appropriated under       subsection (a) to allocate and pay to each eligible revenue       sharing county in amounts that are determined by the       Secretary taking into account economic conditions of each       eligible revenue sharing county, using measurements of       poverty rates, household income, land values, and       unemployment rates as well as other economic indicators, over       the 20-year period ending with September 30, 2021.        ``(l) Eligible revenue sharing county.--The term `eligible       revenue sharing county' means--        ``(A) a county, parish, or borough--        ``(i) that is independent of any other unit of local       government; and        ``(ii) that, as determined by the Secretary, is the       principal provider of government services for the area within       its jurisdiction; and        ``(iii) for which, as determined by the Secretary, there is       a negative revenue impact due to implementation of a Federal       program or changes to such program; and        ``(B) the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto       Rico, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands. . . . ``              Folks may wonder: ``What are the revenue sharing counties?''; ``Why  Treasury?''; and ``How is my new program different from existing county  support programs?''   Let me explain my thinking in putting this language together. In  every state, but especially the West, there are counties with tracts of  federal lands that have unique impacts on the local economy. These  counties are referred to in Section 605 as ``revenue sharing  counties''--counties that have a direct fiscal relationship with public  lands and public resources. These counties help pay for roads, schools,  and other services that directly benefit and, in many cases, support  federal lands. They get payments for the tax-  [[Page S1271]]  exempt status of those public lands, or payments intended to split the  revenue from the commercial use of public lands. This relationship  between the counties and those lands and extractive industries usually  means they are boom-and-bust counties--falling faster into recession  and slower to climb out of recession when changes occur to particular  federal programs or when, for example, a massive global pandemic hits  without warning.             I, and many of my colleagues, have worked for years on programs  attempting to stabilize those local economies--primarily through two  laws: the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act,  which is largely administered by the Secretary of Agriculture through  the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management; and the  Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program, administered through the Secretary of  the Interior.   So, why implement a new and separate program assigned to the  Secretary of Treasury? Treasury is the agency with the best and most  complete knowledge of the economic workings of our nation. Therefore,  it is right up its alley to ``tak[e] into account economic conditions  of each eligible revenue sharing county, using measurements of poverty  rates, household income, land values, and unemployment rates as well as  other economic indicators, over the 20-year period ending with  September 30, 2021.'' In addition, my 20 years of experience in this  arena, combined with what I've heard from Oregonians in rural counties,  adds up to the conclusion that it is time to try something new to  stabilize the local economies of these revenue-sharing counties.             I am not expecting Treasury to do this work on its own. I will work  with the Department, as will my colleague and long-time partner on this  issue, Senator Crapo. I also fully expect Treasury to consult with  others in government who have history in this arena on the creation of  this new formula such as the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior,  as well as the National Association of Counties, state county  associations, including the Association of O&C Counties Oregon, and  many other groups with a deep understanding of these impacts across the  United States. These entities will help Treasury stand up this new  program at Treasury because they provide historic context to the  entirely new program in its analysis of the needs of the counties, for  the first time taking into account economic conditions on the ground.  The new program will include $1.5 billion for eligible counties and  $500 million for Tribes over the next two years.   So, now that I have covered the questions of ``What are the revenue  sharing counties?''; ``Why Treasury?''; and ``How is my new program  different?''; I want to provide an answer to ``What has happened in the  revenue sharing county to warrant a payment?''   Revenue sharing counties have suffered economic loss due to the  implementation of, or changes in, a federal program. For example,  necessary environmental and wildlife protection laws have reduced the  revenue sharing payments to counties that host U.S. Forest Service  lands and timberlands managed by the Bureau of Land Management.   Over the last half century, revenue sharing counties have seen their  budgets fluctuate wildly based on inconsistent revenue sharing payments  caused, in part, by the boom and bust nature of resource extraction  industries. Additionally, current federal county payments laws meant to  stabilize this cycle, such as PILT and SRS, are often inconsistently  funded and leave counties on an economic roller coaster each year  waiting for inconsistent reauthorizations.   The purpose of my new program is to help stabilize the budgets and  economies of counties that have historically hosted extractive industry  on private or public lands and where downturns in those extractive  industries, caused by government action, affected the county  economically and budgetarily.   Unfortunately, due to the nature of the reconciliation process in the  Senate, the final language of the new county payments program did not  make this perfectly clear. Instead, the final language referred simply  to revenue sharing counties, but requires Treasury to establish a  formula that helps both.   Let me touch on a couple of the other key provisions in the section.  First, while the money provided is for a county to use as it sees fit,  a county cannot use any of the funds to lobby anyone for any reason at  any level of government. If a county does use the money in this  unauthorized manner, the county must return the improperly used money  to the treasury.             The county that takes money under this section must report to the  Treasury Secretary about the use of that money. The Secretary has the  discretion to make the reporting requirements more detailed. And  lastly, if the county does not make a timely report, then the county  must pay a penalty.   And lastly, let me talk about the $500,000,000 in this section  destined for the Tribes. The section reads:         ``(2) Payments to eligible tribal governments.--For each of       fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the Secretary shall reserve       $250,000,000 of the total amount appropriated under       subsection (a) to allocate and pay to eligible Tribal       governments in amounts that are determined by the Secretary       taking into account economic conditions of each eligible       Tribe.        ``(2) Eligible tribal government.--The term 'eligible       Tribal government' means the recognized governing body of an       eligible Tribe.        ``(3) Eligible tribe.--The term 'eligible Tribe' means any       Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village,       community, component band, or component reservation,       individually identified (including parenthetically) in the       list published most recently as of the date of enactment of       this section pursuant to section 104 of the Federally       Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 U.S.C. 5131).''    This section of the bill would establish a new Tribal economic  stabilization fund, which would allow the Department of Treasury to  make payments to Tribal governments for any governmental purpose deemed  necessary by the Tribe. This language is intended for the Department of  Treasury to work with the Tribal Governments defined in the bill to  determine a formula ensuring equitable distribution of the funding each  year. This funding could be used to repair critical drinking water  infrastructure, fund Tribal healthcare services, or other critical  Tribal needs.   Madam President, I am thrilled to be on the new path of providing  stabilized aid to these counties. I look forward to working with my  colleagues in standing up this program.                            ____________________
