 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize two outstanding  citizens from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who are making our community  extremely proud.   Jacqueline and Victoria Schneider, twin sisters from Holland,  Pennsylvania, will be graduating from Neumann University in Delaware  County this weekend.   Throughout their time in college, Jacqueline and Victoria have been  defined by their drive, their dedication, and their work ethic. Both  women are standout students and athletes, competing on the Neumann  Knights softball team.   Notably, Jacqueline and Victoria are dual valedictorians for the  Neumann University class of 2019. This is the first time in the 54-year  history of the school that two students will be receiving the  valedictorian medal, and both will have the opportunity to address  their peers at graduation.   I congratulate Jacqueline, who is pursuing a career in law  enforcement, and Victoria, who is pursuing a career in education, on  this outstanding achievement.   I would also like to recognize their parents, Gerry and Karen  Schneider, for raising such amazing children and future leaders of our  community.                     Recognizing Educator Josh Isaacsohn     Mr. Speaker, this week is Teacher Appreciation  [[Page H3483]]  Week, and I rise to recognize an educator in Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, who is teaching his students the value of good  citizenship.   Josh Isaacsohn, a fifth grade teacher at the Gayman Elementary School  in Doylestown, was recently recognized by the Central Bucks school  board for his work in the classroom.   For the past 3 years, during each month of the school year, Josh has  sent notes and drawings from his students to parents of members of our  military who, in turn, would add them to care packages.   Mr. Speaker, the men and women in our military deserve our full  support and gratitude, and I thank Josh for teaching our community's  kids about respecting and honoring our true American heroes.   I would also like to thank Dr. John Kopicki, superintendent of the  Central Bucks School District, and Glenn Schloeffel, president of the  Bucks County school board, for all of their work as well. We thank them  for their leadership in our community.                        Recognizing Artists of Yardley     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that was recently named  Pennsbury School District's 2018-2019 Nonprofit Partner of the Year.   Artists of Yardley, founded in 2004, is an organization dedicated to  enhancing creativity in our community through immersion in the arts.   Located at the Janney House on Patterson Farm in Yardley, Artists of  Yardley boasts over 250 members and offers classes, workshops, and  summer camps for young people in Bucks County. These opportunities,  taught by professional art instructors, seek to amplify the artistic  talents and education of our community's youth.   Notably, for the past 3 years, Artists of Yardley has organized an  art competition for Pennsbury School District students at its  headquarters.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Artists of Yardley for all of its amazing work  with our community and for inspiring Bucks County students to pursue  their dreams.   I would also like to particularly thank Artists of Yardley's  president, Alison Smith, and vice president, Jim Bongartz, for all of  their work and service to our community.                            ____________________
