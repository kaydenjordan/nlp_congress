 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the  millions of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease, and their family  members and caregivers.   I am speaking up because the Center for Medicare and Medicaid  Services, CMS, made a decision that will severely limit access to the  only drug shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's. I think their  decision is a mistake.   Alzheimer's is a heartbreaking disease. It has no cure. These are the  faces of Alzheimer's. They are our sisters, our brothers, our mothers,  our fathers, our neighbors, our grandparents, our fellow Americans, who  are living with this dreadful disease. As time passes, they are  slipping away from their loved ones a little bit at a time. They have  asked and hoped for something to help them. Anything. Anything that  could give them more time with their families.   For the past 20 years, there has been little progress on new  Alzheimer's drugs. Like too many other Americans, I have had the  heartbreaking experience of watching my mother struggle with  Alzheimer's, and still have the challenge of finding sufficient  caregivers to help care for her and those who speak Spanish. My  mother's story is not unique. Nearly 6 million people in the United  States are suffering from Alzheimer's, and this number is growing every  single day.   Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first new  Alzheimer's drug, providing hope for families. But CMS will not cover  it. They finalized a coverage policy that will tightly restrict access  to the entire and only known class of drug that has shown promise to  slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.   Is that the way we should respond to this crisis?   This is an access issue. People who have money and can pay for it  will get the drug. People who are under a CMS program will not.   Every day, Americans living with Alzheimer's are burdened with the  expense of caregivers, doctors' visits, and seeing their family members  decline. This is why my colleagues and I wrote a letter urging CMS not  to limit access to breakthrough therapies for Alzheimer's patients. And  as a representative of over 150,000 Angelenos who are living with  Alzheimer's disease, I am deeply disappointed with CMS's decision.  These are my constituents and members of my community, as well as  yours. Time is not on our side in this fight.   To all the patients, families, and caregivers out there who are  struggling with Alzheimer's, I am not done. I stand with you and I will  continue to fight for you.                            ____________________
