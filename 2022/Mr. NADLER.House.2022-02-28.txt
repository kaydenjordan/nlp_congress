 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2116) to prohibit discrimination based on an individual's  texture or style of hair, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2116         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Creating a Respectful and       Open World for Natural Hair Act of 2022'' or the ``CROWN Act       of 2022''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:  [[Page H1161]]         (1) Throughout United States history, society has used (in       conjunction with skin color) hair texture and hairstyle to       classify individuals on the basis of race.        (2) Like one's skin color, one's hair has served as a basis       of race and national origin discrimination.        (3) Racial and national origin discrimination can and do       occur because of longstanding racial and national origin       biases and stereotypes associated with hair texture and       style.        (4) For example, routinely, people of African descent are       deprived of educational and employment opportunities because       they are adorned with natural or protective hairstyles in       which hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, or worn in       locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, or Afros.        (5) Racial and national origin discrimination is reflected       in school and workplace policies and practices that bar       natural or protective hairstyles commonly worn by people of       African descent.        (6) For example, as recently as 2018, the U.S. Armed Forces       had grooming policies that barred natural or protective       hairstyles that servicemembers of African descent commonly       wear and that described these hairstyles as ``unkempt''.        (7) The U.S. Army also recognized that prohibitions against       natural or protective hairstyles that African-American       soldiers are commonly adorned with are racially       discriminatory, harmful, and bear no relationship to African-      American servicewomen's occupational qualifications and their       ability to serve and protect the Nation. As of February 2021,       the U.S. Army removed minimum hair length requirements and       lifted restrictions on any soldier wearing braids, twists,       locs, and cornrows in order to promote inclusivity and       accommodate the hair needs of soldiers.        (8) As a type of racial or national origin discrimination,       discrimination on the basis of natural or protective       hairstyles that people of African descent are commonly       adorned with violates existing Federal law, including       provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e       et seq.), section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C.       1981), and the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.).       However, some Federal courts have misinterpreted Federal       civil rights law by narrowly interpreting the meaning of race       or national origin, and thereby permitting, for example,       employers to discriminate against people of African descent       who wear natural or protective hairstyles even though the       employment policies involved are not related to workers'       ability to perform their jobs.        (9) Applying this narrow interpretation of race or national       origin has resulted in a lack of Federal civil rights       protection for individuals who are discriminated against on       the basis of characteristics that are commonly associated       with race and national origin.        (10) In 2019 and 2020, State legislatures and municipal       bodies throughout the U.S. have introduced and passed       legislation that rejects certain Federal courts' restrictive       interpretation of race and national origin, and expressly       classifies race and national origin discrimination as       inclusive of discrimination on the basis of natural or       protective hairstyles commonly associated with race and       national origin.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Federal Government should acknowledge that       individuals who have hair texture or wear a hairstyle that is       historically and contemporarily associated with African       Americans or persons of African descent systematically suffer       harmful discrimination in schools, workplaces, and other       contexts based upon longstanding race and national origin       stereotypes and biases;        (2) a clear and comprehensive law should address the       systematic deprivation of educational, employment, and other       opportunities on the basis of hair texture and hairstyle that       are commonly associated with race or national origin;        (3) clear, consistent, and enforceable legal standards must       be provided to redress the widespread incidences of race and       national origin discrimination based upon hair texture and       hairstyle in schools, workplaces, housing, federally funded       institutions, and other contexts;        (4) it is necessary to prevent educational, employment, and       other decisions, practices, and policies generated by or       reflecting negative biases and stereotypes related to race or       national origin;        (5) the Federal Government must play a key role in       enforcing Federal civil rights laws in a way that secures       equal educational, employment, and other opportunities for       all individuals regardless of their race or national origin;        (6) the Federal Government must play a central role in       enforcing the standards established under this Act on behalf       of individuals who suffer race or national origin       discrimination based upon hair texture and hairstyle;        (7) it is necessary to prohibit and provide remedies for       the harms suffered as a result of race or national origin       discrimination on the basis of hair texture and hairstyle;       and        (8) it is necessary to mandate that school, workplace, and       other applicable standards be applied in a nondiscriminatory       manner and to explicitly prohibit the adoption or       implementation of grooming requirements that       disproportionately impact people of African descent.        (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to institute       definitions of race and national origin for Federal civil       rights laws that effectuate the comprehensive scope of       protection Congress intended to be afforded by such laws and       Congress' objective to eliminate race and national origin       discrimination in the United States.

SEC. 9. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural  Hair Act, or the CROWN Act, is a critically important civil rights bill  that would explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of hair  texture or hairstyles commonly associated with a particular race or  national origin. It would do so in areas of the law where  discrimination on the basis of race and national origin are already  prohibited, such as employment, education, and housing.   To be clear, it is my view that existing civil rights statutes  already make such hair-based discrimination unlawful. The Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission agrees, having issued guidance  interpreting title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit such  discrimination as a form of race discrimination in certain  circumstances. Unfortunately, some Federal courts have erroneously  rejected this interpretation. The CROWN Act simply fixes these courts'  misinterpretation of Federal civil rights law.   This fix is urgently needed. According to a 2019 study conducted by  the JOY Collective, Black people are ``disproportionately burdened by  policies and practices in public places, including the workplace, that  target, profile, or single them out for natural hair styles'' and other  hairstyles traditionally associated with their race, like braids, locs,  and twists.   The study also found that 80 percent of Black women believed that  they had to change their hair from its natural state to fit in at the  office and that they were 83 percent more likely to be judged harshly  because of their looks.   While this study illustrates the prevalence of hair discrimination,  it is the people behind those numbers that make this legislation so  vital. For example, a Texas student was told that he would not be able  to walk at graduation because his dreadlocks were too long; a Florida  boy was turned away from his first day of school because his hair was  too long; and a New Orleans-area girl was sent home from school for  wearing braids.   Similarly, numerous Black employees have been told to change their  hair because it violated their employer's dress code. Some have even  been denied employment altogether because of their hairstyles.   In view of these disturbing facts, 14 States have enacted statutes  prohibiting discrimination on the basis of an individual's natural  hairstyle--in every case with bipartisan support and sometimes even  with the unanimous support of both parties.   While I applaud these States for taking action, this is a matter of  basic justice that demands a national solution by Congress. That is why  I strongly support the CROWN Act. The House passed a nearly identical  measure last Congress, and I hope that we will do so again today.   I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey, Representative Bonnie Watson  Coleman, for her leadership and for introducing this important bill  this Congress. I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Committee on  the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick), the newest Member of Congress.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to represent  every person of African descent across this country and in Florida's  20th Congressional District with natural hair.   I call on my colleagues from the U.S. Senate to pass the CROWN Act to  prohibit discrimination on the basis of hair texture or hairstyle that  is commonly associated with a particular race or national origin.   Lawsuits initiated by Black workers alleging discrimination against  their natural hair in the workplace have filled courthouses for more  than 40 years. This legislation will provide us with the freedom to  wear our crowns without discrimination.   We must understand that hair discrimination is rooted in systemic  racism. Anti-Black hair sentiment on U.S. soil has existed for  centuries.   As Members of Congress, we have a legal and ethical obligation to  push back against the Eurocentric beauty perpetuated across TV and in  the media.   Hair discrimination is race discrimination. Unfortunately, some  employers discriminate against people of African descent who wear  natural hair even though the employment policies involved are not  related to workers' ability to perform the job.   The notion that some of these policies are race-neutral policies and,  therefore, not covered under the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlaws  discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion, and national  origin, is absurd and lacks merit.   As a mother of African-American children, I want our beautiful  daughters and sons in my district to feel comfortable in their skin  without retaliation. Sadly, Black students are three to six times more  likely to be suspended or expelled from school.   Today, there remain regressive movements that continue to criminalize  natural Black hairstyles under the auspices of preparing them for the  real world.   We must, instead, teach our children to embrace their natural beauty  and understand that their humanity is not tied to their hair.   To the organizations that have consistently advocated for the passage  of this critical piece of legislation, we thank you for your  commitment.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, while racism and discrimination sometimes appear in  overt forms, they can also manifest themselves in more subtle ways. One  way is through discrimination based on natural hairstyles and hair  textures associated with people of a particular race or national  origin.   As we have discussed on this floor, this is intolerable and it is not  taken care of by current law, despite the statements from the other  side notwithstanding. The CROWN Act would make explicit that the civil  rights laws prohibit such discrimination. It is a matter of basic  fairness and justice.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 55) to amend section 249 of title 18, United States Code, to  specify lynching as a hate crime act, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 55         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Emmett Till Antilynching       Act''.       SEC. 2. LYNCHING; OTHER CONSPIRACIES.         Section 249(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended       by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) Lynching.--Whoever conspires to commit any offense       under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall, if death or serious       bodily injury (as defined in section 2246 of this title)       results from the offense, be imprisoned for not more than 30       years, fined in accordance with this title, or both.        ``(6) Other conspiracies.--Whoever conspires to commit any       offense under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall, if death or       serious bodily injury (as defined in section 2246 of this       title) results from the offense, or if the offense includes       kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual abuse       or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an       attempt to kill, be imprisoned for not more than 30 years,       fined in accordance with this title, or both.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act is long-overdue  legislation that would correct a historical injustice by finally  specifying lynching as a crime under Federal law.   Our Nation endured a shameful period during which thousands of  African Americans were lynched as a means of racial subordination and  enforcing white supremacy. These violent incidents were largely  tolerated by State and Federal officials, and they represent a stain on  our Nation's legacy.   Today, we acknowledge this disgraceful chapter in American history,  and we send a clear message that such violent actions motivated by  hatred and bigotry will not be tolerated in this country.   The term ``lynching'' generally refers to premeditated public acts of  violence--often resulting in death--carried out by a mob in order to  punish an alleged transgressor or to strike fear among a targeted  group.   Throughout history, lynching has been employed as an extreme form of  informal group social control and has often been conducted with the  display of a public spectacle for maximum intimidation.   This legislation is named in honor of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old  African-American youth from Chicago, who was lynched in a particularly  gruesome fashion while visiting an uncle in Mississippi in 1955. His  murder and the antilynching movement that followed set the stage for  the creation of the civil rights movement that we recognize today.   Though lynching touches all races and religions and occurs throughout  the United States, it has been most common in the South and was  targeted primarily at Blacks.   During the period between the Civil War and World War II, thousands  of African Americans were lynched in the United States. These violent  incidents profoundly impacted race relations and shaped the geographic,  political, social, and economic conditions of African-American  communities in ways that are still evident today.   The first Federal antilynching legislation was introduced in 1900,  almost 120 years ago, by Congressman George Henry White, the only  African-American Member of Congress at that time. Unfortunately,  neither his bill nor any antilynching bills that were introduced in the  decades that followed managed to pass Congress.   The Department of Justice has used other laws to prosecute some civil  rights-era crimes and hate crimes that were described as lynching in  public  [[Page H1167]]  discourse, but there is no Federal law explicitly prohibiting lynching.   Today, we act to correct this historical injustice. Madam Speaker, I  thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) for his leadership on this  important issue and for his attention to history.   In memory of Emmett Till and in memory of all the victims of lynching  throughout our history, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, with this legislation, we can right a great historical  wrong by finally specifying lynching as a crime under Federal law, more  than 120 years after the first antilynching bill was introduced in  Congress. Although this proposal should have been law a long time ago,  it is never too late to do the right thing.   The shameful era when lynchings were commonplace in this country-- particularly in the South--is thankfully over, but we have seen  disturbing echoes of this gruesome practice in recent years--most  recently in the brutal murder of Ahmaud Arbery. This legislation sends  a clear message that such violent actions motivated by hatred and  bigotry will not be tolerated in this country.   The Nation is in the midst of a national conversation and a national  awakening on issues of race and justice. As we reckon with our past and  look to the future, it is important that we place lynching where it  properly belongs--in criminal code alongside other hate crimes that  have caused so much pain and suffering over the years.   I want to thank Congressman   Bobby Rush for his tireless efforts in  bringing this legislation forward and all the other Members whose  efforts have paved the way for passage of this bill today.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
