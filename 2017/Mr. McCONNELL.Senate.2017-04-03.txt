 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week is an important one for the  American people, for the Supreme Court, and for the Senate. The  Judiciary Committee just reported out Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination-- the next step in considering the Supreme Court nominee before the full  Senate. It was unfortunate to see our Democratic colleagues on the  committee break with recent precedent and not support this clearly  well-qualified and widely respected Supreme Court nominee.   I would remind colleagues that in addition to simply agreeing to an  up-or-down vote on their nominations on the Senate floor, Republicans  offered each of the last four first-term Supreme Court nominees of  Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama at least some bipartisan  support in the committee votes. Judge Gorsuch is no less qualified than  those four nominees of Presidents Clinton and Obama, and it is  disappointing he didn't get the same bipartisan support in the  committee today.   It now seems apparent that this well-qualified and widely respected  judge will be subject to the first successful partisan filibuster in  the history of the Senate--the first successful partisan filibuster in  the history of the Senate. This is a new low but not entirely  surprising given that the Democratic leader announced before the  nomination was even made that it was hard for him to imagine a nominee  this President would nominate whom he could support. He even went so  far as to say that he would be willing to fight the nomination ``tooth  and nail'' and might even ``keep the seat open'' in perpetuity. It is  not too late for our Democratic colleagues to make the right choice.   This week, the Senate will continue to debate Judge Gorsuch's  nomination here on the floor. This is a matter of great importance,  which is why we are planning to dedicate this week's floor time almost  entirely to continued robust debate of this nomination rather than  double-tracking it with legislative items, as has been done in the  past. Already, several Members from both sides of the aisle have come  to the floor day after day to offer their viewpoints on Judge Gorsuch.  I would encourage Members to take advantage of this time to continue  discussing his excellent credentials, judicial background, and broad  support from across the political spectrum in our country.   Let me remind colleagues the many ways in which Judge Gorsuch has  shown himself to be an outstanding nominee to serve on the High Court.   Judge Gorsuch was unanimously confirmed to his current position as a  Federal judge. Not a single Democrat opposed him then, including  Senators Obama, Clinton, Biden, Leahy, and Schumer. He has participated  in more than 2,700 cases since then. He has been in the majority 99  percent of the time. He has enjoyed the unanimous support of his fellow  judges 97 percent of the time.   The American Bar Association--a group the Democratic leader called  the ``gold standard'' for evaluating judicial nominations--awarded him  its highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified.''   He has amassed a wide array of supporters, including Democrats and  Republicans, current and former colleagues, the legal community, and  editorial boards all across our country. They say Gorsuch is eminently  well-qualified. As Judge John Kane, a Carter appointee, put it, ``I'm  not sure we could expect better [than Judge Gorsuch], or that better  presently exists.''   They say that Gorsuch is independent. Neal Katyal, President Obama's  former Acting Solicitor General, said he has ``no doubt that if  confirmed, Judge Gorsuch would help to restore confidence in the rule  of law'' because Gorsuch's ``years on the bench reveal a commitment''-- a commitment--``to judicial independence.''   They say Gorsuch is fair and impartial. The Denver Post editorial  board noted that ``Gorsuch is a brilliant legal mind and talented  writer whom observers praise for his ability to apply the law fairly  and consistently.'' They went on: ``[W]e appreciate his desire to  strictly interpret the Constitution,'' the paper continued, ``based on  the intent of our nation's founders, even when those rulings might  contradict his personal beliefs.''  [[Page S2163]]    They say Gorsuch is highly revered by Democrats and Republicans. As  USA TODAY noted in its editorial endorsing Gorsuch's confirmation just  today, ``He has gotten an array of glowing references, including from  some Democrats and liberals.'' I mentioned some this morning; there are  many more.   Here is just one additional example of how praise for Judge Gorsuch  has bridged the political divide: Despite their ideological  differences, former Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, a Democrat, and  former Colorado attorney general John Suthers, a Republican, agree that  Judge Gorsuch should be confirmed. They said:         Gorsuch's temperament, personal decency and qualifications       are beyond dispute.        It is time to use this confirmation process to examine and       exalt the characteristics of a judge who demonstrates that he       or she is scholarly, compassionate, committed to the law, and       will function as part of a truly independent, apolitical       judiciary. Judge Gorsuch fits that bill.    It reminds us of what David Frederick, a board member of the left- leaning American Constitution Society and longtime Democrat, recently  said: ``The Senate should confirm [Gorsuch] because there is no  principled reason to vote no.''   ``There is no principled reason to vote no.'' He is absolutely right.  So it goes without saying that there is no principled reason to block  an up-or-down vote on this supremely qualified nominee, either.   I look forward to joining my Senate colleagues in supporting Judge  Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court later this week.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  April 4; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume executive session to consider the nomination  of Elaine Duke, with the time until 12 noon equally divided in the  usual form; further, that at 12 noon, the Senate vote on confirmation  of the Duke nomination with no intervening action or debate; finally,  that following the disposition of the Duke nomination, the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:02 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, April 4, 2017, at 10 a.m.
