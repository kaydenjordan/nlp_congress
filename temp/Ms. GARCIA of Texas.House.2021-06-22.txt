 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  bipartisan Elder Abuse Protection Act.   I proudly sponsored this legislation because, quite frankly, back in  the day, when I was a geriatric social worker, I saw firsthand the  abuse targeted against our seniors as consumers.   This bill will help ensure that our seniors today, the group that  most disproportionately was impacted by COVID-19, are not continuing as  targets of fraudulent crimes. I thank Representative Spartz for joining  me in this legislation.   This March, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Internet Crime  Complaint Center released its 2020 internet crime report, noting it  received 105,301 complaints--over 100,000 complaints--from victims over  the age of 60.   That was a whopping 54 percent increase from the 2019 numbers of  68,000 complaints. If you look at the cost and value of these  complaints, it was $966 million, an approximate 15 percent increase  from the 2019 number of $835 million.   What is worse, Mr. Speaker, is that these statistics reflect only  those complaints in which the victim voluntarily provided their age  range as over 60. So there may be even more.   Victims over the age of 60 are targeted by perpetrators because they  are believed to have significant reliable financial resources.   The evidence is clear, as the United States ages, diversifies, and  modernizes, the number of older adults experiencing elder abuse is,  unfortunately, also projected to increase.   Elder abuse assessment measures and interventions are critical. This  intervention is even more urgent for Latinos in our country who lack  access to resources and information in their preferred language.   In 2017, the United States Department of Health and Human Services  estimated that the Latino population in the United States age 65 and  over was over 4 million people. By 2060, the Department projects the  population of elderly Latinos in America to grow to 19.9 million, or 21  percent of the overall American elderly population. That is a huge  number and growing.   Given these rapid growth rates and projected increases, public online  resources should be made available to Americans with limited English  proficiency. Providing Spanish language resources to the public will  therefore reach an underserved population and will provide an important  resource to millions of residents in the United States of America,  especially to my home State of Texas.                                time  1600     Unfortunately, due to the quarantine measures  and limitations on visiting facilities and nursing homes, it has made  it easier for abuse, neglect, and fraud to go undetected.   That is why this important legislation makes permanent a National  Elder Fraud Hotline and requires the Elder Justice Coordinator to  consult with the Office of Tribal Justice and designees on legal aid  issues.
