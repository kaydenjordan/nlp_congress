 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and I also thank the  chairman of the Committee on Natural Resources and my fellow Arizonan,  dean of our delegation, Congressman Raul Grijalva, for their  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, when people think of Arizona, they think of our Grand  Canyon--perfectly chiseled over millions of years by the Colorado  River. Its beauty and scale are humbling. But to us, it represents so  much more than a natural wonder.   The Grand Canyon National Park welcomes 6 million visitors a year. It  is the cornerstone of our State's tourism industry, directly supporting  almost 10,000 jobs. Though it is special to all, it is sacred to the  indigenous communities who call it home and who know better than anyone  how critical it is to protect.   It is simple: This is no place for uranium mining. We can't risk the  health of the communities that rely on this land and water or the  delicate ecosystems it contains. We cannot improve upon this wonder,  and we should not play a part in its destruction.   Mr. Speaker, I support protecting the Grand Canyon, and I am proud of  the vote we will take later today to safeguard it for future  generations.
