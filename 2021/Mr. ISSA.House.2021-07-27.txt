 Madam Speaker, I thank everyone here for giving serious  consideration to amendment No. 24 to H.R. 4502.   Madam Speaker, I speak today with my colleagues to support an  expansion that was done under the last administration that has had a  profound and positive effect on apprenticeships.                                time  1715    The amendment would simply allow funding to be available for the  implementation of the Department of Labor's Industry-Recognized  Apprenticeship Programs, otherwise known as IRAP.   In 2017, former President Trump acted to enhance the skills and  training options for all Americans so they may compete in today's jobs.  IRAP expanded high-quality apprenticeship programs with a focus on  rapidly growing industries like healthcare and STEM-based positions.   IRAP apprenticeships were unique from the traditional government  programs in that they were designed to be more nimble and responsive to  the changing workforce that we find ourselves in today. Engaging in  learning with new programs doesn't fit the old model, and the IRAP  expansion is extremely important for the following reason. I support  the apprenticeship programs that all of us are familiar with, the  skilled trades and the like; but, in fact, today there are new skills  that are being developed in which the curriculum must be nimble and  must change.   In just 4 months of operation, the program had 131 new offerings in  the healthcare field alone.   What better time than in the middle of a pandemic would there be to  try to enhance nursing and nursing-like skills to be advanced?   This is a time in which we are critically short in these areas, and  with the return of a new variant of coronavirus we could well find  ourselves in desperate need of a quick turnaround of new apprentices.  If we permit this program to continue, it will eventually support 2  million new apprenticeships.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to look at this in the most open  and positive way, nothing could be more important today--particularly  to the healthcare community--than, in fact, to expand flexible  apprenticeships.
