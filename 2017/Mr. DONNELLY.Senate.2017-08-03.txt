 Mr. President, I want to talk about what a great moment  this is. I want to thank Chairman Alexander for all his help, Ranking  Member Patty Murray for all of her help, and to my colleague the  Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson, for all he has done to spearhead  this effort.   This gives folks a shot. It doesn't provide any guarantees, but it  allows folks to be able to take their care into their own hands, to  make judgments, and to decide: I want to take a shot at this.   For me, it was a wonderful family from Indiana who, by the way, this  morning they are at Legoland down in Florida because their young boy is  in good health, is getting along, but time is ticking. Young Jordan  McLinn has Duchenne muscular dystrophy. His mom Laura and Jordan met  with me and said: All we want is a shot. We don't want a guarantee. We  want a chance to try to make Jordan better. That is what this Right to  Try Act does. That is why I am so proud of all our colleagues coming  together to support this, and to all the families Senator Johnson  mentioned, we are so proud of you. We are so grateful to you for your  advocacy because it was your words, your examples that have helped to  get this done.   I want to say to everyone in Indiana and everyone in America how  grateful we are that this Right to Try Act has passed, and to Chairman  Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, thank you for working together to  make this happen.   I yield back.                            ____________________
