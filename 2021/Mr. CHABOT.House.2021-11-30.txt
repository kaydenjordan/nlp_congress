 Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to recognize and thank  for her 32 years of public service, Lebanon, Ohio's, retiring mayor,  Amy Brewer.   I had the pleasure of working with Amy on issues both large and small  for 10 years now since Lebanon became part of my congressional  district.   Mayor Brewer has been a tireless advocate for all things Lebanon  since she was first elected to city council there in 1989. After  serving on council for 12 years, she was elected mayor and has served  in that capacity for the last 20 years.  [[Page H6700]]    Anyone who knows Amy knows that she is a bundle of energy and that  she puts that enthusiasm to work for the people of, in my opinion, one  of the most picturesque, welcoming, and family-oriented communities not  only in Ohio, but in America.   Although saddened by Amy's retirement, the citizens of Lebanon have  benefited in so many ways from her leadership, from the overall quality  of life to improvements in the downtown landscape.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mayor Brewer for sharing the last 32 years of  her remarkable life with the good people of Lebanon, Ohio.                            ____________________
