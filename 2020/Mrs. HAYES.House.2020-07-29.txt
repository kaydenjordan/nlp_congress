 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Child Care  Is Essential Act.   From the beginning, this pandemic has exacerbated the existing  inequities in society and revealed the cracks that we have always known  existed in our childcare system.   The stress on this economy has left it teetering on the edge of total  collapse. The tone from parents and providers who call my office about  this issue have become increasingly more desperate.   Providers in Connecticut tell me stories about being behind on rent  payments, having to furlough workers, having to dip into their own  savings to stay solvent, and trying to figure out if there is a way to  safely open without continuing to mount debt.   We may lose over half of licensed childcare providers in my State.   Even before coronavirus, the childcare industry and families in  Connecticut were struggling. We often hear that there is dignity in  work, and without childcare, work can't happen for many people.   I am a working mother. I rely on before and aftercare, and right now,  like many of my constituents, I am struggling. We live in a country  where women contribute to the economy, where women contribute to  societies, where families are struggling to go back to work.                                time  1215     Mr. Speaker, that is why I am excited to be here today  with my colleagues, voting on legislation that will provide immediate  relief to community providers and inject stability into the childcare  industry.   This bill would keep the workers that help our children learn, grow,  and thrive employed. It would keep small businesses afloat and respond  to the crisis at hand.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Child Care Is  Essential Act and put their money where their mouths are.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, let me first start by saying that licensed  providers already receive this training, that licensed providers  already are equipped for identifying abuse and reporting abuse. Now is  not the time to focus on startups.  [[Page H3908]]    Today, I ask my colleagues to support childcare providers who need  help now, to not allow these pillars in our community to go bankrupt,  to prevent our most vulnerable children from becoming disconnected from  their childcare providers and centers.   Every working parent in this room and around the country knows the  feeling of vulnerability that comes with trusting your children in the  hands of someone in order to support your family.   Every working parent in this room and around the country knows the  sense of helplessness that comes when that critical care is in jeopardy  and your family is left scrambling for an alternative. That feeling of  helplessness is what parents across the country are facing right now in  the middle of a global pandemic as childcare centers have closed their  doors, many of them permanently.   Coronavirus has had a devastating effect on childcare providers.  Since March, almost a quarter of providers have lost their jobs, and as  many as two out of five centers have recently indicated that they will  go out of business without financial support. 4.5 million childcare  slots are at risk of disappearing, including over 46,000 in my own home  State of Connecticut. That is 4.5 million working families who will be  left behind without childcare.   It is frustrating to see my colleagues acting in such bad faith here  today, attempting to sabotage a commonsense plan that would help  Americans get back to work, that would help working parents and  children in their States as well as mine.   Let us talk about what the bill actually does. The Child Care Is  Essential Act provides $50 billion in grant funding within CCDBG for  providers to reopen and stay open safely. As part of receiving these  grants, the bill requires all providers to commit to employ and pay  their employees at pre-COVID-19 levels and to provide families with  relief in the cost of care.   H.R. 7027 requires providers to follow the CDC guidance and local  authorities to keep children and staff safe.   Yes, follow the science to keep children safe.   Childcare is not a partisan issue, or it should not be. Nine out of  10 Americans support a relief package like the Child Care Is Essential  Act. Our childcare industry enables millions of Americans to go back to  work and will help millions of parents fully return to the workforce  when the pandemic passes.   We cannot calculate the revenue of this industry without considering  the impact it has on the total overall economy.   As a body, and in a bipartisan way, we supported $50 billion in  relief to the airline industry. As a body, in a bipartisan way, we  supported $670 billion, without restrictions, to the restaurant  industry to save those businesses.   In all of these relief packages, childcare workers and providers were  left behind. We all talk about the need to reopen the economy, but that  can't happen without the necessary funding to ensure the sustainability  of childcare providers.   As the pandemic continues to race through this country due to this  administration's failed response, parents who are called back to work  have to make a difficult decision: either send their child back to a  childcare center or stay home and lose wages or potentially their jobs.   Show me your budget, and I will show you your values. That is  something that I often say. If we will not make childcare resources a  line item in our budget, we cannot claim it is our national priority.   My colleagues have a habit of saying they agree with the Democratic  proposal on the issue of childcare. But when it is time to make any  investments, they retreat. ``It is not a good use of taxpayer  dollars,'' is what they often say.    I remind you here today that the American families who are asking for  this help are the taxpayers.   In case there is any doubt here today, Republicans have made it  abundantly clear to the American people that they would rather use  taxpayer dollars to bail out private industry than support America's  working families and their children.   House Democrats are here to work for the people, here today to  address the childcare crisis in this country, something that my  colleagues should get serious about fast.   I encourage you all to join us in investing in high-quality childcare  and the industry that helps to make that happen.   Even as a high school teacher, it was always evident to me which  students attended high-quality childcare centers. Their language,  socialization skills, problem-solving skills, and increased parental  involvement were always evident. We have to support childcare. It is  essential.
