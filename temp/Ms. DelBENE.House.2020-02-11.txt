 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise today in order to form a more perfect union, and I do that by  supporting today's rule and the underlying  [[Page H1027]]  resolution which will finally allow for the 28th Amendment to the  Constitution, the equal rights amendment.   The equal rights amendment will enshrine the fundamental principle  that every American be afforded equal rights under the law, including  women.   In 1971 and 1972, Congress overwhelmingly passed the equal rights  amendment. And just a few weeks ago Virginia became the 38th State to  ratify it and the last State needed to amend our Constitution.                                time  1245    H.J. Res. 79 would remove the deadline for States to ratify the equal  rights amendment, clearing the path for full equality of rights for  women.   Because women are still subject to significant pay disparities and  sexual harassment, our work is far from over.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support today's rule  and the underlying resolution and join me in voting for a more perfect  union.
