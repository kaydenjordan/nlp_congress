 Madam President, I give heartfelt thanks to my colleague  from Illinois for bringing the experience of his service in the Senate  and his deliberate study of the challenges of international affairs to  bear on the gravity of the current situation where a policy has brought  us to the brink of conflict and we have no confidence that there is  wise judgment being exercised at this moment to ensure that there is  not a war.   I thank him for sharing the journey that he has been a part of and  that this Chamber has been part of and ringing the alarm bell that at  this moment, we have two key foreign policy advisors--our Secretary of  State and our National Security Advisor--who prefer weapons over  agreements, who have driven a strategy of maximum pressure designed to  make life extraordinarily difficult in Iran, to undo all the  international work of the previous years to end the nuclear program in  that country, and who are talking as if a conflict somewhere--maybe an  Iranian militia in Iraq--should be a trigger to a massive war, which is  why we are so worried about leaving this Chamber for even a day.   I thank him for raising his voice and sharing his experience.                            ____________________     Madam President, I come to the floor because I am losing  a key member of my foreign policy team who has wrestled with the issues  of the Middle East and who has been engaged in the dialogue and  conversation about a smart policy to end nuclear proliferation.  [[Page S3071]]    I can tell you that it is always, for any Senator, a moment that one  has a conflicted heart when a man or a woman on their team who has  contributed so much and has become part of the family, the Senate  family, is ready to take on a new challenge away from these Chambers to  develop their skills and to take their experience to a new extended  conversation. It is a bittersweet moment.   We are proud of what our team members have contributed and proud of  what they are going to contribute as they go off to a new  responsibility.   Today, that member of my team is Louie Reckford. Louie, seated behind  me, first came to my office in the fall of 2013 as part of that  semester's intern class, and it wasn't long before he stood out,  distinguished himself, and thus, when we were hiring a deputy scheduler  the following March, Louie's name was at the top of the list, and he  formally became a part of our team.   So for more than 5 years now, he has contributed. He has never  stopped distinguishing himself, taking on one task and one position  after another and excelling at every one of them. In his 2 years as  deputy scheduler, Louie fielded thousands of requests for meetings,  from constituents, from nonprofits, from local businesses and more,  making sure that every detail was right. His attention to detail and to  turnaround time made a very positive impression with all who contacted  our office.   Over the last 3 years, he has been an invaluable member of my  correspondence and foreign policy team, first as legislative  correspondent and later as legislative aide. On top of sending out  181,000 pieces of constituent mail, mail from my office to my  constituents, an average of 251 per day--on top of that, he has used  his considerable leadership skills and subject-matter experience and  strategic negotiating abilities to help pass a host of bills and  resolutions in committee and here on the floor. When our foreign policy  top staffer was transitioning into a new role as legislative director,  he stepped up to fill the gap, helping to manage a team with two  foreign policy fellows at that time. I could spend quite a lot more  time extolling his list of accomplishments--his instrumental role in  planning several international congressional delegations, his role in  helping me carve out a new role on the Foreign Relations Committee,  and, of course, that vital role of leading our office softball team.   I will just say that Louie will be deeply missed by all members of  Team Merkley, and we wish him well in his new adventure with Foreign  Policy for America, where he will continue to be an invaluable leader  of a myriad number of pressing foreign policy issues confronting our  Nation today.   Louie Reckford, we here in the Senate wish you all the best in your  next chapter of contributing to solving the complex international  issues that face our Nation.   Thank you, Madam President.
