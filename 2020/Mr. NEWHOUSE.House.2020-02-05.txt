 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.   We are all saddened, and deeply frustrated, to see the iconic Puget  Sound continue to devolve into a dumping ground of human waste and  sewage. It is no wonder, the species in our Nation's largest estuary  are facing increasing odds of extinction. We must do more to address  this environmental crisis.   An aquatic toxicologist working with the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration has found that growth rates for salmon  species in Puget Sound are stunned, metabolisms are distorted to the  point of starvation, and physiological functions are disrupted when  exposed to high levels of Prozac, caffeine, cholesterol medication,  ibuprofen, bug spray, cocaine, birth control pills, and dozens of other  drugs and personal care products present in Puget Sound.   Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to see my friends from the west side of  the State, Mr. Heck, who has spent a great deal of his illustrious  career working on this issue, as well as Mr. Kilmer, who has also spent  an inordinate amount of time working on this very, very important  issue, working to address the debilitating impact the environmental  degradation in Puget Sound is having on shellfish, on the endangered  salmon, and on steelhead. And, as was mentioned, on our iconic Southern  Resident killer whales, which are truly on the verge of extinction.                                time  1330    As my colleague Cathy McMorris Rodgers and I have been saying for  years, we must focus on solutions that the science tells us will  directly aid fish species now and not waste our precious resources and  time on political motivations like the efforts to tear down our dams.  This is a deadly distraction from the actual science-based solutions to  support salmon recovery.   I want to continue to work with my colleagues to address problems  facing endangered fish species throughout our region in a comprehensive  manner. The challenges are many:   We must continue to tackle the pinniped issue, the avian predation  issue, but we also must ensure that a robust hatchery program is in  place;   We must continue to prioritize the world-class fish passage in our  hydroelectric infrastructure;   We must continue to take a serious and thoughtful look at fishing and  other human-caused impacts; and   We must build upon the habitat improvements and greater ecological  conservation measures.   Mr. Speaker, we must focus on the science, not the politics. We must  focus on the facts, not ideology or emotions. While I support the  passage of this legislation--and I do--that we are voting on today, I  believe it can and should only move forward as part of a much more  comprehensive discussion and effort in the Pacific Northwest to address  the needs of our iconic species;  [[Page H795]]  the protection of our environment; the reliability of our clean,  renewable energy infrastructure; and, certainly, the future of our  region's economy and livelihood.
