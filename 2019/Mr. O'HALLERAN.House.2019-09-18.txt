 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay my respects to  Ronnie Lupe, former chairman of the White Mountain Apache Tribe, who  passed away last month at the age of 89.   During his time as a public servant, Mr. Lupe fought for Tribal  sovereignty and worked extensively on water rights issues. Mr. Lupe's  efforts aided the passage of the White Mountain Apache Water Rights  Quantification Act of 2009 and established a reservation-wide clean  drinking water system.   For his service to his Tribe, he was recognized by former Arizona  Governor Jack Williams on the Arizona Commission of Indian Affairs in  1968.   A veteran, Mr. Lupe was a member of the United States Marine Corps  during the Korean war.   Arizona lost an awesome voice for Native American advancement. I feel  truly humbled to have known him. Pat and I are keeping our thoughts  with Ronnie's family and the entire White Mountain Apache Tribe in our  prayers as they mourn his passing.                            ____________________
