 Madam Speaker, I rise as the son of a single mom and as  the brother of four sisters. Unfortunately, I have heard stories of  abuse and assault and neglect throughout my life. I also heard these  stories from my students and the many families I served throughout my  time in education. The consistency throughout these stories illustrate  how there is no recourse and there are no safe spaces for women to go  to when they are under assault and feeling abused.   Madam Speaker, this past year, before joining Congress, I sat with a  student and her mom in my office to call  [[Page H1461]]  a domestic violence help hotline. And we stayed on hold for hours  before anyone came to the phone. There was no housing for them to go to  in support of their safety. So I rise to support this legislation, and  I rise to denounce the sexism and patriarchy and misogyny that  continues to exist within our political arenas and within our laws.
