 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have great  respect for my distinguished friends and colleagues, including my  colleagues from Connecticut and from Georgia. I will also add that  there is no doubt that all of us owe a great debt of gratitude to the  brave men and women who fought and served in the Vietnam war. There is  no question that they endured unspeakable hardships there and, of  course, for many decades following their service.   For some, one of these hardships involved exposure to Agent Orange.  This very potent chemical was widely used by the U.S. military during  the Vietnam war as part of its herbicidal warfare program, and it has  proven to have been something that has caused major health problems for  the service men and women who were exposed to it. So Congress passed  the Agent Orange Act of 1991 to provide health benefits for those  servicemembers who were affected by it.   The act presumes the service connection for diseases caused by  herbicides for Active military, naval, or air servicemembers when, and  only when, there is scientific and medical evidence to support it.   In 2002, the VA removed the blue water Navy veterans from the  presumption of exposure, as they had looked at the data repeatedly  under multiple administrations and had not found evidence to grant the  presumption.   The bill now under consideration would restore this presumption to  the  [[Page S7836]]  blue water Navy veterans, but prudence demands that we wait until we  have more complete information and evidence to make this presumption.  In fact, previous studies have lumped all the branches of the services  together into their analyses or they focused solely on the Army. In  other words, they failed to differentiate between those who were Active  on the ground and those who were serving on ships miles offshore.   Now we have a chance to get that precise data. The VA is currently  undertaking a study, slotted to be released in the early months of  2019, that examines the myriad of health factors in Vietnam veterans  and specifically includes a subsample of blue water Navy veterans.   It is only right and only reasonable that Congress should examine  this study before making any presumption of a service connection for  all blue water Navy veterans from this war. The brave men and women who  have sacrificed so much for our country should undoubtedly get the  medical care they need in connection with their service.   As Members of this body, it is also our duty to ensure it is done in  a prudent and proper way, with all the relevant information available  to us. Our veterans deserve no less, and it is for this reason that I  have concerns with it.   I have received calls from Secretary Wilkie and from four previous VA  Secretaries, all of whom have said consistently that the VA has been  strapped with difficulties in recent years. We have to make sure the VA  has the tools it needs to offer the services it needs to offer to our  veterans. Doing something that would offset that, as these VA  Secretaries have concluded, would be unwise. On that basis, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I first want  to note that it has been suggested that there is only one objection to  Chai Feldblum's nomination to the EEOC. That is not true. I am among  those objectors; I am not the lone objector.   My objection to this nominee relates to my belief and religious  freedom. You see, religious freedom is very important to me. I am the  descendant of people who were ordered exterminated by the Governor of  Missouri on October 27, 1837. Religious intolerance cannot be tolerated  in this country, and I see a growing wave of religious intolerance. I  see a growing wave of sentiment of people suggesting that on the basis  of people's religious beliefs, they can be subject to adverse  government decisionmaking.   Ms. Feldblum has written that she sees a conflict between religious  belief and LGBT liberty as ``a zero-sum game'' where ``a gain for one  side necessarily entails a corresponding loss for the other side.'' I  see no reason why that should be the case, and I think that is  fundamentally incompatible with our Nation's long tradition of  pluralism and religious freedom.   Make no mistake--there is no mystery about which side Ms. Feldblum  thinks should win. In a separate speech, she said: ``There can be a  conflict between religious liberty and sexual liberty, but in almost  all cases, the sexual liberty should win. . . . I'm having a hard time  coming up with any case in which religious liberty should win.''   I find these remarks stunning, especially because an entire amendment  to the U.S. Constitution--the very first one, by the way--is devoted to  religious liberty. These are not the words  [[Page S7863]]  of an open-minded jurist. These are not the words of an open-minded  lawyer. These are the words of an activist intent on stamping out all  opposition to her cause. In fact, she has even said as much. She said:  ``[G]ranting liberty to gay people . . . cannot be adequately advanced  if `pockets of resistance' are permitted to flourish.'' Who is she to  decide whether someone should be permitted to persist in their own  religious belief simply because those beliefs happen to conflict with a  particular political world view?   As an EEO Commissioner, Ms. Feldblum would be in a prime position to  stamp out those pockets of resistance. She herself has noted:         The EEOC has jurisdiction only over employment. But other       Federal agencies that enforce sex discrimination provisions       often look to our interpretation for guidance in interpreting       the laws they enforce.    The Federal Government should never be used as a tool to stamp out  religious liberty--that principle which is so central to our Nation's  founding and to human happiness itself. It is so important that we have  to stand behind it. Ms. Feldblum, however, wants to deny exactly that.  On that basis, I object to her confirmation.    Mr. President, I offer up a counteroffer. I am fine with the  other two EEOC Commissioners. If that is what we are worried about--the  ability of the EEOC to do its business--fine. I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following  nominations: Executive Calendar Nos. 379 and 381; and that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate   Mr. President. Is there objection?    Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, we have a  bill here that we received at 10 o'clock this morning, and it is 680- pages long. I have spent many hours reviewing it. This is a bill that  came out of the committee on which I serve. I have been  [[Page S7900]]  trying for many weeks, through the chairman of that committee and her  staff, to get language or to at least get an outline of this. We were  not able to get that until today at 10 a.m. Even after we got that, we  asked for at least an outline of this bill or for a summary of the bill  text from the committee staff, from the chairman's staff. They didn't  respond to us. They wouldn't give it to us, just as they haven't for  weeks. We got this--the closest thing to a summary--from a lobbyist. We  had to wait to get it from a lobbyist.   This is of great impact to my State. This bill creates 1.3 million  acres of wilderness, about half of which is in my State. This bill  permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is  an entity that has been used to acquire more Federal land. Now, in  coming from a State where two-thirds of the land is owned by the  Federal Government--where we can't do anything without leave from the  Federal Government--this hurts. In coming from a State where we have  had about 2 million acres of Federal land declared as monuments through  Presidential proclamations, this hurts.   I have made what I consider to be a very reasonable offer, and I ask  that it be accepted. It involves two words. I want the inclusion of two  words in this bill--two words. Add the words ``or Utah'' to some  language in the Antiquities Act.   I have an amendment that I will counteroffer. I will accept this bill  and agree to its passage if these two words are added to the  Antiquities Act, the words ``or Utah.'' I ask that my colleagues accept  this.    Yes, I object.    Mr. President, I find it unfortunate that the addition of  two words is somehow unacceptable to the Members of this body--two  words. They are two words, by the way, that would put Utah in the same  category as Alaska and Wyoming. What do those States have in common?  They both have repeatedly been victims of the Antiquities Act.   You see, in every single State from Colorado to the west of Colorado,  the Federal Government owns at least 15 percent of the land. In many of  those States, it is much more than 15 percent of the land. In my State,  it is two-thirds of the land--about 67 percent. What that means is that  we have to get permission from the Federal Government to do just about  everything.   What that also means is that our schools are underfunded--everything  from fire, search, rescue, education, local governance. All of these  budgets are underfunded as a result of the fact that most of the land  is owned by the Federal Government. We can't tax that land. We receive  pennies on the dollar for a program called payment in lieu of taxes. It  is pennies on the dollar because most of our land is not ours. Most of  our land cannot be developed privately. Most of our land cannot be  taxed by the States and localities,  [[Page S7901]]  which makes it harder for us to educate our children, for us to secure  our streets, for us to put out fires--fires, by the way, that become  far more severe because of extensive Federal landownership, which is  plainly excessive, which is plainly unfair, which kills people and  results in devastating losses not only to property but also to the  health of the environment.   Bad Federal land management policy is at the root of this. Do you  know what is interesting? People like to talk a lot about these  wildfires. A lot of them occur in the West. Why? Well, there is a lot  of Federal public land in the West. Yes, there are parts of the country  where they have forests where these things don't happen, and when they  do, they are put out much faster in things called private forests.  Privately owned forests and forests owned by many States are much less  prone to wildfires, and when they do occur, they put them out more  quickly. Why? Because they are not hobbled under a mountain of  regulations that makes it almost impossible for us to prevent them and  then from putting them out quickly. This is devastating to our States.  It is a burden on our States and on our State in particular.   Many of you, if you live east of the Rocky Mountains, come from lands  where Federal public lands are almost unheard of, where they are rare,  where you have private land left and right. A lot of those same States  used to be mostly Federal. A State like Illinois used to be  overwhelmingly Federal. Many, if not most, of the States have added,  since the Louisiana Purchase, language in their enabling legislation,  anticipating that, in time, Federal public land within a State's  boundaries would be sold and that in the case of my State and that of  many other States, a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of that  land would be put into a trust fund for the benefit of the States'  public education systems.   Those promises were honored in the Dakotas and in States like Indiana  and Illinois. They were honored as we expanded westward. For some  reason, when we got to the Rocky Mountains, they stopped honoring them.  There are a lot of reasons for this. Some of it has to do with what we  were occupied with doing as a country at the time. Some of it has to do  with the fact that our land is what was regarded as rugged and perhaps  undesirable for a time. But the understanding was still there, just as  it was the understanding in the Dakotas and in States like Indiana and  Illinois.    The effects are still there. We are still impoverished. Our ability  to expand economically is impaired, and the health of our environment  is significantly degraded as a result of this excessive, unnecessary  Federal landownership.   Now, make no mistake--I am not talking here about national parks.  People like to caricature those who complain about excessive Federal  landownership and suggest--as if we are going to put oil drilling rigs  underneath Delicate Arch and other national treasures. That is not what  we are talking about at all. I am talking about garden variety, Federal  public land--land that is excessively restricted and that is  environmentally degraded as a result of poor Federal land management  policies. Why? Well, because these decisions are made by Federal  landing managers who live and work and make decisions many hundreds and  in many cases many thousands of miles from those most affected by those  decisions.   How, then, does this relate to the Antiquities Act? Well, a State  like mine that has a lot of Federal public land, like Alaska and  Wyoming do, is particularly, uniquely vulnerable to predatory practices  under the Antiquities Act, allowing the President of the United States,  under a law passed over a century ago, to utilize his discretion to set  aside land as a national monument. It is already Federal; this is  putting it into a new classification--a classification subject to even  more restrictions, eligible for even less development, less human  activity, less access for recreational or agricultural or religious or  cultural purposes. When you put it in that category, it makes it even  more difficult for those people surrounding it, those people living in  and around the Federal public lands in question.   So Utah, like Wyoming and Alaska, has had a whole lot of Presidents  declare a whole lot of Federal public land, national monument land.   Now, fortunately for the States of Alaska and Wyoming, they have had  congressional delegations that in the past have said, no more, have  demanded relief, and have said that they have had enough. In the case  of a State like mine that has had a couple of million acres, roughly,  of Federal public land declared monument by a Presidential  proclamation, this is important. If it is good enough for Alaska, if it  is good enough for Wyoming, why not extend the same courtesy to the  State of Utah?   Why, when a bill is 680 pages long--which I received at 10 a.m.  today, on what may well be the last or penultimate day of this  legislative session of this Congress--why are we receiving this just  now, especially in the Senate during a term of Congress when it was  originally believed that we might be adjourning by December 6 or 7 or  13 or 14?   Here it is on December 19--my daughter's 18th birthday, by the way;  happy birthday, Eliza--December 19, and we are just getting this bill  for the first time today. What does that mean?   If we had adjourned when we were originally thinking we might  adjourn, would this never have happened? It has been suggested to us by  some Members and some staff that had we adjourned earlier, this would  have just been released perhaps on the last day of the session.   I can't get into anyone else's head. I can't peer into anyone else's  subjective intentions. But this makes me kind of nervous, the fact  that, yes, I sit on the committee from whence this bill originated,  and, yes, I chair the Public Lands Subcommittee, yet there are a whole  lot of these that the chairman or the ranking member know darn well  that I oppose, that I voted against in committee, and there are other  provisions that they know I have had longstanding concerns with. I  wonder if maybe, just maybe, that is part of the reason they wouldn't  tell me what was in it.   I understand it is difficult negotiating a big piece of legislation.  I sympathize greatly with that. I am not suggesting that short of  receiving the entire 680-page document exactly as it has been  submitted, I would irrevocably have bound myself to voting against it.  I am not suggesting that at all. It would have been nice to have a  roadmap, to have some clue as to what might have been in there. And I  know from conversations I have since had with Members today that they  have known for weeks, if not months, that they were putting permanent  LWCF reauthorization in this bill.   I don't believe it was a coincidence that I wasn't informed of this.  I don't believe it was a coincidence that even after this bill was  released at 10 a.m. today, the staff of the committee refused even to  give me an outline--an outline--of what was in the bill, even after  they had filed it. We had to get this from a lobbyist.   This is wrong. It is wrong that the State of Utah is treated the way  it is. It is wrong that you wouldn't give us that language. It is wrong  that you won't treat us the same way Alaska and Wyoming are treated.   This is wrong. We can do better. I implore my colleagues to make this  simple change. Two words. Two words. Add the words ``for Utah'' to this  bill, and I will wholeheartedly support it. If not, I will continue to  oppose it.   Thank you.    Will the Senator yield?    Do the people of Colorado care that you were--    Mr. President, all I am asking is for the language that I  have asked for--two words, the words ``for Utah''--to be added to this  legislation. I am asking to be treated on equal footing as the language  proposed by the Senator from Colorado, the Senator from Alaska, the  Senator from Washington, the Senator from Montana, and others--equal  footing.   We have equal representation in the Senate. It is the one type of  constitutional amendment that is preemptively unconstitutional. You  can't modify the equal representation of the Senate. That is what makes  this place unique. Each State is represented equally, and I will defend  my State, the State of Utah, to my dying breath. As long as I am here  breathing and holding an election certificate, I will defend it.   My distinguished friend and colleague, for whom I have great  affection and respect, has just pointed out that the people of Colorado  might be disappointed about this water measure that was in there or  this or that other provision for Colorado. Do they have reason to be  concerned? You bet. Do those people in Colorado have objection to the  idea that Utah might be treated equally with Alaska or Wyoming? I think  not. I think most people in America would look at a State that has had  a couple of million acres of monument declared and that just wants to  be treated the same way as Alaska and Wyoming and say that is not  unreasonable.   This is a sovereign State, one that has been mistreated by Federal  land managers. We don't want to continue doing that. This is a generous  offer. It is a reasonable offer.   As to the suggestion that because it was offered that this receive a  separate vote--and it is really not equivalent at all. What he is  saying is, split this out; everything else sinks or swims together. All  of theirs pass, and ours stands alone. If we are going to consolidate  this many bills at once--and he is right: Some of these passed out  unanimously, and a bunch of them didn't. I voted against a number of  them. Some of them are new. Some are old but have been modified. One  provision involving my own State involved 450,000 or 500,000 acres of  wilderness and has, since it moved through the committee, been modified  to include an additional 200,000 acres of wilderness. That is from my  State, and I sit on the committee, and I chair the subcommittee that is  supposed to review these things, and this is the first I have seen of  them.   So, yes, I say to my distinguished friend and colleague, for whom I  also have great respect and admiration and affection, yes, there are a  lot of parochial matters that are addressed in these public lands  bills, and appropriately so. What I am asking is for my State to be  treated like your State. That is all I am asking. It is not  unreasonable. It is not unfair.   So if you are going to have 640 pages' worth of legislation,  including some legislation that has some significant ramifications for  my State, I ask you to put those two words into the bill. That is not  unreasonable.   I yield the floor.
