 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important resolution  affirming Israel's right to self-defense against this savage war  perpetrated by Hamas and other Iranian-backed terrorists.   While it was Hamas terrorists who invaded peaceful communities across  Israel, decapitating babies, burning elderly women alive, kidnapping  innocent civilians, including Holocaust survivors, it was Iran that was  working behind the scenes to fund these acts of terror.   I support this resolution because it calls out the mullahs in Tehran  for funding Hamas and enabling this attack to occur.   How did this happen? In short, it happened because the Biden  administration's foreign policy allowed it to happen. Our government  designated Iran as a state sponsor of terror, yet the Biden  administration pursued a policy of weakness and appeasement toward  Tehran.   Since the Biden administration took office, Iran has generated  approximately $80 billion in revenue from oil sales, and that is  because this administration rolled back the Trump administration's  successful maximum pressure campaign.    In 2021, the administration lifted oil sanctions on Iran.  The sanctions relief was so helpful to the regime that the deputy chief  of the Central Bank of Iran said that Iran's foreign currency reserves  were growing due to the growth of oil and other exports.   For months, Secretary Blinken, National Security Advisor Sullivan,  and other officials have chased another JCPOA to release billions of  dollars in sanction assets. Now we see the administration effectively  incentivize Hamas  [[Page H5059]]  to take American hostages by facilitating the transfer of $6 billion  from South Korea to Iranian banks in Qatar, a deal that this  administration claims it has frozen for now but Qatar and Iran say is  available to them today. Support this resolution.
