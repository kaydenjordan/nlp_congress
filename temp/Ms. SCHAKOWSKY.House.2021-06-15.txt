 Madam Speaker, I appreciate Congressman Bowman's  organizing this on behalf of the Congressional Progressive Caucus,  which I am so proud to be a member of, and I really am grateful to him.   Let me just say this in no uncertain terms. Care infrastructure is  infrastructure, and it is especially true for women whose opportunities  are often limited because we don't really have a working care economy  right now.   Every single day nearly 10,000 people turn 65 years old in the United  States of America, and yet we do not have in the United States a long- term-care policy. Think about it. The United States of America does not  have a real long-term-care policy.   Every family tries to figure out for itself, What are we going to do  when grandma and grandpa get older? What are we going to do when I get  older? What is the plan? Most people when they retire or have to retire  actually don't have enough money to really make the kinds of decisions  that they need to and will come up.   Of the people who turn 65, between 50 and 70 percent at that time  need some sort of support or care. Where does that come from? Let me be  clear; it mostly comes from women.   There is a sociologist who says many countries have a safety net; the  United States has women. Paid and unpaid caregivers are women.   Let's talk about the paid caregivers first. People who work in  nursing homes, people who work in home care. They make an average of  about $12 an hour, with no benefits. You can't live on that. They  certainly can't plan for their retirement and to pay for someone to  care for them.   And so what do we do? It is pretty clear what has to be done, and  actually the Biden administration has actually begun to do it, because  everyone should be able to provide and care for their families at any  age, for childcare, and certainly for long-term care for the elderly,  which is a particular concern of mine.   I am the co-chair of the Democratic Caucus Task Force on Aging and  Families, and I am proud of that, coming up with proposals that are  going to help our elderly. It is projected that right now we will need  about 4 million additional caregivers, people who are either paid or  unpaid, by 2028. That is just really around the corner. 4 million. We  do not have enough.   First of all, we have to pay the workers a living wage. Now,  President Biden  [[Page H2811]]  has come up with a plan for $400 billion for home and community-based  care. That is a lot of money. It can be a game changer.   The idea is to be able to provide more money, more wages for those  who suit up every day and go to work, and during the pandemic often in  very dangerous situations where they don't have enough of the PPE, the  personal protective equipment, to take care of them and protect them  against the virus. They suit up every day and go to work and can barely  take care of their own families.   And what about all the women who have had to leave the workforce  because they did not have anyone to care for their children or for  their parents or both? The sandwich generation has to worry about  making sure that they have someone to care for their children and  someone who will help them to take care of their elderly relatives.  That burden has fallen on women who have ended up having to leave the  workforce.   We need to act now. We need to act to fill this gap, to have a real  program for long-term care, to have real help for childcare so that  women can go to work to care for their families, to have the income  that it really takes.   This is not rocket science. It is that we need to pay attention. We  need to have the policies in place. We need to have the infrastructure  in place, the plan on how we are going to deliver the care that is  needed. Without it, we will not be able to move forward economically in  this country, and certainly women will pay, especially pay, the price,  and often it is women that are low income, women of color that suffer.                                time  1930    So I am happy that we are seeing the Biden administration, we are  seeing the Democrats, we are seeing the progressives move forward with  that plan that will actually provide the infrastructure we need.   And let me just end by saying that care infrastructure is  infrastructure.
