 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Nation  observed National Miners Day, which was designated by Congress to honor  the contributions and sacrifices of miners both past and present.   Mr. Speaker, I am the proud grandson of a Pennsylvania coal miner.  National Miners Day does mark the anniversary of the worst mining  accident in history on December 6, 1907, in Monongah, West Virginia.  The disaster resulted in the death of 362 miners.   While technology in mining has continued to improve, mining remains  difficult work. Every day, our Nation's miners work so hard excavating  minerals for energy production and raw materials for many forms of  manufacturing. In particular--my family heritage--I am very proud of  our Pennsylvania coal miners who really dug the coal that fueled the  industrial revolution and provided the energy for fueling our  preparations to win World War I and World War II.   From coal to copper, and from gold to granite, miners work to provide  materials that play an important role in our everyday lives. American  miners today deliver the same commitment to the industry that they  historically have. But thanks to advancements in technology, we are  seeing the industry operate smarter, faster, and, most importantly,  safer.   Americans benefit from the energy, metals, and minerals made  available to us thanks to mining. It is as fundamental today as it was  centuries ago.   Mr. Speaker, to all of our miners, I say: Thank you for all you have  given to this important industry.                 Congratulating the Titusville Area Hospital     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Titusville Area Hospital on a national recognition for  overall excellence in patient perspective.   The award, which is presented by the National Organization of State  Offices of Rural Health, was announced on National Rural Health Day.  Titusville Area Hospital CEO Lee Clinton called the award a true honor  and added that he is very proud of the care provided and the level of  expertise offered to the citizens served at the Titusville Area  Hospital.   He said: ``All of our staff strives to provide each patient with the  best possible experience every time. This award demonstrates our  ability to exceed as a small, rural community hospital.''   Mr. Speaker, our rural hospitals face complex challenges that range  from financial concerns to a shortage of healthcare professionals.  Thankfully, the Titusville Area Hospital is being recognized as a top  performer that is increasing patient satisfaction, and I am proud that  it sets the standard for other rural hospitals.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly congratulate CEO Lee Clinton and all of  the staff of the Titusville Area Hospital on this outstanding  achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, 76 years ago today, our  Nation witnessed a devastating attack at a naval base in Pearl Harbor,  Hawaii. That event hastened our entry into World War II.   The surprise attack by the Japanese on the morning of December 7,  1941, left 2,403 people dead. Among them were members of the U.S. Navy,  Army, Marines, and also civilians. It was one of the deadliest attacks  in American history. President Franklin D. Roosevelt described it as  ``a date which will live in infamy.''   On this solemn day of commemoration, we remember and we reflect.  Flags throughout our country are flown at halfstaff in honor of Pearl  Harbor Remembrance Day.   Mr. Speaker, let us remember and honor the lives of those brave  Americans who perished on this day 76 years ago. As President Roosevelt  said: ``No matter how long it will take us to overcome this  premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might  will win through to absolute victory.'' And we did.   God bless all of our Pearl Harbor victims and survivors, and God  bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
