 Mr. Speaker, let me begin by saying to my brother, Steve,  back in Ohio: I am so very proud of you, your courage, your goodness,  and your honor.   Mr. Speaker, meanwhile, President Trump and the Republicans are doing  everything to railroad tax breaks through this Congress to the top 1  percent with no open hearings, with deals being cut in the Speaker's  office. So I say: Whoa.   It is worth taking a step back to talk about what a good tax plan  contains. A good tax plan puts money back in the pockets of middle  class working families and small business owners. A good tax plan spurs  job creation right here in the U.S.A. Yet everything we have seen and  heard from the Republicans does exactly the opposite.   The goal should be to create more stability in our economy, not raise  the deficit. We have got to stop businesses from shipping jobs overseas  as companies hold their money offshore. They should bring it back home.   Tax reform shouldn't be negotiated in secret. Why should lobbyists  know more about the bill than Members of Congress? A tax bill shouldn't  explode our deficit or threaten your 401(k) plan or hurt Medicare and  Medicaid.   It is time for Republicans to do their jobs, put forward a budget- balancing tax plan that helps American families, not just billionaires  and multimillionaires; and bring the plan forward in sunlight, not  backroom dealings.                            ____________________
