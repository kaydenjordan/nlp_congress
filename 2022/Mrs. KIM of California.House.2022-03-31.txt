 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oklahoma for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Ranking Member Lucas' motion to  instruct.   This motion will agree with section 2502 included in USICA, which  prohibits entities identified as Chinese military companies from  receiving  [[Page H4049]]  funds through the new technology directorate, the supply chain  resiliency program, the regional innovation program, or the  Manufacturing USA program.   In other words, this motion ensures taxpayer dollars spent in this  bill do not go toward the Chinese Communist Party.   On the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, we spent several  months working on a series of bipartisan competitiveness bills that we  could have gone to conference with. Unfortunately, with little notice,  we voted on a 3,000-page bill that was not bipartisan, did not include  strong protections to safeguard U.S. investments from CCP, and provided  $8 billion for a climate slush fund that we have zero oversight over  and China has already taken $100 million from.   Republicans offered several amendments with similar language to that  of Ranking Member Lucas' motion to instruct in the Rules Committee, but  unfortunately, the majority did not allow them to be considered on the  House floor.   The CCP is watching us. Today, we have an opportunity to send a  strong bipartisan and bicameral message: We are bolstering American  competitiveness and national security to ensure we lead in the  development and deployment of the technologies of the future.   It is imperative we have guardrails, such as Mr. Lucas' motion to  instruct, in order to ensure these investments do not fall into the  hands of the CCP and to attain a true bipartisan, bicameral agreement.   I thank Ranking Member Lucas for his leadership and his motion.
