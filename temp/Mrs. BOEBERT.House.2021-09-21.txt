 Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.   Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed.                   Amendment No. 16 Offered by Ms. DeGette     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  yielding his time and for his leadership and protecting freedom for  multiple uses of our public lands by opposing sloppy Democrat land  grabs like the ones contained in this amendment.   This amendment is loaded with more than 30 different land grabs that  undermine our national security interests. I have actually traveled in  helicopters with our servicemen and servicewomen who say that this bill  would hinder the land that they currently practice over, with these  wilderness designations, and it would prevent them from amazing  training that they do, bringing people in worldwide.   The U.S. Department of Defense uses 750,000 tons of minerals each  year for equipment and other important technologies. Copper is used to  manufacture military planes and ships. Silver is used in Apache  helicopters. Beryllium is used to enhance the speed of fighter jets.  Molybdenum is used for armored vehicles, missiles, and aircraft.   The amendment we are discussing proposes to add nearly 1.5 million  acres of new wilderness and permanently withdraws 1.2 million acres  from mineral production.   Again, our Department of Defense needs 750,000 tons of minerals each  year. This amendment permanently withdraws 1.2 million acres that  contain critical minerals and other rare earths that we need for  defense, to protect our men and women in uniform.   Approximately 550,000 of those 1.5 million acres that would be locked  up by these new wilderness designations are in my district. Now, can  you imagine if I had a bill designating the 16th Street Mall in Denver,  Colorado, and said that there would be a wilderness designation. I  mean, it is wild and scenic, but I don't have a bill that does such  because I tend to my district.   None of the Colorado acres proposed for the wilderness designation in  this amendment are located in the district represented by the sponsor  of this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.    Madam Speaker, this amendment, which has nothing to do  with the national defense, creates significant land restrictions on  nearly 400,000 acres of land in Colorado.   This entirely inappropriate amendment to the NDAA seeks to create  73,068 acres of new wilderness in Colorado, which will severely  restrict all forms of recreation, much-needed management, and economic  activity. We can all agree that we need forest management, and the  answer is not a hands-off approach.   While there are a lot of terrible policies in this amendment, one of  my biggest concerns is the increased threat of disastrous wildfires  that will result from the new wilderness designations and other land  grabs in this bill.   Colorado just came out of one of the worst wildfire seasons we have  ever experienced. In 2020 the U.S. set a new record for the number of  acres burned by wildfires, as more than 10.3 million acres went up in  smoke.   Wilderness is the most restrictive land use designation possible, and  it prevents active management in our forests, which is critical to  prevent catastrophic wildfires.   I have spent months meeting with foresters, experts in the timber  industry, and active management advocates. Every one of them has said  we do not need wilderness areas in Colorado, and wilderness areas  prevent active management of our forests and have exacerbated  catastrophic wildfires.   Madam Speaker, this amendment is a blatant attempt to sneak a deeply  partisan environmentalist wish list into the vital and important  funding vehicle of our Nation's defense.                                time  2340
