 Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot allow our  veterans to fall into homelessness, end up jobless, or go without the  basic services that they deserve. These challenges have only been  exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.   I am proud to lead the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans  Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act so that we can do right by our  veterans during this pandemic and beyond.   This legislation includes several of my bipartisan bills. It includes  the Reducing Veteran Homelessness Act and the Homeless Veteran  Coronavirus Response Act to lift veterans out of homelessness.   It includes the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder  Transition Improvement Act to ease the transition to civilian life and  help veterans build meaningful careers.   It includes the Protect the GI Bill Act and the Pandemic Assistance  for Student Veterans Act to help veterans make the most of their GI  Bill benefits.   It includes the Brian Tally VA Employment Transparency Act to protect  veterans' legal rights.   This legislation will make a real difference for veterans across the  country, and I am proud of the bipartisan progress we are making today.
