 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it took 4 weeks--4 weeks, but the  Democratic majority in the House of Representatives is finally ready-- finally ready--to defend their impeachment of the President of the  United States.   After weeks of delay, the Speaker of the House decided yesterday that  a trial could finally go forward. She signed the impeachment papers.  That took place at a table with a political slogan stuck onto it. And  they posed--they posed--afterward for smiling photos. And the Speaker  distributed souvenir pens--souvenir pens--to her own colleagues,  emblazoned with her golden signature that literally came in on silver  platters. The pens literally came in on silver platters. There were  golden pens on silver platters, a souvenir to celebrate the moment.   I seem to remember Democrats falling over themselves to say they did  not see impeachment as a long-sought political win. House Democrats  said over and over that they recognized the gravity and the seriousness  of this action, and, of course, they had only come to it reluctantly.  Well, nothing says seriousness and sobriety like handing out souvenirs,  as though this were a happy bill-signing instead of the gravest process  in our Constitution.   This final display neatly distilled the House's partisan process into  one perfect visual. It was a transparently partisan performance from  beginning to end.   That is why they sped through a slapdash inquiry in 12 weeks, when  previous Presidential impeachments came after months, if not years, of  investigations and hearings. That is why the House cut short their own  inquiry, declined to pursue their own subpoenas, and denied the  President due process, but now--now they want the Senate to redo their  homework and rerun the investigation.   That is why our colleague the Democratic leader told the press that  whatever happens next, as long as he can weaponize the trial to hurt  the Republicans in the 2020 election, ``it's a win-win.'' That is what  the Democratic leader of the Senate said.  [[Page S256]]    That is why the Speaker of the House apparently saw nothing strange  about celebrating the third Presidential impeachment in American  history with souvenirs and posed for photographs--souvenirs and posed  photographs.   That pretty well sums it up. That is what the process has been thus  far, but it is not what this process will be going forward.   The Founding Fathers who crafted and ratified our Constitution knew  that our Nation might sometimes fall prey to the kind of dangerous  factualism and partisanship that has consumed--literally consumed the  House of Representatives.   The Framers set up the Senate specifically to act as a check against  the short-termism and the runaway passions to which the House of  Representatives might fall victim.   Alexander Hamilton worried that ``the demon of faction'' would  ``extend his scepter'' over the House majorities ``at certain  seasons.'' That is what Alexander Hamilton said. He feared for the  viability of the government established by the Constitution if, blinded  by factualism, the House of Representatives would abuse the power of  impeachment to serve nakedly partisan goals rather than long-term  interests of the American people and their Republic, but, fortunately,  they did something about it.   They did not give both the power to impeach and the power to remove  to the House. They divided the power and placed the final decision on  removal over here in the Senate.   This body, this Chamber, exists precisely--precisely so we can look  past the daily dramas and understand how our actions will reverberate  for generations; so we can put aside animal reflexes and animosity and  coolly consider how to best serve our country in the long run; so we  can break factional fevers before they jeopardize the core institutions  of our government.   As Hamilton put it, only the Senate, with ``confidence enough in its  own situation,'' can ``preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary  impartiality between an individual accused, and the representatives of  the people, his accusers.''   The House's hour is over. The Senate's time is at hand. It is time  for this proud body to honor our founding purpose.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter,  before we turn to the trial in earnest, the Senate has one more major  accomplishment to deliver to the American people.   Yesterday we began floor consideration of the most significant update  to the North American trade policy in nearly 30 years. In just a couple  of hours, we are going to pass the USMCA and send it to President Trump  for his signature.   It was back in 2018 when the Trump administration finalized its talks  with the Governments of Mexico and Canada. This has been a major  priority for the President and for many of us in both Houses of  Congress.   That is because American livelihoods in every corner of every State  depend on these critical trading relationships. Farmers, growers,  cattlemen, manufacturers, small businesses, big businesses--this is a  major step for our whole country.   In the 26 years since the ratification of NAFTA, trade with Mexico  and Canada has come to directly support 12 million American jobs--12  million workers and their families who depend on robust trade with our  North American neighbors. Our neighbors to the north and south purchase  half a trillion dollars in American goods and services every single  year. That includes more than a quarter of all the food and  agricultural products we export. Take my home State of Kentucky as an  example. Mexico and Canada buy $300 million of agricultural exports  from Kentucky growers and producers every year. They buy $9.9 billion  of our State's manufacturing exports--and on and on. Commerce with our  neighbors is essential across the board.   No wonder experts estimate that USMCA would create 176,000 new  American jobs. No wonder they predict it will yield tens of billions of  dollars in economic growth. No wonder farmers, ranchers, steelworkers,  and manufacturers across our country have been so eager to see the  USMCA signed, sealed, and delivered. In one recent letter, Kentucky  farmers told me: ``We need the agreement ratified, and we need it to  happen now.''   I know my colleagues have been hearing the same thing from their home  States. Republicans, Democrats, Senators, Representatives--our incoming  has been the same: Get this deal passed. Failure is not an option.   Of course, for far too long, our counterparts in the House kept all  these Americans waiting. It took more than a year and a lot of pressure  from Senate Republicans to get the Speaker of the House to stop  blocking the trade deal and finally let the House vote on it. Late last  year, she finally relented. It passed by a big bipartisan margin, of  course, and I now expect that kind of vote will repeat itself here in  the Senate.   I am especially grateful to our colleagues and counterparts who got  this across the finish line: to the U.S. Trade Representative, Bob  Lighthizer, and his hard-working team, led by his chief of staff,  Jamieson Greer; to Chairman Grassley for leading the bipartisan effort  in the Senate Finance Committee and his trade team, led by Nasim  Fussell; to Ranking Member Wyden and his trade counsel, Jayme White,  and all of our Finance Committee colleagues and staff; and to the  chairmen of our other committees of jurisdiction who worked nimbly to  get this done.   I want to thank the exceptional Cloakroom staff--in particular,  Christopher Tuck.   I would like to thank members of my own team whose efforts were  invaluable, most especially my chief economic policy council, Jay  Khosla, whose role in securing this agreement has been absolutely  essential; Ali Nepola in my personal office; Erica Suares and my  leadership policy advisers; and, of course, their fearless leaders,  Sharon Soderstrom, my chief of staff, and my deputy chief of staff for  policy, Scott Raab.   Of course, I am most grateful to President Trump for prioritizing,  negotiating, and delivering on this major promise. Today the Senate  will send this landmark agreement to the President's desk--a big  bipartisan win. It comes the very same week as President Trump also  signed phase one of his administration's trade agreement with China-- quite a week of substantive accomplishments for the Nation, for the  President, and for our international trade. Both of these measures will  only add to all the other Republican policies of the past 3 years that  have helped generate this historically strong economic moment for  working Americans and for their families.   I would urge every one of our colleagues to join me in voting to pass  the USMCA.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate has remained in session this  afternoon following the first meeting of our impeachment trial. History  will not only remember today for the first steps of the trial, but  today was also a tremendous bipartisan legislative accomplishment for  the American people.   The Senate passed USMCA, President Trump's historic new trade  agreement with Canada and Mexico, by a vote of 89 to 10. Now this  landmark deal, which experts estimate will add tens of billions of  dollars to the U.S. economy and create 176,000 new jobs, is on its way  to the White House to be signed into law by the President.   This was a major priority for farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, small  businesses, and working families across the entire country, and, today,  the Senate got it done.   We also passed another important bill that will keep analogues of the  dangerous drug fentanyl designated as schedule I narcotics. It will  keep them appropriately listed among the most dangerous illegal drugs  and keep this important tool in the hands of law enforcement. The  legislation also preserves mandatory minimum sentences for the  criminals who unleash these dangerous poisons on our streets.   Law enforcement officials from Kentucky and across the Nation have  been pleading with Congress for months to keep these tools in place.  But our Democratic colleagues have resisted Republican efforts to make  these temporary measures permanent.   Finally, this week, thanks to Chairman Graham and the Judiciary  Committee, we were at least able to get an agreement to prevent these  measures from expiring for now.   There is a lot of work to do. Fentanyl and these analogues are a  plague--a plague. They kill more Kentuckians than any other illegal  drug--nearly 800 overdose deaths in 2018 alone, just in my State. The  problem, of course, is nationwide. We are going to stay in the fight  and keep working, but today's victory was an important step.   The Senate will next convene on Tuesday. As I discussed this morning,  an impeachment trial is just about the most serious business in which  the U.S. Senate can engage. The Founding Fathers gave us this task for  a reason. They had confidence in the Senate for a reason. They knew  this institution could do what was right for our Nation, so I am  confident that we can prove our Framers right in the days that lie  ahead.                               MORNING BUSINESS     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of all nominations  on the Secretary's desk; that the nominations be confirmed, the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that  any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions which were submitted earlier today: S. Res 476, S. Res.  477, and S. Res. 478.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on  Tuesday, January 21, from 10 a.m. until 11 a.m., while the Senate is  sitting as a court of impeachment and notwithstanding the Senate's  adjournment, the Senate can receive House messages and executive  matters, committees be authorized to report legislative and executive  matters, and Senators be allowed to submit statements for the Record,  bills and resolutions and cosponsor requests, and, where applicable,  the Secretary of the Senate, on behalf of the Presiding Officer, be  permitted to refer such matters.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 2 p.m. on Friday,  January 17, for a pro forma session only, with no business being  conducted; further, when the Senate adjourns on Friday, January 17, it  next convene at 12:30 p.m. on Tuesday, January 21; further, following  the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day and morning business be closed;  finally, following leader remarks, the Senate recess subject to the  call of the Chair.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 4:01 p.m., adjourned until  Friday, January 17, 2020.                            ____________________
