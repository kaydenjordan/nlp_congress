 Mr. Speaker, Texas has lost another one of our  finest men in blue.   Last month, Detective Jerry Walker responded to a call of a man  brandishing a rifle and screaming and hollering in his backyard. So the  officers arrived, and they ordered the man to drop the weapon, but the  outlaw did not comply. He ran into the house and started firing his  weapon--shooting at the officers from inside the cover of his home.   During the shoot-out with the officers, the outlaw was killed, but  Detective Walker--a 48-year-old father of four and an 18-year veteran  of the force--was shot during the shoot-out. This is a photograph of  him.   His fellow officers rushed to Detective Walker, and he was later  airlifted to the hospital, but he died at the hospital. As his body was  transported from the hospital, dozens of officers and emergency  responders lined the street, saluting their fallen detective. The song  ``Amazing Grace'' could be heard on bagpipes as his body was taken away  and traveled down the street.   Not only was Detective Walker an outstanding member of the Little Elm  Police Department, but he also wore another uniform. He wore the  uniform of a soldier in the United States Army. Walker served our  country both at home and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, Little Elm is in north Texas. It has a population of  about 3,500 people. It has approximately 21 police officers, and  Detective Walker was the longest-serving officer in that town.  Detective Walker's youngest child is only a few months old. His four  children need to remember that their father died a servant of the  people of Little Elm, Texas.   He will be remembered by his family, his friends, and his community  as a model officer who protected the innocent. Most importantly, he  will be remembered as someone who genuinely cared about the people of  the community that he lived in.   Before he became a detective with the Little Elm Police Department,  Walker served as a school resource officer at Little Elm High School.  Students there remember him as someone who could talk to the students  and put them at ease. In fact, the kids just loved him. They often  would arm wrestle with their beloved officer during lunchtime.   One such student, Lionel Valdez, met Walker at school at about the  same time that Valdez started getting into trouble. Valdez' father had  walked out of his own life; so Walker took on a parent's role in making  sure that Valdez kept his nose clean and stayed out of trouble while he  was in school. He even went so far as to make sure  [[Page H752]]  that he showed up in class. Years after Valdez graduated from high  school, he would return to the school and have conversations with  Walker--the one man who showed him the light during his darkest times  as a student at school.   Jerry Walker was a realtime hero.   Detective Walker, Mr. Speaker, is the sixth officer killed in the  line of duty in the first 17 days in 2017. Six deaths in 17 days is  tragic. Our Nation must honor those men and women who wear the badge-- the badge of honor, sacrifice. We must back the blue, Mr. Speaker--back  the blue--and back officers like Jerry Walker of Little Elm, Texas.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, according to a Russian proverb: ``If  he beats you, it means he loves you.'' In Russia, that has become the  norm. Forty percent of all violent crimes in Russia are done within the  home. 36,000 people are beaten by their partners every day.   Madam Speaker, this is disturbing; but the Russian Parliament has  voted overwhelmingly to decriminalize domestic violence if it does not  cause substantial bodily harm and does not happen more than once a  year. So, if a husband beats his wife once a year, that is fine, sayeth  the lords of Siberia.   Madam Speaker, domestic violence is not just a family issue; it is a  human rights issue. As a lifelong advocate for victims, our societies  and countries must recognize the devastating effect of domestic  violence. It tears at the fabric of society--and not legalize it, but  stop this nightmare wherever it is.   Like my grandmother always taught me, you never hurt somebody you  claim you love.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
