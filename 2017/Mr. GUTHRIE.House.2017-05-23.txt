The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Courtney) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1808.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1808.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kentucky?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1808, the Improving Support  for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, as a father, I cannot imagine the horror moms and dads  in this country experience when they discover one of their children has  been taken, abused, or exploited. Sadly, that is a nightmare for  hundreds of thousands of parents in this country. Last year alone,  there were more than 465,000 reports of missing children, and those are  just the cases that were reported.   The well-being of America's children has long been a national  priority. In 1984, Congress established the Missing and Exploited  Children's Program to help coordinate State and local efforts to  recover children who are missing and better protect and support kids  who are victims of abuse and exploitation. As part of that program, we  provide a grant that is used to support the work of the National Center  for Missing & Exploited Children, known as NCMEC.   For more than 30 years, NCMEC has worked to provide help to people  across the country, partnering with parents, law enforcement,  nonprofits, and other public and private entities in an effort to  recover, protect, and support missing and exploited children and their  families. We are here today to ensure this supportive work continues.   H.R. 1808 updates and streamlines the Missing Children's Assistance  Act, making positive changes that will enable us to strengthen our  efforts. This includes reforms that encourage and increase public  awareness of new and innovative ways to recover and protect missing and  exploited children.   The bill better protects the growing number of children who go  missing from State care or are victims of sex trafficking, while also  providing transparency surrounding recovery and prevention efforts. In  recent years, some of the advances in technology have, unfortunately,  made it easier for kids to be victimized and exploited. H.R. 1808  ensures the law aimed at recovering and protecting exploited children  is able to effectively identify and locate today's abductors and  criminal offenders, many of whom are turning to more modern techniques  to commit their disturbing crimes.   The Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017  delivers important reforms that will provide the tools needed to  effectively serve vulnerable youth, help bring perpetrators to justice,  and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly. I urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 1808.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I echo my support, and I enjoy working with  my friend, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Walberg), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment,  Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee,  and a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), my friend and a member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell), my friend and a member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Education and the Workforce Committee.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), a good friend of mine who, in  his work on the Ways and Means Committee, has been focused on and  dedicated to this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I had the opportunity to visit the Center, and the building that I  got to go visit was full of men and women who show up every day, who do  exceptional work dealing with the disturbing issues, and so my hat is  off to them. They deal with stuff that is just unimaginable to most of  us, and they do it in a way that is dignified and in a way that is well  worthy of the effort that we are giving them to give more transparency  and empower them to help more.   I really appreciate working with my friend, Mr. Courtney. H.R. 1808  is a bipartisan proposal, and I urge my colleagues to support the  Improving Support for Missing and Exploited Children Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1808, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
