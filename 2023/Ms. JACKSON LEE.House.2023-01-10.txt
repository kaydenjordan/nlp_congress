 Mr. Speaker, I remember after 9/11 when we all  worked together to ensure the protection of the American people through  the Patriot Act and dealing with the FISA courts, we worked together  because truth is important.   I just want to simply be on the floor today to speak about truth. I  work with school boards across my district. I know that there is not  one school board that does not welcome a parent to hear their voices  because obviously they are partners in the education of our precious  children.   In September 2021, the National School Board Association sent Mr.  Biden a letter pointing to a trend of violence and threats against  school officials. It included a brief reference to Mr. Smith's arrest  incident and a long list of examples with a footnote to a news account  that mentioned the arrest in passing but without details, like his  daughter's assault.   The point is that this came about because there were threats against  school board members.   So can we have truth here?   That is what I rise to bring to the attention of this body as relates  to this committee and this select committee.   Is there going to be truth finding? Is this going to be a committee  that is going to collect information or otherwise investigate citizens  of the United States and give the most right-wing Members who may have  an ax to grind the ability to participate or is it going to be fair?    Is it going to be a gross misuse of power with dangerous  implications, unintended consequences, and potentially  [[Page H139]]  expose general operations of our national security infrastructure,  which will put American lives at risk?   Let me be very clear. Russia is one of our most dangerous  adversaries. We are in the middle of a national quagmire, and to  undermine that through investigations of the FBI and Central  Intelligence is going to be extremely dangerous.    Mr. Speaker, the passage of this resolution would  also give MAGA Republicans the ability to interfere in ongoing criminal  investigations, including those investigating that day that some  declared was just a bunch of tourists on January 6, 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I have worked with my friends on the other side of the  aisle. I have worked with Mr. Roy.   But is this a question of truth?   That is the issue that we stand here discussing today.   In this country, no one is above the law, and to suggest that some  people should be because they don't agree with the force of law being  applied to their activities is contrary to the very fabric of fairness,  justice, and equality that America was founded on.   Let me, as an aside, indicate that we know what has been in the  headlines--10 documents found in a locked closet that Mr. Biden may  have had. Well, you know what, Mr. Speaker, the process of the law is  proceeding. The call was made. The documents were surrendered, if you  will. The process goes forward under the laws of this land. No one  denied it. No one rejected it. No one did not in any way come to say  anything other than: Follow the law. On the other hand, in Mar-a-Lago  no law was found.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to consider the truth and vote  against this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H. Res. 12, a  dangerous resolution whose passage would Establish a Select Committee  on the Weaponization of the Federal Government or, more accurately, a  subcommittee that would threaten our nations safety, security, and  freedom.   MAGA Republicans love to hide behind the idea that they are pushing  an agenda that would help the American people, but let's see this for  what it truly is, a blatant assault on our democracy, our law  enforcement agencies, our justice system, and our intelligence  community, and an attempt to shield the twice-impeached former  president from ongoing investigations being conducted by the Department  of Justice.   The establishment of this subcommittee would give Republicans the  ability to investigate any agency that ``can collect information or  otherwise investigate citizens of the United States'' and gives the  most right-wing members of the Republican party access to confidential  documents solely intended for the members of the Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence.   This gross misuse of power will have dangerous implications and  unintended consequences and could potentially expose general operations  of our national security infrastructure which will put American lives  at risk.   The passage of this resolution would also give MAGA Republicans the  ability to interfere in ongoing criminal investigations including those  investigating the extremist insurrectionists who lead the brutal attack  on this institution two years ago.   In this country, no one is above the law, and to suggest that some  people should be, because they don't agree with the force of the law  being applied to their activities, is contrary to the very fabric of  fairness, justice and equality that America was founded on.   This is a blatant attempt by House GOP members to stifle the federal  government's investigatory powers, claiming that conservatives are  being prosecuted and silenced.   The new Select Subcommittee comes as federal agencies such as the  Department of Justice are investigating the GOP and its allies in  multiple criminal investigations.   Members of the Republican party have been on press tours announcing  this new subcommittee and have laid out their agenda, but how would  this subcommittee help the American people in any way?   For a party that claims to be pro-law enforcement, the Republican  party is now getting ready to undermine the hard work of our law  enforcement and surveillance agencies.   Mr. Speaker what really is the intent here? I can tell you what I  think it is. It is a back door effort to handcuff the current  administration in their normal and usual course of operations?   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to oppose this dangerous and a  completely irresponsible Resolution that will put the lives of  Americans at risk and is a political stunt to further advance their  dangerous conspiracy theories.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The New York  Times titled: ``Republicans Preparing Broad Inquiry Into F.B.I. and  Security Agencies.''                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 8, 2023]    House Republicans Preparing Broad Inquiry Into F.B.I. and Security                                  Agencies                  (By Charlie Savage and Luke Broadwater)         Newly empowered House Republicans are preparing a wide-      ranging investigation into law enforcement and national       security agencies, raising the prospect of politically       charged fights with the Eiden administration over access to       sensitive information like highly classified intelligence and       the details of continuing criminal inquiries by the Justice       Department.        The House plans to vote this week on a resolution to create       a special Judiciary subcommittee on what it calls the       ``weaponization of the federal government,'' a topic that       Republicans have signaled could include reviewing       investigations into former President Donald J. Trump.        The panel would be overseen by Representative Jim Jordan,       Republican of Ohio, who is also poised to become the       Judiciary Committee's chairman. It remains to be seen who       else Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who made numerous concessions to       a far-right faction of his party to win the speakership, will       put on it.        In a Fox News interview on Friday evening, Representative       Chip Roy of Texas, a lead negotiator for hard-right lawmakers       who pushed Mr. McCarthy's team for concessions, portrayed the       panel as part of the agreement they struck for their support.       He said Mr. McCarthy had committed to giving the subcommittee       at least as much funding and staffing as the House special       committee in the last Congress that investigated the Jan. 6,       2021, attack on the Capitol.        ``So we got more resources, more specificity, more power to       go after this recalcitrant Eiden administration,'' Mr. Roy       said. ``That's really important.''        A spokesman for Mr. Jordan did not reply to a request for       comment, but both he and Mr. McCarthy have spoken for months       about their desire for such an investigation and pledged to       voters during the 2022 campaign to carry one out.        ``We will hold the swamp accountable, from the withdrawal       of Afghanistan, to the origins of Covid and to the       weaponization of the F.B.I.,'' Mr. McCarthy said in his first       remarks as speaker early Saturday. ``Let me be very clear: We       will use the power of the purse and the power of the subpoena       to get the job done.''        The text of the resolution establishing the subcommittee       would give the panel essentially open-ended jurisdiction to       scrutinize any issue related to civil liberties or to examine       how any agency of the federal government has collected,       analyzed and used information about Americans including       ``ongoing criminal investigations.''        The Justice Department has traditionally resisted making       information about open criminal investigations available to       Congress, suggesting that legal and political fights over       subpoenas and executive privilege are most likely looming.        Republicans are promoting Mr. Jordan's panel as a new       ``Church Committee,'' referring to a 1970s investigation by       Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, that uncovered       decades of intelligence and civil liberties abuses by       presidents of both parties.        But in an environment in which Mr. Trump has been the       subject of multiple criminal investigations for years--      including continuing inquiries into his attempts to overturn       the 2020 election results and his hoarding of sensitive       documents--Democrats predicted the new investigative       subcommittee was likely to adopt a more partisan edge.        Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat       on the Judiciary Committee, said the Church Committee had       been ``a serious and bipartisan attempt to reform the conduct       of the intelligence community, based on hard and verifiable       evidence.'' By contrast, he said that ``this new thing,       fueled by conspiracy theories and slated to be run by the       most extreme members of the MAGA caucus,'' was likely to be       more similar to the notorious House Un-American Activities       Committee of the mid-20th century.        Mr. Jordan is a staunch ally of Mr. Trump. Late last year,       as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee when his       party was still in the minority, he oversaw a 1,000-page       staff report that claimed that the F.B.I. had ``spied on       President Trump's campaign and ridiculed conservative       Americans'' and that the ``rot within the F.B.I. festers in       and proceeds from Washington.''        The resolution appears to give him authority to subpoena       the Justice Department for information about the special       counsel inquiry into Mr. Trump's attempts to overturn the       2020 election and his handling of classified documents, along       with other politically charged matters like an open tax       investigation into President Biden's son, Hunter Biden.        The text of the resolution would also grant Mr. Jordan's       panel the power to receive the same highly classified       information that intelligence agencies make available to       their  [[Page H140]]       oversight committee, the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence.        Intelligence Committee members have access to some of the       most sensitive secrets in the government, including       information about covert actions, which are not shared with       other lawmakers. Traditionally, House leaders tend to place       on the intelligence panel members of their party they think       are especially trustworthy not to disclose classified       information.        While Mr. Jordan's investigative unit will be housed within       the Judiciary Committee, its 13 members--eight of whom would       be Republicans--will not be limited to lawmakers on that       panel.        It is not clear, for example, whether Republican leaders       would select hard-right members, such as Representative       Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who was       stripped of her committee assignments in 2021 for making a       series of violent and conspiratorial social media posts       before she was elected. Mr. McCarthy has already promised her       a spot on the House Oversight Committee, and she broke with       other far-right members to support his speakership bid from       the first ballot, as did Mr. Jordan.        Such a situation could result in lawmakers trying to       scrutinize a Justice Department investigation as that inquiry       potentially examines some of those same lawmakers' conduct       concerning the events of Jan. 6.        In an interview on ABC's ``This Week'' on Sunday,       Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania,       rejected a suggestion that he should pledge not to serve on       Mr. Jordan's subcommittee because it may scrutinize the Jan.       6 investigation and as a witness in that inquiry, he had a       conflict of interest. Mr. Perry, who played an important role       in Mr. Trump's attempt to overturn the results of the 2020       election, had his cellphone seized by the F.B.I.        ``Why should I be limited--why should anybody be limited       just because someone has made an accusation?'' Mr. Perry       said, adding: ``I get accused of all kinds of things every       single day, as does every member that serves in the public       eye. But that doesn't stop you from doing your job. It is our       duty and it is my duty.''        Some Republicans also seem to see the panel as an       opportunity to raise culture-war issues and promote       conspiracy theories. In his interview with Fox, Mr. Roy       described the subcommittee's mission as going ``after the       weaponization of the government, the F.B.I., the intel       agencies, D.H.S., all of them that have been, you know,       labeling Scott Smith a domestic terrorist.''        In fact, no agency labeled Mr. Smith a domestic terrorist.       Mr. Smith, whose daughter was sexually assaulted in a high       school bathroom in Virginia, was arrested after he lunged at       someone at a school board meeting during a tense and chaotic       debate over bathroom policy for transgender students. He was       convicted of disorderly conduct.        In September 2021, the National School Boards Association       sent Mr. Biden a letter pointing to a trend of violence and       threats against school officials. It included a brief       reference to Mr. Smith's arrest incident amid a long list of       examples, with a footnote to a news account of the meeting       that mentioned the arrest in passing but without details like       his daughter's assault. The letter also said acts of violence       and threats against school officials could be classified as       ``equivalent to a form of domestic terrorism and hate       crimes,'' and asked for federal help.        A few days later, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland       issued a memorandum directing U.S. attorneys and the F.B.I.       to convene meetings across the country with local officials       to discuss ``strategies for addressing threats'' against       school officials and teachers. His memo did not call anyone a       domestic terrorist, and it specifically distinguished       spirited debate, which it stressed was constitutionally       protected, from acts of violence and threats.        But voices on the right have made Mr. Smith a cause       celebre, falsely telling their viewers and readers that the       Biden-era Justice Department and the F.B.I. consider parents       who disagree with liberal school board policies to be       domestic terrorists.        The subcommittee investigation proposed by Mr. Jordan is       just one of a number of inquiries House Republicans plan to       approve this week.        Included in a separate rules package scheduled to come up       for a vote on Monday is a wide-ranging inquiry into the       coronavirus pandemic, including the origins of the virus, so-      called gain-of-function research, the production of vaccines       and the conduct of Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, Mr. Biden's former       chief medical adviser, whom Republicans have pledged to haul       before them for questioning.        Republicans are also planning to form a special committee       to investigate the Chinese government's ``economic,       technological and security progress, and its competition with       the United States.''        Both the China investigation and the investigation into law       enforcement are scheduled for a vote on Tuesday.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.  Res. 12, a dangerous resolution whose passage would Establish a Select  Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government or, more  accurately, a subcommittee that would threaten our nations safety,  security, and freedom.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to oppose this dangerous and a  completely irresponsible Resolution that will put the lives of  Americans at risk and is a political stunt to further advance their  dangerous conspiracy theories.    Mr. Speaker, all of us are concerned about the  bullying of Communist China. I hope as we move forward, this committee  that has been voted on will emphasize the bullying, but it will not  emphasize the negativism that occurred during COVID with ``Kung Flu''  and dealing with the intimidation and the increase of Asian hatred and  violence.   That is why some of us were concerned enough not to support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, let me also say that in addition to wanting us to do  better, I am excited about introducing the Battle Buddy Check  legislation that has our veterans check on each other, just as if they  are on the battlefield, to stop the rise of veteran suicide.   Have a battle buddy. This legislation is hopefully to save lives of  our soldiers who are now veterans who have done all that they could for  America.   Mr. Speaker, I am excited about the introduction of the Lyndon Baines  Johnson Congressional Gold Medal.  [[Page H147]]    Lyndon Baines Johnson will be looked upon as one of the greatest  Presidents, giving opportunity to those who never had it in education  and healthcare and the environment and criminal justice reform and the  right to vote and civil rights.   I ask my colleagues to join me in the Congressional Gold Medal for  Lyndon Baines Johnson.                            ____________________
