 Mr. Speaker, every time I go home, the people of Kansas  never cease to inspire me. This Veterans Day, it was my hometown of  Great Bend and my home county of Barton County who inspired me.   On Veterans Day, not only did we commemorate the 100th anniversary of  the armistice ending World War I, but we also dedicated a new veterans  memorial and veterans cemetery. I was so proud to be part of this  dedication ceremony and join the 300 Kansans who braved snow and sleet  in freezing cold to honor our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to be part of such a community which holds  veterans in such high esteem.                            ____________________
