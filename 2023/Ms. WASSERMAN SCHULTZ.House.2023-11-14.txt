 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I rise in strong opposition to this spending bill.   In it, House Republicans have reduced funding to the NIH and the  National Cancer Institute and virtually eliminated funding for medical  and behavioral research into deadly diseases.   House Republicans eliminated the CDC's tobacco prevention and control  programs. I repeat: House Republicans have defunded our most important  antismoking programs with this bill.   Deaths will be the reality if these cuts come to fruition. How can  Republicans still be this beholden to Big Tobacco?   House Republicans also eliminated the Ending the HIV Epidemic  initiative despite States like Florida, where we are seeing a 33  percent spike in new HIV diagnoses.   With this bill, House Republicans are eliminating Healthy Start,  whose sole mission is to improve the well-being of expectant mothers or  those who just gave birth, all to reduce infant mortality.   On top of that, this extreme MAGA bill eliminates funding for title X  family planning because their far-right ideology forbids access to  reproductive health and related preventive health services.   Of course, House Republicans have eliminated the Teen Pregnancy  Prevention program in tandem with riders that block access to abortion  services or reproductive healthcare services.   At least this bill nakedly reflects the true values of the MAGA House  Republicans because it will encourage discrimination, promote bigotry,  trample on women's rights, decimate public education, and push  minorities further away from equality.                                time  1145    Of course, it ``protects'' Americans from critical race theory,  LGBTQI+ communities, and programs that promote diversity and equity.   This bill should adhere to the agreement that was made in the Fiscal  Responsibility Act we passed on a bipartisan basis in the spring.  Slash-and-burn budgeting hurts real people while you take care of your  corporate co-conspirators.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this terrible spending bill if  it ever even comes to a vote.
