 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Global War on Terror that started 17  years ago continues. Today we formally call the missions undertaken in  the War on Terror Operation Freedom's Sentinel and Operation Inherent  Resolve. Brave American troops continue selflessly serving these  missions in defense of our country. It is often an overlooked or  neglected news story. It doesn't make the headlines frequently, but  families throughout the country who have loved ones in the Middle East  are closely monitoring the latest developments there. Their loves ones  are still in harm's way in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria.   This war is being prosecuted at considerable costs. Many have made  the ultimate sacrifice, including Army SFC Eric Emond, a member of 1st  Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group, who called Springdale, AK, home  when he enlisted in the Marine Corps 21 years ago. He dedicated his  career to the military, serving in the Marines and later joining the  Army.   In 2009, while serving in Afghanistan, he was severely wounded.  During his recovery, he cofounded the Massachusetts Fallen Heroes--an  organization launched to honor the fallen and to support Gold Star  Families. He was on his seventh tour of duty when he was killed in  action last month.   I pray that the Emond family can find comfort in the support of  others who have experienced the pain of losing a loved one and who have  been aided by the organization Sergeant Emond passionately advocated  for.   Many brave Americans are still fighting and selflessly serving,  putting their lives on the line every day to defend this country  against terrorists and nations that wish to assert malign influence in  the world.   We have a duty to honor their commitment to our country and to those  who paid the ultimate sacrifice. In the coming days, Congress will have  an opportunity to name the Department of Veterans Affairs facility in  North Ogden, UT, the Major Brent Taylor Vet Center Outstation in honor  of the city's mayor, a member of the Utah Army National Guard who,  during his fourth military deployment, gave his life in support of the  mission in Afghanistan last month. Let us never forget the sacrifices  of our troops and let their legacies be an inspiration for all  Americans.   On behalf of a grateful nation, I humbly offer my sincerest gratitude  for the patriotism and selfless service of the men and women who serve  in our Nation's uniform, the families who support their noble endeavor,  and to those who gave their all.   We must remember the many brave Americans, past and present, who  stand in defense of our country. Certainly, we need to remember those  on a daily basis. These men and women deserve our attention and  admiration for answering the call to serve and risking comfort, life,  and limb to protect our freedom.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  congratulate Sarah Hartley, a member of my staff who has served the  people of Arkansas over the last 20 years and who will retire later  this month.   Sarah first began her congressional career in 1998 working for then- Congressman Asa Hutchinson. When I was elected to fill Representative  Hutchinson's seat representing Arkansas's Third Congressional District  in 2001, I was fortunate to have Sarah join my staff lending her  expertise in constituent services.   As a caseworker based in north-central Arkansas, she has been the  primary point of contact for my office when constituents were facing  difficulties related to their Social Security. She personally assisted  thousands of Arkansans who were often facing the most difficult moments  of their lives. Her kindness and patience have been a source of comfort  and hope, and her persistence has solved countless problems that  changed lives.   Excellent constituent service has been a commitment of mine since I  entered public office, and I am indebted and very grateful to Sarah for  her many years helping to deliver just that for so many throughout the  course of her career.   While I regret that her time as a member of my staff is coming to an  end, I truly respect and appreciate her commitment to helping her  fellow Arkansans these last two decades. It has been a pleasure to work  alongside her to help get answers for constituents who had nowhere else  to turn. Sarah's knowledge and relationships were the reason that many  casework requests were brought to a positive conclusion.   My staff and I will miss her many contributions to the important work  of assisting Arkansans and being their advocate on matters involving  the Federal Government. Even so, I wish her all the best in this next  chapter. She will now have more time to do the things she loves,  including spending time outdoors exploring everything the Natural State  has to offer.   Again, I want to congratulate Sarah on her 20 years of service and  extend my sincere, heartfelt thanks for the dedication and skill she  brought to the job each day as a member of my staff. The difference she  has made in the lives of so many Arkansans is a testament to how  blessed my staff and I were to serve with her.                            ____________________
