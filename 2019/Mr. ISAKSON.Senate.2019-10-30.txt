 Mr. President, today, I rise to pay tribute to  Jennifer Evans, the president of Leadership Georgia for 2019.  Leadership Georgia is one of the Nation's oldest and most successful  State leadership training programs. Leadership Georgia serves primarily  young business, civic, community leaders who have the desire and  potential to work together for a better Georgia.   The idea for a statewide leadership development program was first  proposed in 1971 during an informal conversation between several key  business leaders at a Georgia Chamber of Commerce meeting. This  inspired group included Pat Patillo, then-president of the Georgia  Chamber; business leader Jim Lientz, Sr.; Rogers Wade of the Georgia  Public Policy Foundation; and community visionary J.W. Fanning, who  would eventually serve as the program's longtime advisor and guiding  hand.   The first class of Leadership Georgia started in 1972 and included  aspiring leaders from across the State. Future U.S. Senator Sam Nunn  was a member of the inaugural class who, at the time, was a young  lawyer from Perry, GA. The story goes that Nunn was inspired to run for  the Senate shortly after attending his first Leadership Georgia  Program. I am also a proud alumnus of the organization, as is my former  colleague, Saxby Chambliss.   Beyond its founding, Leadership Georgia leads the way in many areas.  Thanks to J.W. Fanning's active wife Cora Lee, Leadership Georgia has  always stressed partner and spousal participation. Another key focus of  Leadership Georgia is diversity among its members. The highly  competitive selection process includes participants from every comer of  the State and seeks out those from different occupations, genders,  cultures, and races. The philosophy behind this diversity goal is that  each Leadership Georgia class of 120-plus participants connects on a  deeply personal level that highlights different perspectives while  learning how to work together as one united force for Georgia's best  future.   As president of Leadership Georgia for 2019, Jennifer Evans was  responsible for selecting the five locations where the Leadership  Georgia class have spent their time together. To showcase the ``Georgia  United'' theme she chose, Jennifer selected the Georgia communities of  Young Harris and its Brasstown Resort in the North Georgia mountains;  Albany, which has been resilient in the face of recent natural  disasters; Gainesville, the poultry capital of the world; and Perry,  home to the Georgia National Fairgrounds.   This year, Jennifer also set aside one of these programs to visit us  here in Washington, DC, to allow these emerging leaders to interact  with their elected and appointed officials to deliver the message of  ``United We Can'' and encourage us to find common ground for the  betterment of our State and Nation. That is a message I think all of us  need to hear on a regular basis.   Both members of Leadership Georgia's Class of 2011, Jennifer and her  husband Lee, have dedicated countless hours of time to Leadership  Georgia to ensure the organization maintains its sterling reputation in  our State. They served as program chairs for the Leadership Georgia  Class of 2012 and planned and executed a successful program weekend in  Savannah, GA. Jennifer then served on the board of trustees from 2013  through 2015, where she helped select class members for those years,  and she was asked to rejoin the board of trustees and serve as the vice  president of the organization in 2018. She is currently serving as  president and next year will assume the role of chair of the board of  trustees.   In addition to their volunteer work for Leadership Georgia, Jennifer  and Lee both have busy lives and full-time jobs in Vidalia, GA.  Jennifer is director of transportation for Dot Foods, and Lee just  opened his first Barbaritos franchise. Their children, Rebecca, who is  14 years old, and Cham, who is 12, have practically grown up with  Leadership Georgia and have been able to build lifelong friendships  with kids from across our great State through the extended Leadership  Georgia family.   It gives me hope for the future that folks like Jennifer and Lee  Evans are in each of our States and communities focused on nurturing  and developing future leaders, working to overcome differences, and  focusing on bettering communities for so many.   I want to congratulate Jennifer, current board chair Matt Bishop, the  entire volunteer Leadership Georgia Board of Trustees, and the program  chair team assembled by Jennifer and Lee on delivering a fantastic year  for the 2019 class of Leadership Georgia.                            ____________________
