 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Cathy Glenn  and Dave Ahart of the Senate recording studio be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of the legislative day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments. Thanks  to Senator Boozman for honoring the little known, courageous, now no  longer young men and women but then boys and girls of Little Rock.   I have had the good fortune of getting to know over the years Ernie  Green, who was the senior in high school of the Little Rock group. He  went on to Michigan State. Martin Luther King attended his, I believe,  high school graduation, maybe his Michigan State graduation. I am not  sure.   My brother arranged for my daughter, some years ago on her birthday,  to get to have dinner with Ernie Green because we had watched the  docudrama of the Ernie Green story, about the young men and women of  Little Rock.   I say thank you to Senator Boozman for honoring them.         Disaster Relief for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands    Mr. President, I want to take a moment for the millions of American  citizens who are fighting for their lives in Puerto Rico, to never ever  forget that the people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are, in  fact, American citizens.   It has been 5 days since Hurricane Maria ripped through the island of  Puerto Rico. People are without power, they are without communication,  and in many cases with no end in sight.   My staff has checked to see the condition of the veterans hospitals,  both in Puerto Rico and in the three American Virgin Islands. There has  been a mixed response. Some of them are up and running with electricity  and water. Some of them are running with a generator. Some of them have  been simply suspended or closed for a period of time.   It is up to us to make sure--one of the first things we can do is  make sure those hospitals are served and running, and there is  obviously so much more we need to do.   Much of the island of Puerto Rico remains mostly cut off from San  Juan. The government has dispatched runners on foot to try to maintain  contact in towns outside the capital. Towns are blocked from rescuers.  Patients are worried they will run out of medicine.   The Washington Post talked to a woman in a mountain town. Her mother  has diabetes. They have no power. She worries they will run out of  prescriptions or generator fuel to keep her insulin refrigerated. I  repeat. These are citizens of the United States of America. She is  worried her mother's ulcer will become infected. She fans her mother  with a piece of cardboard to keep the flies away.   These are American citizens. We cannot ignore them. Puerto Rico's  secretary of the Department of Agriculture estimated the storm wiped  out 80 percent of the crop value on the island. Entire farms were wiped  out. Entire plantations are destroyed. One farmer said there will be no  food in Puerto Rico. Officials predict the storm will set the island  back for decades.   Listen to Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's representative in  Congress. Understand that Puerto Rico elects a Congressman or, in this  case, a Congresswoman. She comes here. She doesn't have voting rights  on the floor of the House of Representatives so Puerto Rico has  representation but not the kind of representation Oklahoma or Ohio has,  but, again, they are citizens of the United States of America.   The Resident Commissioner said:         The devastation . . . has set us back 20 to 30 years. I       can't deny that the Puerto Rico of now is different from that       of a week ago. The destruction of properties, of flattened       structures, of families without homes, of debris everywhere.       The island's greenery is gone.    Our country has been hit hard by hurricanes this year. I was proud of  the way we came together in this body to support the people of Texas  after Hurricane Harvey. That seems almost like ancient history. We have  seen bipartisan cooperation on getting aid to Florida following  Hurricane Irma. Our job is far from done. There is more to do.   We must do the same thing for our brothers and sisters, our fellow  American citizens in Puerto Rico. We need to provide relief to the  people of Puerto Rico with all the resources we always provide to  American citizens when Mother Nature deals us a devastating blow. We  can't allow children and grandparents to die waiting for help in our  own backyard.                    Tribute to Cathy Glenn and Dave Ahart    Mr. President, this building is full of people who work hard to make  our government function. I am not really talking about Senators. I am  talking about low-paid workers in our cafeteria, I am talking about  people who keep the offices clean for our constituents, I am talking  about the tour guides who give  [[Page S6090]]  Americans from all over the country a glimpse of the historic  buildings, and I am talking about the clerks right here on the Senate  floor. These people work so hard in the background. Too often they  don't get the credit they deserve serving the American public. I want  to honor two of them today.   This week, the Senate is losing two of the kindest, most cheerfully  hard-working and imaginative people in this building, my dear friends  Cathy Glenn and Dave Ahart.   For nearly three decades, Cathy and Dave worked in the Senate  recording studio, helping all of us do one of our most important jobs,  talking with and listening to the people with whom we serve.   For a decade, I have spent my Thursday mornings--virtually every  Thursday morning the Senate is in session--with Cathy and Dave. Every  Thursday morning, I go to the radio studio to talk with radio stations  across Ohio. It is early. It is toward the end of the week so no one  would blame them for being quiet or even being grumpy, but Dave and  Cathy always bring joy to everyone around them.   Because of them and Ohio's great radio hosts, Thursday morning is  among the highlights of my week here. We share friendship. We share  baseball. They give me baseball trivia questions I can later then test  on Senator McCain or Senator Schumer. They do all right, I should say.   Anyone who knows me knows I am a Cleveland Indians fan. The Indians  have won 29 out of the last 31--never equaled in Major League history,  except in 1884, it is believed.   I am also a pretty big fan of baseball trivia, and that is something  Dave, Cathy, and I share. About every week since 2007, I arrive at the  radio studio to a new baseball trivia question before I do my radio  interview. We lost the records from the first couple of years, but the  first question we have on record is dated July 29, 2010: Name the only  two Hall of Fame pitchers--at that time--with losing records.   Sometimes they give me hints, especially early in the morning.   They had hints. Hint No. 1: One pitcher was a starter and one was a  reliever. Hint No. 2: One of the pitchers pitched in the big leagues  from 1948 to 1965. Hint No. 3: One of them pitched for the Major  Leagues from 1968 to 1985. The answer is--not to keep you in suspense-- Satchel Paige, who played for the Indians and St. Louis Browns.  Lifetime, he had 28 wins and 31 losses, but he was one of the greatest  pitchers in the Negro League. He was born in the early 1900s, starting  in the 1920s, when he was perhaps the single best pitcher in the Negro  League. The Cleveland Indians, under the ownership of Bill Veeck, soon  after they signed Larry Doby, the first Black player in the league,  signed Satchel Paige, who helped to take the Indians to the World  Series that year.   The other pitcher was Rollie Fingers of Steubenville, OH. He played  for the Oakland A's and San Diego Padres. He had 114 wins and 118  losses. He had more losses than he had wins because he was a closer or  relief pitcher who finished off games, and typically they have more  losses than they have wins. I don't want to go into those details on  the Senate floor because many people who are listening probably don't  really care, but I do, and so I am going to continue.   Dave and Cathy's dedication to America's game and to bringing joy to  their jobs didn't end there. They made baseball dioramas, a word I did  not even know until I came to the Senate and met them. Sometimes a  baseball diorama is sort of a 3-D replication of a baseball stadium,  complete with a nod to their favorite baseball-loving canine, my dog  Franklin Roosevelt. People who know me know that of course our dog is  named after Franklin Roosevelt.   They celebrated opening day every April--all of us having hope for  the next year--with popcorn, peanuts, and crackerjacks in the radio  studio. What always moved me wasn't just the love for baseball--that  counted for a lot--but their incredible kindness, thoughtfulness, and  joy of living. That is what makes them such good friends to each other,  to Connie, Rachel, and me.   I can't think of anyone in this building who deserves a long, happy  retirement more than Dave and Cathy. I wish them years of time spent  with friends and loved ones and with a husband and a wife watching a  lot of baseball games. Selfishly, I wish Dave and Cathy wouldn't go.  Your friendship has meant so much to me. Thursday mornings just will  not be the same.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
