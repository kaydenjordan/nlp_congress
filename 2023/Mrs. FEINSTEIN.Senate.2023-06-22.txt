 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Canal Conveyance Capacity Restoration Act, which I introduced today.  Representative Jim Costa has introduced companion legislation in the  House of Representatives.   The bill authorizes one-third cost-share totaling $653 million for  restoring the capacity of the Friant-Kern Canal, the Delta-Mendota  Canal, and the California Aqueduct.   Coordinated legislation in the State legislature introduced by State  Senator Melissa Hurtado has led to a downpayment on a State cost-share  for restoring the canals' capacity. Local water districts would be  responsible for the remainder of the cost not covered by the State or  Federal governments.   In addition, the bill authorizes an additional $180 million to  restore salmon runs on the San Joaquin River. The funding is for fish  passage structures, levees, and other improvements that will allow the  threatened Central Valley Spring-run Chinook salmon to swim freely  upstream from the ocean to the Friant Dam.   My bill would help California water users and California's Nation- leading agriculture industry comply with a recent State requirement to  end the overpumping of groundwater. The stakes are huge: If we don't  bring groundwater into balance, then the San Joaquin Valley will lose  access to about 2 million acre-feet of water per year.   Unless local water agencies and the State and Federal governments  act, a recent U.C. Berkeley study has projected severe impacts from  these water supply losses: 798,000 acres of land would have to be  retired from agricultural production, nearly one-sixth of the working  farmland in an area that produces half the fruit and vegetables grown  in the Nation; and $5.9 billion would be lost in annual farm income in  a region that is almost entirely reliant on agriculture.   One of the most economical and efficient ways to restore groundwater  balance is to convey floodwater to farmland where it can recharge the  aquifer. California has the most variable precipitation of any State.  When massive storms from atmospheric rivers occur, there is runoff to  recharge aquifers--but only if we can effectively convey the  floodwaters throughout the San Joaquin Valley to recharge areas.   However, the major canals are in desperate need of repair and have  lost as much as 60 percent of their capacity. The bill I am introducing  today would provide Federal assistance to help fix these Federal  canals.   Specifically, the bill would authorize $653.4 million in a Federal  funding-cost share for three major projects to restore Federal canals  damaged by subsidence to their former capacity: $180 million for the  Friant-Kern Canal, which would move an additional 100,000 acre-feet per  year on average; $183.9 million for the Delta Mendota Canal, which  would move an additional 62,000 acre-feet per year on average; and  $289.5 million for California Aqueduct repairs, which would move an  additional 205,000 acre-feet per year on average. While parts of the  California Aqueduct are State-owned, the majority of the repairs are on  its federally owned portion.   This will give local farmers a fighting chance to bring their  groundwater basins into balance without being forced to retire vast  amounts of land.   Critically, the ability to deliver floodwaters through restored  Federal canals will allow the water districts to invest in their own  turnouts, pumps, detention basins, and other groundwater recharge  projects. The South Valley Water Association, which covers just a small  part of the valley, provided my office with a list of 36 such projects  for its area alone.   The Public Policy Institute of California, PPIC has determined that  groundwater recharge projects are the best option to help the San  Joaquin Valley comply with the new State groundwater pumping law. PPIC  projects that the valley can make up 300,000 to 500,000 acre-feet of  its groundwater deficit through recharge projects.   A study commissioned by the coalition group Water Blueprint for the  San Joaquin Valley estimates that reductions in groundwater could cause  a loss of up to 42,000 farm and agricultural jobs in the San Joaquin  Valley. Another 40,000 jobs or more could be lost statewide each year  due to reductions in valley agricultural production, putting the total  at approximately 85,000 jobs statewide. Most of these impacts will fall  disproportionately on economically disadvantaged communities.   Let me now turn to the three critical canals that the bill would help  restore. The Friant-Kern Canal is a key feature of the Friant Division  of the Federal Central Valley Project on the Eastside of the San  Joaquin Valley. For nearly 70 years, the Friant Division successfully  kept groundwater tables stable on the Eastside. This provided a  sustainable source of water for farms and for thousands of Californians  and more than 50 small, rural, or disadvantaged communities who rely  entirely on groundwater for their household water supplies.   But unsustainable groundwater pumping in the valley has reduced the  Friant-Kern Canal's ability to deliver water to all who need it. Land  elevation subsidence caused by overpumping means that not all of the  supplies stored at Friant Dam can be conveyed through the canal. In  some areas, the canal can carry only 40 percent of what it is designed  to deliver.   In 2017, a very wet year in which we should have banked as much  floodwater as possible, the Friant-Kern Canal delivered 300,000 acre- feet of water less than it would have conveyed before subsidence. This  water would have helped recharge groundwater in the south San Joaquin  Valley, where the impacts of reduced water deliveries, water quality  issues, and groundwater regulation are expected to be most severe.   The California Aqueduct serves more than 27 million people in  Southern California and the Silicon Valley and more than 750,000 acres  of the Nation's most productive farmland. But despite its name, much of  the California Aqueduct is owned by the Federal Government and serves  portions of Silicon Valley, small towns and communities in the northern  San Joaquin Valley, and farms from Firebaugh to Kettleman City. The  aqueduct represents a successful 70-year partnership between the  Federal Government and the State of California.   In recent years, particularly recent drought years, the California  Aqueduct has subsided. It has lost as much as 20 percent of its  capacity to move water to California's families, farms, and businesses.  California is leading efforts to repair the aqueduct and is working to  provide its share of funding, but the Federal Government will also need  to pay its fair share. The bill I am introducing today would authorize  $289.5  [[Page S2230]]  million toward restoring the California Aqueduct.   The Delta-Mendota Canal stretches southward 117 miles from the C.W.  Bill Jones Pumping Plant along the western edge of the San Joaquin  Valley, parallel to the California Aqueduct. The Delta-Mendota Canal  has lost 15 percent of its conveyance capacity due to subsidence. The  bill I am introducing today would authorize $183.9 million toward  restoring its full ability to convey floodwaters to farms needing to  recharge groundwater and to wildlife refuges of critical importance for  migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway.   This bill responds to a potential crisis that very possibly could  cause the forced retirement of nearly one-sixth of the working farmland  in an area that produces half of America's fruits and vegetables.   These are Federal canals, and the Federal Government must help give  these farmers and agricultural communities a fighting chance to keep  their lands in production.   Lastly, this legislation helps to restore a historic salmon run on  California's second longest river, the San Joaquin.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kelly, and Ms. Sinema):   S. 2162. A bill to support water infrastructure in Reclamation  States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources.    Madam President, I rise today to speak about the  STREAM Act, Support to Rehydrate the Environment, Agriculture and  Municipalities Act, which I am introducing today alongside my  cosponsors, Senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema. This bill is  intended to help Western States upgrade their water infrastructure in  preparation for the severe droughts and weather whiplash that we have  seen the past few years and that will worsen significantly with climate  change.   If we don't take action now, it is only going to get worse. Lawrence  Berkeley National Laboratory scientists project that climate change  will cause a 54-percent drop in the Sierras' snowpack within the next  20 to 40 years and a 79-percent drop by the end of the century. This  change alone could be devastating for California because we absolutely  depend on this snowpack. The Sierra snowpack provides 30 percent of our  water supply and is our biggest reservoir.   For these reasons and others, we need an ``all of the above'' water  strategy, including increased water supply; incentivizing projects that  build in environmental benefits and drinking water for disadvantaged  communities, and investing in separate environmental restoration  efforts.   The bill I am introducing today helps meet this challenge in four  fundamental ways:   No. 1, it authorizes significant water supply funding that, in  combination with the bipartisan infrastructure law, would provide  California with 1.04 million additional acre-feet of water per year on  average, enough water for over 6 million people.   No. 2, it provides additional financial incentives for water supply  projects that include environmental benefits and drinking water for  disadvantaged communities.   No. 3, it reforms the congressional review process to more quickly  approve water supply projects;   No. 4, it significantly invests not only in water supply projects but  also in environmental restoration to help imperiled species adapt to  climate change.   The recent drought in the West from 2020 to 2022 illustrates why this  bill is so desperately needed.   In 2021, the drought caused the California agriculture industry to  shrink by an estimated 8,745 jobs and incur $1.2 billion in direct  costs, according to a report prepared for the California Department of  Food and Agriculture by researchers at the University of California at  Merced. Reduced water deliveries resulted in 395,000 acres of cropland  left dry and unplanted.   Counting ``spillover effects'' in the broader economy, the U.C.  Merced analysis found the total impacts were more than 14,600 lost  jobs, both full time and part time, and $1.7 billion in gross revenue  losses.   In both 2021 and 2022, homes in significant parts of the State were  at risk of running dry. In 2021, large parts of Marin and Sonoma  Counties and the Mendocino coast came very close to losing all water  supply. In 2022, much of Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Bernardino  Counties were placed under emergency orders limiting them to once-a- week landscape irrigation, with the possibility of a complete  irrigation shutoff that was only avoided by the timely arrival of  multiple atmospheric rivers last fall.   In California, one in eight acres statewide has burned from wildfires  in the last decade, with the past 2 years being the worst on record.  The drought has been devastating to the aquatic ecosystem as well as  our forests. As just one example, the endangered winter-run Chinook  salmon depend on sufficient cold water released by Shasta Dam to rear  their offspring in the Sacramento River.   With limited water available in 2021, NOAA Fisheries models predict  that approximately 75 percent of the winter run Chinook salmon's eggs  died from elevated water temperatures. This is a species with three 1- year age classes, and a prolonged drought could threaten the survival  of the species.   To increase drought resiliency in California and other Western  States, the bill authorizes the following funding over the next 5  years: $750 million for surface and groundwater storage projects and  supporting conveyance, including $50 million for natural water  retention and release projects; $300 million for water recycling  projects; $150 million for desalination projects; $250 million for  environmental restoration projects; and $100 million for drinking water  for disadvantaged communities.   This funding builds on the bipartisan infrastructure law's funding of  $1.15 billion for storage projects, $550 million for water recycling  projects, and $250 million for desalination projects.   The STREAM Act, in combination with the bipartisan infrastructure  law, would provide California with the Federal cost-share for  approximately 1,042,000 acre-feet per year of additional water supply,  or enough water for over 6 million people. This comes from the  following:   Enough funding for California to finally build three major off-stream  storage projects providing 370,000 acre-feet of water on average each  year: Sites Reservoir, the Los Vaqueros Expansion, and the BF Sisk  raise. In addition, the storage funding could provide an additional  55,000 acre-feet per year from some combination of other smaller  surface and groundwater storage projects like the Sacramento Regional  Groundwater Bank or Del Puerto Canyon Reservoir. All of the projects  are non-Federal projects with a 25-percent Federal cost share, with the  exception of the Federal BF Sisk Raise with a 50-percent Federal cost- share.   Enough funding for 532,000 additional acre-feet from water recycling  projects, from the $300 million authorized in the bill plus $550  million in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, with a 25-percent  Federal cost-share for projects.   Enough funding for approximately 85,000 additional acre-feet from the  $150 million authorized in the bill for desalination projects, plus  $250 million in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, with a 25  percent Federal cost-share for projects.   While virtually everyone supports water recycling projects, surface  and groundwater storage projects are sometimes more controversial. I  want to point out a 2022 report from the widely respected Public Policy  Institute of California, PPIC, which relates to the benefits of  additional surface and groundwater storage as California's climate is  changing.   Many climate forecasters emphasize that as climate change  intensifies, California will get more of its precipitation in a few  large to extraordinarily large storms fueled by atmospheric rivers, and  more of the precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow. In  between the bursts of atmospheric rivers there will be longer and more  intense droughts. We have definitely seen a preview of this pattern  this year.   PPIC has studied these projections and estimated that there is  substantial water in wet years that is not needed to maintain healthy  Delta outflows but currently cannot be captured because California  lacks the infrastructure to  [[Page S2231]]  store for future dry periods. PPIC suggests that given this reality,  cost-effective storage projects in appropriate locations could help  improve California's drought resiliency.   PPIC also argues that these storage projects should be managed for  environmental flow benefits as well as water supply benefits. This bill  would help with that because Federal funding for Sites Reservoir would  help provide cold water for salmon, and Federal funding for the  expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir would provide needed water for  wildlife refuges. Regarding cold water reserves for salmon in  particular, these reserves will be critical to prevent salmon runs from  being wiped out during the potential fourth, fifth, and maybe even  sixth and seventh years of devastating droughts.   The bill's funding authorizations apply not just to California but  throughout the 17 Western States where the Bureau of Reclamation has a  presence. Many of these States have recently benefited from the Bureau  of Reclamation's storage, water recycling, and desalination programs  and/or have projects currently seeking funding from these programs,  including Arizona, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Nevada, and  New Mexico. I believe the Federal funding assistance authorized by this  bill will be particularly important for all seven Colorado River basin  States as the States negotiate the next painful round of water supply  cuts from the Colorado River between now and 2026 in order to meet the  challenge of an increasingly dry Colorado River basin.   In Arizona, the STREAM Act would significantly advance the Salt River  Project's proposal to raise Bartlett Dam on the Verde River to  counteract the loss of approximately one-third of the nearby Horseshoe  Dam's capacity from accumulating sediment.   The bill uses financial incentives to encourage storage and  conveyance projects to include environmental benefits and other public  benefits such as drinking water for disadvantaged communities. This is  important to ensure that the environment and disadvantaged communities  are included in our drought resilience strategies.   If proposed storage projects solely provide irrigation and general  municipal and industrial water supply benefits, the bill authorizes  only low-interest loans to support these projects.   In contrast, the bill authorizes grants for storage and conveyance  projects that include environmental benefits, drinking water benefits  for disadvantaged communities, or other public benefits either as part  of the project design or as part of a watershed restoration plan  adopted together with the project.   This access to grants gives project sponsors a strong financial  incentive to design environmental and disadvantaged community benefits  into their projects. This approach builds on the experience of the  Proposition 1 water bond California's voters passed by a 2-to-1 margin  in 2014, which also incentivizes projects with environmental and other  public benefits.    If storage and conveyance projects take these steps, they can get  Federal grants both directly for the public benefits and for an equal  value investment in the water supply component of the project. Thus,  the Federal Government will provide $50 million for the general water  supply benefits of a project if the project also has $50 million in  fish and wildlife or water quality benefits either directly from the  project or from an associated watershed restoration plan.   The bill not only increases funding for drought resiliency projects,  it expedites their approvals and assists them more cost-effectively,  stretching taxpayer dollars further.   The traditional Bureau of Reclamation model for approving and funding  new water supply projects has involved the following:   No. 1, reclamation studies new projects in detail, which can take a  decade or more for major projects.   No. 2, once Reclamation's studies are complete, Congress authorizes  projects individually, which can take another 3 to 5 years or longer in  many cases.   No. 3, the design and construction can take a decade or longer.   One can quickly see that this model can end up taking decades to  construct significant new water supply projects. This is especially the  case given the limitations of Federal budgets and the increasing cost  of major projects in recent years. Given the tremendous challenge posed  by climate change to western water supply, we need a nimbler and more  responsive model.   Mike Connor, the Deputy Secretary of the Interior during the Obama  Administration and currently Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil  Works, testified in support of a new model during an October 8, 2015,  hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Deputy Secretary Connor stated:         The traditional Reclamation business model, in which       feasibility studies, consistent with the 1983 Principles and       Guidelines for Water and Related Resources Development, are       first authorized, funded, and submitted to Congress, and then       construction is authorized and funded, does not always       address the needs of project sponsors at the state and local       levels. Moreover, given budget limitations and the       availability of other available financing mechanisms, the       historic Federal role in financing water storage projects       through the Bureau of Reclamation must be revisited with a       greater emphasis on non-Federal financing.    In response to the concerns articulated by then-Deputy Secretary  Connor and others, the bill we are introducing today, building on the  2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, makes two  significant changes to the traditional Reclamation model. These changes  expedite project approvals and make more cost-effective use of  available Federal funding.   First, the bill eliminates the need for Congress to authorize  individual water recycling and desalination projects and non-Federal  storage projects a Federal investment of less than $250 million. It can  take 3 to 5 years or longer for projects to get legislatively approved.  In fact, zero new water recycling projects were authorized from 2009 to  2017 despite dozens of meritorious projects with approved feasibility  studies.   Federal storage projects, which are often more controversial,  continue to require congressional authorization, as do non-Federal  storage projects with a greater than $250 million Federal investment.  The bill shortens the timeline for congressional approval of these  projects through directing Reclamation to follow a process that the  Army Corps of Engineers uses to notify Congress of completed  feasibility studies each year to set up an orderly timeline to  authorize projects.   Second, the bill no longer requires 100 percent Federal funding  upfront as was necessary under the traditional Reclamation model.  Instead, the bill allows a maximum of 50 percent Federal funding for  federally owned projects and a maximum of 25 percent Federal funding  for non-Federal projects that are built by States, water districts, or  Indian Tribes.   Federal dollars can be stretched further by the partnerships with  States and water districts that will be fostered under the bill. For  example, the proposed expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir in California  would be funded nearly 50 percent by the State of California, which has  already conditionally awarded funding, in addition to potentially 20 to  25 percent by the Federal Government and the remaining 25 to 30 percent  by water users.   Multipartner projects like the Los Vaqueros expansion frequently have  multiple benefits. For example, much of the State and Federal funding  for the Los Vaqueros expansion would go to augment the water supply of  wildlife refuges that provide essential water for migratory birds on  the Pacific flyway. These benefits would complement the project's water  supply benefits for many Bay Area water districts.   If proposed storage projects solely provide irrigation and general  municipal and industrial water supply benefits, the bill authorizes  only low-interest loans to support these projects.   In contrast, the bill authorizes grants for storage and conveyance  projects that include environmental benefits, drinking water benefits  for disadvantaged communities, or other public benefits either as part  of the project design or as part of a watershed restoration plan  adopted together with the project.   Let me give an example of how this works. If a project sponsor is  seeking $100 million in Federal funding for a $400 million non-Federal  storage project, the sponsor can get that $100 million funding as a  grant if there is  [[Page S2232]]  $100 million in public benefits from either the project itself or other  projects as part of a watershed restoration plan approved with the  project.   The public benefits could be either drinking water for disadvantaged  communities or fish and wildlife benefits. Some examples of fish and  wildlife or water quality benefits from a watershed plan could include  water leasing during a dry year, water sharing agreements, water  banking, ongoing water conservation, and related activities if they  provide fish and wildlife or water quality benefits; environmental  restoration projects; and natural water retention and release projects.   The longer and more severe droughts coming with climate change will  adversely affect not just farms and cities but also the natural  environment. The bill includes provisions to improve species' drought  resiliency as well.   The significant funding authorization of $250 million for  environmental restoration can be used to benefit many different  species, including fish and migratory birds. Some authorized uses of  this funding include improved habitat for salmon, Delta smelt, and  other fish species adversely affected by the Bureau of Reclamation's  water projects; additional water for wildlife refuges hosting migratory  birds along the Pacific flyway; improved stream gauges, monitoring and  science to better understand how to restore species and to operate  Reclamation water projects with reduced environmental impacts; ensuring  that when Sacramento Valley rice growers sell their water and idle  their crops, some water is left behind and applied to bare fields in  late summer and early fall to create shallow flooded habitat during a  critical shorebird migration period; and assistance in implementing  water-related settlements with State agencies and State water quality  laws.   The bill would also authorize $50 million of the broader storage  funding for natural water retention and release projects.   These projects would help restore stream and river channels with  natural materials like wetlands. Like many other projects prioritized  by the bill, these projects could have multiple benefits, including  increased groundwater recharge, improved flood protection, and  increased floodplain habitat to benefit salmon and other species. I  look forward to receiving comments on ways to prioritize multibenefit  projects like natural water storage projects as we move forward with  the bill.   The bill also authorizes pay-for-performance environmental  restoration approaches that award grants contingent on the success of  the restoration effort. These approaches can expedite environmental  restoration and build public/private partnerships to increase the  number of acres restored.   In addition, the bill makes clear that it must be implemented  consistently with all Federal environmental laws, including the  Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the  Clean Water Act and all other environmental laws. All applicable state  laws must also be followed.   California is home to more than 40 million people, but our major  statewide water infrastructure hasn't significantly changed in the past  50 years, when we had only 16 million people.   We must modernize the system or we risk becoming a desert state.  Critically, this means putting in place infrastructure to allow our  cities, our farmers, and our natural communities to withstand the  severe droughts that we are projected to face as a result of climate  change.   I hope my western colleagues will join my cosponsors and me on this  bill because drought is a serious threat for all of our States.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:   S. 2166. A bill to amend the Reclamation States Emergency Drought  Relief Act of 1991 and the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009  to provide grants to States and Indian Tribes for programs to  voluntarily repurpose agricultural land to reduce consumptive water  use, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources.    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Restore Aging Infrastructure Now RAIN Act, which I introduced today.  Senator Alex Padilla is cosponsoring the legislation.   This bill has three purposes: No. 1, upgrade aging canals and other  facilities owned by the Bureau of Reclamation to provide environmental  and other benefits; No. 2, for the first time provide grant funding  rather than loans for Reclamation facility upgrades that provide  drinking water for disadvantaged communities; and No. 3, incentivize  agricultural and municipal irrigation districts to participate in these  projects by giving them a 15 percent discount on what they owe for  repairing the aging facilities that serve them.   Let me explain these three bill purposes in more detail. First,  Congress has appropriated $3.2 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation to  repair its aging canals, dams and other facilities. If the Federal  taxpayers are spending this much money to retool Reclamation  infrastructure for the needs of the 21st century, the Department of the  Interior should have the authority to modify the Reclamation facilities  to achieve increased environmental benefits, drinking water for  disadvantaged communities, and other project benefits.   This bill applies to Reclamation ``transferred works'' facilities,  which are operated and maintained by agricultural or municipal water  districts. The bill authorizes Reclamation to modify these transferred  works facilities when the Agency is repairing them, as long as the  modifications add no more than 25 percent of the cost of the repair  projects, or $25 million for repair projects costing less than $100  million.   In California, this could be particularly helpful for projects to  restore major Central Valley Project canals that have lost up to 60  percent of their conveyance capacity due to subsidence. These projects  are important to allow farmers to capture runoff from our increasingly  concentrated winter storms and move the water to overdrafted areas  where it is needed to recharge the local aquifers.  [[Page S2235]]    As I mentioned, the bill applies to those Reclamation facilities  known as ``transferred works,'' which are operated and maintained by  agricultural or irrigation water districts. In order to modify these  projects when they are being repaired, the Secretary must obtain the  consent of the transferred works operating entity and any individual  water district that would receive less water under the modified  project.   Many Bureau of Reclamation facilities were built for the sole purpose  of assisting agricultural water supply. This irrigation focus is  critically important in the arid West. However, as climate change  stretches western water supplies, Reclamation facilities will need to  serve multiple purposes as efficiently as possible.   There are many rural communities in the areas served by Reclamation  facilities that have dwindling water supplies. In California, many of  these communities are home to migrant farmworkers who plant and harvest  the crops that Reclamation water deliveries support.   All too often, these communities' water supplies have become  unreliable as groundwater tables drop, or drought reduces surface water  supplies for lengthy periods. Many of these communities lack the  ratepayer base and income levels to provide clean drinking water to  meet their residents' basic daily needs.   In order to meet this challenge, the bill authorizes Reclamation to  offer grants rather than loans when it modifies existing Reclamation  facilities to provide drinking water for disadvantaged communities.  Eligible communities are defined using existing precedent that their  median family income must not exceed 80 percent of the statewide median  family income.   In California, this could be particular helpful for the major canal  repair projects which are restoring the original capacity of the  Friant-Kern Canal, the California Aqueduct, and the Delta-Mendota  Canal, all of which have been damaged by subsidence. Under the bill,  Reclamation can now modify these upgraded canals to provide turnouts to  recharge the aquifers of disadvantaged communities along the canals.   As a result, when we have wet years like this past winter,  Reclamation could send some of the flood flows to help these  communities boost their local water supplies.   These project modifications can be an efficient way to assist these  disadvantaged communities; the canals already exist, works crews will  already be mobilized to repair them, and in many cases, the canals run  very near the communities that would benefit.   To make the bill work, agricultural and municipal water districts  must participate in these modifications to Reclamation facility repair  projects.   In many cases, the water providers will face disincentives to  participate in these projects. Some providers may see their benefits  reduced. All providers will have to accept significant delay in  obtaining the benefits of the restoration of these projects. It will  take significant time to modify the projects in a manner that the  providers can accept and then to conduct environmental compliance on  the proposed modification. The providers will also have to accept  modified project operations that give increased priority to public  benefits.   To offset these disincentives for water providers to participate in  modifications to projects which increase just public benefits, the bill  reduces the amount the providers have to pay for the underlying repair  projects by 15 percent. The result is that each project beneficiary  will pay 85 percent of the costs for the modified project that the  beneficiary would otherwise have been allocated.   This provision sets up a financial incentive for water providers to  support modified projects that solely increase environmental and other  public benefits without increasing water diversions or other water  supply benefits. Without this financial incentive, water providers  might be expected to frequently oppose such modification of the  projects that they rely on for water deliveries. In the case of canal  restoration projects, the agricultural water districts will receive  less water than they would have under the original canals at full  capacity if an increased amount of the water is diverted for dedicated  to disadvantaged communities or wildlife refuges. The financial  incentive is important in this context to avoid generating agricultural  water district opposition to project modifications to benefit  disadvantaged communities and wildlife refuges.   This approach is consistent with Reclamation programs like the Title  XVI and large-scale water recycling programs. These programs provide 25  percent Federal grant funding for projects that increase municipal  water supplies, even where the benefiting communities are not  disadvantaged. These grants are justified because the recycled water  programs provide both water supply and broader public benefits by  reducing pressure to divert water from often overallocated streams and  rivers. With this bill, too, the modified projects merit some Federal  grant funding because they provide a range of public benefits beyond  just regular water supply, including potentially environmental benefits  or drinking water for disadvantaged communities.   Given the inevitability of increasingly severe and lengthy droughts  as the West's climate changes, it will be essential to provide  incentives to collaborate on multibenefit projects that bring  agricultural, environmental, and urban interests together to address  the very serious challenge of maintaining sufficiently reliable water  supply for all, including disadvantaged communities. This proposed  legislation seeks to increase incentives for such needed collaboration.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA:   S. 2203. A bill to require the conduct of winter season  reconnaissance of atmospheric rivers on the West Coast of the United  States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Canal Conveyance Capacity Restoration Act, which I introduced today.  Representative Jim Costa has introduced companion legislation in the  House of Representatives.   The bill authorizes one-third cost-share totaling $653 million for  restoring the capacity of the Friant-Kern Canal, the Delta-Mendota  Canal, and the California Aqueduct.   Coordinated legislation in the State legislature introduced by State  Senator Melissa Hurtado has led to a downpayment on a State cost-share  for restoring the canals' capacity. Local water districts would be  responsible for the remainder of the cost not covered by the State or  Federal governments.   In addition, the bill authorizes an additional $180 million to  restore salmon runs on the San Joaquin River. The funding is for fish  passage structures, levees, and other improvements that will allow the  threatened Central Valley Spring-run Chinook salmon to swim freely  upstream from the ocean to the Friant Dam.   My bill would help California water users and California's Nation- leading agriculture industry comply with a recent State requirement to  end the overpumping of groundwater. The stakes are huge: If we don't  bring groundwater into balance, then the San Joaquin Valley will lose  access to about 2 million acre-feet of water per year.   Unless local water agencies and the State and Federal governments  act, a recent U.C. Berkeley study has projected severe impacts from  these water supply losses: 798,000 acres of land would have to be  retired from agricultural production, nearly one-sixth of the working  farmland in an area that produces half the fruit and vegetables grown  in the Nation; and $5.9 billion would be lost in annual farm income in  a region that is almost entirely reliant on agriculture.   One of the most economical and efficient ways to restore groundwater  balance is to convey floodwater to farmland where it can recharge the  aquifer. California has the most variable precipitation of any State.  When massive storms from atmospheric rivers occur, there is runoff to  recharge aquifers--but only if we can effectively convey the  floodwaters throughout the San Joaquin Valley to recharge areas.   However, the major canals are in desperate need of repair and have  lost as much as 60 percent of their capacity. The bill I am introducing  today would provide Federal assistance to help fix these Federal  canals.   Specifically, the bill would authorize $653.4 million in a Federal  funding-cost share for three major projects to restore Federal canals  damaged by subsidence to their former capacity: $180 million for the  Friant-Kern Canal, which would move an additional 100,000 acre-feet per  year on average; $183.9 million for the Delta Mendota Canal, which  would move an additional 62,000 acre-feet per year on average; and  $289.5 million for California Aqueduct repairs, which would move an  additional 205,000 acre-feet per year on average. While parts of the  California Aqueduct are State-owned, the majority of the repairs are on  its federally owned portion.   This will give local farmers a fighting chance to bring their  groundwater basins into balance without being forced to retire vast  amounts of land.   Critically, the ability to deliver floodwaters through restored  Federal canals will allow the water districts to invest in their own  turnouts, pumps, detention basins, and other groundwater recharge  projects. The South Valley Water Association, which covers just a small  part of the valley, provided my office with a list of 36 such projects  for its area alone.   The Public Policy Institute of California, PPIC has determined that  groundwater recharge projects are the best option to help the San  Joaquin Valley comply with the new State groundwater pumping law. PPIC  projects that the valley can make up 300,000 to 500,000 acre-feet of  its groundwater deficit through recharge projects.   A study commissioned by the coalition group Water Blueprint for the  San Joaquin Valley estimates that reductions in groundwater could cause  a loss of up to 42,000 farm and agricultural jobs in the San Joaquin  Valley. Another 40,000 jobs or more could be lost statewide each year  due to reductions in valley agricultural production, putting the total  at approximately 85,000 jobs statewide. Most of these impacts will fall  disproportionately on economically disadvantaged communities.   Let me now turn to the three critical canals that the bill would help  restore. The Friant-Kern Canal is a key feature of the Friant Division  of the Federal Central Valley Project on the Eastside of the San  Joaquin Valley. For nearly 70 years, the Friant Division successfully  kept groundwater tables stable on the Eastside. This provided a  sustainable source of water for farms and for thousands of Californians  and more than 50 small, rural, or disadvantaged communities who rely  entirely on groundwater for their household water supplies.   But unsustainable groundwater pumping in the valley has reduced the  Friant-Kern Canal's ability to deliver water to all who need it. Land  elevation subsidence caused by overpumping means that not all of the  supplies stored at Friant Dam can be conveyed through the canal. In  some areas, the canal can carry only 40 percent of what it is designed  to deliver.   In 2017, a very wet year in which we should have banked as much  floodwater as possible, the Friant-Kern Canal delivered 300,000 acre- feet of water less than it would have conveyed before subsidence. This  water would have helped recharge groundwater in the south San Joaquin  Valley, where the impacts of reduced water deliveries, water quality  issues, and groundwater regulation are expected to be most severe.   The California Aqueduct serves more than 27 million people in  Southern California and the Silicon Valley and more than 750,000 acres  of the Nation's most productive farmland. But despite its name, much of  the California Aqueduct is owned by the Federal Government and serves  portions of Silicon Valley, small towns and communities in the northern  San Joaquin Valley, and farms from Firebaugh to Kettleman City. The  aqueduct represents a successful 70-year partnership between the  Federal Government and the State of California.   In recent years, particularly recent drought years, the California  Aqueduct has subsided. It has lost as much as 20 percent of its  capacity to move water to California's families, farms, and businesses.  California is leading efforts to repair the aqueduct and is working to  provide its share of funding, but the Federal Government will also need  to pay its fair share. The bill I am introducing today would authorize  $289.5  [[Page S2230]]  million toward restoring the California Aqueduct.   The Delta-Mendota Canal stretches southward 117 miles from the C.W.  Bill Jones Pumping Plant along the western edge of the San Joaquin  Valley, parallel to the California Aqueduct. The Delta-Mendota Canal  has lost 15 percent of its conveyance capacity due to subsidence. The  bill I am introducing today would authorize $183.9 million toward  restoring its full ability to convey floodwaters to farms needing to  recharge groundwater and to wildlife refuges of critical importance for  migratory waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway.   This bill responds to a potential crisis that very possibly could  cause the forced retirement of nearly one-sixth of the working farmland  in an area that produces half of America's fruits and vegetables.   These are Federal canals, and the Federal Government must help give  these farmers and agricultural communities a fighting chance to keep  their lands in production.   Lastly, this legislation helps to restore a historic salmon run on  California's second longest river, the San Joaquin.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.                                  ______    Madam President, I rise today to speak about the  STREAM Act, Support to Rehydrate the Environment, Agriculture and  Municipalities Act, which I am introducing today alongside my  cosponsors, Senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema. This bill is  intended to help Western States upgrade their water infrastructure in  preparation for the severe droughts and weather whiplash that we have  seen the past few years and that will worsen significantly with climate  change.   If we don't take action now, it is only going to get worse. Lawrence  Berkeley National Laboratory scientists project that climate change  will cause a 54-percent drop in the Sierras' snowpack within the next  20 to 40 years and a 79-percent drop by the end of the century. This  change alone could be devastating for California because we absolutely  depend on this snowpack. The Sierra snowpack provides 30 percent of our  water supply and is our biggest reservoir.   For these reasons and others, we need an ``all of the above'' water  strategy, including increased water supply; incentivizing projects that  build in environmental benefits and drinking water for disadvantaged  communities, and investing in separate environmental restoration  efforts.   The bill I am introducing today helps meet this challenge in four  fundamental ways:   No. 1, it authorizes significant water supply funding that, in  combination with the bipartisan infrastructure law, would provide  California with 1.04 million additional acre-feet of water per year on  average, enough water for over 6 million people.   No. 2, it provides additional financial incentives for water supply  projects that include environmental benefits and drinking water for  disadvantaged communities.   No. 3, it reforms the congressional review process to more quickly  approve water supply projects;   No. 4, it significantly invests not only in water supply projects but  also in environmental restoration to help imperiled species adapt to  climate change.   The recent drought in the West from 2020 to 2022 illustrates why this  bill is so desperately needed.   In 2021, the drought caused the California agriculture industry to  shrink by an estimated 8,745 jobs and incur $1.2 billion in direct  costs, according to a report prepared for the California Department of  Food and Agriculture by researchers at the University of California at  Merced. Reduced water deliveries resulted in 395,000 acres of cropland  left dry and unplanted.   Counting ``spillover effects'' in the broader economy, the U.C.  Merced analysis found the total impacts were more than 14,600 lost  jobs, both full time and part time, and $1.7 billion in gross revenue  losses.   In both 2021 and 2022, homes in significant parts of the State were  at risk of running dry. In 2021, large parts of Marin and Sonoma  Counties and the Mendocino coast came very close to losing all water  supply. In 2022, much of Los Angeles, Ventura, and San Bernardino  Counties were placed under emergency orders limiting them to once-a- week landscape irrigation, with the possibility of a complete  irrigation shutoff that was only avoided by the timely arrival of  multiple atmospheric rivers last fall.   In California, one in eight acres statewide has burned from wildfires  in the last decade, with the past 2 years being the worst on record.  The drought has been devastating to the aquatic ecosystem as well as  our forests. As just one example, the endangered winter-run Chinook  salmon depend on sufficient cold water released by Shasta Dam to rear  their offspring in the Sacramento River.   With limited water available in 2021, NOAA Fisheries models predict  that approximately 75 percent of the winter run Chinook salmon's eggs  died from elevated water temperatures. This is a species with three 1- year age classes, and a prolonged drought could threaten the survival  of the species.   To increase drought resiliency in California and other Western  States, the bill authorizes the following funding over the next 5  years: $750 million for surface and groundwater storage projects and  supporting conveyance, including $50 million for natural water  retention and release projects; $300 million for water recycling  projects; $150 million for desalination projects; $250 million for  environmental restoration projects; and $100 million for drinking water  for disadvantaged communities.   This funding builds on the bipartisan infrastructure law's funding of  $1.15 billion for storage projects, $550 million for water recycling  projects, and $250 million for desalination projects.   The STREAM Act, in combination with the bipartisan infrastructure  law, would provide California with the Federal cost-share for  approximately 1,042,000 acre-feet per year of additional water supply,  or enough water for over 6 million people. This comes from the  following:   Enough funding for California to finally build three major off-stream  storage projects providing 370,000 acre-feet of water on average each  year: Sites Reservoir, the Los Vaqueros Expansion, and the BF Sisk  raise. In addition, the storage funding could provide an additional  55,000 acre-feet per year from some combination of other smaller  surface and groundwater storage projects like the Sacramento Regional  Groundwater Bank or Del Puerto Canyon Reservoir. All of the projects  are non-Federal projects with a 25-percent Federal cost share, with the  exception of the Federal BF Sisk Raise with a 50-percent Federal cost- share.   Enough funding for 532,000 additional acre-feet from water recycling  projects, from the $300 million authorized in the bill plus $550  million in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, with a 25-percent  Federal cost-share for projects.   Enough funding for approximately 85,000 additional acre-feet from the  $150 million authorized in the bill for desalination projects, plus  $250 million in the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, with a 25  percent Federal cost-share for projects.   While virtually everyone supports water recycling projects, surface  and groundwater storage projects are sometimes more controversial. I  want to point out a 2022 report from the widely respected Public Policy  Institute of California, PPIC, which relates to the benefits of  additional surface and groundwater storage as California's climate is  changing.   Many climate forecasters emphasize that as climate change  intensifies, California will get more of its precipitation in a few  large to extraordinarily large storms fueled by atmospheric rivers, and  more of the precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow. In  between the bursts of atmospheric rivers there will be longer and more  intense droughts. We have definitely seen a preview of this pattern  this year.   PPIC has studied these projections and estimated that there is  substantial water in wet years that is not needed to maintain healthy  Delta outflows but currently cannot be captured because California  lacks the infrastructure to  [[Page S2231]]  store for future dry periods. PPIC suggests that given this reality,  cost-effective storage projects in appropriate locations could help  improve California's drought resiliency.   PPIC also argues that these storage projects should be managed for  environmental flow benefits as well as water supply benefits. This bill  would help with that because Federal funding for Sites Reservoir would  help provide cold water for salmon, and Federal funding for the  expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir would provide needed water for  wildlife refuges. Regarding cold water reserves for salmon in  particular, these reserves will be critical to prevent salmon runs from  being wiped out during the potential fourth, fifth, and maybe even  sixth and seventh years of devastating droughts.   The bill's funding authorizations apply not just to California but  throughout the 17 Western States where the Bureau of Reclamation has a  presence. Many of these States have recently benefited from the Bureau  of Reclamation's storage, water recycling, and desalination programs  and/or have projects currently seeking funding from these programs,  including Arizona, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Nevada, and  New Mexico. I believe the Federal funding assistance authorized by this  bill will be particularly important for all seven Colorado River basin  States as the States negotiate the next painful round of water supply  cuts from the Colorado River between now and 2026 in order to meet the  challenge of an increasingly dry Colorado River basin.   In Arizona, the STREAM Act would significantly advance the Salt River  Project's proposal to raise Bartlett Dam on the Verde River to  counteract the loss of approximately one-third of the nearby Horseshoe  Dam's capacity from accumulating sediment.   The bill uses financial incentives to encourage storage and  conveyance projects to include environmental benefits and other public  benefits such as drinking water for disadvantaged communities. This is  important to ensure that the environment and disadvantaged communities  are included in our drought resilience strategies.   If proposed storage projects solely provide irrigation and general  municipal and industrial water supply benefits, the bill authorizes  only low-interest loans to support these projects.   In contrast, the bill authorizes grants for storage and conveyance  projects that include environmental benefits, drinking water benefits  for disadvantaged communities, or other public benefits either as part  of the project design or as part of a watershed restoration plan  adopted together with the project.   This access to grants gives project sponsors a strong financial  incentive to design environmental and disadvantaged community benefits  into their projects. This approach builds on the experience of the  Proposition 1 water bond California's voters passed by a 2-to-1 margin  in 2014, which also incentivizes projects with environmental and other  public benefits.    If storage and conveyance projects take these steps, they can get  Federal grants both directly for the public benefits and for an equal  value investment in the water supply component of the project. Thus,  the Federal Government will provide $50 million for the general water  supply benefits of a project if the project also has $50 million in  fish and wildlife or water quality benefits either directly from the  project or from an associated watershed restoration plan.   The bill not only increases funding for drought resiliency projects,  it expedites their approvals and assists them more cost-effectively,  stretching taxpayer dollars further.   The traditional Bureau of Reclamation model for approving and funding  new water supply projects has involved the following:   No. 1, reclamation studies new projects in detail, which can take a  decade or more for major projects.   No. 2, once Reclamation's studies are complete, Congress authorizes  projects individually, which can take another 3 to 5 years or longer in  many cases.   No. 3, the design and construction can take a decade or longer.   One can quickly see that this model can end up taking decades to  construct significant new water supply projects. This is especially the  case given the limitations of Federal budgets and the increasing cost  of major projects in recent years. Given the tremendous challenge posed  by climate change to western water supply, we need a nimbler and more  responsive model.   Mike Connor, the Deputy Secretary of the Interior during the Obama  Administration and currently Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil  Works, testified in support of a new model during an October 8, 2015,  hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.  Deputy Secretary Connor stated:         The traditional Reclamation business model, in which       feasibility studies, consistent with the 1983 Principles and       Guidelines for Water and Related Resources Development, are       first authorized, funded, and submitted to Congress, and then       construction is authorized and funded, does not always       address the needs of project sponsors at the state and local       levels. Moreover, given budget limitations and the       availability of other available financing mechanisms, the       historic Federal role in financing water storage projects       through the Bureau of Reclamation must be revisited with a       greater emphasis on non-Federal financing.    In response to the concerns articulated by then-Deputy Secretary  Connor and others, the bill we are introducing today, building on the  2016 Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, makes two  significant changes to the traditional Reclamation model. These changes  expedite project approvals and make more cost-effective use of  available Federal funding.   First, the bill eliminates the need for Congress to authorize  individual water recycling and desalination projects and non-Federal  storage projects a Federal investment of less than $250 million. It can  take 3 to 5 years or longer for projects to get legislatively approved.  In fact, zero new water recycling projects were authorized from 2009 to  2017 despite dozens of meritorious projects with approved feasibility  studies.   Federal storage projects, which are often more controversial,  continue to require congressional authorization, as do non-Federal  storage projects with a greater than $250 million Federal investment.  The bill shortens the timeline for congressional approval of these  projects through directing Reclamation to follow a process that the  Army Corps of Engineers uses to notify Congress of completed  feasibility studies each year to set up an orderly timeline to  authorize projects.   Second, the bill no longer requires 100 percent Federal funding  upfront as was necessary under the traditional Reclamation model.  Instead, the bill allows a maximum of 50 percent Federal funding for  federally owned projects and a maximum of 25 percent Federal funding  for non-Federal projects that are built by States, water districts, or  Indian Tribes.   Federal dollars can be stretched further by the partnerships with  States and water districts that will be fostered under the bill. For  example, the proposed expansion of Los Vaqueros Reservoir in California  would be funded nearly 50 percent by the State of California, which has  already conditionally awarded funding, in addition to potentially 20 to  25 percent by the Federal Government and the remaining 25 to 30 percent  by water users.   Multipartner projects like the Los Vaqueros expansion frequently have  multiple benefits. For example, much of the State and Federal funding  for the Los Vaqueros expansion would go to augment the water supply of  wildlife refuges that provide essential water for migratory birds on  the Pacific flyway. These benefits would complement the project's water  supply benefits for many Bay Area water districts.   If proposed storage projects solely provide irrigation and general  municipal and industrial water supply benefits, the bill authorizes  only low-interest loans to support these projects.   In contrast, the bill authorizes grants for storage and conveyance  projects that include environmental benefits, drinking water benefits  for disadvantaged communities, or other public benefits either as part  of the project design or as part of a watershed restoration plan  adopted together with the project.   Let me give an example of how this works. If a project sponsor is  seeking $100 million in Federal funding for a $400 million non-Federal  storage project, the sponsor can get that $100 million funding as a  grant if there is  [[Page S2232]]  $100 million in public benefits from either the project itself or other  projects as part of a watershed restoration plan approved with the  project.   The public benefits could be either drinking water for disadvantaged  communities or fish and wildlife benefits. Some examples of fish and  wildlife or water quality benefits from a watershed plan could include  water leasing during a dry year, water sharing agreements, water  banking, ongoing water conservation, and related activities if they  provide fish and wildlife or water quality benefits; environmental  restoration projects; and natural water retention and release projects.   The longer and more severe droughts coming with climate change will  adversely affect not just farms and cities but also the natural  environment. The bill includes provisions to improve species' drought  resiliency as well.   The significant funding authorization of $250 million for  environmental restoration can be used to benefit many different  species, including fish and migratory birds. Some authorized uses of  this funding include improved habitat for salmon, Delta smelt, and  other fish species adversely affected by the Bureau of Reclamation's  water projects; additional water for wildlife refuges hosting migratory  birds along the Pacific flyway; improved stream gauges, monitoring and  science to better understand how to restore species and to operate  Reclamation water projects with reduced environmental impacts; ensuring  that when Sacramento Valley rice growers sell their water and idle  their crops, some water is left behind and applied to bare fields in  late summer and early fall to create shallow flooded habitat during a  critical shorebird migration period; and assistance in implementing  water-related settlements with State agencies and State water quality  laws.   The bill would also authorize $50 million of the broader storage  funding for natural water retention and release projects.   These projects would help restore stream and river channels with  natural materials like wetlands. Like many other projects prioritized  by the bill, these projects could have multiple benefits, including  increased groundwater recharge, improved flood protection, and  increased floodplain habitat to benefit salmon and other species. I  look forward to receiving comments on ways to prioritize multibenefit  projects like natural water storage projects as we move forward with  the bill.   The bill also authorizes pay-for-performance environmental  restoration approaches that award grants contingent on the success of  the restoration effort. These approaches can expedite environmental  restoration and build public/private partnerships to increase the  number of acres restored.   In addition, the bill makes clear that it must be implemented  consistently with all Federal environmental laws, including the  Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the  Clean Water Act and all other environmental laws. All applicable state  laws must also be followed.   California is home to more than 40 million people, but our major  statewide water infrastructure hasn't significantly changed in the past  50 years, when we had only 16 million people.   We must modernize the system or we risk becoming a desert state.  Critically, this means putting in place infrastructure to allow our  cities, our farmers, and our natural communities to withstand the  severe droughts that we are projected to face as a result of climate  change.   I hope my western colleagues will join my cosponsors and me on this  bill because drought is a serious threat for all of our States.                                  ______    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Restore Aging Infrastructure Now RAIN Act, which I introduced today.  Senator Alex Padilla is cosponsoring the legislation.   This bill has three purposes: No. 1, upgrade aging canals and other  facilities owned by the Bureau of Reclamation to provide environmental  and other benefits; No. 2, for the first time provide grant funding  rather than loans for Reclamation facility upgrades that provide  drinking water for disadvantaged communities; and No. 3, incentivize  agricultural and municipal irrigation districts to participate in these  projects by giving them a 15 percent discount on what they owe for  repairing the aging facilities that serve them.   Let me explain these three bill purposes in more detail. First,  Congress has appropriated $3.2 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation to  repair its aging canals, dams and other facilities. If the Federal  taxpayers are spending this much money to retool Reclamation  infrastructure for the needs of the 21st century, the Department of the  Interior should have the authority to modify the Reclamation facilities  to achieve increased environmental benefits, drinking water for  disadvantaged communities, and other project benefits.   This bill applies to Reclamation ``transferred works'' facilities,  which are operated and maintained by agricultural or municipal water  districts. The bill authorizes Reclamation to modify these transferred  works facilities when the Agency is repairing them, as long as the  modifications add no more than 25 percent of the cost of the repair  projects, or $25 million for repair projects costing less than $100  million.   In California, this could be particularly helpful for projects to  restore major Central Valley Project canals that have lost up to 60  percent of their conveyance capacity due to subsidence. These projects  are important to allow farmers to capture runoff from our increasingly  concentrated winter storms and move the water to overdrafted areas  where it is needed to recharge the local aquifers.  [[Page S2235]]    As I mentioned, the bill applies to those Reclamation facilities  known as ``transferred works,'' which are operated and maintained by  agricultural or irrigation water districts. In order to modify these  projects when they are being repaired, the Secretary must obtain the  consent of the transferred works operating entity and any individual  water district that would receive less water under the modified  project.   Many Bureau of Reclamation facilities were built for the sole purpose  of assisting agricultural water supply. This irrigation focus is  critically important in the arid West. However, as climate change  stretches western water supplies, Reclamation facilities will need to  serve multiple purposes as efficiently as possible.   There are many rural communities in the areas served by Reclamation  facilities that have dwindling water supplies. In California, many of  these communities are home to migrant farmworkers who plant and harvest  the crops that Reclamation water deliveries support.   All too often, these communities' water supplies have become  unreliable as groundwater tables drop, or drought reduces surface water  supplies for lengthy periods. Many of these communities lack the  ratepayer base and income levels to provide clean drinking water to  meet their residents' basic daily needs.   In order to meet this challenge, the bill authorizes Reclamation to  offer grants rather than loans when it modifies existing Reclamation  facilities to provide drinking water for disadvantaged communities.  Eligible communities are defined using existing precedent that their  median family income must not exceed 80 percent of the statewide median  family income.   In California, this could be particular helpful for the major canal  repair projects which are restoring the original capacity of the  Friant-Kern Canal, the California Aqueduct, and the Delta-Mendota  Canal, all of which have been damaged by subsidence. Under the bill,  Reclamation can now modify these upgraded canals to provide turnouts to  recharge the aquifers of disadvantaged communities along the canals.   As a result, when we have wet years like this past winter,  Reclamation could send some of the flood flows to help these  communities boost their local water supplies.   These project modifications can be an efficient way to assist these  disadvantaged communities; the canals already exist, works crews will  already be mobilized to repair them, and in many cases, the canals run  very near the communities that would benefit.   To make the bill work, agricultural and municipal water districts  must participate in these modifications to Reclamation facility repair  projects.   In many cases, the water providers will face disincentives to  participate in these projects. Some providers may see their benefits  reduced. All providers will have to accept significant delay in  obtaining the benefits of the restoration of these projects. It will  take significant time to modify the projects in a manner that the  providers can accept and then to conduct environmental compliance on  the proposed modification. The providers will also have to accept  modified project operations that give increased priority to public  benefits.   To offset these disincentives for water providers to participate in  modifications to projects which increase just public benefits, the bill  reduces the amount the providers have to pay for the underlying repair  projects by 15 percent. The result is that each project beneficiary  will pay 85 percent of the costs for the modified project that the  beneficiary would otherwise have been allocated.   This provision sets up a financial incentive for water providers to  support modified projects that solely increase environmental and other  public benefits without increasing water diversions or other water  supply benefits. Without this financial incentive, water providers  might be expected to frequently oppose such modification of the  projects that they rely on for water deliveries. In the case of canal  restoration projects, the agricultural water districts will receive  less water than they would have under the original canals at full  capacity if an increased amount of the water is diverted for dedicated  to disadvantaged communities or wildlife refuges. The financial  incentive is important in this context to avoid generating agricultural  water district opposition to project modifications to benefit  disadvantaged communities and wildlife refuges.   This approach is consistent with Reclamation programs like the Title  XVI and large-scale water recycling programs. These programs provide 25  percent Federal grant funding for projects that increase municipal  water supplies, even where the benefiting communities are not  disadvantaged. These grants are justified because the recycled water  programs provide both water supply and broader public benefits by  reducing pressure to divert water from often overallocated streams and  rivers. With this bill, too, the modified projects merit some Federal  grant funding because they provide a range of public benefits beyond  just regular water supply, including potentially environmental benefits  or drinking water for disadvantaged communities.   Given the inevitability of increasingly severe and lengthy droughts  as the West's climate changes, it will be essential to provide  incentives to collaborate on multibenefit projects that bring  agricultural, environmental, and urban interests together to address  the very serious challenge of maintaining sufficiently reliable water  supply for all, including disadvantaged communities. This proposed  legislation seeks to increase incentives for such needed collaboration.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.                                  ______
