 Can I just offer, a great Democrat Hubert Humphrey said a  long time ago that he who throws mud loses ground, and if we could  somehow get Members of Congress to think about that in relation to this  institution. I don't know how you do it. Maybe it is something you  think about when you have more time. But instead of running against the  institution, which drags everybody down, including the country, build  it up, focus on the positive things, as you have, but don't tear the  institution down, because we are all less for it.
