 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in strong support of  Representative Barbara Lee's amendment to repeal the 2002 Authorization  for Use of Military Force in Iraq.   We cannot allow this President or any President to use an outdated  AUMF intended to address Saddam Hussein to wage unauthorized wars  against whatever leader they are upset with on any given day.   Because of congressional inaction, the U.S. military is operating in  at  [[Page H734]]  least 76 countries across the world, and we have spent trillions of  dollars on military activities since 9/11, largely on unauthorized wars  abroad, when we could be helping people at home, expanding Social  Security, ensuring healthcare is a human right, and investing in green  jobs and renewable energy.   Recently, the President threatened this bill with a veto. It only  made the case more clear: Congress must reassert its constitutional  authority per Article I, Section 8, to declare war.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support both Representative Ro  Khanna's bill to prohibit funding for war with Iran and Representative  Lee's efforts to repeal the 2002 AUMF.
