 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with the  thousands of our Puerto Rican brothers and sisters surviving the loss  and trauma of ongoing natural disasters that have ravaged the island of  Puerto Rico, the youth, the elderly, the ill, the unhoused, those in  poverty, and those living with disabilities who find themselves  disproportionately harmed by food and healthcare insecurity, frequent  power outages, infrastructure collapse, and barriers to transparency.   Just last month, 13-year-old Jaideliz Moreno Ventura died due to  chronic medical supply shortages. The only medical center on her  island, Vieques, has not reopened its doors since Hurricane Maria 3  years ago.   To this day, 240,000 students and their educators must stay home  because their schools are still too unsafe to open, and 5,000 families  remain displaced from their homes.   But the fear and anguish are not limited to those remaining on the  island. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts proudly boasts the fifth  largest Puerto Rican community in the country, and in the Massachusetts  Seventh Congressional District, I represent 35,000 Puerto Ricans.   I have borne witness to both the strength and the pain of those who  were displaced after Hurricane Maria who now call Boston home and those  Puerto Ricans who have called Boston home for decades who fear for  their family members who are still on the island. They share with me  their ongoing fear for their families in Puerto Rico facing ongoing  threats to their homes and their lives.   For too long, this administration has turned its back on the people  of Puerto Rico. It is shameful, and we must not allow it to continue.   I am grateful for the leadership of Chairwoman Lowey and Chairman  Neal in working to organize this much-needed funding package that we  will vote on later today. I also recognize my colleague from New York,  Representative Velazquez, for her unwavering love, which has informed  her unwavering fight for the island.   In my own district, I thank IBA, Chelsea Collaborative, Somos de  Sabana Grande, the Puerto Rican Veterans Association, and many more. I  urge my colleagues to support this package, H.R. 5687.                            ____________________
