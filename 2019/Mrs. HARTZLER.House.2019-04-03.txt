 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule  and the underlying legislation.   The Violence Against Women Act was originally enacted to strengthen  law enforcement's ability to help women suffering from domestic  violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and to bolster their efforts in  preventing future violence. I fully support VAWA's original intent;  however, this rule and the bill under consideration no longer focus on  the women suffering from violence. Instead, H.R. 1585 has been  politicized.   This bill was written to use women to overhaul several unrelated  areas of law, such as unemployment benefits, housing requirements for  nonwomen populations, and the Second Amendment.   In short, the original intent of this measure, to protect women from  abuse, has been hijacked. Not only does this legislation lose focus on  the matter at hand, which is women suffering from violence, it fails to  prioritize a woman's right to privacy, to safety, and to healing from  sexual violence.   Specifically, H.R. 1585 continues a misguided policy adopted under  President Obama, forcing domestic violence survivors to share female- only shelters with men. Unfortunately, we have already seen litigation  in women shelters caused by this type of problematic policy.   For example, as was mentioned by my friend from Arizona, the Naomi's  House women's shelter in California is facing a lawsuit on behalf of  nine women who were sexually harassed by a transgender individual.  Staff at the shelter did not take any disciplinary action due to the  fact that, as a Federal grantee, they are required to take in  transgender men who identify as females.   The women suffering from sexual violence were not only subjected to  additional sexual harassment, but were threatened to be removed from  the shelter if they refused to share a shower and coexist with the  transgender individual.    In a similar case in Alaska, the city of Anchorage is investigating  the Downtown Hope Center, which is a faith-based, nonprofit  organization. The reason? They are allegedly violating a local law  because they provide shelter to only women.   Anchorage is trying to force the Hope Center to house transgender- identifying men alongside women in its overnight, shared-sleeping  facility. However, part of the Hope Center's mission is to provide  women suffering from rape, physical abuse, and violence a safe place to  sleep at night without the presence of men.   I would ask my colleagues: How does this policy advance our goal of  helping women suffering from abuse when it denies them a safe place to  heal? The answer is: It doesn't. These new housing provisions not only  diminish the Violence Against Women Act, but also enable more violence  against women.   While there are many other concerns with the VAWA language, I will  mention just one more.   A 2018 Government Accountability Office report found that Planned  Parenthood received nearly $300,000 from VAWA formula grants during  2013 through 2015. This is extremely disheartening, considering there  have been several undercover investigations and news stories suggesting  that a number of Planned Parenthood affiliates have not been reporting  when clients are victims of statutory rape, child prostitution, or sex  trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, while I fully support increased protections for battered  women, this bill is not the answer. It further victimizes women, and it  uses them to advance other political causes. We need to send this bill  back to all seven committees of jurisdiction to address these concerns  so that a VAWA law can once again focus on alleviating suffering from  violence.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and ``no'' on the  underlying legislation.                                time  1300
