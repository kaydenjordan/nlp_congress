 Madam President, I listened to the statements made by the  Republican leadership this morning on the floor of the U.S. Senate. If  one has a sense of history and memory, their statements are  preposterous.   The last speaker came before us and said: The Democrats are even  threatening to end the filibuster in retribution.   Well, let's stop and think for a moment. Was there a filibuster  affecting the Supreme Court nominees? Was there a requirement of 60- vote margins if there is controversy associated with filling the  vacancy on the Supreme Court? There was until one Senator from  Kentucky, Mr. Mitch McConnell, eliminated the filibuster when it came  to the Supreme Court.   This so-called democratic institution of the filibuster was  eliminated when it came to Supreme Court nominees by that same Senator  McConnell, who comes to the floor and says that the Democrats have  reached an outrageous position: They are threatening the future of the  filibuster.   He eliminated it. When there were changes made in the filibuster on  other court appointments, Senator Reid was careful not to include the  Supreme Court, but Senator McConnell did. Senator McConnell has brought  us to this moment.   Think how different it would be--how different it would be today if  the nominee of this President were subject to a  [[Page S5737]]  filibuster. If it took 60 votes, it means the person nominated would  have to be moderate in their approach. We don't expect that from this  President in filling the vacancy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   I also read and reread one simple fact when it came to Ruth Bader  Ginsburg in 1993. She cleared the Senate Chamber, at a time when the  filibuster rule did apply, with a vote of 96 to 3--96 to 3.   Understand that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a well-known person when she  came before this body for approval to the Supreme Court. She had been  an outspoken advocate for women's rights and equality as an attorney  and advocate for groups like the American Civil Liberties Union. She  had served on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.   As well known as she was for her political beliefs, she cleared this  Senate Chamber with only three dissenting votes--Senator Jesse Helms,  Senator Don Nickles, and Senator Bob Smith--three Republicans. What a  different time it was. Even though her stripes were clear, she was so  well respected as a jurist and a person of integrity that she was  approved by the Senate Chamber.    How far we have fallen. We are in a position now, at this moment,  when Senator McConnell, 4 years ago, established a standard. The  vacancy of Scalia's seat on the Supreme Court led President Obama to  nominate Merrick Garland, a well-respected judge from the DC Circuit. I  remember seeing him and meeting with him after he had been proposed by  President Obama. It was a sad duty to watch him as he walked the Halls  of the Senate. You see, Senator McConnell announced that he didn't want  any Republican Senators to physically meet with Merrick Garland--not  give him the recognition of even a meeting in their office, let alone a  hearing. The argument that Senator McConnell made--and Senator Schumer  said this morning--was that it wasn't President Obama's place to fill  that vacancy; it was the place of the next President of the United  States.   Senator McConnell, basically, declared President Obama was a lameduck  when it came to Supreme Court vacancies in his last year in office and  that the next President, whoever that might be, would make the choice.  Well, one after another, the Republican Senators marched in line behind  that McConnell position, announcing that they, too, agreed that  President Obama was a lameduck when it came to filling Supreme Court  vacancies in his last year in office. They didn't cite the Constitution  because there is no provision in the Constitution that even comes close  to that suggestion. There certainly wasn't any law, and there wasn't  any precedent.   I hear the Republicans come to the floor mentioning Joe Biden's name  and Chuck Schumer's name. Who knows who will be next on their list? The  fact is, the Senate makes the decisions based on majority. At that  point, Senator McConnell had the majority, and he lined up his  membership behind him.   Unfortunately, they are lining up again, but this time Senator  McConnell's position is the exact opposite. This time he is arguing  that because there is a Republican President, he should fill this  vacancy instantly: Get it done. Let's go. His Republican Senators who  took the opposite position 4 years ago are finding some rationalization  to follow him again.   What is at stake in this, of course, is not just the Senate, the  comity of the Senate, the respect we have for one another, the respect  we have for traditions one way or the other and that they be followed  regardless of the President's party; what is at stake, unfortunately,  is also the Supreme Court. This institution, the third branch of  government, is part of a strategy that Senator McConnell has been  pushing forward for years now. It is the intent of the Republicans in  the Senate, through Senator McConnell, to take control of the third  branch of government, the judicial branch. They are desperate to do it.  Time is not on their side.   The demographics of America cannot be held back simply by voter  suppression. They have to count on jurists from every level of the  Federal judiciary to adhere to their minority point of view on so many  important issues. Ironically, one of those issues is the role of women,  the equality of women in America. Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued for that  her whole life. She was smart enough to know she was taking her  argument to a lot of male judges, so she argued for equality for men,  as well as women, during the course of her career on and off the bench.   She was principled, determined, and successful. As an attorney, she  argued and won multiple cases in the Supreme Court in the 1970s,  eventually persuading the all-male Court to apply the 14th Amendment's  equal protection clause to sex-based discrimination. Sadly, we can  predict with almost 100 percent certitude that if Donald Trump and  Mitch McConnell choose her successor, that principle will be under  fire; in fact, it may not even survive.   For all the kind speeches about this principled woman and what she  gave to America--and they are well deserved about Ruth Bader Ginsburg-- watch the nominee who comes from the Trump White House and you will  find, I am afraid, they are not even close to the standard that she  argued for and succeeded.   Today, we are 6 weeks from election day and 7 weeks from the Supreme  Court taking up another case, one which I think is relevant and  important to every single American. The question the Court will decide  is whether the ACA--ObamaCare--will survive. President Trump and  Majority Leader McConnell want to rush the nominee before the Senate  before these two dates arrive.   Do you recall, not that many years ago, when the Republicans  controlled the House of Representatives and voted, I believe, 50  different times to eliminate the Affordable Care Act? Were it not for a  Democratic Senate, they might have achieved their goal. Each and every  time they were asked: What would you replace it with? What would you  say to the 20 million Americans who depend on the Affordable Care Act  for their source of health insurance? What would you say to the rest of  America who depend on the Affordable Care Act for fundamental  protections in health insurance and protections, such as no  discrimination based on preexisting conditions?   Americans understand that. Virtually every family has a story to tell  of someone in their own family with an illness that could be considered  a preexisting condition. The insurance industry even went so far at one  point as to say being a woman was essentially a preexisting condition.  Based on that, the health insurance industry would either charge higher  premiums or refuse coverage.   We got rid of those days. We ended that with the Affordable Care Act.  We ended it with ObamaCare. And now the Republicans, again, want the  insurance industry to have that power over your life. As of this  morning, 6 million Americans have been reported as diagnosed with  COVID-19. Trust me, the insurance industry would make that a  preexisting condition for them and for any others in the future who  should turn up positive on these COVID-19 tests.    What the Republicans are seeking to do in the Supreme Court is what  they failed to do on the floor of the Senate. They tried on the Senate  floor many times--and the last time is well remembered--to end the  Affordable Care Act. Those of us who were here that night watched as a  handful--perhaps three--Republican Senators said no. We all remember  that moment after he had been on the phone with President Trump when  John McCain, the late Senator from Arizona, came through those doors at  2:30 in the morning and cast his ``no'' vote in the well of the Senate  Chamber. I was there just a few feet away and watched every second of  it. It was gripping. It was exciting. For many people, it was giving  them another chance to protect themselves with health insurance,  something the other Republicans were determined to eliminate.   John McCain said then and we say now: If you have a better idea on  the Republican side--President Trump, if you have a better idea than  the ACA--let's see it. How many times has this President made an empty  promise: We have a substitute; I will give it to you in a week, 2  weeks, 3 weeks. They don't have one.   Recently, at a hearing before the Appropriations Subcommittee, I  asked  [[Page S5738]]  three leading health experts and doctors in the Trump administration if  any of them had worked on the so-called Republican substitute. Not a  one. It doesn't exist. It is just an empty answer and an imperfect  answer, at best, from this administration.   I remember February 13, 2016, when Justice Scalia just passed away in  a Presidential election year and Senator McConnell said, to the  surprise of many of us, the following:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       [the Scalia vacancy] should not be filled until we have a new       President.    He stated the McConnell rule in February of 2016, an election year.  Here it is:         The American people should have a voice in the selection of       their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy       should not be filled until we have a new President.    It is pretty clear, isn't it?   Well, Republican Senators all lined up behind him in this new  statement of principle and denied Merrick Garland not only a hearing  but even the courtesy of an office appointment for most of them. The  McConnell rule is clear and unambiguous, and the 2016 Republicans  dutifully fell in line behind it. They said that the American people  should have the last word. An election year Supreme Court vacancy  should be filled in the next Presidential term.   Senator McConnell claims that his rule really had an asterisk at the  end. I don't see one. He said it really depends on which party controls  the Senate. Well, that is certainly a distinction without a difference.  Why should the composition of the Senate dictate whether or not the  American people ``should have a voice in the selection of their next  Supreme Court Justice''? Either the American people have a voice  regarding the future of the Court when there is a vacancy in an  election year or they don't.   Four years ago, Senator McConnell said they do. Now he says they  don't. It is a flip-flop and, oh, the painful contortions I see among  most Republican Senators trying to rationalize posing for holy pictures  4 years ago, saying that the American people should have the last word  and then 4 years later, completely reversing themselves--but they do.   This is not just some Washington debate. The stakes in this debate  are important for every American. It isn't about who gets the last word  on MSNBC or FOX; it is about who gets the last word when you learn  someone in your family has a devastating illness and you are praying to  God you have a health insurance plan that will cover it.   President Trump has made clear he wants to strike down the entire  Affordable Care Act even without a substitute. That is the position the  Trump administration took before the Supreme Court in a case that will  be argued just days after this November 3 election.   President Trump has also made it clear that when he picks a new  Supreme Court Justice, he wants them to agree with him when it comes to  eliminating the Affordable Care Act.   I would say to people across America: Be prepared. If Mitch McConnell  gets his way, if Donald Trump gets his way, if they install a new  Supreme Court Justice who has taken this oath--this political oath to  following the Trump plan--all of America will be at risk because the  protections of the Affordable Care Act will be eliminated by that  Supreme Court.   In 2015, Donald Trump tweeted, as he often does: ``If I win the  Presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike  Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.'' We certainly know what  that means because at least on one occasion, John Roberts has kept  ObamaCare alive.   Let's be clear. The Affordable Care Act is hanging in the balance in  just a few days. The healthcare coverage and protections for  preexisting conditions that millions of American families rely on are  at risk. Republicans were never able to repeal the Affordable Care Act  in the House or on the floor of the Senate--thank you, John McCain--so  they want to do it in the Court. They are trying to accomplish in the  Supreme Court what they cannot accomplish in Congress. If President  Trump and Senator McConnell go through with their plan to jam through a  Supreme Court nominee this year, the Affordable Care Act is doomed.   Did you hear last night when the chairman of the Senate Judiciary  Committee announced--I saw it this morning on television. He announced  that every single Republican Senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee  is going to vote for the Trump nominee for the Supreme Court. We don't  have a nominee yet, do we? The President said he will not announce one  until Saturday of this week. Here is this announcement by the  Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee: He's counted the  votes. It is a done deal.   What does it tell you? It tells you it doesn't make any difference  whom the President nominates--the silence of the lambs in the U.S.  Senate.   If President Trump and Senator McConnell go through with this plan,  America will feel it, and every family will know it. That is why my  Republican colleagues refuse to give the American people the last word  on November 3. They are so uncertain of the reelection of Donald Trump,  they have to do this now, quickly. They are afraid he will not be  renominated, that he will not be reelected, and that he will not be in  a position to fill this vacancy next year. So they are breaking their  own promise to the American people to respect their judgment in the  selection of the Supreme Court nominee.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Michigan  (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Michigan  (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Michigan  (Ms. Stabenow), are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Michigan  (Ms. Stabenow), are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Michigan  (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from New  Jersey, Senator Booker, for an outstanding statement from the heart.   I think about this moment in history. I think about the fact that  just a few weeks ago, we were mourning the loss of John Lewis. He was a  personal friend, a champion and inspiration, one of the real pillars of  the civil rights movement of the 1960s, who lived on to this day and  carried the torch for so many years when it came to civil rights and  equal rights. I will miss him.   Now there is another loss of another giant. Although she was small in  stature, Ruth Bader Ginsburg had an amazing life story. She was an  extraordinarily bright young woman who just asked for a chance to get a  job in New York with one of the law firms, but because she was a woman,  they turned her away. That lost job must have been a disappointment to  her, but as we reflect on it in the history of this Nation, it was the  biggest break we ever had when it came to the cause of women in modern  times because she went on to become a law clerk, a professor, a judge,  and ultimately a Supreme Court Justice.   In the course of that career, she was such a powerful and effective  advocate for the cause of women across America and, I might add, for  the cause of men too. She made history. That job rejection may have  been a disappointment for a day, but as we reflect on it, thank  goodness she was steered to another path and used it so effectively.   If you left this Chamber tonight and walked across the street to the  Supreme Court, you would find a large group of people, as you have  since last Friday, pausing, reflecting, thanking, praying for Ruth  Bader Ginsburg's life. Across there tonight, they are lighting candles,  dropping flowers and notes, crying, commiserating, really noting the  loss America feels.   I was struck personally by my own family's reaction. My daughter, my  daughter-in-law, and so many others confided in me in ways they rarely  do about how much this woman meant to them. It was time for reflection  in my family and, I am sure, a lot of those across the United States.   She had one last request, one dying wish. She handed it to her  granddaughter and she said: Let the next President pick my successor on  the Supreme Court. It is understandable that she would do that. I know  she probably had a hope in her heart as to who that person might be,  but she knew, after the way the vacancy of Antonin Scalia was treated  by the Republicans in the Senate, that was the way they were going to  handle her situation--at least we thought they would.   Then, of course, Senator McConnell announced a 180-degree reversal in  principle--180-degree reversal. Instead of waiting for the election and  new inauguration of the President to fill her vacancy, he made it clear  that Republicans in the Senate are hell-bent to fill this vacancy as  fast as possible. What is the hurry? Why have they changed their  position after 4 years? Do they doubt that President Trump is going to  be reelected? Did that play into this equation? Who knows. But they are  determined to do it because they have an agenda which is more important  than consistency, more important than honor, more important than  principle. Their agenda is to turn back the achievements and progress  made by Ruth Bader Ginsburg and to leave the American people more  vulnerable in their time of need.   A few weeks ago, I took a poll in Illinois to see what the public  sentiment might be on issues. I was a little surprised how overwhelming  the issue of healthcare still is in my State of Illinois. As I  reflected on it, it made sense. We wake up every day, looking for our  masks, wondering how many more people have died, hoping that we can  protect ourselves and our families. So healthcare is on the forefront  of everyone's mind, and, of course, protection for your family is  always your first instinct. People know that without the Affordable  Care Act they will not have that protection.   We remember--many of us do--the debate in creating the Affordable  Care Act 10 years ago. I might say, in my House and Senate careers, it  is the most important issue I have ever voted on. When again will I be  able to help 20 million Americans find health insurance for the first  time? When will there be another opportunity to make sure that health  insurance sold in America treats people fairly?   The Affordable Care Act eliminated lifetime limits on payouts, which  is eminently sensible when you consider the skyrocketing cost of  medical care and how so many situations in life are so darned  expensive. It said to people: You cannot be discriminated against  because you have a preexisting condition.   I remember the day--most of us do--when applying for health insurance  was a long list of questions, and if you happened to just check one of  those ``yes,'' be prepared, because it meant you had a preexisting  condition, and you were about to be charged a higher premium, if they  would allow you to buy health insurance. Families with children who  survived cancer knew what that meant--health insurance they couldn't  afford or health insurance that wasn't available. The Affordable Care  Act changes that and says you cannot discriminate against a person  because of a preexisting condition.   When we looked at some of the preexisting conditions health insurance  companies were boldly announcing, well, of course, gender could be a  preexisting condition. Women did have to pay higher premiums, you know.  Think of that: gender as a preexisting condition. That was one of the  tricks to deny coverage or to raise premium costs.   Then, when it came to covering your kids, we remember what it was  like--many of us do--when our kids graduated college, thought they were  invincible, and took part-time jobs with no benefits.   I remember calling my daughter and asking: ``Jennifer, do you have  health insurance anymore?''   ``No, Dad. I am just fine.''   Well, we got her health insurance, and it cost a pretty penny.   Now, under the Affordable Care Act, I could have kept my daughter  under my family plan until she had reached the age of 26, when she  would have had a better chance of having a better job with benefits.   That is one of the things the Affordable Care Act did, but the Trump  administration and the Republicans in Congress have been determined to  kill the Affordable Care Act from the day it passed. There were over 50  rollcall votes in the U.S. House of Representatives to eliminate the  Affordable Care Act. They all might have passed the House, but they  were not taken up by the Democratic Senate.   They waited for the day, and the day finally came. Senator McConnell  had the majority, and he was setting up to eliminate the Affordable  Care Act here on the floor of the Senate. I will never  [[Page S5756]]  forget that night or that early morning. At 2:30 in the morning, those  doors opened. John McCain, who was very sick--we knew he didn't have  long for this world--had just left a phone conversation with President  Trump. He walked to that well, and he barely lifted that right arm that  had been crippled during his prisoner of war experience in Vietnam. He  lifted it just enough to say ``no,'' and John McCain's ``no'' saved the  Affordable Care Act for millions of Americans.   Did the Republicans learn their lesson? No. They decided that, if  they couldn't win it on the floor of the House and if they couldn't win  it on the floor of the Senate, they would win it across the street with  the Supreme Court. That is what this is all about. That is why Senator  McConnell has reversed his position--a position which he claimed to be  principled. He has reversed his position on filling the vacancy on the  Supreme Court in a President's last year and has said that he is going  to, with determination, fill this seat.   The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, who  is a friend of mine--and I work with him--had to explain to the  American people why he reversed his position completely on this issue.  Then he announced last night that every Republican Member of the Senate  Committee on the Judiciary was going to vote for President Trump's  nominee. You would have thought he would have waited until that nominee  had been announced, but, clearly, it doesn't make any difference. They  know that whoever that nominee will be will be hell-bent on going  across the street and eliminating the Affordable Care Act in the  Supreme Court.   That is why this issue is not just a matter of debate between the  highest ranking politicians in Washington but is a matter that affects  everyone across America who buys health insurance, and that is just  about all of us. It is to make sure that health insurance is worth  owning and will be there when you need it.   I see some colleagues on the floor, and I want to yield to them  because I know they have their own thoughts to share with you, but it  troubles me greatly what has happened to this Senate. This big Chamber,  this big room, has turned into a museum piece in Washington, DC. We  don't entertain visitors anymore because of COVID-19, but if they were  to come, they could peer down at the desks and say: Well, that is where  people used to stand, called Senators, who actually legislated. We  don't do that anymore here. It is very seldom. Instead, we take up  these partisan causes, like filling the Federal judiciary with  ideologues and violating the traditions of the Senate to fill Supreme  Court vacancies.   This Chamber is just a room, but the Senate is 100 people--100 people  bound together by history, tradition, rules, and mutual respect. What  we are witnessing now with the Senate's effort by the Republicans to  fill this Supreme Court vacancy before a new President is elected is a  violation of all four--history, tradition, rules, and the mutual  respect that is important in this body.   I hope that we can recover from it, not only for the good of the  Senate but for the good of the Supreme Court, and that we can come out  of this with a determination to try to put this Chamber back on track.  This is a sad and dark moment--a loss of a wonderful woman who served  this country so well and this effort to replace her in a manner that  does not speak to the best instincts and history of the U.S. Senate   I yield the floor.
