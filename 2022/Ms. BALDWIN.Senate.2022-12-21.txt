 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from       further consideration of S. 4814 and that the Senate proceed to its       immediate consideration.         I ask unanimous consent that the Hickenlooper substitute       amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as       amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the       motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.         Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
