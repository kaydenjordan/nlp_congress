 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  irresponsible bill that would hurt millions of seniors, workers,  families, and veterans.   If this bill becomes law, the Social Security Administration will  close field offices that seniors and people with disabilities rely on  for services; nearly 500,000 low-income families could be evicted from  voucher-supported housing; 200,000 young children will lose spots in  Head Start; and cruel barriers to TANF will mean grandparents who rely  on the program to keep their grandchildren out of foster care will lose  crucial resources.   Meanwhile, Republicans want to cut law enforcement funding and give  wealthy tax cheats a license to avoid paying the taxes they owe.   What do we get in exchange for over a decade of crippled government?  We get less than 1 year of reprieve from default and economic  catastrophe.   Republicans should do what they did three times under President Trump  and pass a clean bill free of brutal cuts.
