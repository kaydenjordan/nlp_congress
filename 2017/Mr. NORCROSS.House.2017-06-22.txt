 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Illinois for  yielding me the time.   Certainly, we are in the House today and sending a very clear message  that career and technical skills matter, and I rise in support of this  bill. For a 4-year college, that pathway is certainly  [[Page H5081]]  great for some, but not all. Technical training helped shape my life  from community college to the construction site and, yes, here to  Congress.   Career and technical education, or CTE, is often overlooked, and it  shouldn't be. We need electricians and computer programmers just as  much as we need doctors and engineers. In my State of New Jersey, 9 out  of 10 of the fastest growing occupations don't require a 4-year degree,  but they do require a certificate or on-the-job training.   This is an important reauthorization bill that will go a long way to  providing students with opportunities to build skills that they need  for those fast-growing, high-paying jobs.   I want to thank the sponsors for including my provision that will  allow high schools to give more information on that career path in  technical education.   Don Borden, who is the president of Camden County College in my  State, says that we have an ``understanding of the types of educational  programs we need to provide for our students,'' and that ``will lead to  meaningful employment.''   This is about employment and careers, to train the students on  available curriculum, on available jobs. I urge support of this jobs  bill.                                time  1430
