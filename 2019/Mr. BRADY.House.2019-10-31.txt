 Madam Speaker, the impeachment and removal of the  President is a serious matter. At its heart, it lets a small, partisan  group in Washington overturn the will of the entire American people.   Above all, Americans believe in fairness and, when accused, the right  to due process. This sham impeachment offers neither.   It is secret. It is partisan. It is being conducted behind closed  doors to hide information from the American people, all with one goal  in mind: take down President Trump by any means necessary.   I will not legitimize this unprecedented and unfair charade with this  vote today.   Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Schiff long ago abandoned the due process  and fairness that was guaranteed during the Clinton impeachment. I know  because I was here in Congress for it.   There is simply no cause for this impeachment inquiry--none. It is  shameful to create a constitutional crisis for purely partisan reasons.
