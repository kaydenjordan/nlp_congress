 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bipartisan bill  with Representative Lucas, the Rural STEM Education Act.   More than 9 million students nationwide attend a rural school. And in  my home State of Utah, 15 percent of our students live in rural  communities.   Unfortunately, there are many barriers to receiving quality STEM  education for rural community students. There is a shortage of math and  science teachers and a high rate of teacher turnover. Plus, access  to high-speed and reliable internet is more limited in these areas.    Today, as we live through this pandemic, we know how important  reliable internet is for kids and teachers. This bill would provide  effective online teaching tools that educators can use in our rural  areas.   It will also increase teacher recruitment and improve internet  access. It will task several government agencies to work together to  advance research and provide teachers with what they need to  effectively teach STEM to more students in rural communities.   When bright young minds have the opportunity to explore science,  technology, engineering, and math, you never know where their  intelligence and their curiosity might lead them or what new  discoveries we will be able to trace back to the education they  received starting in their hometown.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I  thank my friend from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas) for championing this.
