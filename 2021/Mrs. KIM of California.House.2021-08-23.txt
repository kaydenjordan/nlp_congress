 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Dr. Mike Myungki Hong, a giant in the Korean-American community who  exemplified the American Dream. He was a personal friend, a mentor, a  visionary, and a very generous philanthropist who touched the lives of  so many people.   Despite his success as an engineer and founder of Dura Coat Products,  he was a very humble man who loved his wife, Lorrie, and his children  very, very dearly. He spent his life giving back to his community and  supporting the next generation of young leaders.   Dr. Hong dedicated his life to carrying on the legacy of Dosan Ahn  Chang Ho, a leader of the Korean independence movement, with honesty,  humility, integrity, and passion.   The Korean-American community and I are indebted to Dr. Hong for his  service and dedication. I pray that Dr. Hong's love of our country and  community continues to live through us, and I pray for God's peace for  his family.                            ____________________
