 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the life of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.   Dr. King lived a life dedicated to serving and being a voice for the  oppressed across our Nation. His message of nonviolence resonated with  many Americans during a tumultuous period of our history when basic  civil rights were being denied to many based on the color of their  skin.   Drawing inspiration from his Christian faith, Dr. King believed his  protests were the strongest weapon to achieve freedom and equality. In  the end he paid the ultimate price, choosing courage over fear to  overcome hatred and ignorance.   He famously preached: ``Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only  light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.''   Because of Dr. King's influence, all Americans can gather together to  celebrate diversity and the growth of human rights for each of us. I  hope that everyone will join me in commemorating and remembering Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., for his leadership, his sacrifices, and his  legacy.                            ____________________
