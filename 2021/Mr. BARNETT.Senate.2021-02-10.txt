 I didn't steal it. I bled on it. And they were       fucking macing me, and I couldn't fucking see. And so I       figure: Well, I'm in her office. I got blood in her office. I       put a quarter on her desk even though she ain't fucking worth       it. And I left her a note on her desk that says: Nancy, Bigo       was here, you bitch.    Trump's mob ransacked the Speaker of the House's office. They  terrorized her staff. Again, that is a mob that was sent by the  President of the United States to stop the certification of an  election.   The Vice President, the Speaker of the House--the first and second in  line to the Presidency--were performing their constitutional duties,  presiding over the election certification. And they were put in danger  because President Trump put his own desires--his own need for power-- over his duty to the Constitution and our democratic process. President  Trump put a target on their backs, and his mob broke into the Capitol  to hunt them down.   (Text of video presentation.)         The Officer. We're talking projectiles. Let's go. We need       units outside on the terrace ASAP. We need units. We're       surrounded.        The Officer. Cruiser 50, they've breached the scaffolds.       Let Capitol know they have breached the scaffolds. They are       behind our lines.    Mr. Manager SWALWELL. Shortly after 2 p.m., the Capitol Police and  Metropolitan Police were overwhelmed by President Trump's mob.  Perimeters were broken. The Capitol had been breached. Those officers  kept fighting back for hours and hours to hold th line. They fought to  defend the Capitol Building and all of us within it.    But they weren't there just to protect us--and they did--and our  staff and the custodial staff and all the people who work so hard in  this building. They were there to protect the votes of the American  people that were being counted that day. I will show you more later  about what that day was like for those brave officers.   But first, let's go back to what was happening where Manager Plaskett  left off in the House Chamber. Rioters who had entered the building  through the Senate quickly spread out through the Capitol. Many headed  toward the House and Senate Chambers. After Speaker Pelosi was ushered  out, Chairman McGovern was presiding in the House, attempting to keep  the counting process going.   On our phones, Members were receiving security updates and watching  social media to see the horror that was going on outside. We never  thought it would make its way in.   By 2:25 p.m., rioters who were already in the building opened the  east side doors of the Capitol Rotunda to let more of the mob in. They  quickly flooded through the doors, overwhelming the officers.   This is new security footage of those doors, and, as before, the mob  is identified with the red dot on the model of the Capitol. If you look  closely, you will see the first person through the door is holding the  Trump flag.   (Video presentation.)   At the same time, just one floor below, the mob finally pushed  through a line of Capitol Police officers and overtook the area. We all  know that area in the Capitol as the Crypt. This is directly beneath  the Rotunda at the very center of the Capitol.   (Text of video presentation.)         (People chanting: ``Open up.'')        The Officer. No harm. No harm.    Inside the House Chamber, a security officer suspended the floor  debate to update Members.   (Text of video presentation.)         The Officer. We have a person with tear gas in the Rotunda.       Please stand by. There are masks under your seats. Please       grab a mask. Place it in your lap, and be prepared to don       your mask in the event the room is breached.    We were told there were tear gas masks underneath our seats and to be  prepared to grab them.   Determined to keep the count going, Chairman McGovern called the  House back into session, but only 4 minutes later, at 2:30 p.m., the  House abruptly recessed. A new security announcement was made.   (Text of video presentation.)         The Officer. Be prepared to get down under your chairs, if       necessary. So we have folks entering the Rotunda and coming       down this way. So we will update you as soon as we can, but       just be prepared. Stay calm.    As I heard that announcement on the floor, I saw the new House  Chaplain, on just her fourth day on the job, walk to the front podium  unannounced, and, amidst the chaos, she started to recite a prayer for  peace.   Uncertain what would happen next, I sent a text message to my wife:         I love you and the babies, please hug them for me.    I imagine many of you sent a similar message.   What we could not see from inside the Chamber was that outside, the  mob was growing larger and larger and approaching our doors. But we  could hear them.  [[Page S637]]    This security footage, which does not have sound, shows a closeup of  Trump's mob as they move toward the second floor of the House Chamber  to stop the counting of votes.   (Video presentation.)   In the back of the group, you see one individual carrying a ``Stop  the Steal'' sign. They get within footsteps of the House door.   The next video is the viewpoint of the insurrectionists. It begins  with the mob amassing and cuts ahead to show you their search to the  House door.   (Text of video presentation.)         (People chanting: ``We want Trump.'')        Unidentified Man. It's a mob. They're going. Just stop.       Whoa, whoa. Dude, dude, dude, dude--you're not helping.       You're not helping. You are going to get me hurt and other       people.        (People chanting: ``Stop the steal.'')        Unidentified Man. All right, no violence.        Unidentified Man. It's too late for that. They don't listen       without that stuff.        (People chanting: ``Stop the steal.'')    Those doors, to orient you at home, are the doors that the President  of the United States walks through when he or she gives the State of  the Union Address.   You may have heard one man yell ``no violence'' and another respond:         It's too late for that. They don't listen without that.    They were there to stop the certification of the election.   At this point, inside the House Chamber, we can now hear the pounding  on the doors. At 2:35 p.m., Members on the House floor were told that  an evacuation route was secure, and it was time to leave. This video  shows Members of Congress exiting to the side of the podium where we  would go through the House Lobby and downstairs.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Because of coronavirus restrictions, congressional Members had been  waiting in the Gallery for their time to speak, just one level above  the House floor. Representatives, staff, journalists all took cover  under their chairs, helped each other put on their gas masks, and held  hands as rioters gathered outside.   Here, on this slide, you see Representative Jason Crow comforting our  colleague Representative Susan Wild.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   The rioters continued to surround the House Chamber, flooding the  halls and kicking on the doors as they passed them.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   This security video shows Ashli Babbitt, followed by others in the  mob, turning the corner to the House Lobby doors where the Members were  leaving.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Chairman McGovern was one of the last Members to leave the floor. As  he left through the House Lobby, just after 2:40 p.m., he was spotted  by the mob.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Minutes later, at 2:44 p.m., Ashli Babbitt attempted to climb through  a shattered window into the House Lobby. To protect the Members in the  Lobby, an officer discharged his weapon, and she was killed. I want to  warn everyone that the next video, which shows her death, is graphic.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         He has a gun! He has a gun! He's got a gun!    Inside the Chamber, Representatives, staff, and journalists remained  trapped in the Gallery, one floor above the House floor, and heard the  gunshot. My colleague Representative  Dan Kildee produced this  recording.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         What the fuck? Take your pins off. Pins off!    Out of fear that they would be seen or taken by the mob, my  colleagues were telling each other to take off their congressional  pins. That buzzing sound that you hear in the background of these  videos was the sound of the gas masks.   It was not until approximately 2:50 p.m., about 6 minutes after the  shooting downstairs, that the remaining Members, staff, and journalists  in the Gallery were finally able to flee.   In this security footage video, you can see them exiting. Many  Members are still wearing their gas masks. They walk just feet away  from where the Capitol Police are holding an insurrectionist at  gunpoint. Just minutes earlier, that insurrectionist had tried to open  the Gallery door and, thankfully, was stopped by a tactical team.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Although Members were now being moved to another location, the mob  continued to fight--to stop the count, to find the Members, to engage  with the police. The building was not yet secure.   This security video from 2:56 p.m. shows the mob in the House of  Representatives' wing on the second floor of the Capitol.  Insurrectionists who are still inside the building are fighting with  the police, who are overwhelmed in trying to get them out.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Throughout this presentation, we have been very careful to not share  where Members of Congress were taken or the paths they followed to get  out and off the floor, but that very issue was under discussion by the  insurrectionists themselves. One example comes from an FBI affidavit,  which stated that a leader of a militia group known as the Oath Keepers  received messages while he was at the Capitol. The leader was given  directions to where Representatives were thought to be sheltering and  instructions to ``turn on gas; seal them in.''   As you know, the threat to the Senate was no less than that of the  Members of the House. The mob approached the Senate with the same  purpose: fulfilling President Trump's goal of stopping the count;  delaying the certification of the electoral college votes of the  American people.   As you heard from Manager Plaskett, Vice President Pence was moved  away from the area near the Senate Chamber at around 2:25 p.m. By that  time, rioters had breached several areas close to this Chamber, and  they were flooding the hallways just outside an nearby. The Senate  Chamber was not evacuated until 2:30 p.m. The mob had been in the  building for more than 15 minutes.    This new security footage of the Senators and staff leaving the  Chamber will be displayed on the screens. It is silent.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   You cannot see it in this footage, but quick-thinking Senate floor  staff grabbed and protected the electoral ballots that the mob was  after.   Those of you who were here that day will recall that, once you left  the Senate floor, you moved through a hallway to get to safety. That  hallway was near where Officer Goodman had encountered a mob and led  them upstairs and away from the Senate Chamber. You know how close you  came to the mob. Some of you, I understand, could hear them, but most  of the public does not know how close these rioters came to you. As you  were moving through that hallway--I paced it off--you were just 58  steps away from where the mob was amassing and where police were  rushing to stop them. They were yelling.   In this security video, you can see how the Capitol Police created a  line and blocked the hallway with their bodies to prevent rioters at  the end of the hall from reaching you and your staff.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Because this is security footage that you have not seen before, I  want to play it again. The top of the screen is the other end of that  hallway where the mob has amassed and the officers are rushing to  protect you.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Additional security footage shows how Leader Schumer and the members  of his protective detail had a near miss with the mob. They came within  just yards of rioters and had to turn around. Here, in this new video,  you see Leader Schumer walking up a ramp. In going up the ramp with his  detail, he will soon go out of view.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Seconds later, they return and run back down the hallway, and  officers immediately shut the door and use their bodies to keep them  safe.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   At 2:45 p.m., shortly after Senators were ushered to safety from the  Senate floor, insurrectionists reached the Senate Galleries. The  following video was filmed by a New Yorker reporter.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Where the fuck are they? We're here.    Minutes later, the insurrectionists invaded and desecrated the Senate  floor. These vandals shouted and rifled through the desks of this room.  They took pictures of documents and of  [[Page S638]]  themselves, celebrating that they had taken over the floor and stopped  the counting of the electoral college votes.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Look at this. Take a picture.        Unidentified Speaker. Here. Look. Ted Cruz's objections. He       was going to sell us out all along.        Unidentified Speaker. Really?        Unidentified Speaker. Objection to counting the electoral       votes of the State of Arizona.        Unidentified Speaker. All right. All right. There's got to       be something in here we can use against these scum bags.        Unidentified Speaker. What happened to the phone, man?    Larry Brock, who was arrested for his role in the insurrection, was  photographed on the Senate floor, wearing a helmet, tactical gear, and  carrying flex cuffs.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   This man, also in the Senate Galleries, is Eric Munchel. Like Brock,  he was dressed in what appears to be tactical gear, also holding up  flex cuffs.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   If the doors to this Chamber had been breached just minutes earlier,  imagine what they could have done with those cuffs.   After insurrectionists occupied the Capitol and stopped the joint  session from counting the votes, the Capitol was in lockdown for 5  hours.   As long as it took to get back to the Capitol, to get back to the  certification of the election, it could have been so much longer, or we  might not have been able to resume at all. As horrific as it was--140  officers injured, 3 officers who ultimately lost their lives--we all  know that awful day could have been so much worse. The only reason it  was not was because of the extraordinary bravery of the men and women  of the Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Departments. For  hours and hours, these insurrectionists were in hand-to-hand combat  with these brave men and women.   Like some of you, I come from a law enforcement family. My dad was a  cop. My two brothers--my little brothers are cops who walk the beat  today. I am proud of them. And like in every law enforcement family,  when we hang up the phone, we don't only say ``I love you,'' we say  ``Be safe.''   So let's focus now on the attack and what it was like for the  officers defending the Capitol that day. And, again, I want to warn you  that the following audio and videos are graphic and are unsettling, but  it is important that we understand the extent of what occurred.   Here is an audio recording from the radio traffic of the DC  Metropolitan Police Department describing the violence.   (Text of audio presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Cruiser 50, I copy. We're still talking rocks, bottles, and       pieces of flag and metal pole.        Cruiser 50, the crowd is using munitions against us. They       have bear spray in the crowd. Bear spray in the crowd.        1328.        Multiple deployments U.S. Capitol with pepper spray.        DSO, DSO, I need a re-up. I need a re-up up here.    You hear the officer describe they are ``using munitions''--they, the  rioters, are ``using munitions against us.''   This video shows how the sprays that were described were used against  the officers.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   In a separate Metropolitan Police Department radio traffic recording,  you can hear an officer when he realizes that the insurrectionists had  overtaken the police line.   (Text of audio presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Cruiser 50. We lost the line. We've lost the line. All MPD,       pull back. All MPD, pull back up to the upper deck. All MPD,       pull back to the upper deck ASAP. All MPD, come back to the       upper deck. Upper deck. Cruiser 50, we're flanked. 10-33. I       repeat 10-33 west front of the Capitol. We have been flanked       and we've lost the line.    The MPD officer calls out ``10-33.'' That is the code for emergency,  officer in need of assistance; his words, ``We've lost the line.''   Hours after Members of the House and Senate had left this area on the  west front of the building, the mob continued to grow, continued to  beat the officers, as they tried to get in.   In this new security video, you can see the mob attacking officers  with a crutch, a hockey stick, a bull horn, and a Trump flag.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   I want to show you that same attack from the officer's perspective,  from his body camera footage.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   This body camera footage is from 4:27 p.m., over 2 hours from when  the Capitol was first breached. The attack on police that afternoon was  constant.   Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, a 20-year police veteran  with four daughters, was part of a line of officers protecting the  Capitol. He was one of three officers whom the mob dragged down the  stairs. When they dragged him, they stole his badge, his radio, his  ammunition magazine, and they tased him, triggered a heart attack.   Here he describes his experience.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Officer Fanone. It looked like a medieval battle scene. It       was some of the most brutal combat, you know, I have ever--      ever encountered. At one point I got tased. People were       yelling at me, `We got one. We got one.'    Officer Christina Laury, who regularly serves in MPD's Narcotics and  Specialized Investigation Division, also protected the front Capitol  entrance. Here is her experience.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Officer Laury. I mean, I can't say enough about the       officers that were there, the officers that were on the       frontline. And when I say `the frontline,' I mean, literally,       officers that were in a line, stopping these people that were       beating them with metal poles. They were spraying them with       bear mace. I mean, they did everything in their power to not       let those people in. And this was going on for hours.    Around 4:30 p.m., hours into the Capitol riots, Officer Daniel Hodges  was protecting a west side Capitol entrance, when rioters who were  trying to stop the certification trapped him between two doors.   When Officer Hodges was interviewed later, this is how he described  what was happening.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Officer Hodges. They threw down a huge metal object that       hit me on the head. I was also knocked down. The medical mask       I was wearing at the time got pulled up over my eyes, so I       was on the ground and blinded, and they started attacking me       from all sides.    Rioters crushed Officer Hodges. He was wedged in the doorway, blood  dripping from his mouth. He was struggling to breathe, all while the  insurrectionists hit him.   Officer Hodges' experience reminds you of what he and many other  officers experienced that day, what they went through.   We are also reminded of three officers who lost their lives: Capitol  Hill Police Officers Sicknick, Liebengood, and Metropolitan Police  Officer Smith.   In many law enforcement families, we pray for our loved ones, and we  know the scripture of Matthew 5:9, ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for  they shall be called the children of God.''   I am sorry I have to show you the next video, but in it you will see  how blessed we were that on that hellish day, we had a peacemaker like  Officer Hodges protecting our lives, our staffs' lives, this Capitol,  and the certification process.   May we do all we can in this Chamber to make sure that never happens  again.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)                                    Recess    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.
