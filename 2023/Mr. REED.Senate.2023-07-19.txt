 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I rise to discuss the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2024.   The Armed Services Committee approved this bill by a broad bipartisan  vote of 24 to 1 last month--the largest margin in years. I appreciated  the opportunity to work with Senator Wicker and our colleagues to  produce this bill. Senator Wicker has been supportive, cooperative,  creative, and has done so with great credit to the committee's  traditions, and I thank him for that. I am also obviously tremendously  appreciative of the work of the staff, Liz King on the majority and  John Keast on the minority.   This is a strong defense bill. It is laser-focused on the threats we  face. It addresses a broad range of pressing issues, from strategic  competition with China and Russia to countering threats from Iran,  North Korea, violent extremists, and even climate change. The bill  authorizes a record level of investment in key technologies like  hypersonics and artificial intelligence and makes real progress toward  modernizing our ships, our aircraft, and our combat vehicles. Most  importantly, this NDAA provides a historic level of support for our  troops and their families, including the largest pay raise in decades.  The bill makes meaningful steps forward at a critical time for our  national security.   In addition to authorizing $845 billion for the Department of Defense  and $32 billion for the Department of Energy's national security  programs, there are a number of important policy provisions that I  would like to briefly highlight.   To begin, we have to ensure the United States can outcompete, deter,  and prevail against our near-peer rivals. China has emerged as our  primary competitor, as the only nation with the intent and the  capability to mount a sustained challenge to the United States'  security and economic interests.   This NDAA confronts China by fully investing in the Pacific  Deterrence Initiative, or PDI, to improve our force posture and build  the capabilities of our partners and allies in the Indo-Pacific. The  bill also establishes the Indo-Pacific Campaigning Initiative to  facilitate increased U.S. military exercises, freedom of navigation  operations, and partner engagements in the region. And, to help Taiwan  improve its overall readiness and defense capabilities, the bill  establishes a comprehensive training, advising, and capacity-building  program for Taiwan's military forces.   I want to emphasize, however, that our Nation's ability to deter  China cannot be based on military might alone. We must strengthen our  network of allies and partners, which will be central to any strategy  for the Indo-Pacific region. To that end, the bill makes progress  toward advancing the security partnership among Australia, the United  Kingdom, and the United States, known as AUKUS. This partnership  provides a valuable blueprint that can help pave the way for other  regional networks.   Now, even as we shift increased attention to the Indo-Pacific, we  cannot lose sight of our priorities in other theaters, like Europe.  This year's NDAA fully funds the European Deterrence Initiative and the  Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to support our European allies  and partners. Ukraine has fought with incredible skill and bravery to  defend its sovereign territory from Russia, but there is much more to  be done. The United States must continue to provide training,  humanitarian and economic assistance, weapons, and military equipment  to Ukraine to help the nation protect itself and rebuild itself.   As part of this effort, the NDAA includes significant support for  America's industrial base to backfill our own munitions. This bill  facilitates the acquisition of defense stocks related to Ukraine and  authorizes the use of multiyear contracting authorities to help improve  industrial base stability.   Specifically, the bill helps improve defense acquisition processes by  enabling the Department to invest in and rapidly field cutting-edge  commercial technologies. By improving defense small business programs  and partnerships with high-tech companies, this legislation will help  meet the defense, industrial, and civilian needs of the United States.   Indeed, America's capacity for technological innovation has long  given us the strongest economy and military in the world. This  advantage is not a given, however; it must be nurtured and maintained.  To that end, the Defense bill authorizes significant funding for game- changing technologies like microelectronics, hypersonic weapons, and  unmanned aircraft systems. It also provides resources to accelerate the  development of the Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or the JADC2,  program. This suite of technologies will help the Joint Force detect,  analyze, and act on information across the battlespace, quickly using  automation, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics. When  fully developed, this concept will help our forces acquire targets as  early as possible and rapidly deliver information to the best operator  on air, land, or sea.   To accomplish the objectives of national security and the national  defense strategy, our military services and combatant commanders must  have the resources they need. In recognizing this, the NDAA broadly  supports the procurement of naval vessels, combat aircraft, armored  vehicles, weapons systems, and munitions requested in the President's  defense budget for fiscal year 2024.   The bill provides additional funding for the Navy and the Marine  Corps to accelerate the procurement of surface vessels and submarines,  which are critical to power projection and deterrence around the world.  The bill also provides greater predictability and stability in our  naval acquisition programs and improves the United States' shipbuilding  infrastructure modernization efforts.   The bill authorizes the Air Force to divest of certain aircraft and  to restructure parts of its fleet as it evolves to a rapidly changing  global security environment, and it invests in the Army's priority  modernization efforts, to include long-range fires, future vertical  lift, next-generation combat vehicles, and air and missile defense.   Developing these air, land, and sea warfare capabilities will be  vital to our success in long-term strategic competition with China.  Simultaneously, we must enable the Department to operate successfully  in evolving domains like space and cyber space. With this in mind, this  bill helps strengthen the cyber security posture of the Department and  the defense industrial base by providing increased funding to adopt  innovative and modern cyber security strategies, tools, and  technologies.    Ultimately, the key factor that makes the U.S. military the greatest  in the world is our people. We need to ensure that our uniformed  personnel know every day how much we appreciate what they do and that  we have their backs.   Importantly, this NDAA provides a 5.2-percent pay raise to both  military servicemembers and the Defense civilian workforce. As I  indicated, this is one of the largest increases in pay in many, many  years.   Finally, as we navigate the threats of nuclear escalation from Russia  and increasing capabilities from China, the Defense bill strengthens  our deterrence strategy by helping to modernize the U.S. nuclear triad.  And there are many, many other provisions in this bill that will help  equip the Department and our warfighters with the tools they need to  succeed.   This morning, Leader Schumer introduced a substitute amendment to S.  2226, the committee-passed NDAA. This substitute includes 51 amendments  that have been cleared on both sides, including 21 Democratic  amendments, 21 Republicans amendments, and 9 bipartisan amendments.  Again, I am pleased that we have brought this bill to the floor so the  entire Senate has an opportunity to participate in the process.   We have worked tirelessly, and we will continue to do so. I know that  Chair Murray is here because she has the first amendment and would like  to speak to that.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S3135]]     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 3 o'clock  vote commence.    Madam President, I yield back all time.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, is there any time remaining on our side?    I will be very brief. My understanding of the War Powers  Act--the President of the United States may initiate hostilities for a  limited period of time until Congress can act. This proposal, a sense  of Congress, would call into question what the War Powers Act  authorizes, and that is a constitutional provision. It has been held  constitutional.                          Vote on Amendment No. 222     Mr. President, is there time remaining?    Mr. President, the Army recognizes its mistake. They  revised their policies. They now use something known as net book value,  which is consistent with the Foreign Assistance Act, which the State  Department uses.   And reinforcing Senator Murray's point, the bottom line here is, if  we adopt this amendment, we will lower the amount of equipment we can  provide to Ukraine, which is critically in need of such equipment.   I would urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 838     Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that floor  passes be granted to the following staff members for the duration of  the consideration of Calendar No. 119--that is, S. 2226: Liz King and  Jon Clark with the majority Armed Services Committee and John Keast and  Brendan Gavin with the minority Armed Services Committee.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Julia Coulter  and Jessica Lewis, Government Accountability Office detailees to the  Senate Committee on Armed Services, have floor privileges during  consideration of the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization  Act.
