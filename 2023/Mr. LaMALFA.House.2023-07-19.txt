 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that I think is going  to be loved by both sides of the room here today since it makes so much  sense.   The situation we have is, it will fix an issue under the FAA  regulations that currently prevents a privately owned, restricted  category aircraft that is already performing a wildfire suppression  operation from transporting firefighters to a scene.   Now, if this exact same aircraft were owned by a public entity such  as the Forest Service, BLM, et cetera, that aircraft would be allowed  to transport firefighters while performing a wildfire suppression  operation. Even more egregious is the fact that if this government  agency were to decide to lease this private aircraft for 90 days or  more, that would magically transform it into the type of aircraft that  would be allowed to transport firefighters on the way to a suppression  action.   Under the current guidelines, however, they are not allowed to do so.  This would either force contractors to have to get 90 days or longer  leases with entities that may not want the aircraft for 90 days or be  able to afford that. This may be a small local entity, local  government.   What we are doing is allowing some flexibility here to not be locked  into 90-day aircraft contracts that aren't needed and, at the same  time, prevent unneeded ferrying back and forth, one for fire  suppression activities and then another one to transport the personnel  [[Page H3826]]  when it would be perfectly logical to transport them on the same trip,  saving fuel, saving wear and tear on the aircraft and the people, and  even a little extra unneeded pollution in the air from running the  aircraft, right?   My amendment requires the FAA to move forward with allowing private  aircraft to also transport firefighters when they are fighting  wildfires. The current policy is an unnecessary barrier to being able  to deploy and fully utilize the capabilities of existing wildfire  contractors for wildfire suppression.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am really wounded by that because the  logic just isn't there. What we are talking about is an aircraft that  is fully certified. If it was under a 90-day or longer contract,  everybody would be hunky-dory with it. It would be perfectly kosher.   However, in this situation here, since it doesn't have that long of a  contract, it is not now considered a public aircraft. It meets all the  standards for safety, for transporting personnel as well as  transporting the products with which they will be putting out the fire.   I am just mystified as to the logic of why we can't do this. It will  save sorties. It will save a lot of unneeded pain. It will also allow  local entities to be able to afford to keep these aircraft around  because they are not going to be locked into 90-day contracts. I am  just at a loss as to why this couldn't be agreed to by my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comment of my colleague  from Tennessee. He mentioned a while ago with Mr. Issa ``40-love,'' so  I will pick up on the ``love'' part of that and say that this is a  friendlier discussion.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, it ought to be obvious that American  schools are for American students. This should not be a controversial  statement, yet in the last few months, cities such as New York and  Chicago, for example, and across the U.S. are using schools as shelters  for illegal immigrants.   All of this is the result of the Biden administration's failed border  policies that have turned every State into a border State, regardless  if they are actually near the border.   The policies have only further encouraged more illegal immigration  because of the promise of illegal immigrants being allowed to remain in  our country with proper process and cushy food and housing. The tab of  all of this is being picked up by the American taxpayer.   The recent expansion of these programs into schools is an insult to  the reason public schools even exist, to provide a free education that  teaches kids the necessary skills to lead a successful life, all of  which stand to be disrupted by illegal immigrants being housed in their  school gyms and classrooms taking up the resources that rightly belong  to American students.   This is why we need the Schools Not Shelters Act introduced by Mr.  Molinaro from New York.   We can't guarantee who are even coming into these shelters or if the  information we have on them is at all accurate, and we certainly can't  promise parents that there will be no harm to their kids.   A controlled border solves these issues, and the Schools Not Shelters  Act is a very important key to starting on that.
