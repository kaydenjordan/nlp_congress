 Madam President, on behalf of myself and Senator  Tuberville, I call up amendment No. 542 and ask that it be reported by  number.    Madam President, in 2006, the Secure Fence Act was  signed into law, authorizing 700 miles of double-layer fencing along  the southwest border. It passed this Chamber on a vote of 80 to 19,  with 26 Senate Democrats voting to secure the border. Among the  Democratic Senators voting for it were then-Senators Obama, Biden,  Clinton, and current Senators Schumer, Feinstein, Carper, and Wyden.   In the end, only 36 miles of double fencing was actually constructed,  which, in the end, combined with a very low bar for asylum claims and  DACA, created the catalyst for a humanitarian crisis in 2014 of  unaccompanied minors and family units coming in, with the crisis  peaking in the summer of 2019. In reaction, President Trump enacted a  number of policies, including construction of 700 miles of wall.   Now, we didn't construct all of it, but we contracted 700 miles,  completed 450, and, as of today, 250 miles are contracted but not  built.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration is now reversing all of these  policies.    I have 2 minutes, don't I?    I was told 2.   Well, anyway, my amendment--   --will prevent cancellation of those contracts, saving  taxpayers the cancellation costs and securing the borders.   I urge support of my amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
