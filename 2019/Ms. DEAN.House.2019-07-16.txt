 Madam Speaker, words matter. Decency matters.   Recently, President Trump told four Congresswomen of color to ``go  back'' to their home countries.   Mr. President, they are home.   Three of these Congresswomen, my colleagues, were born in the United  States. The fourth, also my colleague, is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  They are as American as I am, as the President is, as the First Lady is  or anyone else, period.   Telling people who look different to go back to where they came from  is a refrain laced with hate. This rhetoric is neither new nor a  surprise, but that doesn't mean we can allow it to stand. And it belies  a fundamental misunderstanding of our Nation's promise, that we are all  created equal and that everyone has a role to play in building a more  perfect Union--not just White Americans, every American.   We hereby recognize these words for what they are: offensive,  hateful. And the people we represent deserve better.   As a cosponsor, I believe we must call out hate wherever we see it,  whether in our own houses or in the White House.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to support the resolution. Words  matter.
