 Madam Speaker, I would like to take a moment to honor Dr.  Emily England Clyburn, the wife of Majority Whip James E. Clyburn,  after her passing on September 19.   It is often said that behind every great man is an even greater  woman. Certainly, this was true of Dr. Clyburn. She was a great woman  who supported a great man.   Known affectionately as Miss Emily or Dr. Em, Dr. Clyburn was a kind,  compassionate, and incredibly generous woman.   She spent most of her career as a librarian, first in public schools  and then for almost 30 years at the Charleston Naval Base and Dorn VA  Medical Center in Columbia, South Carolina. Her love of learning led  her to raise millions of dollars to create more need-based scholarships  for her alma mater, South Carolina State University.   Mrs. Clyburn knew the importance of a good education, and she wanted  to create more opportunities for students of color throughout the  State. It was part of her strong commitment to equality.   We will remember her as a dedicated fighter for civil rights. She was  a model of class and character throughout her life.   My thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Clyburn; his daughters, Mignon,  Jennifer, and Angela; the family; and all the people of South Carolina  during this time of loss.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the U.S.  Virgin Islands for yielding and for her continued leadership on issues  that impact Americans throughout the diaspora and also issues that the  CBC finds necessary to continue to raise. We are known as the  conscience of the Congress, and although we are the Congressional Black  Caucus, we represent 78 million Americans of all stripes. That is  something that I think is very important for people to understand.   I am not surprised that the gentlewoman once again has raised an  issue for the caucus that impacts so many people in this Nation and, if  President Trump has his way, negatively impacts so many people in this  Nation.   I am very concerned about Trump's latest attack on low-income  Americans. His administration would like to make drastic changes to the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,  [[Page H7894]]  or SNAP. The program, which used to be called food stamps, has helped  millions of working parents, disabled Americans, and seniors afford a  more nutritional diet.   Traditionally, SNAP benefits were assigned based on a standard income  level. If you made less than 130 percent of the Federal poverty level,  roughly $2,300 per month, you were eligible. If you made more than  that, you were not. However, there was an important clause in how the  State governments assessed that income.   If you had a more prosperous year, say you made an extra $100 or $200  per month thanks to a side job, you could still be eligible for the  benefits. States knew that such income might be temporary, and they did  not want to punish hardworking Americans for seeking a better life.   The system worked because it encouraged nutritious eating for lower  income citizens, a group that studies show have less nutritious diets  across the board. And it allowed them to save a little money for the  future.   In addition, it saved time because it allowed recipients to enroll  automatically and provided a new market for American farm products. It  was a win-win for everyone involved.   So, naturally, Trump wants to change that. He wants to impose a hard  cap on the income levels for recipients, and he wants to eliminate  eligibility for people with more than $2,300 in a bank account.   If the rule is enacted, it could be disastrous for our country's  lower income workers, disabled citizens, and the elderly. Millions of  them could lose their benefits and return to unhealthy eating, because  that is all they would be able to afford.   Study after study shows the costs to our Nation's healthcare from  patients with poor diets. The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention estimates that unhealthy eating costs about $1 trillion,  with a T, per year in extra healthcare and contributes to the death of  almost 700,000 citizens annually, the size of a congressional district.  These are costs we do not need, especially at a time when many  economists say a recession is looming.   There are several other problems with this proposed rule. It promotes  the belief that lower income Americans should stay lower income because  it punishes people who want to save a little money. If you save too  much, you could lose your benefits.   The greatest harm would be done to innocent schoolchildren. The free  school meal programs across the country use SNAP eligibility to  determine whether children can qualify for the meals. If their parents  get eliminated from the system, at least 265,000 students could go  hungry during the school day. If they lose those meals, academic  studies show that their performance in school will drop significantly.  You cannot think about math when you are thinking about an empty  stomach. They will have lower standardized test scores, and they are  more likely to come to school late, if they come at all.   These children feel the shame of being in the Free and Reduced Meal  Program already. This rule would reduce that shame by making sure they  do not have any meals at all.   These are students who need support the most, so we need to support  them the most. What we do not need are rules designed to keep them in  poverty from an administration dedicated to enriching the wealthy and  themselves.   We need to give States the freedom to assess their SNAP eligibility  in a way that empowers them to empower their citizens. We need to  promote healthy living with proper diet and nutrition choices. We need  to protect our schoolchildren and do everything possible to make sure  that they get every educational benefit possible.   That is why we need to fight this proposed rule change to the SNAP  program.   Our farmers are struggling, thanks to Trump's trade wars, and our  students are struggling from inequality already. We do not need to make  both of those problems worse.   We are mortified but not surprised by the actions of a callous  administration toward people of need. It is not surprising that the  administration has looked into how it could once again penalize poor  people, struggling children, and the elderly, who have paid their dues,  played by the rules, and now need a little assistance, but they just  don't matter.   This is not the country I was led to believe that I was growing up  in. This is not what I learned in school. What we see here is a  disassembling of a nation. Everything that we have stood for is falling  apart around us because of this President and his administration.   We will continue to fight. I think our Nation is stronger than one  man. We will come together as a great Nation once again and take care  of the least of us. It is our obligation.
