 Mr. Speaker, while I and my Democratic colleagues, as  well as the Biden-Harris administration, have raised Social Security  benefits by 8.7 percent, extreme Republicans are attempting to force  cuts to Social Security eligibility and benefits that will hurt the  financial security of America's seniors.   Their very first bill released the wealthy and well connected from  giving their fair share of taxes, adding $114 billion to the debt.   Social Security used to be a bipartisan-supported program. It is a  vital lifeline for Americans, and House Democrats will continue to  fight to protect Social Security not only for our seniors now but for  future generations.   Together, House Democrats will continue to stand united in holding  our Republican colleagues accountable and to push back against their  efforts to subsidize the lifestyles of the rich and powerful.                            ____________________
