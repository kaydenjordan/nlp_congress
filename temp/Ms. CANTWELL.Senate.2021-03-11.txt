 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I know we are having a vote in a moment.  I ask unanimous consent that the vote not start until I finish my  remarks.    Mr. President, I don't plan to speak long, but  listening to my colleagues, I just wanted to make a few points.   Our former colleague, Representative Becerra, spent much time in the  Congress--I think 12 terms--much of that in a position focusing on  healthcare policy as a member of the Ways and Means Committee. I say  that because I know so many of our colleagues, particularly House  Members, have gone on to run Agencies, run Departments, be Secretaries  of Defense, and, basically, they just had some congressional experience  in that policy area.   So I am not sure why we are discarding that important policy  background, consideration, balancing of those issues, weighing in on  parts of our constituencies, as Mr. Becerra did.   And Mr. Becerra was the first Hispanic to be a member of the Ways and  Means Committee. So I am pretty sure he brought forth a context to many  of the healthcare policies. I know now that I bring a lot of focus on  Native American issues to the Finance Committee because I represent so  many Native Americans.   I think Mr. Becerra represents somebody who has a lot of healthcare  experience and then, as attorney general, took on one of the biggest  fights we need to have right now, which is the affordability of  prescription drug pricing and the shortages that I believe are  artificially created on things like insulin and other drugs that are  spiking out of control the healthcare prices for Americans.   If you had to say, besides getting access to affordable healthcare  insurance, what the second most important goal would be--or, actually,  if you asked across the spectrum of millions of Americans--they would  say it is the high cost of prescription drugs. And we have somebody who  has taken on this battle and, basically, really understands what we  need to do as a nation in lowering prescription drug prices.   So I just hope that people who are at home are listening. This is a  unique individual who I think stands up truth to power many times in  his career, and I think that we would be great if we have his vote and  nomination out here on the Senate floor so the American people can hear  more about the important policies.   If you want to vote against him because you don't want the Affordable  Care Act, well, that is your prerogative. But if you want somebody who  has just as much experience as any other Member of Congress who has  gone on to run an Agency, I guarantee you he is as qualified, if not  more qualified.   So I hope our colleagues will vote yes on this motion to bring Xavier  Becerra before the United States Senate.   I thank the President.   I yield the floor.
