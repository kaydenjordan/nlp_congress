 Mr. Speaker, I have spent a lot of time with my friend,  Congressman Mike Thompson, over the past week because our districts  neighbor each other. While the worst of this  [[Page H8082]]  fire was in Congressman Thompson's district, portions of that terrible  Santa Rosa fire spilled over to affect my constituents, and I had a  separate fire in Mendocino County, the Redwood Complex, that itself  would have ranked among the top 20 wildfires in California history. The  fact that all of these fires happened together is truly an  unprecedented and a dreadful crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Thompson. He has been everywhere in the  region. I thank our local government partners, and I thank our  colleagues, Minority Leader Pelosi, and Majority Leader McCarthy. The  support has been bipartisan and it has been nationwide. FEMA has been  on the ground along with first responders doing heroic work to get the  recovery and the rebuilding process started. We are grateful for all of  that, but we are only at the beginning.   If you want to see your government doing good work, go to the local  assistance center in Santa Rosa or in Ukiah and watch how the  wraparound services are there. Every need that these fire victims,  these devastated families, can imagine is there to be met. But we are  at the beginning, and we are going to need that support over a long- sustained period.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for standing with us at this early  stage of dealing with this crisis. We are going to need them over the  long haul. We will be talking more about this going forward.                            ____________________
