 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Simply Blooming of Traer, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Simply Blooming was founded in 2006 by Lisa Eikamp as a one-stop shop  for all of your floral needs. Simply Blooming has flowers from all over  the world in store. As an experienced floral designer, Eikamp is able  to design and accessorize an arrangement for a variety of events and  occasions. Simply Blooming's website boasts a broad portfolio of floral  designs including prom corsages, wedding bouquets, and sympathy  flowers. In addition to flowers, you can also find a variety of plants,  home decor, stylish clothing, and even boots for sale.   This year has been a momentous one for Simply Blooming. They opened a  new location in Vinton on the exact day of their 17th anniversary of  the flagship store opening in Traer. The second store is called Simply  Blooming, Too, and has already become an integral part of the Vinton  community. They had a ribbon cutting ceremony to celebrate the  occasion, and an Elvis Presley impersonator even stopped by for the  festivities.   Part of what makes Simply Blooming special is their attention to  customer service. They maintain active social media profiles updating  customers on the arrangements they design, community events hosted at  Simply Blooming, and information on all of their new products.   Simply Blooming's commitment to providing flower arrangements for  every occasion is clear. In 17 years, Ms. Eikamp has been able to  provide quality customer service by treating her customers like family.  I want to commend Lisa Eikamp and the entire team at Simply Blooming  for their work. This business exemplifies the innovative spirit and  leadership skills of the Iowa entrepreneur. I look forward to seeing  your continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
