 Madam Speaker, this bill will not reduce inflation. It  will pull us deeper into the current recession and take America further  in the wrong direction. It is simply more government and less freedom.   In the past year, inflation has exceeded 13 percent, and real wages  have effectively fallen by 4.5 percent. The Federal Reserve and Big  Government combined to fuel inflation, and now people are being crushed  by these high prices. You cannot spend your way out of inflation.   But that is exactly what this bill tries to do with $745 billion in  new spending. It raises taxes in a recession. And it gives more than  six times the agency's current annual budget for the IRS. It is going  to more than double audits on families.   Instead of addressing the 32 percent increase in energy prices by  increasing domestic production, this bill spends billions on Green New  Deal pet projects like a $27 billion EPA-run Climate Bank and a $250- billion federally run Department of Energy loan program.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues, please oppose this bill.
