 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for leading and for  his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, let's be very clear about where we are with TrumpCare  2.0.   This bill still strips 24 million Americans of health care, cuts $880  billion from Medicaid, and increases premiums for the majority of  Americans. It still has an age tax if you are 50 to 64 years old, and  cuts maternity care and coverage for substance abuse disorders.   It still gives $1 trillion in tax cuts to the wealthiest  millionaires, billionaires, and corporations on the backs of working  people who will pay more and get less.   TrumpCare 2.0 adds insult to injury because my Republican colleagues  would like you to believe that they are going to cover preexisting  conditions. That is just not true.   American people, be clear: this will not cover preexisting  conditions, and 133 million Americans with those preexisting conditions  will suffer. There are kids like James Kish, an 8-year-old in my  district who has a brain tumor and literally stands to die if this bill  passes.   Mr. Speaker, hundreds across this country are calling our offices and  weeping. We should all weep that this bill is coming to the floor. We  should vote ``no.''                                time  1215
