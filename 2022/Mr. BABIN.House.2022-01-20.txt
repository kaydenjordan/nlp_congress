 Mr. Speaker, I want to just say how much I appreciate the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for having this very, very  valuable worthwhile Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the 63 million  babies who have tragically been aborted since the Supreme Court's  devastating decision in Roe v. Wade.   However, in the 49 years since that fatal decision, science has  unmistakably proven that unborn babies can feel pain as early as 15  weeks. They even have a character. We can see it on sonograms.   But the left likes to ignore this fact. They seem to only value the  type of science that supports their political agenda. It is time for  the ``party of science'' to actually follow the science and to protect  the unborn.   I will always fight for life. I am proud to be up here with my  colleagues today standing up for these unborn, innocent, little human  beings. I sincerely pray that the Supreme Court of the United States  will make the just decision to overturn Roe v. Wade this very year.
