 Mr. President, before I begin, I want to take a moment to  express my sadness about Senator Blunt's announcement that he will not  seek reelection in 2022.   He has been a leader within our conference ever since he came over to  the Senate, and he will be sorely missed. I will especially miss having  him as a Member of the whip team here in the Senate.   I came to the House of Representatives with Senator Blunt back in the  election of 1996. We began our service in January of 1997, and he  quickly rose up through the ranks in the House and became the  Republican whip in the House of Representatives. He has always been  involved in leadership wherever he has been, and his list of  achievements is long.   All Americans have benefited over the past year from his tremendous  efforts to accelerate coronavirus testing and vaccine development. And  less than 2 months ago, in his role as chairman of Rules Committee, he  oversaw a very successful inauguration at a particularly challenging  time.   The one good thing is that Roy is not leaving us immediately. He will  be here for 2 more years, and I look forward to continuing to work with  him and to seeing everything that he will accomplish                       American Rescue Plan Act of 2021    Mr. President, it has been quoted that ``[t]he Senate works best when  we work together. . . . The challenges we face are great. The divisions  in the country are real. We have no choice but to try to work together  every day to reward the faith the American people have placed in us.''   Those are not my words. Those are the words of the Democratic leader  on Inauguration Day. But I agree with him. The Senate does indeed work  best when we work together. And, for proof, look no further than last  week's debacle--a good example of what happens when, instead of working  together, one party tries to strong-arm its legislation through the  Senate.   Last Friday was perhaps most notable for its 11-plus-hour vote on an  amendment. Democrats held a 15-minute vote open for almost 12 hours-- making it the longest vote in modern Senate history--because it had  become clear that they were in danger of losing the support of one of  their Members.   It turns out that when you force a massive, liberal piece of  legislation through the Senate without committee review and without any  attempt at soliciting input from the Senate as a whole, you start to  lose support even from Members of your own party. It was an  embarrassing moment for the Democrat leadership and a sad moment for  the rest of the Senate.   In that same speech on Inauguration Day, the Democratic leader  pledged:         [The] Senate will legislate. . . . And to my Republican       colleagues, when and where we can, the Democratic majority       will strive to make this important work bipartisan.    There was no evidence of that here. Democrats didn't try to make this  bill bipartisan. In fact, they actively tried to make sure Republicans  didn't have a voice in this legislation.   Remember that almost 12-hour amendment vote? Democrats held that vote  open for nearly 12 hours solely because they were afraid that a  Republican amendment might pass. Republicans were more than willing to  work with Democrats on COVID relief, as we did last year on five  separate COVID bills, but Democrats didn't want Republicans interfering  with their legislation.   I want to talk about those previous COVID bills for just a minute.  Prior to Democrats taking control of the Senate, COVID relief was a  bipartisan process. Under Republican control, the Senate passed five  COVID relief bills with overwhelming bipartisan majorities. Because  both Democrats and Republicans had a voice in the legislation, there  was no need to keep any of those votes open to engage in partisan arm- twisting. ``The Senate works best when it works together.''   The bipartisan process on those other COVID bills didn't just  guarantee a bipartisan vote in the Senate; it also guaranteed that  those other COVID bills were actually about COVID. Because both parties  had to work together to get a result, neither party was able to hijack  the bill for partisan purposes.   Contrast that with the bill the Senate passed on Saturday. While  Democrats have tried to sell their legislation as a COVID relief bill,  the truth is it isn't one. Just 1 percent--1 percent--of this bill  actually goes to our top COVID priority--vaccinations--and less than 10  percent of this bill is directly related to combating the virus.   There has been a lot of talk about how this bill is a liberal wish  list, which it is, but that is almost being too generous. A liberal  wish list at least suggests some grand policy schemes. This bill is  mostly just a collection of payoffs to Democrat interest groups in  Democrat States.   For the extreme abortion wing of the Democratic Party, this bill  omits longstanding Federal restriction on using taxpayer dollars to pay  for abortion. It makes labor unions eligible for loans designed to  rescue Main Street small businesses. It bails out failing union  pensions--a bailout even the New York Times describes as having  ``nothing to do with the pandemic'' and as an ``almost unheard-of'' use  of taxpayer dollars. That is from the New York Times.   It provides nearly $129 billion for K-12 schools--despite the fact  that these schools have spent just $5 billion of the $68 billion  already given to them--while keeping teachers unions happy by making  sure funding isn't tied to any requirement to actually get back to in- person instruction.   Then, of course, there is the money for the States. The bill  appropriates a staggering $350 billion for States, despite the fact  that a majority of States already have the resources they need to  weather the rest of the pandemic.   On top of that, the distribution formula for that $350 billion is  heavily weighted in favor of blue States, like California, which stands  to see $27 billion under this legislation, despite the fact that  California's revenues are up by $15 billion. Now, imagine the outcry if  Republicans were directing funding to States that voted Republican in  the last election.    And lest anyone thinks any of this was unintentional, Democrats  doubled down on the partisanship when it came to amendments. They  rejected an amendment that would have protected Americans from having  their tax dollars used to pay for abortions, even though multiple  Democrats broke ranks with their party to support this amendment.   They rejected an amendment to tie funding for schools to schools that  actually are reopening. They rejected an amendment to ensure seamless  support to nonpublic schools serving low-income students. They rejected  an amendment to stop labor unions from taking loan money intended for  small businesses. They rejected an amendment to provide greater  transparency on nursing home COVID deaths, presumably in an attempt to  protect the Democratic Governor of New York, who is under fire for  seemingly deliberate attempts to obscure reporting of these deaths.   In a nod to the far-left environmental wing of the party, they  rejected an amendment to reverse the President's cancellation of the  Keystone XL Pipeline, which will cost thousands--thousands of American  jobs.   I could go on for a while on amendments because there are a lot more.   Democrats passed an amendment that provides an incentive for some  Americans to stay on unemployment by making more than $10,000 of their  unemployment benefits nontaxable.  [[Page S1440]]  Think about that. More than $10,000 of their unemployment benefits is  untaxable without regard to income.   Working Americans still have to pay their taxes, even if they are  making less money than they would on unemployment. If you are a hard- working taxpayer in this country and you are not getting a tax break  when the people who are on unemployment are getting a $10,000 tax  break, nontaxable income that is costing the Federal Government  somewhere on the order of $30 billion, you can imagine the average  taxpayer in this country might find that to be highly objectionable  when they find out about it. A substantial amount of unemployment  benefits will be tax-free. That doesn't seem too fair, not to mention  that the last thing we should be doing right now is discouraging people  from going back to work.   In that speech I referenced earlier that the Democratic leader gave  on Inauguration Day, he said:         As the majority changes in the Senate, the Senate will do       business differently.    ``The Senate will do business differently.'' Well, now we have a  glimpse of what that looks like. And, apparently, it looks like  ruthless partisanship in an attempt to completely silence the minority  and the Americans they represent. It is deeply disappointing that  Democrats have turned a bipartisan process into a totally partisan  exercise.   As I mentioned, pandemic relief ought to be bipartisan, and it was  last year, five times. Five times here in the U.S. Senate, we passed  pandemic relief, coronavirus relief legislation, with overwhelming  bipartisan majorities under regular order, where 60 votes are required,  instead of under the procedure that was used by the Democrats last week  to shut Republicans out of that process.   We could have passed a bill last week again with overwhelming  bipartisan support, but that would have required Democrats to be  willing to genuinely collaborate with Republicans. And, unfortunately,  it is becoming clear that collaboration is not part of the new way of  doing business in the Democratic-led Senate.   I hope my Democratic colleagues will change course in the days ahead  and work with Republicans to unite our country. As the Democratic  leader suggested on Inauguration Day, they owe the American people  nothing less.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
