 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 45th  anniversary of the University of Massachusetts Amherst University  Without Walls, one of the oldest and most highly regarded adult  bachelor's degree completion programs in the Nation.   Founded in 1971, UWW provides nontraditional students with access to  the resources of our best universities. It has developed into a  national leader in adult education, having graduated nearly 4,300  students, including basketball legend, Julius Erving.   One of the first programs in the Nation to offer an innovative blend  of online and classroom learning, UWW provides an excellent education  to students, including many veterans who are unable to complete a  traditional college degree due to financial constraints, family  obligations, or personal hardship.   The key to success is the incredible team of UMass Amherst faculty  and staff who have dedicated their lives to teaching and supporting  adult students as they balance family, community, and academic  responsibilities.   I wish to personally thank all of the faculty, staff, and UWW  students for their dedication to excellence.                            ____________________
