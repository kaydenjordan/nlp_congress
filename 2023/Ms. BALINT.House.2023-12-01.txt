 Mr. Speaker, three young college students went for a walk  in Burlington, Vermont, during their Thanksgiving break: Hishem,  Kinnaan, and Taahseen spoke Arabic to one another and wore keffiyehs.   They were shot.   Whether or not this meets the legal standard for hate crime, we know  this was a hateful act. The recent rise in Islamophobia in this country  has led to deadly violence. It is deeply disturbing and frightening.   I want to be clear: Leaders in this very Chamber need to  unequivocally denounce the rise of anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia.  Words matter.   We need to lead with our values--community and acceptance--rather  than hatred and fear.   No one should be targeted because of their ethnicity or their  religion. It has no place in Vermont. It has no place anywhere. We all  have a part to play. We need to speak up and stand with our Muslim  neighbors and friends now.   The eyes of the Nation are on Vermont, and we want to make it  absolutely clear to Americans that we will stand against this kind of  violence and hate.                            ____________________
