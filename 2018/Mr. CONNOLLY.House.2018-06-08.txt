 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this simple amendment to H.R. 5895 would ensure  sufficient funds for the Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector  General to provide rigorous oversight of the Washington, D.C., Veterans  Affairs Medical Center, a center that has been plagued with management  problems, many of which have been described in previous amendments here  this morning.   The inspector general recently concluded a year-long investigation  into the critical deficiencies at that center. In its final report,  issued on March 7 of this year, the IG highlighted that leadership  failures and pervasive understaffing underpinned widespread issues in  inventory management, sterile processing, and patient safety itself.  These are our veterans we are talking about.   The IG found continual mismanagement of protected information and  significant government resources, putting them at risk for fraud,  waste, and abuse. The report makes clear these failures have persisted  for the better part of a decade. Entrenched problems like these will  not be resolved overnight.                                time  0945    Following the final report's release, officials from the U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs briefed House Veterans Affairs'  Committee staff that delays in patient care and supply shortages were  no longer occurring as of January 2018.   Yet recent reports show, contrary to that, that seven procedures were  canceled due to supply shortages in February and March of this year,  contrary to the Department's own claims. The VA inspector general has  played a vital role in covering that crisis at the D.C. VA Medical  Center, and we must ensure that the VA IG has adequate resources to  carry out its essential mandate.   The bill before us today meets the President's 2019 budget request of  $172 million. However, the VA inspector general, Michael Missal,  recently wrote that $172 million will not be sufficient for the IG to  fully meet its mission of effective oversight of the programs and  operations of the Veterans Administration.   Furthermore, the IG said that an FY19 appropriation of $172 million  would actually likely require a decrease of about 28 OIG staff. This  could not be a worse time to have that happen, and I know the chairman  and the ranking member share in that view.   Across the inspector general community, the IG staffing at the VA is  among the smallest ratio of oversight staff to agency staff, and the  OIG budget represents less than 0.1 percent of the total Veterans  Administration budget.   This week, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to fund the IG  at a level of $192 million for FY 2019, and I hope my colleagues will  support that higher funding level when this bill gets to conference.  [[Page H4989]]    We have a sacred obligation to ensure that the men and women, who  sacrificed so much to defend our freedom, receive the highest quality  care they can possibly receive. The IG's yearlong investigation  revealed that the D.C. VA Medical Center has, at times, fallen far  below that standard. We owe it to our veterans not only to address  these problems, but also to understand how they were allowed to arise  in the first place.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to this  bill and to ensure the highest quality for our veterans who fought for  their country, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would conclude simply by thanking my  friend from Florida for detailing that horror story. Unfortunately,  these aren't isolated incidents. This is a pattern of shoddy care for  our veterans at this center, and we need the IG to be doing his work  over time to make sure that these deficiencies are corrected, and  corrected as soon as possible. That is the intent of this amendment.   Again, I thank my friend from Texas, but I especially thank my good  friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz from Florida for their support on this  amendment.   I include in the Record two letters from the Department of Veterans  Affairs inspector general.                                     Department of Veterans Affairs,                                               Inspector General,                                      Washington DC, March 23, 2018.      Hon. Phil Roe, M.D.,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed is a response from the Office       of Inspector General (OIG) to a question for the record       received from Congressman Mike Bost following the February       15th hearing before the Committee on the U.S. Department of       Veterans Affairs Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2019. We       request that it be added to the hearing record.        Thank you for your interest in the OIG.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael J. Missal.        Enclosure.  Office of Inspector General, Department of Veterans Affairs Response to    Questions for the Record From House Committee on Veterans' Affairs     Hearing on U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Budget Request for                              Fiscal Year 2019         65. The budget includes a request for $172 million for the       Office of Inspector General to strengthen accountability.       Will this level of funding be sufficient to properly enforce       accountability throughout the VA?        VA Office of Inspector General Response: The budget request       for the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for fiscal year       (FY) 2019 of $172 million will not be sufficient for the OIG       to fully meet its mission of effective oversight of the       programs and operations of VA. While that amount would       represent an increase over the OIG's funding of $164 million       for FY 2018, it falls short of even the OIG's actual FY 2018       operating budget of $175.5 million (which includes $15.9       million of carryover due to a late hiring cycle that was out       of synch with the budget cycle).        There will not be a carryover of that size for FY 2019 as       those funds will have been expended led primarily on new       hires to conduct our oversight work. In addition, we are now       funding our Office of Contract Review approximately $5       million that was previously paid by VA through a reimbursable       agreement, and there are other increased costs in FY 2019.       Consequently, an FY 2019 appropriation of $172 million would       require a decrease of about 28 OIG staff. This would result       in a likely curtailment of some of our oversight priorities       if OIG staffing and resources decrease at a time when VA is       experiencing growth, including large and complex projects       such as VA's new electronic health records initiative,       improving VA's financial systems, enhancing and consolidating       VA's IT systems, and expansion of community care programs.       The OIG will need additional funds to not only conduct       oversight of these costly programs, but also to expand our       investigations of other high-risk VA programs, such as       construction, procurement, education benefits, and the       delivery of timely and quality healthcare. The VA OIG's       staffing is among the smallest ratio of oversight staff to       agency staff across the Inspector General community.       Moreover, the OIG budget represents less than .1 percent of       VA's overall budget, which again is less than a significant       number of OIGs at other cabinet level agencies. An FY2019       appropriation of $172 million will undermine progress       achieved to ``right size'' the OIG oversight capacity to the       growth and demands of VA' new initiatives.                                   ____                                     Department of Veterans Affairs,                                               Inspector General,                                       Washington, DC, April 3 2018.      Hon. Patty Murray,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Murray: Your question regarding the VA Office       of Inspector General's (OIG) budget for fiscal year (FY) 2019       was referred to the OIG for a response. We appreciate your       interest and are grateful for your support.        The budget request for the OIG FY 2019 of $172 million will       not be sufficient for the OIG to fully meet its mission of       effective oversight of the programs and operations of VA.       While that amount would represent an increase over the OIG's       funding of $164 million for FY 2018, it falls short of even       the OIG's actual FY 2018 operating budget of $179.9 million       (which includes $15.9 million of carryover due to a late       hiring cycle that was out of synch with the budget cycle).        There will not be a carryover of that size for FY 2019 as       those funds will have been expended primarily on new hires to       conduct our oversight work. In addition, we are now funding       our Office of Contract Review approximately $5 million that       was previously paid by VA through a reimbursable agreement,       and there are other increased costs in FY 2019. Consequently,       a FY 2019 appropriation of $172 million would likely require       a decrease of about 28 OIG staff. This would inevitably       result in a curtailment of some of our oversight activities       at a time when VA is experiencing growth, including large and       complex projects such as VA's new electronic health records       initiative, improving VA's financial systems, enhancing and       consolidating VA's IT systems, and expansion of community       care programs. The OIG will need additional funds to not only       conduct oversight of these costly programs, but also to       expand our investigations of other high-risk VA programs,       such as construction, procurement, education benefits, and       the delivery of timely and quality healthcare.

A FY 2019       appropriation of $172 million will undermine progress       achieved to ``right size'' the OIG oversight capacity to       match the growth and demands of VA's new initiatives.        We will provide a copy of this letter to Chairman Isakson       and request that it be made part of the hearing record.  [[Page H4990]]         Again, thank you for interest and support of the OIG.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael J. Missal.     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
