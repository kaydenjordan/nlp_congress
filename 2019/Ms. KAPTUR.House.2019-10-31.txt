 Madam Speaker, I rise to introduce a resolution  supporting the Three Seas Initiative to bolster energy infrastructure  security in Central and Eastern Europe. I am pleased to co-lead this  bipartisan effort with the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the Environment, Adam  Kinzinger.   Energy security is national security. For years, Russia has sought to  undermine liberty and security in Europe by forcing Central and East  European nations into reliance on Russia for their energy needs. They  do this through projects including the Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream,  Russian gas pipelines.   Thankfully, 12 of our closest allies in Central and Eastern Europe  have banded together to increase their energy autonomy through  collective financing of energy infrastructure projects: the Three Seas  Initiative.   This resolution makes clear U.S.'s strong support for the initiative  and encourages member nations to take action on joint financing of  future projects. Additionally, it encourages the member nations to  consider financing of clean energy projects as the world addresses our  dire climate change crises.   In the face of increased Russian aggression, the U.S. must play a  leading role in energy security in Europe, and I urge my colleagues to  support this important resolution.                            ____________________
