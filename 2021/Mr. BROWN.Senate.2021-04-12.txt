 Mr. President, on Friday, Amazon, one of the world's  largest corporations, successfully crushed the most recent union drive  at one of their warehouses, where workers were organizing for a voice  on the job.  [[Page S1871]]    Let's be clear: This was never a fair fight.   Amazon is perhaps the world's most powerful corporation. It would not  be raking in profits without the hard work and dedication of its  hundreds--hundreds of thousands of American workers. Yet Amazon  unleashed all that corporate power to fight those same workers.   They harassed employees with anti-union propaganda. They sent  misleading text messages, websites, and fliers. Workers reported they  didn't even get enough time for bathroom breaks in the warehouse. That  is how intense the company's pressure is. And yet, when they are able  to use the bathroom during this union fight, even there workers are hit  with anti-union propaganda fliers on the stall doors.   Amazon demanded the U.S. Postal Service install a mailbox onsite at  the warehouse so they could monitor employees mailing their union  election ballots. It is all part of a pattern for Amazon.   In 2019, Amazon fired a Staten Island warehouse worker who called for  unionization.   Amazon monitors employees' online communications. Last fall we  learned the company planned to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars  for new software to monitor ``threats'' like unions. Amazon isn't  alone. This union busting is standard operating procedure for most  companies.   A growing number of Americans want to join unions. A recent poll  found that about half of Americans would like to join a union if they  could. Millennials are the most pro-worker, pro-union generation since  World War II. The Center for Economic Policy and Research reported that  75 percent of new union members are under the age of 35.   I talked to one of those union workers at the end of last month. I  spoke to Kate from Zanesville, OH, who joined UFCW--United Food and  Commercial Workers--not too long ago. We talked about the work she and  I and others did to save her future pension in the rescue plan, how her  union had helped her learn about retirement security and helped her  fight for her retirement security.   So if all those workers, especially young workers, want to join a  union, if they want to have a voice on the job, they want to have more  control over their work lives, why aren't more union drives successful?   Pretty important question to ask, pretty obvious answer--because  corporations have so much power.   One union organizer told a reporter for the Huffington Post:         When people hear there's an election, they think everybody       gets to vote, there's a secret ballot, and so on. What they       don't understand--    What the public doesn't understand about union elections--       is that the company has access to the workers 24 hours a day,       7 days a week, and has enormous influence over their lives.    If they care to use that influence, and so often they do, here is  what he said:         They can threaten. They can give a raise. They can demote.       They can grant favors.    Or they cannot grant favors.         Every worker knows that.    This is what workers organizing are up against. There is nothing  close, nothing at all resembling a level playing field for American  workers.   That is why we need the PRO Act, Protecting the Right to Organize  Act.   It is a comprehensive overhaul of our labor laws to protect workers'  right to stand together and to bargain for fair wages and better  benefits and safer workplaces.   It would level the playing field and finally, finally give workers a  fighting chance against corporate union-busting tactics like we saw  from Amazon.   We know what has happened in this country. We know we have seen--we  have seen worker productivity go up. We have seen corporate profits go  up. We have seen executive compensation skyrocket upward. Yet worker  wages are flat.   Passing the PRO Act would strengthen the punishment against companies  that violate workers' rights to organize and that retaliate against  union organizers.   It would close loopholes that allow employers to misclassify their  employees as supervisors and independent contractors to avoid paying  their fair share and to avoid giving workers the benefits they have  earned and that they deserve.   A union card is a ticket to a middle-class life when you fight for  economic justice by making it available for all workers. We just need  corporations to get out of the way, to be neutral, to let workers  organize and take control over their careers and their futures.   We also need to empower all workers, whether they have chosen to join  a union or not.   That means paid family and medical leave for all workers. It means a  living wage for all workers. It means retirement security for all  workers. It means power over your life and your schedule. It means  overtime pay when you earn it. It means healthcare for all workers. It  is, all in the end, about the dignity of work.   Remember what Dr. King said; that ``no labor is really menial unless  you are not getting adequate wages.''   When you love this country, you fight for the people who make it  work. That is what union organizers do in the face of overwhelming  corporate opposition, like the billionaires at Amazon, and it is what  all of us must continue to do until all work pays off.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until noon, Tuesday,  April 13; that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the nomination of Polly Trottenberg to be Deputy  Secretary of Transportation; further, I ask that the Senate recess from  12:30 until 2:15 to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; finally, that  the postcloture time in the Trottenberg nomination be considered  expired at 2:15 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:26 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, April 13, 2021, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
