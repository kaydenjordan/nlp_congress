 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, at an emergency  session of the U.N. Security Council, Ambassador Nikki Haley spoke  truthfully about the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks in Gaza over many  years by tunnel and firebombs using human shields financed by Iran.   Ambassador Haley explained, as our President said: ``The location of  our Embassy has no bearing on the specific boundaries of Israeli  sovereignty in Jerusalem or the resolution of contested borders. . . .  It does not undermine the prospects for peace in any way.''   ``But let's remember that the Hamas terrorist organization has been  inciting violence for years, long before the United States decided to  move our Embassy,'' Ambassador Haley said. ``This is what is  endangering the people of Gaza. Make no mistake: Hamas is pleased with  the results of yesterday.''   The real story I saw in The Jerusalem Post is ``Promises Made,  Promises Kept,'' not the fake news of Hamas sympathizers.   In addition, last night, at the Willard, I was grateful to attend the  International Republican Institute dinner led by President Daniel  Twining where Ambassador Nikki Haley was honored with Secretary James  Mattis to receive the Freedom Award.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
