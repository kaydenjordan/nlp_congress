 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our guest  chaplain for today, Dipesh Pandya, along with members of the BAPS  mandirs in our district in Pennsylvania.   They are here with hundreds of prominent Indian Americans who are  also members of the BAPS organization, a Hindu faith that holds  services in 32 States across 91 congressional districts.   They are here with us today to celebrate Diwali, the festival of  lights, a festival celebrated by over 2 million Indian Americans across  the United States. This 5-day celebration signifies the triumph of  light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair.   Diwali reminds us that there is joy in serving God, serving our  country, serving our community, and our fellow citizens, particularly  during times of calamity and despair. Traditionally, rows of divas, or  candles, were used to illuminate and dispel darkness.   Today we are reminded that we must work together, united and in  friendship, to serve this great Nation and the communities in which we  live.   Indeed, the BAPS community throughout the United States continuously  strives to serve society through various charitable and humanitarian  activities, ranging from food drives to disaster relief efforts,  including the planting of trees.   On behalf of my fellow Members of Congress, I am proud to recognize  and welcome the BAPS members who have traveled here to Washington from  across the country.                            ____________________
