 Mr. Speaker, I trespass on the time of the House today  to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Leno Bradby.   Mr. Bradby was a true leader of our community--a community in the  Fourth Congressional District, known as Charles City County. He was an  active member of his NAACP chapter, of the National Association for the  Advancement of Colored People, as well as being a member of the Charles  City County Democratic Committee.   Mr. Bradby dedicated his time to helping folks vote by supporting  voter registration and voter education efforts in our district. He  regularly volunteered at the polling locations and provided community  members with transportation to cast their ballots. I know that his  presence was greatly missed in a special election that was held within  our district yesterday.   It is sad to see a devout and active member of our community leave  us, but his legacy will live on with his fellow community members. This  is a great loss to Charles City County.                            ____________________
