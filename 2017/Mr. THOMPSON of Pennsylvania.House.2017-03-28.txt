 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight a  program that helps low-income families lead healthier lives through  education.   SNAP-Ed works to help individuals who benefit from the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP. It aims to help people make healthy  choices within a limited budget and choose active lifestyles consistent  with the current dietary guidelines for Americans.   As chairman of the Agriculture Committee's Nutrition Subcommittee, we  have been examining SNAP and how we can improve it in the next farm  bill. SNAP-Ed is an important part of this, and the results show that  it works.   In my home State of Pennsylvania, 17 percent of people are living  below the poverty line; 1.8 million Pennsylvanians are eligible for  SNAP; 85 percent of Pennsylvania adults do not eat the recommended  daily amounts of fruits and vegetables; and 14 percent of  Pennsylvanians are food insecure, meaning they lack reliable access to  a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food.   Mr. Speaker, SNAP-Ed helps low-income families stretch tight budgets  and bring home healthy foods from the grocery store. It teaches low- income families how to prepare nutritious meals.   SNAP-Ed is a $400 million program awarded through Federal grants to  State agencies. SNAP-Ed has the flexibility to work in schools, grocery  stores, parks, even public gyms. SNAP-Ed offers many different forms of  direct education and takes community input into consideration when  developing education programs.   Another food education program authorized through the farm bill is  the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program. This program is an  approximately $68 million initiative operated through the Cooperative  Extension Service of land grant universities. It delivers direct  education via peer educators in a series of interactive hands-on  lessons to improve four core  [[Page H2468]]  areas: diet quality and physical activity, food resource management,  food safety, and food security.   The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program tends to be less  flexible in how it delivers services than SNAP-Ed, but it has the  capacity to reach more people than SNAP-Ed because it operates in more  areas, both urban and rural, across this country.   Mr. Speaker, both of these educational programs are helping low- income families lead healthier lives and make better choices when it  comes to nutritious food. Through education we can help ensure that  American families--especially children--learn about the importance of a  balanced diet as part of a healthy lifestyle and the joy of preparing  their own meals.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to strengthening these programs in the  next farm bill so that we can continue to educate and serve American  families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Ellwood National Crankshaft on receiving STAR certification in the OSHA  Voluntary Protection Program.   Ellwood National Crankshaft, located in Irvine, Pennsylvania, is a  unique manufacturer of new and reconditioned crankshafts for medium- speed engines in the 800- to 6,000-horsepower range.   Mr. Speaker, in order to attain this distinguished certification, a  facility has met or exceeded the performance-based criteria for a  managed safety and health system. It also passed the rigorous onsite  evaluation conducted by a team of OSHA safety and health experts.   This recognition is even more significant, knowing that Ellwood  National Crankshaft is one of only a few forging and process safety  management facilities to obtain the STAR status. Its motto, ``Injury  free every day,'' echoes the importance of safety throughout the plant.   I commend Ellwood National Crankshaft for making safety a top  priority.
