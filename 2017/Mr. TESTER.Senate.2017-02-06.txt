 Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for a  question?    Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for a  question?    Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for a  question?    Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for a  question?    Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for a  question?    I say to Senator Durbin, there has been a lot of talk  about the fact that the number of Cabinet appointees were much higher  in the Obama administration than they are now. Could you take us back 8  years ago? I mean, we just confirmed a lady to be Secretary of  Education who has never spent 1 minute in a public school classroom, on  a school board, teaching, student, otherwise. There are claims out  there about some of these nominees being involved in insider trading.  There are claims out there that some of these nominees did not pay  their taxes.   Could you take us back 8 years ago and tell us how those folks were  treated, if there was anything wrong with them when they came to this  floor?    I want to thank the Senator from Illinois for his history  lesson on the confirmation process over the last 8 years, at least in  the Senate.   I want to speak today on behalf of the thousands of Montanans who  have asked me to oppose the nomination of Mr. Sessions as the Attorney  General of the United States. As this country's top law enforcement  official, the Attorney General must stand up and fight for all  Americans. The Attorney General must provide a voice for the folks who  often are not able to speak for themselves.   The Attorney General must enforce the law as it is written, not how  the President wishes it was written. I believe Mr. Sessions has proven  time and time again that he does not fulfill these qualifications, and  therefore I will oppose his nomination for Attorney General.   Mr. Sessions opposed the reauthorization of the Violence Against  Women Act. This landmark legislation protects women from domestic  violence and sexual assault and brings perpetrators to justice. In my  State of Montana, this law helped provide over $10 million every year  to support women and children. Those are critical resources that make a  real difference in the lives of women, children, and their families,  and they keep our communities safe.   The Violence Against Women Act supports shelters like the Friendship  Center in Helena, which is literally saving lives and protecting women  and children from violence every day--in fact, they help over 1,000  Montanans each and every year--or programs like Rocky Boy Office of  Victims Services, which is in the Rocky Boy Indian Reservation.   Thanks to the Violence Against Women Act, this has helped reduce the  number of sexual assaults on that reservation. If he is confirmed, I  would invite Mr. Sessions to Red Lodge, Missoula or Browning, and the  many other places in our State to see how the Violence Against Women  Act is saving lives and making communities safer. I invite him to sit  down with the survivors at any of the YWCAs in Montana and explain to  them why he opposes the Violence Against Women Act.   As Attorney General, Mr. Sessions will be responsible for  administering critical resources through the Violence Against Women  Act, resources that will save lives, but as a Senator, Mr. Sessions has  turned his back on the survivors of domestic violence. I am not  confident he will be there for them as Attorney General.   I will not support a nominee for Attorney General who opposed  legislation that helps us better investigate and prosecute violent  crimes against women, but that is not all. I am not convinced that Mr.  Sessions will stand up for the privacy laws of law-abiding Americans.  Less than 2 years ago, right on this Senate floor, Mr. Sessions fought  to preserve the most intrusive aspects of the PATRIOT Act.   That was not the first time he supported unchecked government  surveillance. Mr. Sessions has voted in support of the most intrusive  aspects of the PATRIOT Act seven times--seven times.   He is a staunch advocate for the NSA's bulk data collection, which  violates the privacy of millions of Americans. If Mr. Sessions is  confirmed as Attorney General, will he push back and fight our  government that undercuts our freedoms? Will he fight on behalf of  government officials who listen into our phone calls, or scroll through  our emails or preserve our Snapchats?   Will he intervene if the government once again spies on citizens  without a warrant? I think the answer to that, quite frankly, is no.  When government agencies like the NSA collect bulk data, they do so at  the expense of our freedoms. If Mr. Sessions is not willing to protect  our Fourth Amendment rights, can we expect him to fight for other  constitutional rights?   Will he fight for the First, the Second, the Fifth? Again, the answer  is no. We need an Attorney General who will fight and protect our  individual freedoms, not one who is willing to sacrifice it.   I am not alone. Thousands of Montanans have contacted my office  opposing Mr. Sessions. Here are some of the things Montanans have  written to me. Anne from Missoula wrote me:         Please vote against the nomination of Jeff Sessions for       Attorney General. He has a history of supporting the       weakening of our civil liberties. Voting rights should be       strengthened, not weakened. His support of the Patriot Act       and opposition of the Violence Against Women Act are just a       few of the many egregious positions that he has taken.    Susan from Bigfork:         Please vote no on Jeff Sessions for Attorney General. She       is an inappropriate choice due to women's issues and civil       liberty issues. He has shown poor choices in protecting       voting rights and women's choices.    Jerilyn from Belgrade:         Jeff Sessions is completely the wrong person to be Attorney       General. His record on civil rights and women's issues belong       in a different century.    Amy from Whitefish:         Vote no to the nomination of Jeff Sessions, who has shown       himself time and again to be no friend to equality or civil       liberties. Please know that we in Montana expect you to       uphold our desire for all members of this great Nation       regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation       or sexual orientation, to be treated with respect and       dignity.    Charles from Livingston:         He voted no on the Violence Against Women Act.    That ``he'' being Mr. Sessions. Mr. Sessions voted no on adding  sexual orientation to the definition of hate crimes. He voted yes on  loosening restrictions on cell phone wiretapping.   Now, I agree with Anne and Susan and Amy and Jerilyn and Charles and  thousands of other Montanans. Because of that, I will not support Mr.  Sessions, and I will urge my colleagues to oppose his nomination.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.
