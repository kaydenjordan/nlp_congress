 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION     United Kingdom--AIM-120D Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile                                  (AMRAAM)         The Government of the United Kingdom has requested to buy       up to two hundred (200) AIM-120D Advanced Medium Range Air-      to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs). Also included in this sale are       missile containers; weapon system support equipment; support       and test equipment; site survey; transportation; repair and       return support; warranties; spare and repair parts;       publications and technical documentation; maintenance and       personnel training; training equipment; U.S. Government and       contractor engineering, logistics, and technical support       services; and other related elements of logistics and program       support. The estimated cost of the overall possible sale is       $650 million.        The proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security policies of the United States by helping to       improve the security of a NATO ally which has been, and       continues to be, an important partner on critical foreign       policy and defense issues.        The proposed sale will improve the Royal Air Force's       aircraft capabilities for mutual defense, regional security,       force modernization, and U.S. and NATO interoperability. This       sale will enhance the Royal Air Force's ability to defend the       United Kingdom against future threats and contribute to       future NATO operations. The United Kingdom will have no       difficulty absorbing these missiles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Missile Systems       Company, Tucson, AZ. At this time, there are no known offset       agreements proposed in connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the United Kingdom.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 18-03       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-120D Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles       (AMRAAM) is a guided missile featuring digital technology and       micro-miniature solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures,       and interception of high- and low-flying and maneuvering       targets. The AMRAAM is classified CONFIDENTIAL, major       components and subsystems range from UNCLASSIFIED to       CONFIDENTIAL, and technical data and other documentation are       classified up to SECRET.        2. The AIM-120D AMRAAM hardware, including the missile       guidance section, is classified CONFIDENTIAL. State-of-the-      art technology is used in the missile to provide it with       unique beyond-visual-range capability. The increase in       capability from the AIM-120C-7 to AIM-120D consists of a two-      way data link, a more accurate navigation unit, improved       High-Angle Off-Boresight (HOBS) capability, and enhanced       aircraft-to-missile position handoff.        3. AIM-120D features a target detection device with       embedded electronic countermeasures, and an electronics unit       within the guidance section that performs all radar signal       processing, midcourse and terminal guidance, flight control,       target detection, and warhead burst point determination.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary obtains       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems that might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that the Government of the       United Kingdom can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for the sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This proposed sale is necessary to the       furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national security       objectives outlined in the policy justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of the United Kingdom.                                   ____                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION   Denmark--AIM-120 C-7 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM)         The Government of Denmark has requested to buy twenty-eight       (28) AIM-120 C-7 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles       (AMRAAM) and one (1) AMRAAM spare guidance section. Also       included are missile containers, control section spares,       weapon systems support, test equipment, spare and repair       parts, publications and technical documentation, personnel       training, training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor       engineering, logistics, and technical support services, and       other related elements of logistics and program support. The       total estimated program cost is $90 million.        This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy       and national security of the United States by helping to       improve the security of a NATO ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in the       European region.        This proposed sale would support Denmark's F-16 and future       F-35 fighter programs and enhance Denmark's ability to       provide for its own territorial defense and support coalition       operations. The proposed sale also enables interoperability       and standardization between the armed forces of Denmark and       the United States. Denmark already maintains the AIM-120B in       its inventory and will have no difficulty absorbing this       additional equipment and support into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of these systems and equipment will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon Cooperation in       Tucson, Arizona. The purchaser has requested offsets. At this       time, agreements are undetermined and will be defined in       negotiations between the purchaser and contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Denmark.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.
