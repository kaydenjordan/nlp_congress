 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, tonight, I am convening a Special Order  hour for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, where we are focused on  our shared commitment and shared urgency to make comprehensive  immigration reform and universal healthcare our reality. We are one  step closer to doing so for DACA recipients, or Dreamers, who have been  waiting and are still waiting for us to make good on our long-overdue  commitment to a pathway to citizenship for them.   Healthcare is a human right, full stop. I know saying healthcare is a  human right can feel more like a slogan or a hashtag than a call to  action that anyone will actually do something about. I have certainly  felt that myself and felt frustrated by the simplicity of that call to  action contrasted with a deflating lack of change.   Some people think it is too lofty and that we should start smaller.  What does it mean, though, to start smaller? When it comes to  healthcare, that means dividing people into who is worthy of healthcare  and who is not.   I will take a quick moment to thank everyone who doesn't give in and  doesn't give up on envisioning a better world that has more than enough  resources for all of us because I know that you get pushback, doubt,  and detraction. It is those big, lofty goals that keep us rooted in our  why and keep pushing us for better.   That is why, last week when President Biden announced his proposal to  expand eligibility for Medicaid and Affordable Care Act benefits to  Dreamers, we all celebrated.   DACA first started in 2012, over a decade ago. There are  approximately 600,000 DACA recipients living across the United States.  They are healthcare workers, they are teachers, they are parents, and  they are neighbors.   About 35,000 Dreamers call my home State of Illinois their home. One  of them is my husband, Boris Hernandez, who has lived in the U.S. since  he was 14 years old. He has now lived in the U.S. more than he ever  lived in Guatemala.   Collectively, Dreamers pay $9.4 billion in State and Federal taxes  every single year.   For all these years, access to healthcare through the ACA or through  Medicaid hasn't been available to Dreamers. That is a policy failure  with life and death consequences.   Right now, DACA recipients can mainly only access healthcare if their  employer provides it. Otherwise, they are largely reliant upon the  State they happen to live in to have a State-funded healthcare program.   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, more than a  third of DACA recipients don't have any healthcare insurance  whatsoever. We know what happens when you deny access to affordable  healthcare. People avoid going to the doctor as much as possible  because they can't afford to go. Health conditions that may only need  preventive care or some kind of medication go undiagnosed, untreated,  and get worse and worse until it is a life or death emergency.   Before I came to Congress, I had the deep honor of serving in the  Illinois House of Representatives, where I led legislation with the  Latino Legislative Caucus, the Healthy Illinois coalition, and Governor  J.B. Pritzker to create what is now State law that expands Medicaid  coverage to all residents age 42 and up regardless of legal status.  This made Illinois the first State in the entire country to provide  healthcare coverage to immigrants, regardless of status.   By the time this passed into law, it reflected multiple rounds of  negotiations. If I could have, I would have had eligibility start at  the age of 19 to ensure that there was no break in healthcare coverage  for our children who are now adults.   I now look forward to working with President Biden's proposed  expansion of healthcare coverage to Dreamers and it going into effect  so that we can continue to build on the work we have done in Illinois  and across the country.   Hearing even one story of what expanding healthcare coverage for just  one person has meant to them and their loved ones underscores what is  true for all of us. We must recognize the importance of providing  access to quality healthcare and services for all people, regardless of  their citizenship status.   Olga, a resident in Illinois, who, because of this new State law,  could access medical coverage for the first time, graciously shared her  story with me. She said: ``I was born in Mexico, and I came to Chicago  in 2004. I came to the United States for a better life for my family. I  encountered many obstacles, such as language, work, housing, school for  my children, and health. I had to get a dental treatment, but due to  the cost, I put off going. Then, it got complicated and more expensive.  I managed to save $8,000, but I had to choose between two options: pay  for the dentist or pay for my son's university. Having access to  medical coverage is a true relief because now I can go regularly to the  doctor.''   I share Olga's story because her story is the story of many others,  hundreds of thousands of immigrants, whether DACA or otherwise, who  live all across our country and still don't have the ability to go to  the doctor when they need it.   The immediate and tremendous impact she experienced once affordable  healthcare was no longer denied is the same immediate and tremendous  impact President Biden's proposal will have on all Dreamers.    It feels obvious to say, but the benefits of access to affordable  healthcare for someone who is a DACA recipient are the same for all  immigrants. It is not just Dreamers.   Yet, here is just one example of how we continue to divide and break  up the immigrant community into politicized categories that we then use  to weigh different members of the immigrant community against each  other. Who is and isn't worthy of citizenship? Who is and isn't worthy  of healthcare?   I say all this as the only Member of Congress in a mixed-status  marriage. What I want to make absolutely clear is that our families and  our communities cannot be conveniently divided into documentation  status and, therefore, neither can our deservedness of healthcare as a  human right.   That is why The New York Times' reporting this week that multiple  staff at HHS warned the administration that migrant children were being  hastily connected to sponsors who put them in grave danger cannot be  seen as separate.   More than 250,000 migrant children have come alone to the United  States in the last 2 years alone, and thousands  [[Page H1877]]  have ended up in grueling, dangerous, exploitive jobs all across the  country, in complete violation of child labor laws. They are away from  their families and caregivers. They are not in school, and they are  doing graveyard shifts in factories.   You can't tell me that is healthy. You can't tell me these children  and their families they have been separated from are not deserving of  safe, caring sponsors who would prioritize their healthcare, education,  wellness, and a pathway to citizenship.   I commend President Biden for his proposal for Dreamers. It marks a  significant step forward for immigration reform, demonstrating our  commitment to protecting Dreamers by providing them with access to  quality healthcare and services.   But we must recognize this moment, which has been preceded by years  of moments, that the brokenness of our immigration system is a failure  we share on both sides of the aisle. Let us use this moment to  rededicate ourselves to this shared responsibility to fix it humanely,  comprehensively, and immediately.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to my colleagues, who will  highlight the tremendous impact that President Biden's proposed  expansion of healthcare to Dreamers will have and our shared  responsibility to make universal healthcare and comprehensive  immigration reform a reality after all these years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Frost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana  (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I too dream of that day. You see, half of  my family is still undocumented. Half of my family has lived here for  almost 40 years.   My uncle, Max Guerra, will be turning 70 in 2 years. He works at a  diner. He works 65 to 70 hours a week, standing there preparing meals  for others to be able to enjoy.   I asked him: Tio, you are almost 70, why are you still working so  much?   He says to me: Delia, I have to make sure that all my four boys get  through college. I have to help them pay for college because I have no  way of guaranteeing that I will be here tomorrow or the day after  because of my immigration status. I have to work like today is the last  day that I will be able to provide for my family. My uncle, Max Miliano  Guerra, is not alone.   As we think about this broken immigration system and as we think  about healthcare, I have to go back to that moment where I proudly  stood on the statehouse floor and passed legislation to expand  healthcare coverage to people who are undocumented and over the age of  42.   I remember receiving a letter from a young woman who had just become  a citizen. Her letter to me said, Representative Ramirez, I wish you  would have been in the statehouse just a few years before. I wish you  would have been able to pass the legislation you passed a few years ago  because if you had done that my father would still be alive today.   Her father was in this country for almost 40 whole years working at  factories and small businesses, giving to the community, contributing  every single day, paying taxes. He got very sick. He got cancer but had  no healthcare. Her father worked until he could no longer work, which  was days before he died because he had no access to healthcare in a  country he contributed to for almost 40 years.   This is why when we talk about healthcare coverage and when we talk  about this moment and immigration, we can't separate the issues. We  understand that it is past time for us to be able to have a pathway to  citizenship. It is past time that DACA Dreamers, like my own husband,  have access to healthcare. They are healthcare workers, they are  teachers, and during the pandemic they kept you and me alive. This is  exactly why I applaud President Biden's administration and this  proposal to finally provide healthcare to those who every single year  provide more than $9.4 billion of tax revenue to this country we love.    This is exactly why standing here as a Member of the Congressional  Progressive Caucus, as the daughter of a woman who crossed the border  when she was pregnant with me in her first trimester--a woman who said  to me, Delia, water was just a privilege. It was the ability to be able  to keep on walking and recognizing that I needed you to have the life I  never had. I needed you to wear your first pair of shoes before the age  of seven, unlike me. I needed you to be able to get more than a third  grade education. I risked everything in 1,811 miles of desert, walking  40 years ago so that you, inside my womb, could be born in a country  where you would have the opportunities I never had.   That woman today is a citizen because of amnesty of 1987. One thing  that woman never imagined was that her daughter, that life she fought  so hard to keep alive in the Rio Grande, would be standing before you  today in the same fight for immigration reform that so many for the  last 40 years have had.   This is why we understand that we have to get past parties. We have  to be in a position to be able to expand healthcare coverage to people  regardless of their legal status.   As Congressman Carter said, we need to recognize that it is actually  quite more affordable to provide preventative care than to care for  someone when they are nearly dying in a hospital, which is exactly what  we saw in the State of Illinois.   By expanding healthcare coverage to people in Illinois, hospitals no  longer have to take in people who are dying because they didn't get  preventive care. This is why this proposal and this proposed rule will  make such a difference--not just to Boris, but to all of those children  that came so young and are no longer 13, 14, 15, they are 38, 39.   It has been the honor of my life to be sworn into the U.S. Congress.  I recognize the responsibility we have and the commitment of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus to ensure that we stop talking about  immigration reform and do something about it.   Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of going back home and having to  look at people that look like me, that carry my blood, and tell them:  Maybe next Congress. Maybe next time. Maybe convince this person or  convince the other.   It is past time that this country that I love, that I was born in,  where I get to serve in Congress as the first Latina from the Midwest  that proudly I represent, that we finally do what is right and what we  all know is not just a moral obligation. It is also one that allows us  to be able to continue to contribute and see the economic development  and the contributions of our immigrants here in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues who have joined tonight's  Progressive Caucus Special Order hour. What is absolutely clear to me  is that the power of our collective voices, united in making  comprehensive immigration reform and universal healthcare a reality  now, not later--and not only for some while other members of the  immigrant community suffer--must be our responsibility. I know that  when there is a will there is always a way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H1879]]                                ____________________
