 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. McGovern), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today is a very sad day for all of us--for me  personally, for the Rules Committee, for the entire House of  Representatives, and, most importantly, for the American people.   For the second time in my life, the House of Representatives will be  voting to impeach a President of the United States. But unlike in 1998,  the decision to have this vote is not the result of a bipartisan  process nor an open or fair process. Instead, it is going to be a  deeply partisan vote, coming at the end of an unfair and rushed process  prescribed solely by Democrats to ensure a predetermined result.                                time  1015    Impeachment of a President is one of the most consequential acts the  House of Representatives can undertake, and it should only be done  after the fullest and most careful consideration.   Yet, today, after a truncated investigation that denied the President  due process and cherry-picked evidence and witness testimony to fit  their narrative and trampled on Republicans' minority rights, Democrats  in the House are pressing forward with a partisan impeachment vote.   Doing so contradicts Speaker Pelosi's own words back in March of this  year when she said that an ``impeachment is so divisive to the country  that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and  bipartisan, I don't think we should go down that path, because it  divides the country.''   But if we are really being honest, Democrats have been searching for  a reason to impeach President Trump since the day he was elected. In  December of 2017, a current member of the majority forced a vote to  impeach the President; and even then, long before there was even an  impeachment investigation, 58 Democrats voted to impeach the President.   Those Members have only grown since then, to the point where the  majority is now pushing forward with a final vote on impeachment,  heedless of where it takes the country and regardless of whether or not  they have proven their case.   If my colleagues in the majority believe they have proven their case,  let me be clear: They have not. The entire premise of these Articles of  Impeachment rests on a pause placed on Ukrainian security assistance, a  pause of 55 days.   The majority has spun creative narratives as to the meaning and the  motive of this pause, alleging the President demanded a ``quid pro  quo,'' but with no factual evidence to back it up. Security aid to  Ukraine was released. The administration did so without Ukraine ever  initiating an investigation into anyone or anything.   It is even more startling to me that the majority wants to move  forward with this resolution given how substantially flawed and  procedurally defective the entire process has been.   The Judiciary Committee, which drafted these Articles of Impeachment,  engaged in an abbreviated process, hearing from no witnesses with  firsthand knowledge of the events in question. They did not conduct  their own investigation and only held two hearings on this topic before  drafting the articles, one with staff and one with constitutional law  scholars. That is hardly the type of lengthy and serious consideration  a topic as grave as impeachment demands.   The committee actually charged with an impeachment investigation was  the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, not the Judiciary  Committee, but that committee, too, followed a primarily closed  process. Republicans were denied the right to call witnesses or  subpoena documents, and the President was denied the right to  representation in the committee's hearings.   Without respecting minority rights and without respecting due process  rights of the President, how can anyone consider this a fair process?   Madam Speaker, it gets worse. The Articles of Impeachment we are  considering today are based on the Schiff report, the final document  produced by the Intelligence Committee and transmitted to the Judiciary  Committee.   But the Schiff report includes unsubstantiated allegations. It  includes, in some cases, news reports as the only evidence supporting  so-called factual assertions, and it includes at least 54 different  hearsay statements as assertions of evidence without any firsthand  information from witnesses to corroborate those statements.   The author of the report, Chairman Schiff, was never questioned by  the Judiciary Committee, and he refused to sit for questions or to  explain how his committee conducted its investigation. In fact, during  the staff presentation of evidence at the Judiciary Committee, Ranking  Member Collins asked how the investigation was conducted that resulted  in the drafting of the Schiff report, but he never received an answer.   During the Rules Committee consideration of H. Res. 755, there were  numerous times when the members on both sides of the aisle posed  questions to our witnesses, questions they could not answer because  they sit on the Judiciary Committee and were not the author of the  report that brought about H. Res. 755.   The author has never appeared before members of the minority to  explain a single thing in the report or to provide factual information  supporting the many assertions it contains.   Madam Speaker, this is no way to go about impeaching the President of  the United States. The articles before us are based on very limited  information. They are based on hearsay, on news reports, and on other  unsupported allegations. They are based on a report written by a Member  of Congress who refused to answer questions about it; and I do not  believe the allegations, which are subject to interpretation, actually  rise to the level of an impeachable offense.   To make matters worse, when Republicans attempted to exercise one of  their rights under House rules, they were shut down by Chairman Nadler.  Under clause 2(j)(1) of rule XI, the minority is allowed to demand a  minority hearing day. On December 4, the Republicans on the Judiciary  Committee properly exercised that right and transmitted a demand to  Chairman Nadler for a hearing day at which the minority could call  their own witnesses.   To be clear, Madam Speaker, a minority hearing day is not subject to  the chair's discretion. It is a right, and Republicans on the Judiciary  Committee properly demanded the exercise of that right; yet, Chairman  Nadler declined to allow a minority hearing day to be held before the  voting of these articles.   I think we can all agree that it would have been better for the  institution and for the American people to allow all voices to be heard  and all witnesses to be questioned before proceeding to a vote on  something this consequential; yet, the majority trampled on that right.    But I suppose I should not be surprised by any of this. When the  House passed H. Res. 660, the resolution setting up the official  impeachment inquiry less than 2 months ago, I warned the House that  what the majority was doing was setting up a closed, unfair process  that could only have one outcome. Today, we are seeing the end result  of this closed and unfair process: a quick rush to judgment forced  through not one, but two committees in short order, with minority  rights trampled, witnesses left unquestioned, and due process ignored.   It is also disappointing that Members are not being given more time  to debate this issue on the floor.   Last night at the Rules Committee, I offered an amendment to double  the amount of floor time debate from 6 to 12 hours. This would have  allowed for  [[Page H12118]]  roughly the same amount of debate time used in the Clinton impeachment,  and it would have been ensured that all Members could have the  opportunity to speak on the floor. Unfortunately, that amendment was  not accepted.   While I know my friend, Chairman McGovern, did the best he could, I  do think it is ironic that, when all is said and done, the 13 members  of the Rules Committee spent more time discussing H. Res. 755 in  committee yesterday than we will spend debating it on the House floor  for every Member today. I think that is a disservice to the Members of  this body and to the American people.   Madam Speaker, we deserve better than the flawed process that led to  this flawed outcome. The House of Representatives deserves better than  that. The President certainly deserves better than that. More  importantly, the American people deserve better than what we are doing  here today.   I oppose proceeding any further; I oppose the rule; I oppose this  limited and unfair process; and I certainly oppose impeaching the  President of the United States. I urge opposition to the rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds just to respond to  my friend.   President Trump, for the Record, was not provided the opportunity to  challenge the facts and still has not received the materials from the  Judiciary Committee, as required by H. Res. 660, another example of why  this isn't a fair process.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney),  the distinguished chairman of the Republican Conference, for the  purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Smith), my good friend and the distinguished secretary of the  Republican Conference for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), my good friend, a distinguished member of both the  Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my very good friend and fellow member of the  Rules Committee and member of the Judiciary Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Byrne), my very good friend, a distinguished member of the  Armed Services Committee and a former member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my very good friend, also a distinguished  member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment on the rule that the House shall not proceed to consideration  of the underlying resolution until six conditions are met: all evidence  in the possession of Chairman Schiff has been made available to the  Judiciary Committee; that Chairman Schiff appear before the Judiciary  Committee to testify to the report that he authored; that all  underlying unclassified evidence has been made available to the public;  minority members of the Judiciary Committee have received their right  to a minority hearing day; minority witnesses requested by Ranking  Member Nunes and Ranking Member Collins are called and allowed to be  heard in accordance with H. Res. 660; and subpoenas requested by  Ranking Member Nunes in the Intelligence Committee are issued and  enforced.   Madam Speaker, to be clear, my amendment ensures that the majority  does not proceed without providing a fair, equitable, and transparent  process, one that respects minority rights, one that opens up the  investigation to all Members of the House, and one that allows  Republicans on the Judiciary Committee to examine the most relevant  witnesses.   Perhaps most crucially, it will allow all Members to fully consider  the information available to the committee that actually conducted the  impeachment investigation, the Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence.   The process the House has followed has been abysmal. It was a closed,  unfair process that did not respect minority rights and did not give  the President due process. But we can change that today. If we defeat  the previous question, the House will only move forward with a real,  thorough, and ultimately fair process that all Members can be proud of.  I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice), my good friend.    Might I inquire, Madam Speaker, how much time we have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Zeldin), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Just to advise, through the Chair, my friend, I am waiting for one  additional speaker, but I reserve my time at this time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird), my good friend, a distinguished combat veteran for  our country.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, before I begin my formal remarks in closing, I want to  say one thing for the record.   I have great respect for all of my friends on the other side of the  aisle, and I am sure they are voting their convictions; so when I vote  mine, please don't imply I am doing it for my political party. I am  doing it because it is what I believe is right. I do believe I can  defend both the President and the Constitution of the United States,  and I think that is exactly what I am doing.   Madam Speaker, I cannot oppose this rule strongly enough. The process  we saw leading up to it today was a complete charade. It was a closed  process, an unfair process, and a rushed process, and it could only  have ever had one logical, predetermined ending.   Throughout it all, the majority trampled on minority rights: They  refused to call witnesses with relevant, firsthand knowledge; they  relied on hearsay news reports to make their case; they denied  Republicans the right to hold a minority hearing day; and they refused  the President of the United States his due process rights in the  committee that was actually conducting the impeachment process and  investigating him.   In the end, what was the result? Articles of Impeachment based on an  event that never happened; a purported quid pro quo that did not exist;  aid that was allegedly withheld that, in reality, was never withheld at  all; and a narrative of intent based on nothing more than fantasy.   Madam Speaker, we deserve better than this. Impeachment is the most  consequential act the House of Representatives can undertake. It must  not and cannot be based on a flawed process. It cannot come at the  expense of minority rights or due process to the accused. It cannot be  based on a vendetta against the President that the majority has pursued  since the day he was elected, and it cannot be based on nothing more  than spin and hearsay. I oppose this rule, and I opposed the flawed and  unfair process.   Madam Speaker, it is a very solemn vote that all of us will cast.   I want to end by, number one, thanking my good friend, the chairman  of the Rules Committee, for conducting the kind of hearing he conducted  yesterday; but I also want to underscore, again, that we are very  violently opposed to the process and very strongly opposed to the rule.  We think this is a charade and has been very unfair.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the rule, ``no'' on the  [[Page H12129]]  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
