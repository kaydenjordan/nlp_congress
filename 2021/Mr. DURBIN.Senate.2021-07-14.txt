 Reserving the right to object.    I read this bill, and I am not sure the Senator from  Indiana really wants to do what this bill says because the bill makes  it a priority that this Agency, Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms--a  priority if there is a request from a licensed manufacturer, importer,  or dealer, a request of the Agency for information questions on  regulatory matters, puts timelines on them, deadlines.   It says that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives--the Attorney General shall--shall--not later than 90 days  after the receipt of such a request or question make a ruling or  determination.   Well, you think to yourself, if this Agency has very little to do  with thousands of employees, then perhaps the timeliness of response  from the industry would merit some 90-day deadline. But the Senator in  introducing this completely overlooks the obvious. This legislation  would force ATF to take resources and manpower away from their other  activities and put them into answering regulatory inquiries with a 90- day deadline in his bill.   So what are the other duties that will be taking the ATF agents away  from? Well, the Senator is from Indiana, my neighboring State, and I am  sure when he goes to northwestern Indiana, he hears a lot about the  city of Chicago. Well, it was last weekend, on the Fourth of July  weekend, that there were 104 people shot in the city of Chicago, 19  died. There were 13 children who were shot and two law enforcement  agents.   What is the responsibility of the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives Bureau when it comes to this kind of mass shooting that is  taking place in the city I am honored to represent but breaks my heart  to hear those numbers?   They are supposed to be investigating the gun violence. They are  supposed to be gathering the information and evidence so they can work  with the prosecutors to stop this mass shooting. Unfortunately, the  Senator from Indiana said, no, that is not your priority at ATF; your  priority is to answer regulatory questions from gun dealers and  manufacturers. And you have 90 days to do it, no matter what else is  going on. Oh, you may be going after somebody who is guilty in a mass  killing and a mass shooting; put it aside. You have a bookkeeping  question. That is one of the provisions in here. You have a bookkeeping  question that should take priority over anything else you are doing.  Stop preparing information and evidence for trial, answer the industry  questions on regulations. That is your highest priority--at least that  is what your bill says.   So I look at this, and I think, in the reality of gun violence and  death and the crimes that are being committed, ATF has the most  important role of keeping us safe. I want them to be efficient in  dealing with the industry. But that is not their highest priority, as  far as I am concerned. The highest priority is to keep America safe and  to do something about gun violence. And for that reason, I object.    Reserving the right to object.    Let me say, initially, I did not mention the issue of the  source of crime guns in Illinois. The Senator from Indiana raised it.  And since he did, I want to make a record of it   When we trace the crime guns in Illinois, we find an alarming  percentage of them coming from gun shows in your State right next to  Illinois. The bad guys get on the Skyway, drive over to northwest  Indiana gun shows and buy guns at those shows without background checks  and come back and commit crime in Chicago and other neighborhoods.   That is a fact. You may not like it; I certainly don't like it. But  we ought to be doing something about that instead of worrying about the  gun manufacturers and the gun salesmen and whether or not they are  going to get special treatment from this Agency.   But let me address the second matter that is before us, and this is  Senator Braun's request for S. 1916, Protecting the Right to Keep and  Bear Arms. I want to set the record straight at the outset. Current  Federal law, the Stafford Act, prohibits the Federal Government from  seizing lawfully owned guns during a period of a major disaster or  emergency. It is on the books. That is the law.   The Stafford Act is also clear that during a major disaster  emergency, the Federal Government is prohibited from creating new  registration requirements for guns, new prohibitions on gun possession,  or new prohibitions on the lawful carrying of firearms. That is on the  books already. So current law already protects guns that people own  legally during periods of disaster or emergency. But the Senator's bill  goes much further than that.   Section 4 of the bill would amend the Stafford Act--get this--to say  that the Federal Government also cannot prohibit the manufacture or  sale or transfer of guns or ammunition during a disaster or emergency.  There are several problems with this.   First, current law has exceptions that allow the government to  continue enforcing laws already on the books during a disaster. This  includes laws that prohibit convicted felons from possessing guns. Your  bill does not make that exception. I am sure you don't want to do that.  I hope you will look at your bill. In other words, under the bill, as I  read it, during a major disaster or emergency, the government would be  barred from any prohibition of gun sales, even from enforcing the  current prohibition on the sale of guns to convicted felons.   That doesn't make sense. I am sure that is not what want you want to  do, but that is what your bill says. I hope it is not what you  intended, and I am sure it is not. So please look at it carefully.   There are also legitimate reasons why the government might need to  temporarily prohibit guns being sold in a disaster area. Here is  something that is not outlandish. Suppose the background check system  has been knocked offline in a disaster area. We wouldn't want felons  taking advantage of that situation to walk into a gun dealer and buy  guns that they are ineligible to buy.   Current law ensures that the government can't take anyone's lawfully  owned guns away from them during a disaster, but there is no clear  justification for granting untouchable status to gun sales during the  disaster. This bill needs some work. I hope we will not pass it in a  hasty manner. And in light of these and other concerns, I object.    Madam President, David Chipman is the nominee for the  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Agency. I know a bit about  him because he went through the Agency process. He is a veteran of over  20 years working for this Agency. We need him. I will tell you why we  need him.   In the history of the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  Agency, there has only been one person who has served--I believe it is  from your State of Minnesota. There is only one person who served as  the confirmed Director of the Agency. Otherwise, over and over again,  it goes without any leadership. You say: Well, is that just an accident  that this Agency never has a Director? I don't think it is an accident  at all.   You see, the gun lobby, when they want to make their case against new  gun laws, always say the same thing: ``Well, just enforce the laws on  the books. You don't need new laws. Enforce the laws on the books.''   If you bought that premise, then the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives Agency is one of the agencies that does that. So if you can  weaken this Agency--fewer agents, fewer employees, fewer supervisors,  no Director--then the actual enforcement that is being done by this  Agency is diminished.   So, now, President Biden brings us Mr. Chipman. There are two parts  of his career that should be noted: Over 20 years at ATF, involved in  some of the most serious investigations, and did an incredible job.  After he left the ATF, he went to work for a gun safety group. He is  the first one to tell you: ``I own a gun, and I respect your Second  Amendment rights and my Second Amendment rights, but I don't want guns  to get into the hands of the wrong people, and that is how I would run  the ATF.''   I think that reflects what the majority of Americans think. Second  Amendment rights--I honor them, I respect them, they are in the law,  decided by the Supreme Court in the Heller decision, but when it comes  to guns--and I look at the wanton violence taking place. I don't want  guns getting into the hands of convicted felons. No, I don't. I don't  think they have any Second Amendment right, neither does David Chipman.  But the people behind the gun lobby, gun industry don't want an Agency  that actually enforces those laws. They really don't. And so they are  trying to stop his nomination.   It may be controversial, but I hope he gets this job. I am going to  vote for him.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this morning, our friends in Europe  claimed first place in the race against climate change. The European  Union has laid out a plan to decarbonize Europe and reduce greenhouse  gas emissions by 55 percent at the end of this decade. It is an  ambitious plan, and it is one that will, in the words of EU climate  policy chief Frans Timmermans, ``give humanity a fighting chance.''   To our allies in Europe, I want to say: America stands with you in  this effort, and we welcome the friendly competition to see who can  move quickest to save our planet.   Earlier today, President Biden joined members of the Senate  Democratic caucus to discuss our historic budget proposal that was  unveiled last night. It is a proposal designed, first and foremost, to  help working families and secondly--and not a distant second, right up  with that--to secure our planet's future.   Climate change impacts every single one of us. It doesn't care about  our borders or national identities. It does present an opportunity for  us to lead the world in saving this planet, literally, for our kids and  grandkids.   I am glad we have a President who understands this issue. The budget  resolution we discussed with him today will pave the way for that to  happen.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2349         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers from       Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.         Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1631 et       seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 140B.
