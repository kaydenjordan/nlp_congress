 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.  As Chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies subcommittee I am pleased to  highlight the national priorities funded in our division which impacts  the lives of all Americans from heartland to coast, farms to cities,  and everything in between.   First, our bill makes important, USDA-wide investments to ensure  equitable participation in USDA programs, address the impacts of  climate change, and support staff and leadership offices at USDA.  [[Page H1412]]    The bill includes over $550 million for the expansion of broadband  service, including $450 million for the Reconnect program.   Our bill fully funds all the domestic nutrition programs and includes  a significant investment to increase the amounts of fruits and  vegetables offered in the WIC program. Additionally, there is $2  billion for international food aid.   The bill provides $1.87 billion for farm programs, including $61  million in loan authority to address heirs property issues.   The bill includes $3.5 billion for agriculture research programs,  including the Agricultural Research Service and the National Institute  of Food and Agriculture to keep American agriculture the best and most  bountiful in the world.   The bill includes a total of $3.3 billion for FDA and provides  targeted increases to ensure Americans have access to the safest food  and medicine.   This is a good bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.   I want to thank our Ranking Member, Andy Harris, and the majority and  minority committee staff.   I also want to thank Chair DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger for  their leadership through this process.
