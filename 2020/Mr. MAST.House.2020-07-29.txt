 Mr. Speaker, I rise also, today, in support of the Water  Resources and Development Act of 2020. This piece of legislation is a  top priority for my constituents in south Florida on the Treasure Coast  because it is critical to our public health, our environment, and our  economy.   Now, I am smiling because this legislation includes a number of  provisions that I was proud to write to protect Florida's waterways,  including accelerating construction of the EAA reservoir, reducing  discharges from Lake Okeechobee to the St. Lucie Estuary, and to combat  harmful algal blooms--all yeomen's work.   Now, demanding that the Army Corps of Engineers must seek to reduce  discharges into our coastal estuaries is a huge victory that everybody  in our community should be proud of.   However, I ask my colleagues this: If their constituents were being,  literally, poisoned by the Federal Government, would they fight for  anything less than a complete stop to that poisoning?   That is why I am going to continue to be in this fight with  everything that I have got, build on this momentum to eliminate all  toxic discharges into my community and send more water south into  Florida's Everglades.
