 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Simpson County  Historical Society and its long-reaching influence on Simpson County  and the surrounding communities.   Since its founding in 1959, Simpson County Historical Society has  been a valuable asset to the First District of Kentucky. Through the  collection and preservation of historical property and genealogical  records, the society has been able to maintain an extensive archive for  the benefit of future generations.   I applaud the work the society has done over the last 60 years, and I  am pleased to say that, as of Thursday, September 12, they will have  expanded to a newer, larger facility enabling them to increase their  research capabilities and broaden their effect on local education and  cultural development.   I join with the residents of Simpson County and the local community,  as well as those who have benefited from the work of the Simpson County  Historical Society, in honoring their incredible dedication to the  preservation and promotion of history. I wish the historical society  the best as they begin a new phase of their own history and express my  gratitude for their service to the First District of Kentucky.                            ____________________
