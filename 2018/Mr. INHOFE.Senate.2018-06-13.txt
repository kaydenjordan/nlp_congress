 Mr. President, I couldn't have said it as well as the  Senator from Missouri. This is the John S. McCain reauthorization bill  and obviously he is deserving of much more than that.                              Amendment No. 2842    Since we are going to have the votes in just a few minutes--two  votes--let me make a couple of comments, and then I will yield to the  Senator from Rhode Island. I believe the first vote we are going to  have is going to be the Reed amendment, and I do oppose it. This  amendment would require congressional authorization for the development  of nuclear weapons for one simple reason we already require. Congress  is already required to authorize the development of nuclear weapons in  each year's authorization and appropriations bill.   The debate is not really about the authorization; it is about the  ``Nuclear Posture Review.'' The ``Nuclear Posture Review'' calls for  the United States to develop a low-yield nuclear capability, which some  in Congress are against. That is fine. That is what this vote is on. We  should debate it. We have debated it in the past, certainly in our  committee we have, and that is the reason it is on the committee and  would have to be taken off on the floor, if that is the desire of the  majority of Members. That is not my desire. That is what we did.   The Armed Services Committee considered an amendment to limit low- yield authorization, debate its merits, and voted it down by a  bipartisan vote of 16 to 11. There is certainly support for it.   Let's be clear. The purpose of developing the low-yield capability is  the same as our entire nuclear enterprise--deterrence. According to the  NPR, Russia believes we have a gap in our nuclear capability because we  have no low-yield nuclear warheads. As a result, they may perceive that  limited nuclear first use, including low-yield weapons, would present  the United States with two bad choices in response: escalate or do  nothing. Since neither response would be acceptable, Russia may see  this as an opportunity to gain strategic advantage through the use of  nuclear weapons. We must correct this Russian misconception.   Simply put, the NDAA authorizes the development of low-yield  capability to make nuclear use less likely, to preserve and enhance  deterrence. That is what this is all about. I heard arguments--and we  debated this for many hours in the committee, and it is one that I  think we ought to have every capability the Russians have, and of  course we will not have that unless we have the low-yield capability. I  would hate to have our country in a position where the only choice we  have is to do nothing or to use the high-yield equipment that we don't  want to use.   I will save my remarks on the next amendment, the Lee amendment,  until after this so we can give Senator Reed the opportunity to visit  about his amendment.    In just a moment, it is my intention to table the Reed  amendment. I want to say this. This is the way things should work. We  have debated this. We have debated it in committee. I have heard his  very logical remarks and positions, and he has heard mine. We have an  honest disagreement, and I think this is a better example than some of  the things we heard recently from some of our colleagues.    Mr. President, I move to table Reed amendment No. 2842  and ask for the yeas and nays.    I move to table Lee amendment No. 2366 and ask for the  yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is my intent--and I will be doing it-- but I want to give a chance for Senator Paul to be on the floor when I  do this.   As we have said over and over again, Senator Reed and I have worked  very closely in trying to get these amendments in place. I can remember  in  [[Page S3896]]  years past, when there were people who objected to any amendments, we  ended up without amendments, so we had to pass a bill that didn't have  an open amendment process on the floor.   We wanted an open amendment process on the floor. I am talking about  ``we'' being the Democrats, Republicans, and the leadership on both  sides of the aisle. We have committed to that. We have tried to do  that.   Unfortunately, under Senate rules, one Senator can stop and object to  moving on an amendment. If that happens and continues, the same thing  will happen. I can remember four times in the past when we ended up  without any amendments at all because one person objected.   It is our intent to open it up so that people can offer their  amendments, vote them down, vote them up--whatever we want to do.   Right now, we have several amendments, and I would like to make a  motion to adopt them en bloc. These amendments are amendments that have  been cleared on both sides. There are 10 of them. All 10 are germane  amendments.   They are Ernst amendment No. 2289, Schatz No. 2441, Bennet No. 2617,  Shaheen No. 2686, Heitkamp No. 2695, Lee No. 2723, Hatch No. 2755, Cruz  No. 2598, and Tester No. 2818.   These 10 amendments are all germane. They cleared on both sides.   I ask unanimous consent that these amendments be called up en bloc.    Mr. President, I do regret this.   Let me repeat what was just objected to. There are 10 amendments that  are cleared on both sides. Democrats are all for them. Republicans are  all for them. I suggest the junior Senator from Kentucky is for all  these amendments too.   If we don't have these amendments, what amendments will we have? What  good does it do to offer an objection to these amendments that are all  germane just because he is upset with some senior Senator from another  State?   I am thinking now: Where do we go from here? I am going to offer  another bloc of votes as soon as we have some that are all germane and  agreed to on both sides. When that happens, I am hoping there will not  be an objection. I am hoping to break this logjam.   If not, then what is going to happen is that we are going to end up  voting for this bill. We know it is going to pass. It has passed for 57  consecutive years. It is going to pass, but it will pass without the  amendments of those individuals who have wanted an open amendment  process, which I have wanted, which my Democratic colleague has wanted,  and we have made that effort for a long period of time.   I am concerned. I think that it could end up that we will have--it is  not as if we haven't had amendments. In our committee, we had some 300  amendments that we actually considered. We went through the amendment  process. We have had a lot of input from other Members, but again, we  are committed to an open amendment process. So far, it looks as if we  are not going to get it.   I just ask that whatever is causing my good friend from Kentucky to  object to these amendments will be satisfied by some change. If he  wants a vote on his amendment, let him go and pursue it. I hate to hold  this bill hostage.   I just got back from being with our troops all over the world. I was  in CENTCOM, in EUCOM, in AFRICOM, talking to our troops who are over  there. They know that their pay raise is in this bill. Their benefits  are in there. This is one thing we need to do.   If there is one thing that needs to be done, it is this bill. I think  maybe there is something wrong with a system that says: If I can't have  my way to get a vote on my amendment, I am going to kill everybody  else's amendments. That is what I am afraid may be happening now.   I am hoping my friend from Kentucky will reconsider and allow us to  adopt amendments. It has nothing to do with an amendment the Senator  from Kentucky has.
