 Madam Speaker, this month marks 1 year since the Trump  administration negotiated the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.   USMCA is undoubtedly a win for Missourians and for all Americans. The  agreement will bring 176,000 new jobs and will spur $63 billion in new  economic activity.   Benefits of USMCA will be felt across diverse industries, including  many of our manufacturing industries, agriculture, and small  businesses, while also supporting technology and innovation.   But month after month, this Congress has been subject to missed  opportunities for our producers and consumers as we have been refused  the chance to vote on the USMCA. This needs to change.   Instead of House leaders squandering precious legislative time  bringing up impeachment inquiries, they should be bringing up USMCA for  a vote.   Let us hope that we get this opportunity soon. That would be a  positive win for all Americans.                            ____________________
