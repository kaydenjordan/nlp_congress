 Mr. Speaker, my, my, my, here we go again,  Republicans playing politics with deeply personal healthcare decisions  that belong between women and their physicians.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is not going to save  lives. It is going to wrench us back to the dark days of coat hanger  medicine where women were killed and maimed in back alleys.   This legislation has one aim: intimidate good and decent doctors;  threaten them with imprisonment if they dare to perform a legal  abortion, exercising their own medical judgment and with the consent of  their patient.   I strongly oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the women of this country are watching. We will not go  back.
