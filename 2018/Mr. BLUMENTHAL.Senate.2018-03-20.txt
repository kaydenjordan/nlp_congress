 Mr. President, at the very start, I am grateful, and  I praise my cosponsor, Senator Portman, who has helped to lead in the  championing of this measure. He has really been steadfast in the face  of a lot of challenges. It was a difficult bill to draft and then to  redraft and change again in response to suggestions that we received  from friends and adversaries, but Senator Portman has been really  stalwart throughout it.   I join him in thanking our partners, Senator McCaskill, Senator  McCain, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Cornyn, and, of course, Senator  Thune, who is the chairman of the committee, and Ranking Member Nelson.   This road began for me more than 10 years ago when I was the State  attorney general in Connecticut, and I wanted to pursue legal remedies  against the websites. Back then, it was craigslist or MySpace that  promoted sex trafficking and prostitution as well as pornography. My  staff informed me that there was a provision of Federal law--section  230 of the Communications Decency Act--that would stop me in my tracks.  Indeed, it has stopped others, most recently some of the survivors of  sex trafficking who were told by a Federal court of appeals, in effect,  that what happened to you is outrageous, and there should be a remedy  for you, but section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks your  day in court. It closes the courthouse doors to you in your seeking a  legal remedy.   Along the way, there were many who said to Senator Portman and to me  that we could never pass this legislation because it would hold  trafficking websites accountable. They said the opponents of this  change were too powerful, too big, too entrenched. They said the  victims and survivors were too powerless, too invisible.   We have met them. We know their stories. They are heartbreaking. They  are children--some younger than the pages in this Chamber today--who  have endured torture that is unspeakable and unthinkable for anyone of  any age, and they deserve their day in court, rights, and remedies-- real remedies that make the rights real.   So I thank Senator Portman, and I thank, as he has also done, those  survivors who have come forward and been the faces and voices of our  cause. Their courage and strength and that of their family members have  enabled us to reach this point.   I emphasize that this measure is very carefully and narrowly written  to address a specific harm, and I want to take a couple of minutes to  correct any misunderstanding that there may be in this Chamber.   First, some of the legislation's critics have claimed it will impose  liability on the so-called Good Samaritan. In reality, this bill  explicitly preserves subsection 230(c)(2)(A) of the Communications  Decency Act, commonly called the Good Samaritan provision. This  provision ensures that websites cannot be held liable on account of  actions taken in good faith to restrict objectionable material. SESTA  is crystal clear on this point. A website operator's good deeds cannot  be used against him.   This measure is also technology neutral. It imposes no requirement  that website operators use a particular technology to screen their  sites for objectionable content. They are free to use whatever  technology they wish. That is why the Internet Association and its  member companies support this legislation. They know that if technology  companies work to prevent human trafficking and not to profit from it,  they have nothing to fear from this measure.   I understand that an amendment has been offered to restate SESTA's  Good Samaritan provision. Even if the amendment only protected Good  Samaritans, it would be unnecessary and potentially confusing to the  courts. I emphasize that point. It would obfuscate and confuse the good  intent of the Good Samaritan provision. It would also derail this  widely popular legislation by sending it back to the House, where  special interests will have another chance to kill it. Unfortunately,  this proposed amendment--perhaps unintentionally--would not simply  protect Good Samaritans; it would also protect websites that operate in  bad faith. It would also protect websites that identify sex trafficking  ads and then leave them up in order to continue profiting from them.   I will briefly talk about one other amendment that has been offered-- again, while being well-intentioned--that threatens to derail this  legislation.   The amendment would provide additional money to Attorney General  Sessions to investigate and prosecute websites that criminally  facilitate human trafficking. I believe law enforcement ought to have  additional resources. I firmly support more funding to investigate and  prosecute this criminal activity, but this bill is not the means by  which to do it.   In fact, law enforcement and the community against human trafficking  are strongly against these amendments. Let me repeat. These law  enforcement groups include the Fraternal Order of Police, the  Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies, the FBI Agents  Association, and I could go down the list. In fact, there is no need  to.   I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these groups be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                             National Fraternal Order of Police,                                      Washigton, DC, March 19, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators McConnell and Schumer: I am writing on behalf       of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you       of our strong support for H.R 1865, the ``Allow States and       Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,'' which includes       language from S. 1693, the ``Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers       Act,'' which the FOP also supports.        This legislation will allow law enforcement to investigate       and prosecute individuals and businesses that advertise or       facilitate sex trafficking more effectively. The bill will       create a new Federal offense prohibiting the use or operation       of an instate facility, like a website, that promotes or       facilitates illegal prostitution.        The FOP is opposed to the two pending amendments because       they may have the unintended consequence of derailing this       important legislation. Amendments to this bill will only       continue to deprive the survivors and victims of sex       trafficking of getting justice.        On behalf of the more than 335,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, we urge you both to pass this legislation       without any amendments on the Senate floor. If we can be of       any additional assistance, please do not hesitate to contact       me or my Senior Advisor, Jim Pasco, in my Washington office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                                                     March 19, 2018.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader       Schumer: We, the undersigned organizations, representing       prosecutors, chiefs of police, sheriffs, rank and file       officers and chief executives of state investigative agencies       at the federal, state, and local level, write to urge a clean       vote this week in the Senate on the House-passed FOSTA/SESTA       package so that victims and federal and state law enforcement       can better seek to hold all responsible parties accountable       for the facilitation of sex trafficking. At the same time, we       urge you to reject the proposed amendment that would create a       shield for companies vaguely attempting to filter content on       their websites and the proposed amendment that would provide       additional funding through the Department of Justice to       investigate and prosecute website operators that criminally       facilitate sex trafficking. Simply put, the amendment to       create a liability shield is bad public policy and the       funding amendment is a poison pill that is dead on arrival if       sent back to the House.        As membership organizations charged with protecting our       communities, we can't afford to sacrifice the opportunity to       pass good public policy to hold facilitators of sex       trafficking accountable. Through extensive discussions over       the past couple of years, a delicate balance has been struck       among a wide variety of stakeholders to achieve the       legislation pending before the Senate. The House passed       version, which included language from the Senate SESTA       version, was a carefully crafted piece of legislation to help       state and local law enforcement bring more of these sex       trafficking cases forward and we  [[Page S1830]]       encourage you to provide us with the tools needed to achieve       that goal.            Sincerely,        Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies;        FBI Agents Association;        Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;        International Association of Chiefs of Police;        Major Cities Chiefs Association;        Major County Sheriffs of America;        National Association of Police Organizations;        National District Attorneys Association;        National Fusion Center Association;        National Sheriffs' Association.                                   ____     Mr. President, my colleagues should take heed of what  these groups are saying because they see through the potentially  derailing impact of these amendments.   I close by again thanking my friend and partner, Senator Portman, as  well as Senator McCaskill, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Cornyn, and  Senator McCain.   This measure is truly bipartisan, as it should be. There is nothing  partisan about sex trafficking. There is nothing excusable or tolerable  about it. I hope the Senate will do its job tomorrow and send this  legislation to the President's desk.   I yield the floor to my partner, Senator Portman, with my thanks.
