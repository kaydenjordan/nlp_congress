 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, like many of us this past Saturday, I marched in  Washington with millions of women across the country claiming their  human rights and claiming their basic individuals rights. Madam  Speaker, the previous speaker on the other side made mention of the  fact that the Hyde amendment is the law of the land and that it has  been upheld by the United States Supreme Court. We know. We get it.  That is not what this is about.   This is about going well beyond that and actually limiting what women  can do and what individuals can do with their own money when acquiring  health care that includes the reproductive health services that are the  subject of this debate.   How many times do we have to come to the floor to make the point that  choices about women's health care should be made between a woman and  her doctor, not somebody in Washington dictating to women what they can  do with their own money and with their own bodies?   Do you know what else is the law of the land? Do you know what else  has been upheld by the Supreme Court almost a half a century ago?   That fundamental right that women have over the determinations they  make for themselves about their own bodies. That has been upheld by the  United States Supreme Court as well.
