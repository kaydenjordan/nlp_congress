 Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to start  debate on what is called the Congressional Review Act of the stream  protection rule. For people who are probably saying ``I don't  understand any of that; could you explain it to me?'' what we are going  to do tonight is to start this debate, which is really about clean  water, and it is about making sure that polluters clean up their  messes, particularly when it comes to streams and the beauty we have in  our country that is used by many people. And it is about making sure  that rules for polluters paying are enforced in law and, clearly,  agencies which have developed those rules in conjunction with laws that  are already on the books continue to have those laws in effect.   We are in a new administration, and already the debate is starting  where people would like this end result to be clean water, 0; Donald  Trump, the new President, 1. That is because this administration is  starting a war on clean water, and tonight that debate is coming to the  Senate floor. It is coming to the Senate floor because the last  administration worked for more than 5 years on producing something to  make sure that we had safe drinking water and safe stream water for  fishing and to make sure that industries that are known for polluting  ensure that their level of pollution is cleaned up.   After more than 5 years in the implementation of that rule, after  thousands and thousands of hours of discussion and debate, as it has  become a rule, now there is one thing that can stop it. There is one  thing that can stop it; that is, if Congress uses its authority under  the Congressional Review Act to repeal it within the 60 days of  legislative action that it has become effective.  [[Page S564]]    What is happening is that the Trump administration and our colleagues  on the other side of the aisle are trying to say that we want to repeal  more than 5 years of hard work of clearly outlining a stream protection  rule to protect streams in the United States of America from pollution  caused by certain types of mining activity.   Let me show you a picture of what I am talking about. This stream  could be anywhere in America. It could be anywhere in the United States  of America. It is probably a good picture. Why? Because it shows the  great outdoors. Probably for me, it is somewhere I would like to hike.  It shows a stream, but it shows the degradation of that stream with the  pollution in the stream.   Whether you are Trout Unlimited, which supported this rule, or you  are the Wilderness Society, or all the hunting and fishing groups that  supported this rule, or you are just one of the many citizens in a  State where mining exists and you are happy that it exists there but  you also want them to be clean up their messes--these are the people  who do not want to see this level of degradation in the streams.   Why don't they want to see it? Because first and foremost they  obviously don't want to see it, but if you are a fisherman and you are  out fishing, you certainly don't want to see the impacts that selenium  is causing on fish.   There are a couple of incidents here where the impacts of selenium on  fish are shown in this diagram. Deformation both here in the tail and  here in the mouth of fish are impacts from selenium in streams. We do  not want to see selenium having that kind of impact on our fish.   What do we want to do? We want to make sure that we are measuring  selenium in the streams and that we are cleaning it up. That is what we  want to do. The notion that somehow people have described a rule for  stream protection that is about having safe drinking water and having  safe fishing water is about a ``war on coal'' is just wrongheaded. This  is about making sure that we don't overturn something that took over 5  years to get in place. And I should say, it is the first time in 33  years that we have updated this rule.   For 33 years, the Department of the Interior has said that the  hydraulic impact of mining on a stream should be mitigated. What has  changed in the last 33 years is that we now have better technology and  we have more information about selenium. We know that it impacts fish,  and we want mining companies to measure their impacts on headwaters and  make sure they are doing something to minimize this selenium impact.   I know people think that maybe in this process for 5 years--somehow  that created a decrease in the amount of coal in the United States of  America, even though the rule was just getting started. Let's look at  the real issue. The real issue is that natural gas becoming cheaper in  the United States of America has pushed down the demand for purchasing  coal, a more expensive product that had nothing do with this rule.   I have been in business and, yes, you plan for the future. And if you  think your business is going to have to increase its insurance or  change its business practices, yes, you consider all of that, but this  chart clearly shows that our electricity grid has gone from having 50  percent of it supplied by coal now down--as this line is crossing  here--to about 30 percent of our electricity grid from coal.   This rule was not in place. Saying that you want to have safe  drinking water has nothing to do with what has happened in the  marketplace as natural gas has become a more viable option than coal.  This chart shows it.   We have another chart that also shows this 23-percent decline in  coal. Why? Again, because of natural gas consumption going up. For  those on the other side who would like to say this is somehow about a  war on coal, I will tell you, we should not denigrate anybody for the  job that they have done to support their families. In fact, I believe  we should make sure they have a pension, make sure they have health  care.   It is a tragedy that we bailed out Wall Street from the U.S.  Treasury, and as pension programs all across America imploded, nobody  wanted to bail out the pension program for miners so they could retire  with the kinds of health benefits that other people do. If we want to  help individuals who are suffering in coal country, I suggest that we  take care of their pensions.   In the meantime, what we should do is make sure we are preparing for  the health and safety of people who depend on these streams for  multiple uses; that is to say, there are those in an outdoor economy  who count just as much on those streams and count on them not being  polluted because of certain mining activities.   This chart can be shown in just about every State of the United  States. The outdoor economy in our States--the people who like to go  fishing, the people who like to go hunting, the people who like to  navigate our rivers and want to do so when they are not polluted--is  6.1 million direct jobs in the United States. That basically dwarfs the  coal industry.   This isn't about saying one job is better than the other, but the  notion that somehow we are hurting our economy because we want to have  clean streams and we want people to be able to safely catch fish  without selenium in them is basically ignoring the facts. By not  regulating the coal industry to make sure they are cleaning up their  mess, you are hurting the 6.1 million jobs that depend on having clean  streams.   I know people here probably understand that Montana is full of  streams. That movie, ``A River Runs Through It,'' is iconic in the  Northwest as an example of why people love the outdoors because they  want to fish. They want the experience of going and being outdoors and  having the wonder of that.   I personally have been in the streams of West Virginia and have had a  fabulous time. I want other people to understand that these streams are  worth protecting all over the United States of America. But the movie  is not called ``A River Runs Through It and a Mine Sits on Top of It.''  We don't have people moving to Montana and buying ranches, making  investments, hiring people, and diversifying because they want to see  the mines in Montana. They want to see the beauty of the outdoors. They  want it to be pure and pristine, and they want people to clean up their  pollution. If we are talking about an economy and you want to talk  about jobs, do not ruin the $80 billion in tax revenue that comes from  an outdoor industry because you want to allow an industry to continue  to pollute.   I am going to continue for the next year to make this point to my  colleagues in the West who are going to try to overturn every rule they  don't like because they think somehow that they want to claim it  impacts jobs. We are going to have this discussion, and we are going to  show that the outdoor economy is just as important and is actually  producing more jobs and producing more revenue. The only point of  conflict, I think, is when one impacts the other to the degree of  creating pollution and then taking a beautiful stream away from us-- because no one wants to fish in a stream with that level of pollution.   Why are we here? We are here because certain types of mining-- particularly, mountaintop removal mining--make it way more challenging  to protect those streams. As I mentioned, for the last several years,  people have been discussing what to do to make sure that these  companies are making sure the environmental impacts are minimized. The  production of these mines has actually fallen a great degree in the  last several years.   We have been working, as I said, during this time period to make sure  that we implement the right kind of regulations so that people will  clean up this mess. As I mentioned, it has been basically since the  early eighties until this level of attention was given to a new rule.  Why do we want to change a rule that was from 1983? Because it says  that you must minimize the disturbances to the prevailing hydraulic  balance at the mine site and offer areas and quality of water and  ground water systems, both during and after the mining operations.   President Trump did not invent that. That has been in law all along.  The notion that somehow that has changed is not correct. It has been in  the opening days of the Trump administration that people are trying to  say that stewardship doesn't matter, that somehow, yes, we want to have  immaculate water  [[Page S565]]  and immaculate air--as President Trump said--but it is OK if  regulations cause a problem for business. What business? The outdoor  industry or the coal industry? Because right now, you are talking about  making a change to what is protection of those streams and repealing a  law that is about safe drinking water. We don't want to eliminate that.   We want to make sure that we use the best technology available to  minimize the disturbances, address the impacts on fish and wildlife,  and any other related environmental issues. We know a lot more about  mining and fishing. As I showed you one picture, I will show you  another impact of selenium. Basically, it is showing the deformation.  What we now know much more about is how selenium does impact these  areas.   What is at stake if you kill the stream protection rule? Our  sportsmen--groups like the National Wildlife Federation and Trout  Unlimited--say this:         The resolution is an ill-conceived tool for jettisoning a       very useful rule that protects mountain head water streams       and communities throughout the coal country in Appalachia. We       urge you to oppose striking this rule, and to instead work       with the Department of Interior to protect these streams, and       make necessary improvements to improve the CRA, instead of       using it as a cleaver.    They go on to say:         150,000 passionate trout anglers work to conserve, protect       and restore our Nation's trout and salmon fisheries and their       watersheds. And our members give back to the resources they       love by investing dollars and hundreds of thousands of       volunteer hours to conserve streams.    So you can see that they feel passionately about this. They feel  passionately because this is part of our outdoor economy and what  people have passion about.   In my State, people would say: Well, you have these other jobs. No,  actually, in our State, there are 250 abandoned mines in Washington.  Yes, if we don't clean them up, and if we don't make sure there is  reclamation, there is still pollution.   We have had a mine history in our State, but we want responsible  mining and we want responsible cleanup. With today's rule that is in  place and that you are trying to repeal--to repeal safe drinking water,  basically--that would take those tools away and allow pollution to  continue. What is the cost of that? It is very small. You would think  that the way some people go on about this, that somehow this is  astronomical amounts of money. Basically, it is about 0.1 percent of  the industry's annual revenue. When you are in business, you think  about your costs. You think about your cost of doing business. Yes, the  cost of doing business has to include making sure that you clean up  pollution. To me, this is an industry that makes way more than this in  its annual revenue.   Am I empathetic to my colleagues who represent States that are  changing in their energy mix and resources? Do you think we need to  have a plan for that? Yes. Do I think we need to have a plan for how we  are going to diversify? Yes, I do. But this is not an economic debate  about how we are going to save jobs. In reality, as I showed in the  chart before, the natural gas prices are driving coal to a much lower  level of our electricity grid than ever before in our history, and that  is not going to change.   Let's make sure we clean up our streams. Let's make sure we use the  best technology available to make sure we are detecting that pollution  and require people to have a minimal amount of responsibility in the  cost of what it takes to make sure that selenium is not in drinking  water or impacting our fish.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.                           Spirit of Bipartisanship     Mr. President, I know my colleague from Oregon is  around somewhere and wanted to speak on this rule, and when he shows up  on the floor, we will certainly give him the time to do so. I want to  make a couple of points while we are waiting for him.   First, in this discussion here with my colleagues, there is some  discussion and I guess the start of what will be a continuing theme  that somehow, if you get rid of regulations, we are going to restore  competitiveness to the U.S. economy. Nothing could be further from the  truth.   If you ask businesses what we need to do to be competitive as a  country, they will say: Make sure we have a great education system.  Make sure we invest in R&D. Let's develop new technology.   If we look at where businesses are locating, they want to locate in  beautiful, pristine places because they know that is where their  employees will want to locate. So, first of all, that somehow the  government is going to restore the economy by deregulating and letting  polluters pollute is just not correct. It is not what America wants.  What people want is to have safe drinking water, and they want an  outdoor economy that is supported by having a great environment.    So I want to say a couple of other things. Obviously, this rule that  we are talking about and that has been developed over a long period of  time is an  [[Page S571]]  improvement over the 1983 rule because it gives us a better idea on the  pollution that is happening. Now, if people don't want to know that  information, I guess that is OK. The court, counter to what my  colleague from West Virginia said, did not say that it was suspending  the rule. It said that it was still in effect, that the pollution had  to be cleaned up. It said: Come back and look at the economic impact.  But somehow, some are saying that the Supreme Court decision on the  MATS rule gave EPA and others a get-out-of-jail-free card; you don't  have to look at pollutants. They have to look at pollutants.   So what is this issue about? It is about clean water.   Mr. President, I wish to enter into the Record a couple of articles  that I have seen from constituents. My colleague from West Virginia  mentioned a few people. These are the real people in America who want  this.   One of them is a gentleman named Ben Kurtz, who happens to be from  Grand Junction, CO. This is what he says:         It's often said that drag is a fly fisherman's greatest       enemy. The truth, however, is that a wet fly or heavy drag is       irrelevant if you don't have clean water to fish. Our lakes,       rivers, streams and the fish that inhabit them are all       extremely sensitive to pollution. And right now, many of       these streams all across our country are being threatened by       dirty groundwater stemming from coal mines.        Despite this, it's been nearly a decade since the       Department of Interior has updated its Stream Protection       Rule--an inadequate, Reagan-era regulation governing impacts       to waterways from coal mining which was weakened even further       under the Bush administration.        For the last six years, DOI has been engaged in the process       of updating and gathering input on the rule, with the       ultimate goal of revising it to make it more effective, in       line with the challenges our waters face today as well as the       law Congress passed in the 1970s to create it. While it has       been a long time coming, that process now appears to be       coming to a close.        Once finalized, the revised rule would establish common-      sense new protections that would safeguard the health of our       waterways, and by extension, the communities that are       impacted by them. For example, the rule would strengthen       baseline requirements for water quality testing to ensure       that coal mining operations are not polluting streams in a       manner similar to that of the old hardrock mines throughout       the West.        In addition, the revised standards would require coal mines       to develop a plan for how to protect fish and wildlife while       also putting in place measures that will reduce impacts on       habitats and improve reclamation of mines that have       shuttered.    I mentioned earlier as a side note to this letter that we have 250  such mines in our State.         These proposed changes are just common sense: The rule is       low-cost (independent analysts have calculated that the       safeguards would cost between 1 and 60 cents per ton of coal       that's mined) and while the revisions are expected to result       in cleaner waters and improved public health, its impact on       jobs will be slim to none.        Still, the issuing of a strong final Stream Protection Rule       is not a foregone conclusion, as the coal industry is intent       on maintaining the status quo. Were that to transpire it       would mean streams that are at greater risk of being polluted       with coal mine waste and runoff.        Taking all of this into account, it's clear that whether       you're a fly fisherman or not, the revised rule is something       we should all support. Cleaner waters not only mean better       fishing but cleaner and healthier communities too.        Speaking on behalf of my fellow fly fishermen, I applaud       the Department of the Interior for its ongoing efforts to       enact sensible safeguards that protect the federal lands we       all support and enjoy. It's time for DOI to push the Stream       Protection Rule update across the finish line so we       fishermen--    Obviously, this letter was written before that--       can go back to worrying about the little things--like what       color fly to cast--rather than fretting over groundwater       pollution that threatens our vibrant ecosystems and       jeopardizes our health.    Well, I think Mr. Kurtz said it the best.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           Protection for Our Rivers and Streams Is Long Overdue                               (By Ben Kurtz)         It's often said that drag is a fly fisherman's greatest       enemy. The truth, however, is that a wet fly or heavy drag is       irrelevant if you don't have clean water to fish. Our lakes,       rivers, streams and the fish that inhabit them are all       extremely sensitive to pollution.

For the last six years, DOT has been engaged in the process       of updating and gathering input on the rule, with the       ultimate goal of revising it to make it more effective, in       line with the challenges our waters face today as well as the       law Congress passed in the 1970s to create it.

Cleaner waters not only mean better       fishing but cleaner and healthier communities too.

Mr. President, I can read others, but these are the  people who are concerned about this rule. These are the individuals who  want to know whether we are going to do our job and to say that  polluters must pay. I believe that if we have the technology and the  rules to do that, why would miners object? Why would the mining  industry object to having the correct information?   I will read another letter from a Montana rancher this time.         As a long-time rancher of north of Billings, water supply       has been a 70-year-old struggle for my ranch. The coal       industry has posted a threat to my water supply since the       1970s, and more recently increased mining, spurred by fast-      growing markets and the export to Asia, which has sparked       water damage across the West. The limited water we are       talking about in the West makes it doubly valuable and in       need of protection. As the saying goes: ``Whiskey is for       drinking and water is for fighting.'' So it is absolutely       essential that we protect the water we have, and sometimes       that means a stronger rule from the Federal Government.        Most cattle ranchers in the Bull Mountains where I live       rely on a combination of wells and natural springs to water       our livestock. And like other nearby operations, my ranch is       currently being literally undermined by coal mines using       massive and destructive long wall machines that make it       difficult for efficient mining because of surface       disruptions, impairing coal aquifers, subsiding recharge       areas, and they pull surface streams underground. I can think       of no industry that degrades water in such a reckless and       cavalier way as the coal industry. From acid mine drainage       and thousands of mines' buried headwaters across Appalachia,       to eating streams on the prairie that are destroying wells       and springs in Montana's Bull Mountain.        While Montana surface mining laws require reclamation of       the area over long mines, reclamation is a slow and uncertain       process, and water in the existing mines in Montana has not       been reclaimed, according to the bond-released statistics.       These proposals for mining are to be included along these       rivers and even moving along tributaries, to get it out of       the way of coal mining. In Wyoming, Angelo Creek is slowly       being eaten by a coal mine. With all of it as a backdrop, I       am happy to see the proposal by the Department of the       Interior to update this regulation put in place over 30 years       ago.  [[Page S572]]         So the proposed Stream Protection Rule would safeguard       communities from destructive coal mining practices and keep       pace with our current science and modern mining practices.       These new rules would minimize impacts to surface and       groundwater such as springs on my property by requiring       companies to avoid mining practices that permanently pollute       and diminish streams, requiring coal companies to test and       monitor the conditions of streams that their mining might       impact before and during and after operations.        The proposed rule would also require companies to restore       streams and other waters that they were using and that were       capable of supporting, like in the ranching area, prior to       the mining activities. The Department of the Interior could       also improve parts of the stream protection rule by providing       technical assistance.        It is very well to have good standards and test these out       in rules, but if they are poorly implemented on the ground       and over time, the results will be like no rule. So the       Interior Department's work to update and modernize these       decade-old rules and regulations is absolutely essential if       we are going to keep a bad situation from getting worse.       Clean water in the West is too precious to let coal companies       pollute it or diminish it.    This happens to be from a woman named Ellen Pfister who has a cattle  ranch in the Bull Mountains area of Shepherd, MT.   So these are just two examples of people who really want to see us do  something. Why? Because clean water is so important to them. It is so  important to the outdoor economy, and it is important to this  particular rancher who wants to make sure that clean water is an aspect  of their farming.   There are a couple of other points I wanted to make about the rule  and this notion that somehow overregulation has destroyed the pension  program. It is so amazing that here in the Senate, somebody thinks that  overregulation could blow that big of a hole into the pension program.  The pension program had a more than 23-percent drop in the implosion of  the economy in 2008 and 2009. So that kind of hole was there before  this process. It is sad that now miners who are going to reach a  retirement age won't have a pension to retire on. I think it is  appalling that we bailed out Wall Street and we don't want to help with  a pension program that basically took a major hit during the downturn.  What are we saying to people? We don't care about those pensions, but  we will turn over the keys to the Treasury to someone else?   So the notion that, somehow, standing up for clean water is equated  with the pension program is just not true. We support those workers. We  will do anything to help them from all aspects of that picture,  including giving them a pension and making sure they have health care  and retirement. We have had that discussion, and many of my colleagues  had that discussion here late into the night just at the end of last  year. I am sure that we are waiting for a response from Leader  McConnell as to when he is going to put that kind of legislation on the  Senate floor. But, unfortunately, what we have instead is a rule trying  to hold back making sure that we have safe drinking water, safe fishing  water, and an outdoor economy that can count on these things.   I thank my colleague from Hawaii for being here earlier and talking  about this issue, as well as my colleague who is the ranking member  from the EPW committee, Senator Carper from Delaware, making an  eloquent statement and talking about the West Virginia economy, as he  is a native of West Virginia, and now my colleague from Oregon, who is  also addressing this issue. I appreciate their coming to the floor  tonight and being part of this discussion.   This is so important to all of us and really to all of our country. I  think making sure that people understand how important clean water is  to various aspects is so important. So I thank my colleague from  Oregon.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.
