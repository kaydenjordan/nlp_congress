 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 117 designates a peak in the Beaverhead National  Forest as the Alex Diekmann Peak.   Alex Diekmann was a renowned conservationist who lived in Bozeman,  Montana, not far from the Beaverhead National Forest and the peak that  will soon bear his name.   As a senior project manager for The Trust for Public Land, Mr.  Diekmann dedicated his professional life to protecting the natural and  scenic resources of the northern Rockies. His conservation legacy is  apparent throughout Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, where he was directly  involved in the conservation of more than 100,000 acres of public and  private lands.   At the age of 52, Mr. Diekmann lost a heroic battle with cancer on  February 1, 2016. To honor his enduring legacy, this bill renames a  peak in the Lee Metcalf Wilderness in Montana as the Alex Diekmann  Peak.   This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its  adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by encouraging my colleagues to  vote in support of the naming of Alex Diekmann Peak in S. 117.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1107 is a bill cosponsored by the entire Nevada  delegation that will enhance both economic development opportunities  and the conservation of public land in Pershing County.   First, I want to mention that this bill will designate over 130,000  acres of wilderness. This is a significant conservation victory and I  would like to congratulate everyone who has worked on making this a  reality.   In addition to the wilderness designation, this bill establishes a  process to exchange or sell up to 400,000 acres of Federal land  throughout Pershing County. I understand that the BLM and other  interested parties have raised some concerns with the appraisal process  set up in the bill. Unfortunately, we were not able to address these  concerns at markup, but I hope we can continue working with our  colleagues in the Senate to make any necessary changes to the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am just going to close by saying that I  request that all of our colleagues vote to support H.R. 1107, Pershing  County Economic Development and Conservation Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians is the only federally  recognized Tribe in Alabama. The Tribe was administratively recognized  by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1984 and, thereafter, acquired trust  land in both Alabama and Florida.   However, like other Tribes recognized post-1924, the status of Poarch  Band's trust lands have been under legal attack due to the  ramifications of the 2009 Supreme Court Carcieri decision.   The Tribe currently maintains several facilities for use of its  members on its trust lands, as well as owning and operating two  casinos. H.R. 1532 would simply ratify and reaffirm this trust status  of the Poarch Band's lands, protecting the lands against further  litigation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support adoption of this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just would like to ask all  of my colleagues to support H.R. 1532, the Poarch Band of Creek Indians  Land Reaffirmation Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 2897 authorizes the District of Columbia and the National Park  Service to enter into cooperative management agreements for the  operation, maintenance, and management of the National Park System  units in the District of Columbia.   Cooperative management agreements are effective tools used throughout  the National Park System that lead to creative partnerships that  enhance programming and management capacity.   As we will hear from Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of  Columbia and the National Park Service have worked out an agreement to  update Franklin Square that will revitalize an area in an important  quadrant of downtown. This bill simply provides the city with authority  to execute the agreement.   In addition to Franklin Square, H.R. 2897 has the potential to foster  cooperation that will enhance many of the small urban parks found  throughout our Nation's capital.   Mr. Speaker, this is a win/win, and I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I am closing by asking that our colleagues  support this great bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
