 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Advancing  Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act, which would extend vital telehealth  flexibilities through 2024. Expanding telehealth during the pandemic  was a resounding success and has been recognized by many New Mexicans  and rural Americans as a lifesaver.   Telehealth provided Americans continued access to healthcare services  without being physically present and also allowed healthcare providers  to remain in practice.   While this bill is an important step in the right direction, my  Republican colleagues and I wish to go one step further by offering  another bill, which would make permanent the extension of telehealth  services for federally qualified health clinics and rural health  clinics.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill on the floor,  as well as our subsequent bill to permanently expand telehealth  services to all Americans, regardless of ZIP Code. Access to the care  they deserve is crucial.
