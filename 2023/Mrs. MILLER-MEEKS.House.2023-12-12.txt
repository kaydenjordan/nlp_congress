 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the career  and retirement of a special member of the University of Iowa's Police  Department.   Jago, the university's longest serving canine, recently retired after  9 years of service.   During his decade on the force, Jago provided security for 2 U.S.  sitting Presidents, 4 Governors, 17 Secret Servicemembers, and  countless guests at Kinnick Stadium.   Jago also provided security for Major League Baseball games at the  Field of Dreams in Dyersville, Iowa, and has assisted in collecting and  locating key evidence in numerous investigations.   After nearly a decade on the force, Jago deserves all the treats that  retirement has to offer him.   I thank Jago for his service, and happy retirement.           Recognizing the University of Iowa's Women's Soccer Team     Mr. Speaker, last month, the University of Iowa's  Women's Soccer team earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament  after securing a win in the Big Ten Championship.   For the first time in Big Ten Championship history, an eight-seed  team won it all. In a nail-biter of a game, the Hawkeyes defeated the  Wisconsin Badgers 1-0.   The sole point scored during the game came from a penalty kick from  midfielder Josie Durr in the first half.   Needless to say, the University of Iowa's Women's Soccer team made us  all very proud this season, and I cannot wait to see what they  accomplish next year.   Keep it up, Hawkeyes.                 Congratulations to Riley Kramer of Troop 89     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Riley  Kramer of Troop 89 from Bettendorf, Iowa, for achieving the rank of  Eagle Scout.   The Eagle Scout is the highest and most prestigious achievement a  Scout can obtain.   To earn this rank, Scouts must fulfill leadership roles, exemplify  the Scout oath and law, display exemplary outdoor skills, speak better  than their Congresswoman, earn at least 21 badges, and complete a  comprehensive service project for their community.   For Riley's Eagle Scout project, he worked with the mayor of  Riverdale on a half-mile trail for the city. This trail supports our  community and gives people space to exercise and get out and enjoy  nature in Scott County.   I congratulate Riley on this honor, and I congratulate Riley's family  and everyone who supported him on his journey to become an Eagle Scout.     Holiday Shout-out to Simpson Stormin' Red Ale and West Hill Brewing     Mr. Speaker, today I rise for a cheers-worthy  holiday shout-out.   This month, Simpson Stormin' Red Ale has its official launch party at  West Hill Brewing in Indianola, Iowa.   The idea for this beer was brewed up between West Hill owners and  Simpson College.   Aspiring graphic designers and artists were given the opportunity to  design this year's logo.   This year, Madison McDonald, a graphic design major from Winterset,  Iowa, created the winning design.   Moving forward, there will be an annual redesign contest, and West  Hill also plans to donate a portion of all profits from Simpson  Stormin' Red Ale to support student scholarships at Simpson College.   Nothing quite brings people together like the holidays.   I congratulate West Hill Brewing and Simpson College on another  successful collaboration.   Mr. Speaker, I wish everyone a very merry Christmas.                            ____________________
