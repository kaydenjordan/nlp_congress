 Madam Speaker, today has been a long time coming for  President Trump, the American people, and the American farmers and  ranchers.   Our vote today ensures that we deliver on our promise to bring fair  and equitable trade with our closest trading partners, Mexico and  Canada.   In my home State of Washington, exports to Canada and Mexico totaled  $11.3 billion in 2018, and trade-related jobs amount to nearly 40  percent of all jobs in the State.   I have heard from farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers in every  county of central Washington. They all agree that today's vote to pass  USMCA is exactly what we need.   Most importantly, USMCA maintains duty-free access for U.S.  agriculture products, including the iconic Washington State apple,  which accounts for nearly $450 million in exports annually.   The USMCA goes even further to advance access for the U.S. dairy and  wine industries, two substantial drivers for Washington's economy.   Madam Speaker, I am proud today that we are delivering USMCA for my  constituents.
