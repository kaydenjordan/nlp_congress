 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1243, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for up to 3 minutes  of debate equally divided prior to the scheduled rollcall vote.    Mr. President, on his 47th day as President, Joe Biden  signed an Executive order directing the head of every Federal Agency to  submit a plan for their Agency to promote voter registration and voter  participation.   The problem is that the order also mandates that all Federal Agencies  partner with approved third-party organizations to provide these  services on Federal Agency property across the Nation. Determining  which third-party organizations will be approved, by whom, and based on  what criteria is missing from the order.   In spite of congressional oversight attempts and Freedom of  Information Act lawsuits, the Biden administration has refused to  release copies of these Agency plans. The prospect of the Biden  administration writing their own rules and using taxpayer money to  partner with liberal ``get out the vote'' organizations is wildly  inappropriate.   As a matter of principle, I don't believe that the Federal Government  should be using official taxpayer resources to advance partisan  politics. Further, mandating that every Federal Agency engage in  election engineering on the taxpayers' dime raises serious ethical and  legal concerns. Simply put, this Executive order is further  weaponization of the Federal Government's power to boost one side of  the aisle over the another.   My amendment would defund this ethically and legally dubious scheme  and restore faith in our elections.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
