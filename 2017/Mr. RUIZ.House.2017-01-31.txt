 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 724,  which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban and help unify the  family of Muktar and his wife, who spent 20 years in a refugee camp  after fleeing Somalia, and will continue to be separated from their  children who still live in the camp.
