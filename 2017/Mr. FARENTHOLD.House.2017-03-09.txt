 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Since this bill was marked up in the last Congress, the very same  plausibility standard used in this bill was adopted by the Federal  Circuit Court of Appeals in which fraudulent joinder cases arise with  the greatest frequency.   Last Congress, Ranking Member Conyers said of the bill, it should  simply pick one of the existing articulations in the fraudulent joinder  standard and codify that into law. At the time, the plausibility  approach was applied by some district courts, but just last year, the  Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals adopted the same plausibility standard  this bill contains in a case called International Energy.   The Fifth Circuit stated: We must consider whether the plaintiff  pleaded ``enough facts to state a claim to relieve that is plausible on  its face.'' The plaintiff in that case petitioned for rehearing en  banc, but the rehearing was denied, with not a single judge on the  Fifth Circuit requesting a vote.   In just the last year, district courts in the Fifth Circuit have  issued more than 40 fraudulent joinder decisions without much  difficulty and with the results that indicate just the sort of  reasonable reform that would occur nationwide when we get this bill  passed into law.   So this is about making the system work and opening the door to the  Federal courts so companies from foreign states are not unfairly,  potentially disadvantaged.   The other piece of this that is easy to neglect is the local  defendant. I don't know if the gentleman across the aisle has ever been  sued. I have friends who have been sued. It is an emotionally and  financially devastating procedure. You have got to take time off from  your life and business to defend it. You have got to hire a lawyer,  which is incredibly expensive. This is to protect the innocent third  parties and open the doors to the Federal courts and just make it  fairer and easier.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is not about protecting big corporations.  This bill is about protecting the small-business owner or the employee  who is fraudulently joined into a case who has to go out and hire his  or her own lawyer.   I remember something my law school professor once told me back in the  day at St. Mary's University School of Law in San Antonio, Texas, and  it stuck in my mind ever since: When you get sued, you may be able to  beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.   It is expensive, it is emotionally draining, and it is time  consuming.   I have no problem at all, and this bill is not designed to protect  corporations. It is designed to protect, just as its name states,  innocent parties. These are people who are joined solely to defeat  diversity jurisdiction. We are just changing the standard slightly to  one adopted by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to make it much more  fair to these innocent parties.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in the gentleman from Georgia's  example, this bill wouldn't apply at all. If my grandmother were  assaulted in a nursing home, I would certainly sue the nursing home  company. I would also join the person who actually did it who most  likely definitely will be a resident of the State that the lawsuit was  going in. There would clearly be a plausible cause of action against  that tortfeasor.   Mr. Chairman, I didn't practice personal injury law. I was an  agriculture lawyer. But this would be an easy case for me to prove in  his example. We are not trying to protect anybody who has done  something wrong. We are trying to protect people who are joined into a  lawsuit solely for the purpose of forum shopping.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, this really is about trying to stop bringing phony  cases in. You are bringing phony defendants in, and that is what we are  trying to stop. We have got to be fair about this.   It is not often that we have the opportunity to protect innocent  local folks and businesses from costly and meritless lawsuits. This is  an opportunity to rein in forum shopping and abuses by trial lawyers  and hold them to a good faith standard in litigation. We can do that by  passing a bill that is just a few pages long. That is the opportunity  we have today.   All this bill does--all this bill does--is say that innocent, local  parties--mostly small businesses--can't be added to a lawsuit for forum  shopping purposes, and it only prohibits this when there is no  plausible case against these small businesses or the case against them  isn't brought in good faith.   Who could argue with that?   Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I urge all my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Simpson). All time for general debate has  expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule, and shall be considered as read.   The text of the bill is as follow:                                  H.R. 725         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Innocent Party Protection       Act''.       SEC. 2. PREVENTION OF FRAUDULENT JOINDER.         Section 1447 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(f) Fraudulent Joinder.--        ``(1) This subsection shall apply to any case in which--        ``(A) a civil action is removed solely on the basis of the       jurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a);        ``(B) a motion to remand is made on the ground that--        ``(i) one or more defendants are citizens of the same State       as one or more plaintiffs; or        ``(ii) one or more defendants properly joined and served       are citizens of the State in which the action was brought;       and        ``(C) the motion is opposed on the ground that the joinder       of the defendant or defendants described in subparagraph (B)       is fraudulent.        ``(2) The joinder of a defendant described in paragraph       (1)(B) is fraudulent if the court finds that--        ``(A) there is actual fraud in the pleading of       jurisdictional facts with respect to that defendant;        ``(B) based on the complaint and the materials submitted       under paragraph (3), it is not plausible to conclude that       applicable State law would impose liability on that       defendant;        ``(C) State or Federal law clearly bars all claims in the       complaint against that defendant; or        ``(D) objective evidence clearly demonstrates that there is       no good faith intention to prosecute the action against that       defendant or to seek a joint judgment including that       defendant.        ``(3) In determining whether to grant or deny a motion       under paragraph (1)(B), the court may permit the pleadings to       be amended, and shall consider the pleadings, affidavits, and       other evidence submitted by the parties.        ``(4) If the court finds that all defendants described in       paragraph (1)(B) have been fraudulently joined under       paragraph (2), it shall dismiss without prejudice the claims       against those defendants and shall deny the motion described       in paragraph (1)(B).''.    The Acting CHAIR. No amendment to the bill shall be in order except  those printed in House Report 115-27. Each such amendment may be  offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated  in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the  time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the  proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall  not be subject to a demand for division of the question.                     Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Soto    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in House Report 115-27.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be roundly  opposed for the simple reason it doesn't protect any victims, but it  also victimizes local parties in the types of cases covered by the  amendment.   The purpose of the underlying bill is to allow judges greater  discretion to free innocent local parties--that is, innocent people and  innocent small businesses--from lawsuits when those innocent local  parties are dragged into a case solely because a plaintiff's attorney  wants to do some forum shopping.   These innocent local parties have, at most, an attenuated connection  to the claims made by the trial lawyer against some national company a  thousand miles away. These innocent local parties shouldn't have to  suffer the time, expense, and emotional drain of a lawsuit when the  plaintiff can't even come up with a plausible claim. The base bill  protects these innocent local parties from being dragged into a lawsuit  as a party just to keep the case in State court.   Now, let's bring in this amendment, which denies the bill's  protection to innocent local parties adjoined to a lawsuit simply  because the legal allegations in the case fall into one arbitrary  category and that one is in another. It is terribly unfair.   This amendment would allow these things to happen to innocent people  in the name of allowing trial lawyers to scuttle the hydraulic fracking  industry through lawsuits. Innocent people are innocent people, and  they should be protected against being dragged into lawsuits regardless  of the nature of the case.   This doesn't deny anybody access to the courts. It protects innocent  parties from being dragged into a case for forum shopping.   Every single one of the gentleman's cases will be heard in court.  They will have their day in court and they will have justice based on  the facts.   This bill does not protect wrongdoing corporations. This bill  protects people who are dragged into a lawsuit strictly for procedural  purposes.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am not going to get sucked into a  debate of hydraulic fracking. Being from Texas, we might have a whole  difference of opinion on that.   But I do want to point out, with respect to this bill, it doesn't  deny anyone access to courts, it doesn't deny anyone access to justice  regardless of what claim. I don't think it is fair we take out one  particular claim or not one particular claim. That seems to go against  fundamental fairness as well.   This bill is all about fairness. It is about fairness to keep people  from being dragged into court solely because a plaintiff's attorney  needs a local defendant to avoid diversity jurisdiction.   I oppose this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment and support the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment continues to victimize  innocent local parties just because they happen to be in an insurance  case.   The underlying bill is designed to protect folks from being dragged  into a lawsuit just to facilitate forum shopping by plaintiffs'  attorneys.   The purpose of this bill is to allow judges greater discretion to  free these innocent local parties. They are the ones that are suffering  as a result of this.   This amendment denies the bill's protection to innocent local parties  joined to a lawsuit simply because the legal allegations in the case  fall into one arbitrary category rather than another, just like the  previous amendment. It is terribly unfair. Innocent people are innocent  people, and they should be protected from being dragged into a lawsuit  regardless of the nature of the case.   The rules we have developed in this great country to protect the  innocent are rules of general application, such as the rules protecting  people's rights to have their side of the story told and the rules  protecting people from biased or inaccurate testimony.   We should all be appalled by the suggestion that these general  protections designed to protect innocent people from criminal liability  should be suspended because the case is one of assault and battery or  murder or somehow relates to insurance. It is the same kind of logic.                                time  1545    Our country is rightfully proud of its principles providing due  process and equal protection, but these concepts are meaningless if  they are only selectively applied to some type of cases and not others.  And for the same reason, we should all be outraged at the suggestion  that the rules of fairness, designed to protect the innocent, should be  suspended in civil law cases because a case involves one particular  subject matter or another. But that is exactly what this misguided  amendment does.   This amendment would allow a plaintiff's lawyer to drag an individual  insurance adjuster into a lawsuit even when the applicable State law  makes it absolutely clear that only insurers, not individual people,  are subject to bad faith claims. How does the sponsor explain this to a  person like Jack Stout, why a lawyer pulled him into a bad faith  lawsuit targeting State Farm? Mr. Stout was a local insurance agent who  merely sold a policy to the plaintiff, met and spoke with the plaintiff  once, and had nothing to do with processing the plaintiff's homeowner's  insurance claim. A Federal District Court in Oklahoma found he was  fraudulently joined and dismissed the claim against him, but under this  amendment, the innocent person would have been stuck back in the  lawsuit.   What about a person like Douglas Bradley, where the plaintiff's  lawyer named him as a defendant in a bad faith lawsuit against an  insurer? In that case, the complaint included Mr. Bradley, an insurance  agent, as a defendant in the caption of the case. It referred to  defendant, singular, not defendants. Throughout the entire pleadings,  it didn't even mention his name. A Federal District Court in Indiana  dismissed this claim against him as fraudulently joined, but under this  amendment, this innocent person would have been stuck back in the  lawsuit. It is not fair, it is expensive, and it is emotionally  draining to these innocent parties.   For that reason, I urge opposition to the amendment and support of  the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Nunes) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 725) to  amend title 28, United States Code, to prevent fraudulent joinder, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials to H.R. 985.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 180 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 985.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1549                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 985) to  [[Page H1975]]  amend the procedures used in Federal court class actions and  multidistrict litigation proceedings to assure fairer, more efficient  outcomes for claimants and defendants, and for other purposes, with Mr.  Simpson in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) and the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, recently an independent research firm surveyed  companies in 26 countries and found that 80 percent of those companies  that were subject to class action lawsuits were U.S. companies, putting  those U.S. companies at a distinct economic disadvantage when competing  with companies worldwide.   But the problem of overbroad class action doesn't just affect U.S.  companies. It affects consumers in the United States who are forced  into lawsuits they don't want to be in. How do we know that? We know  that because the median rate at which consumer class action members  take the compensation offered in a settlement is incredibly low. That  would be 0.023 percent. That is two-hundredths of a percent. That is  right, only the tiniest fraction of consumer class action members  bother to claim the compensation awarded them in a settlement. That is  clear proof that vastly large numbers of class members are satisfied  with the products they purchase, don't want compensation, and don't  want to be lumped into a ginormous class action lawsuit.   Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action  lawsuit system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes  with hundreds and thousands of unmeritorious claims and use those  artificially inflated claims to force defendants to settle the case.  Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has recognized that ``A court's  decision to certify a class . . . places pressure on the defendant to  settle even unmeritorious claims.''   Judge Diane Wood of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, appointed  by President Clinton, has explained that class certification ``is, in  effect, the whole case.'' And as one appeals court judge, nominated by  President Obama, wrote in his dissent in a recent class action case,  ``The chief difficulty we confront in this case arises from the fact  that some of the members of the class have not suffered the . . .  injury upon which this entire case is predicated and that could  constitute as many as 24,000 consumers who would have no valid claim  against the defendants under the state laws even if the named  plaintiffs win on the merits.''   He went on to chastise the other judges who allowed the class action  to proceed, writing ``if the district court does not identify a culling  method to ensure that the class, by judgment, includes only members who  were actually injured, this court has no business simply hoping that  one will work.''   The purpose of a class action is to provide a fair means of  evaluating similar, meritorious claims, not to provide a way for  lawyers to artificially inflate the size of a class to extort a larger  settlement fee for themselves, siphoning money away from those actually  injured, and increasing prices for everyone.   Just look at an accounting of recent class action settlements. The  SUBWAY food chain was sued in a class action because trial lawyers  complained their foot-long subs weren't a full foot long. As part of  the settlement, small amounts were paid to the 10 class  representatives, but the millions of other class members received  nothing; not a dime, not a sandwich. Meanwhile, the lawyers were  awarded $520,000 in fees. The settlement was appealed, and during oral  arguments Judge Diane Sykes remarked that ``A class action that seeks  only worthless benefits for the class should be dismissed out of hand.  That's what should have happened here. . . . This is a racket.''    The Coca-Cola Company was sued in a class action lawsuit involving  Vitaminwater. Class members received zero dollars in the settlement.  The lawyers were awarded $1.2 million in fees.   In a case involving Facebook, the company agreed to settle the case  by paying class counsel $3 million. Zero dollars were paid to class  members. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the deal, but in a withering  dissent, Judge Kleinfeld observed that ``Facebook users who had  suffered damages . . . got no money, not a nickel, from the defendants.  Class counsel, on the other hand, got millions.''   This bill includes several reforms. It prevents people from being  forced into a class with other uninjured or minimally injured class  members, only to have the compensation of injured parties reduced. It  prevents trial lawyers from using incestuous, litigation-factory  arrangements to gin up lawsuits. It requires courts to use objective  criteria in determining who is injured in a class action and how  compensation will actually reach the victims. It requires that injured  victims get paid first, before the lawyers, and that lawyer fees be  limited to a reasonable percentage of the money received by victims.   It requires judges to itemize exactly who gets what in a class action  settlement and who is paying and controlling the lawyers. It requires  all the rules governing class action be followed, that expensive  pretrial proceedings be put on hold while the court determines if the  case can't meet class certification requirements, and allows appeals of  those class certification orders so justice can be done faster.   It ensures lawyers don't add plaintiffs just for forum shopping  purposes, and it requires the verification of allegations in  multidistrict pretrial proceedings, ensuring defendants receive due  process while plaintiffs, not lawyers, get the benefits of any cost  savings achieved by the multidistrict pretrial process.   H.R. 985 also contains provisions to include much-needed transparency  into the asbestos bankruptcy trust system. On too frequent an occasion,  by the time asbestos victims assert their claims for compensation, the  bankruptcy trust formed for their benefit has been diluted by  fraudulent claims, leaving these victims without their entitled  recovery.   The reason that fraud is allowed to exist within the asbestos trust  system is the excessive lack of transparency created by plaintiffs'  firms. The predictable result of this reduced transparency has been a  growing wave of claims and reports of fraud.   This bill strikes the proper balance of transparency and preserving  the dignity and medical privacy of asbestos victims while also  minimizing the administrative impact on the asbestos trusts. This bill  saves the money in these trusts, which is a limited amount of money, to  make sure future claimants, many of whom are veterans, have the  opportunity to seek and receive compensation for their injuries and  prevent double-dipping and fraud.   Please join me in supporting this bill on behalf of consumers and  injured parties everywhere.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to point out to my colleague across the  aisle that over the past several Congresses, we have had multiple  hearings on class action reform and asbestos trust litigation, all of  which are easily and publicly available.   I further would like to go on to say this bill doesn't prevent any  claim from being brought as a class action--zero, zip, none. All it  does is maximize the recovery of the victims.   Under this bill, a class action lawyer's fees are pegged to a  reasonable percentage of the money actually received by the client  under the settlement. What that will do is incentivize lawyers to make  the maximum amount available to their clients, to seek the maximum  recovery for their client.   Under this bill, class action lawyers will no longer be able to agree  to settlements that give them millions of dollars and get their clients  absolutely nothing, or maybe a coupon, if they are lucky.   Under this bill, a class action lawyer will get more in fees as long  as they agree to a settlement that actually means that their clients,  the actual plaintiffs, are getting a reasonable amount of money.  Imagine that: incentivizing lawyers to do the best work for their  clients. That is what this bill does.   I would also like to talk for a second about the asbestos portion of  this. I have to say that this is a little troubling for me. The  disclosure requirements in the FACT Act portion of this bill requires  less than would be required in a State court pleading for damages. It  is the minimum amount of information necessary to make sure somebody  isn't double-dipping. It specifically protects medical records and  social security numbers. It is designed as a fraud prevention tool.   The argument that this is designed to protect companies that  manufactured asbestos is flawed. This is designed for the asbestos  trust--companies that have gone bankrupt and set aside large amounts of  money to be paid to the victims of asbestos. This protects the assets  in those trusts, not the tortfeasor companies. We are making sure there  is enough money in these trusts to pay future victims by stopping  fraudulent claims today.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Clearly there are two groups of individuals who we are not fearful  will commit fraud. It is our Nation's veterans and servicemembers. At  the same time, there is no reason to distinguish between the disclosure  obligation of veteran servicemembers and the disclosure obligations of  ordinary citizens.   This FACT Act provision is designed to protect veterans from fraud  and make sure our future veterans who are exposed and other people who  are exposed in their jobs to asbestos have the resources available  because the company that actually made the asbestos is most likely  bankrupt and out of business now.   There are finite resources in these trusts, and we owe it to our  servicemembers and to future victims of asbestosis or mesothelioma to  make sure there is money there to take care of their medical bills and  compensate them for the injuries. That is the purpose of the FACT Act  portion of this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am going to have to beg to differ with my colleague from across the  aisle.   Fraud has been documented in news reports, State court cases, and in  testimony before the Judiciary Committee.  [[Page H1979]]    The Wall Street Journal conducted an investigation that found  thousands of dispiritedly filed claims. Court documents in many States,  including Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, and  Virginia, attest to widespread fraud. Most recently, a bankruptcy case  in North Carolina uncovered a startling number of dispiritedly filed  claims.   Additionally, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony over the course  of four hearings about the FACT Act, during which witnesses repeatedly  testified that fraud existed within the asbestos trust bankruptcy  situation. Keep in mind that the fraud reported today has been in spite  of the lack of disclosure that exists.   Consistent with other multimillion-dollar compensation programs,  there is fraud occurring in the asbestos trust system, and the FACT Act  will go a long way to uncovering that fraud. The FACT Act is designed  to provide the minimum amount of transparency necessary to prevent this  fraud while protecting the personal information of those victims of  asbestos.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to address the fact that there have been numerous hearings on  the FACT Act and the problems associated with it. There was one hearing  before the Judiciary Committee on the Constitution on September 9,  2011. There were three legislative hearings before the Subcommittee on  Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law, one during the 112th  Congress, one during the 113th Congress, and one during the 114th  Congress. I am sure the gentleman's staff could have gotten him copies  of those.   I also point out that the minority used these opportunities to call  witnesses that were representatives of the plaintiffs' asbestos trial  bar. They called the attorneys to voice their concern about the bill,  not the victims. In fact, the minority called the same witness for  three out of the four hearings. Now they claim that asbestos victims  were never provided an opportunity to testify.   The Judiciary Committee has provided ample opportunity to include  asbestos victims' views on the legislation in the record, and there are  many letters and statements from victims in the record.   In closing, I do want to say--going back to the class action part of  this bill for a second only--that only the tiniest fraction of  consumers in class actions bother to claim the compensation awarded  them in the settlement. That is clear proof that the vastly large  number of class members are satisfied with the products they have  purchased, don't want compensation, and don't want to be lumped into a  gigantic class action lawsuit.   Federal judges are crying out for Congress to reform the class action  system, which currently allows trial lawyers to fill classes with  hundreds and thousands of meritorious claims and use those artificially  inflated classes to force defendants to settle the case.   As I recounted, class action settlements have left lawyers with  millions of dollars while victims receive absolutely nothing or a  coupon, at best. The bill prevents people from being forced into class  actions with other uninjured or minimally injured members only to have  the compensation of injured parties reduced. It requires that lawyer  fees be limited to a reasonable percentage of the money injured victims  actually receive. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   I also want to talk a second about the FACT Act. We hear these  stories about these corporations that did all of this wrong. Many of  them are bankrupt, and the only money available to the victims are the  money that has been set aside in these asbestos trust funds. When an  unscrupulous attorney makes a claim against multiple trusts or files  claims in Federal court and State court, it is difficult, if not  impossible, to find out if that claim has already been made. The FACT  Act makes that easily available while providing privacy necessary to  protect the victims.   The FACT Act is designed to protect the future victims and make sure  there is money there for the children, for the veterans, for the  hardworking Americans who are injured by asbestos but whose symptoms  have not yet manifested. Sometimes these asbestos-related diseases take  decades to show up, and there needs to be money there to take care of  those folks. That is what this legislation is intending to do, not to  protect corporations.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill that provides much-needed  reform to the class action system and to the asbestos trust system.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to Rules  Committee Print 115-5 of H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action  Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency Act of 2017,  which is a radical measure that would overturn centuries of American  law.   This committee print buries the ``Furthering Asbestos Claim  Transparency Act of 2017,'' crammed through committee on a party-line  vote, within the overarching legislation intended to effectively  obliterate class actions in America, H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class  Action Litigation Act of 2017.   I oppose this two-for-one bill combination because it will, in sum,  undermine the enforcement of this Nation's civil rights laws and upend  decades of settled class action law.   The fact that the House would even consider such sweeping, reckless  legislation without holding a single hearing is an outrage.   This poorly drafted legislation will create needless chaos in the  courts without actually solving any demonstrated problem.   Class action lawsuits are among the most important tools to enable  injured, cheated, and or victimized individuals and small businesses to  hold large corporations and institutions accountable and deter future  misconduct.   H.R. 985 would eviscerate that tool.   Let me remind my colleagues that class actions are critical for the  enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing,  education, and access to public areas and services.   As the Supreme Court has recognized in Amchem Products, Inc. v.  Windsor, class actions provide ``vindication of the rights of groups of  people who individually would be without effective strength to bring  their opponents into court at all.''   Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997). Courts  have interpreted Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the  federal class action rule, over decades and the Advisory Committee on  Civil Rules has, through its deliberative process, reviewed and amended  the rule to ensure its fair and efficient operation.   No further revisions are needed at this time.   Civil rights injuries are never identical and are already subject to  rigorous judicial review.   H.R. 985 imposes a new and impossible hurdle for class certification.   This alone would sound the death knell for most class actions.   It requires that the proponents of the class demonstrate that each  class member has suffered the same type and scope of injury.   At this early stage of a civil rights class action, it is frequently  impossible to identify all of the victims or the precise nature of each  of their injuries.   Classes inherently include a range of affected individuals, and in no  case does every member of the class suffer the same scope of injury  from the same wrongful act.   But even if this information were knowable, class members' injuries  would not be the same.   As a simple example, those overcharged for rent will have different  injuries.   In an employment discrimination class action, the extent of a class  member's injuries will depend on a range of factors, including their  job position, tenure, employment status, salary, and length of exposure  to the discriminatory conditions.   For this reason, nearly forty years ago, the Supreme Court developed  a two-stage process for such cases in International Brotherhood of  Teamsters v. U.S., 431 U.S. 324, 371-72 (1977).   In the first stage, the court determines whether the employer engaged  in a pattern or practice of discrimination.  [[Page H1981]]    If the employer is found liable, the court holds individual hearings  to determine the relief (if any) for each victim.   The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the use of the Teamsters model  for discrimination class actions in part because of the individualized  nature of injuries.   In the case of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 366  (2011).   Thus, this bill would overturn the approach established four decades  ago to permit a class of victims of discrimination to seek effective  relief.   Certainly, many civil rights, discrimination and employment class  actions, including cases involving refusals by companies to properly  pay workers, would not satisfy these criteria.   Some provisions would make it even more difficult to bring race and  gender discrimination class actions.   Other provisions would have a dramatic impact on cases against toxic  polluters.   For example, arbitrary and unworkable standards for attorneys' fees  undermine civil rights enforcement.   If a case is successful, the judge awards a reasonable fee based upon  the time that the advocates have spent working on the case.   This method of determining attorneys' fees provides for consistent  and predictable outcomes, which is a benefit to all parties in a  lawsuit.   H.R. 985 would entirely displace this well-settled law with a  standard long ago rejected as arbitrary and unworkable.   Under the bill, attorneys' fees would be calculated as a percentage  of the value of the equitable relief. Sec. 1718(b)(3).   But how is a judge to determine the cash value of an integrated  school, a well-operating foster care system, the deinstitutionalization  of individuals with disabilities, or myriad other forms of equitable  relief secured by civil rights class actions?   Asking judges to assign a price tag in such cases is an impossible  task and would lead to uncertainty and inconsistency.   Non-profit organizations cannot bear the risk of these long and  expensive cases if, at the end, their fees are calculated under this  incoherent and capricious standard.   Indeed, the bill creates an incentive for defendants to prolong the  litigation so as to make it economically impossible for plaintiffs'  attorneys to continue to prosecute the litigation.   In addition, by considering this bill now, Congress is circumventing  the process that Congress itself established for promulgation of  federal court rules under the Rules Enabling Act, bypassing both the  Judicial Conference of the United States and the U.S. Supreme Court.   Civil rights class actions are often about systemic reforms that  benefit the most vulnerable.   Interference with the proper federal court rules process is reckless  and irresponsible, particularly when this proposal is so damaging to  victims.   Mr. Chair, the only beneficiaries of the so-called FACT Act, are the  very entities that knowingly produced a toxic substance that killed or  seriously injured thousands of unsuspecting American consumers and  workers.   The FACT Act would force asbestos patients seeking any compensation  from a private asbestos trust fund to reveal on a public web site  private information including the last four digits of their Social  Security numbers, and personal information about their families and  children.   In fact, not a single asbestos victim has come forward in support of  this legislation.   Worse, this bill would allow victims of asbestos exposure to be  further victimized by requiring this information about their illness to  be made publicly available to virtually anyone who has access to the  Internet.   For example, the bill requires all payment demands, as well as, the  names and exposure histories of each claimant--together with the basis  for any payment the trust made to such claimants--to be publicly  disclosed.   This sensitive information must be posted on the court's public  docket, which is easily accessible through the Internet with the  payment of a nominal fee.   Once irretrievably released into the public domain, this information  would be a virtual treasure trove for data collectors and other  entities for purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with  compensation for asbestos exposure.   Insurance companies, prospective employers, lenders, and predatory  scam artists as well as the victim's neighbors would have access to  this information.   Many of the people who would be hurt by the FACT Act are veterans,  who are disproportionately affected by asbestos disease.   To address this serious failing of the bill, I offered an amendment  which would ensure that the quarterly reports required under the FACT  Act, contain only aggregate payment information.   My amendment also deletes the bill's burdensome discovery  requirement.   As noted by the widow of our former colleague Congressman Bruce Vento  who passed away from asbestos-induced mesothelioma, the bill's public  disclosure of victims' private information: ``could be used to deny  employment, credit, and health, life, and disability insurance.''   Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims ``would be more  vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of  predators.''   Supporters of this legislation say that Bankruptcy Code section 107  will prevent such results.   But, they are wrong; this provision only permits--it does not  require--the bankruptcy court to issue a protective order.   In fact, such relief may only be granted for cause if the court finds  that ``disclosure of such information would create undue risk of  identity theft or other unlawful injury to the individual.''   What this means is that an asbestos victim would have to retain  counsel and go to court in order to prove cause to obtain relief.   And, even though Bankruptcy Rule 9037 does require certain types of  personal information to be redacted from a document filed in a  bankruptcy case, said Rule would be overridden by this legislation, as  written.   Accordingly, for these reasons and more, I oppose this harmful  legislation.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Joyce of Ohio). All time for general debate has  expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.   It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose  of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a  substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-5.

Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Goodlatte    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1  printed in part B of House Report 115-29.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, the FACT Act is designed to require  increased transparency to combat fraud committed against asbestos  trusts. This amendment strikes the requirement that asbestos trusts  publish the very data that is necessary to detect fraud between the  trusts and State tort proceedings. In its place, this amendment calls  for only a quarterly report with an aggregate list of demands received  by the trusts.   The simple aggregation of information is worthless in allowing  parties to make a meaningful inquiry into whether or not they are being  defrauded. This amendment guts the bill, and I urge opposition.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on my side?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me say whose side I want to stand  on, and that is the side of Mrs. Vento, the widow of our former  colleague, Representative Bruce Vento, who passed away from asbestos- induced cancer.   The bill's public disclosure of victims' private information could be  used to deny employment, credit, and health, life, and disability  insurance. Mrs. Vento also warned that asbestos victims would be more  vulnerable to identity thieves, con men, and other types of predators.   There is no reason for this bill. Not only is the Judicial Conference  of Federal Judges against it, but victims are crying out: Stop it, and  stop it now.   Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1\1/2\ minutes  remaining.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a StarTribune  article.  [[Page H1992]]                                [From the StarTribune]      Stand With Families Affected by Asbestos, and Help Kill FACT Act         My husband was the late U.S. Rep. Bruce F. Vento, who       served for almost 24 years in the House of Representatives       representing Minnesota's Fourth Congressional District. He       died from mesothelioma in 2000 within eight and a half months       of being diagnosed.        Mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer caused by asbestos       exposure. Bruce was exposed while working his way through       college as a laborer, years before he became involved in       public life.        With his death, our country lost a hardworking and humble       public servant years before his time. Bruce's parents,       siblings, children, grandchildren and I lost so much more.        Since his death, I have worked with asbestos patients and       family members from across the country to fight for a ban on       asbestos and to protect the rights of people whose lives have       been forever affected by this terrible poison.        I have recently been involved in the effort to stop the so-      called ``Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act,'' or       FACT Act, which would obstruct justice for victims dying from       asbestos-related diseases while giving a handout to the very       corporations that knowingly poisoned and killed them.        The FACT Act would require that the personal information of       sick and dying asbestos patients and their families be posted       on a public website, including names, addresses, medical       diagnoses, financial compensation received and the last four       digits of our Social Security numbers.        This is precisely the kind of information that law       enforcement officials tell the public we should not share on       the Internet because it leaves us vulnerable to identity       thieves and con artists.        The House could be considering a vote on this bad       legislation in the coming weeks, making it all the more       urgent that we act now to protect the privacy of asbestos       victims and their families.        Supporters of the FACT Act are the corporations that       exposed innocent workers, consumers and their family members       to asbestos, while concealing what they knew about this       dangerous poison. They claim that this gross violation of our       privacy is necessary in order to protect asbestos patients       from fraud against the asbestos trust funds that were set up       to compensate asbestos victims and their families. Yet, not a       single instance of fraud against the trust funds has been       identified.        What is worse, while the bill's supporters claim that they       are doing it for asbestos victims, not one victim of asbestos       exposure or an affected family member has been allowed to be       heard on this legislation. The only people who would be       directly affected by the bill have been completely shut out       of the process.        The FACT Act would also bog down the asbestos trust funds       in endless paperwork to respond to information requests from       asbestos companies. This would drain the funds of money that       is desperately needed to compensate sick and dying victims.       As the victims get more and more desperate, they will be       willing to settle cases for pennies on the dollar, taking       needed compensation away from families and leaving it in the       pockets of the responsible companies.        I recently traveled to Washington, D.C., and met with Sens.       Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Betty McCollum, all of       whom committed to work with asbestos patients and family       members to stop the FACT Act from becoming law. I hope that       we can count on the rest of Minnesota's congressional       delegation to stand with asbestos patients and families and       against the FACT Act.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, without having the ability to hear my  colleague's opposition, I know that the supporters of this legislation  will say that Bankruptcy Code section 107 will prevent these  devastating results, but it is not true. This provision only permits  it. It does not require the bankruptcy court to issue a protective  order.   My amendment protects these vulnerable victims against the release of  their data, making them, in addition to the devastating disease that  they got from asbestos--and our good friend Bruce Vento, many of us  knew Congressman Vento, we knew his wife, and we knew that his death  was both untimely and devastating, and now you are saying to victims  like him: Release all the data. Open yourself up to more. Open your  families up to more.   The Jackson Lee amendment is a commonsense amendment that will  provide for an asbestos trust report quarterly, an aggregate list of  demands received and payments made. As well, it would protect the  privacy of asbestos victim plaintiffs from overly broad and invasive  disclosure requirements by striking down the bill's text about personal  information disclosure mandates. No matter what my good friend from  Texas says, he does not have an answer to protecting the privacy of  these victims.   I ask our colleagues to support a commonsense response. Stop it now.  The courts don't want it, and it is horrible for the victims. It is  doubling down on people who have lost loved ones and victims who are  suffering from asbestos-induced cancer. I ask my colleagues to support  the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the FACT Act requires that a very basic  amount of information be released to protect against fraud against the  asbestos trust system. I am standing with future victims of asbestos.   The diseases associated with asbestos typically don't manifest  themselves for decades, in some cases, beyond or after exposure. These  trusts are being drained by fraudulent and duplicative claims. These  requirements of disclosure prevent that fraud by requiring the minimal  amount of information being required. In fact, a judge with 29 years of  bench experience testified before the Committee on the Judiciary that  the FACT Act provides more protection in terms of confidentiality of  records than the legal system is able to do.   This is commonsense legislation, does not invade people's privacy,  and preserves these trust funds to make sure all victims are  compensated. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Jackson  Lee amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will  be postponed.                   Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Espaillat    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8  printed in part B of House Report 115-29.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prevent asbestos  trusts from disclosing claims information submitted by individuals  living in public housing in its quarterly reports and in response to  information requests.   There is no reason to distinguish between the disclosure obligations  of individuals living in public housing and the disclosure obligations  of ordinary citizens. To the extent that claimants do not affirmatively  identify themselves as living in public housing, this amendment would  require asbestos trusts to determine whether claimants qualify in these  categories, further draining them of funds needed to compensate future  victims.   The FACT Act balances the need for transparency and protecting  claimants' privacy. The FACT Act excludes any confidential medical  records and the claimants' Social Security numbers. We should ensure  that bankruptcy asbestos claims are processed in an open, fair, and  transparent method in order to protect the limited amount of money  reserved for compensating future asbestos victims.                                time  1745    The FACT Act should apply uniformly to all claimants, and it should  not impose disparate burdens relating to individuals living in public  housing.   Mr. Chairman, for that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I am not sure how this bill applies to  government ethics at all.   This bill is a simple bill that tells trial lawyers not to sue  innocent local people in businesses just so they can forum shop. It  tells them that all they have got to do is show a plausible case before  they can proceed and that they have got to proceed in good faith.   It has nothing to do with what the amendment proposes. This is to  protect innocent folks from being sucked into lawsuits by trial  lawyers.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the  underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
