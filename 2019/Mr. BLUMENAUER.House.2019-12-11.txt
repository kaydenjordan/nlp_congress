 Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy,  and I appreciate his leadership.   I strongly urge that my colleagues reject the cynical approach that  is being advanced by our Republican friends. Think about it for a  moment. We are talking about challenging the monopoly that the  Republicans gave, making it illegal to negotiate drug prices.   As a result, we have heard already in the course of this debate that  our constituents pay four times more, on average, than other countries.  Sometimes it is 67 times as much.   What would happen if we were able to slightly restrain that monopoly  power and have a little competition? The Republicans are so cynical  that they say the first thing the drug companies will do is not cut  executive bonuses, not cut back on stock buybacks, not cut back on  bizarre advertising. The first thing the pharmaceutical industry would  do, in the vision of the Republicans, is cut back on vital research.                                time  1945    Give me a break. They already spend less on research than they do on  the items that I have mentioned.   I really believe that, even though we have big differences with  them--and I think we settled some of those scores in the recent trade  negotiations--I have a hard time believing that they would make  patients suffer instead of cutting back a little bit on executive  compensation or stock buybacks.   I am proud that we have stood firm against Big Pharma in our trade  negotiations, and I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of this  legislation that will lower prescription drug prices by almost $2,000  per average family.   It will have savings that will expand Medicare benefits to include  dental, vision, and hearing--critical benefits for the older  constituents whom we all represent.   It reinvests the savings in Federal health programs, drug innovation,  and medical research.    Madam Chair, reject this cynical view that the drug  companies will punish consumers before they will restrain some of the  excesses if we finally take back part of the monopoly powers that the  Republicans gave to the pharmaceutical industry.
