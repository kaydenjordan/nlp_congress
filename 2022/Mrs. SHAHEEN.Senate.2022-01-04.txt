 Mr. President, I come to the floor to pay  tribute to John Victor Amrol, Jr., a long-time New Hampshire resident,  State employee, and labor advocate who passed away recently at the age  of 85. Born in our State capital of Concord, John was in many ways a  quintessential Granite Stater. He had a warm personality, an  exceptional work ethic, and a passion  [[Page S23]]  for service that enriched his community and improved the quality of  life for so many across our great State.   After graduating from nearby St. John's High School in 1953, John  took a job with the State of New Hampshire in our department of  transportation, DOT. It was the start of a 44-year career in highway  road design. Throughout his long tenure with DOT, John played a role in  ensuring that our roadways were developed in a safe and efficient  manner. He also served his community and State as a member of the Army  National Guard from 1953 to 1978. He retired as a master sergeant, and  he was a proud member of American Legion Post 21 for 26 years.   John achieved so much with the department of transportation; yet as a  longtime member of the State Employees Association (SEA)/Service  Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 1984 and its president from  1991-2000, his true impact transcends all that he accomplished in his  decades of work with the DOT. John was a pillar of the SEA/SEIU,  serving on nearly every committee and always diving deep into the  issues that affected working people and their families. The union  represents a wide range of occupations in the public and private sector  workforce that provides critical services to our State. Each and every  member owes a debt of gratitude to John. He was a force in fighting for  their well-being, dignity, and fair treatment. As a negotiator, John  was as tough as New Hampshire granite. In fact, his wisdom and judgment  at the negotiating table earned him the nickname ``The Father of  Collective Bargaining for State Employees'' among his SEA colleagues.  They also paid tribute to John by dedicating their office building on  North State Street in Concord in his name.   John was the president of SEA/SEIU Local 1984 when I was elected  Governor. We shared a vision of a strong, secure middle class in New  Hampshire where hard-working Granite Staters get a fair shot and their  fair share, and we knew that unions play an important role in achieving  that vision. I could always count on him for a fair, honest, and  informed assessment of labor issues.   The Granite State and the many people John served are grateful for  his many gifts and powerful advocacy. In the last couple of weeks,  family and friends have gathered to share and cherish their many fond  memories of him. I am with them in spirit as they reflect on the life  of this good and generous man.                            ____________________
