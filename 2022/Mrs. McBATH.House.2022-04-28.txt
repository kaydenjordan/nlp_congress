 Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, live from Atlanta, Georgia,  households across America were introduced to The Weather Channel. For  the first time, Americans could get safe, reliable, trustworthy  information about the weather 24 hours a day.   Since its first broadcast, The Weather Channel has done far more than  just provide up-to-date information about weather forecasts. With the  help of friendly, familiar faces, The Weather Channel's reporting has  inspired countless young people to wonder and care about the natural  world around them, motivating them to study weather and our climate.  And through their constant innovation, The Weather Channel's award- winning breakthroughs in weather reporting have undoubtedly saved  countless American lives.   I am proud to lead a House Resolution with my colleague from Georgia,  Congressman Loudermilk, to commemorate the anniversary; and I wish The  Weather Channel continued success as they document and broadcast vital  weather and safety information to millions of households across the  country.                            ____________________
