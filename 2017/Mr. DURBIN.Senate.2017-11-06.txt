 Mr. President, let me first say at the outset that many  of us have extended well wishes to our colleague, Senator Paul, who was  injured over the weekend. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope that  he returns soon. He is an important part of the Senate and an important  colleague to those of us on both sides of the aisle.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday there was another gun massacre  and horrible circumstances. I know the Presiding Officer came to the  floor earlier today to say a word about his feelings and the feelings  of his family. They are shared by all of us. It is heartbreaking to  think that some person so demented, so unusual would come into a  worship setting and kill innocent people.   Yesterday, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, at least 26 people were  killed and 20 others were wounded when a gunman opened fire in the  sanctuary of the First Baptist Church. The reported shooter, Devin  Kelley, used an assault rifle to commit this mass murder. The victims  range in age from 18 months to 77 years. About a dozen of those who  were killed were children, including the daughter of the church's  pastor. This is heartbreaking. Our nation grieves for the victims and  their loved ones.   The shooter reportedly drove up to the church wearing a bulletproof  vest and tactical gear, and he began firing in the parking lot before  entering the church. At some point, a local resident who lived near the  church began firing back. The shooter then drove off, with two  residents in pursuit, eventually crashing his car. He was found dead  from a gunshot wound, which may have been self-inflicted.   President Trump and others have said that this exchange of fire with  citizens responding saved lives and shows that the policy response to  the shooting should be to arm more good guys with guns. Let us not  forget that 46 people were shot before these citizens came on the  scene.   This reported shooter, 26 years old, had served in the U.S. Air Force  from 2010 until 2014, working on logistics readiness. In 2012 he was  court-martialed for two counts of assault on his then-wife and child.  He was sentenced to confinement for 12 months. He received a bad  conduct discharge in 2014. He remarried in 2014, and had worked as an  unarmed security guard at a water park. He reportedly bought four guns,  one each year from 2014 to 2017, and three of those weapons--the  assault rifle that he used in this crime and two handguns--were found  at the scene.   Local law enforcement said that the shooter was likely motivated by a  domestic situation. His wife's grandmother was one of the victims.   There are so many things that come to mind. First and foremost is the  grief and sorrow we all feel for the families who were affected. It is  so sad that when people go to church on Sunday, they are not safe from  gun violence and gun massacres, which are occurring way too frequently  across the United States. Just over two years ago, nine people were  killed by a gunman in the Charleston Emanuel AME Church. And just last  month we saw the worst mass shooting in modern American history in Las  Vegas, with 58 people murdered and over 500 wounded. In Chicago, at  least 29 people were shot, five fatally, over this past weekend.   There are things that we need to do, and that only we can do in  Congress, to make the laws better and safer.   I respect the Second Amendment. I respect the fact that there are men  and women in my family, friends, and people I represent across Illinois  who own guns and use them safely and responsibly. We have sportsmen and  hunters in my family. We have people who buy guns for sporting purposes  and for self-defense. They store the guns carefully and safely. They  take very seriously that they are dealing with a deadly weapon. They  don't want anyone innocent to be hurt. I respect that very much. I  think we all should. But I also call on them now. They need to lead us  into a more sensible policy when it comes to gun safety.   Owners of firearms, overwhelmingly, when asked, believe we should  have comprehensive background checks to keep guns out of the hands of  those who misuse them. Overwhelmingly, a majority of gun owners feel  that way, as most Americans feel. Why can't we do that? We certainly  know it is within our power.   In my State of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, we are approaching  600 homicides this year--600--most of them from gunfire. It is  heartbreaking. That doesn't include those who were injured by being  shot as well. Where are these guns coming from? There are no gun stores  in the city of Chicago. That is true. But when it comes to purchasing  guns, it makes no difference. The suburbs have plenty of gun dealers.  Of course, there are gun shows in neighboring States, like Indiana. We  also know gun stores in the suburbs of Chicago supply 25 percent of the  identified crime guns. We know many of those are sold in what is known  as a straw purchase. They are sold to someone who buys a gun for  someone who is not legally qualified. It is a girlfriend or someone who  buys a gun because she has no criminal record so her boyfriend can use  it--misuse it--and kill innocent people. Can't we toughen that law and  make sure there are real penalties for straw purchases? That is not  going to slow down any legitimate gun owner or anyone who wants to use  a gun in a responsible fashion. That is one thing we can do.   Then there is the gun show loophole. We know, with Columbine and  other places, that it was a gun show loophole that opened the way for  the purchase of guns that killed innocent people. Let's do something  about that. We should. If we are serious, we should.   We also know that the 1996 Lautenberg amendment prohibits convicted  domestic abusers from buying or using guns. That applies, as well, to  military personnel. Questions need to be asked and answered about this  shooter in Texas and what happened after he was court-martialed for  domestic abuse in the Air Force in 2012. How did he purchase a gun  after that, in violation of the Lautenberg amendment?   We need to also ask why in the world anyone needs to own an assault  weapon. I understand people buy rifles and shotguns and even handguns  for sporting and self-defense. But why does anyone need to own a  military-style weapon--one that can be converted, as we found in Las  Vegas, to a weapon that discharges 100 rounds in 7 seconds?  [[Page S7031]]  That is totally unnecessary for any legitimate legal purpose. It is  available, perhaps, for military use, perhaps, for law enforcement but  not for the ordinary American citizen who would purchase and own a gun  for legitimate purposes.    Next, we need to make sure that we understand why gun violence is  growing in America. The number of people who have been killed or  injured just grows by the year. It is getting worse. According to a CDC  report issued just last week, gun deaths increased for the second year  in a row last year. There were more than 38,000 gun deaths in 2016, up  from 36,000 in 2015 and from 33,500 the year before that. We are  experiencing a public health crisis of gun violence in America,  according to the American Medical Association.   Of course, there is no single law or policy that would prevent every  shooting death, just as there is no single law or policy that would  prevent every drug overdose death. But we have to start working  together, on a bipartisan basis, to bring these shooting numbers down.   We need to also talk about the issue of mental health, raised by the  President in response to this tragedy in Texas. The President said:         This isn't a guns situation. . . . I think that mental       health is your problem here.    Despite the fact that most violence in the United States has nothing  to do with mental illness, many are arguing that mental health is  really the issue. What have we done in the Senate when it comes to  mental health and guns this year? Senate Republicans used the CRA to  repeal a regulation that directed the Social Security Administration to  share mental illness information with the background check compilation  of information. There was advocacy for massive cuts to Medicaid, which  would throw millions of people with mental health needs off coverage.  There was an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would  have allowed insurers to refuse coverage of essential health benefits,  including mental health treatment. And there was a refusal to provide  additional Federal funding to help provide mental health care. We don't  have a very good record this year in the Senate when it comes to taking  mental illness seriously, and we should.   I will also introduce a bill that I am working on to encourage more  crime-gun tracing in light of last week's crime-gun trace report from  the Chicago Police Department.   We focus on terrorism and what it does to our country, and we should.  That is our responsibility. Anyone who would do harm to innocent  Americans--as in 9/11, killing 3,000 in that particular instance--needs  to be taken extremely seriously by all of us in Congress and in the  White House. Foreign sources of terrorism need to be carefully watched  when it comes to our border security, when it comes to background  checks, and the like. But let's be honest. More Americans are dying  from Americans killing Americans with guns than by terrorist activity.  It is just as much a death as any foreign terrorist threat would be,  and we need to consider it just as seriously as we do when it comes to  the issues of terrorism and safety for the people of America.   Why doesn't the Congress take this up? Why don't we even have a  debate? I am on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We have not had a  single bill this year that addresses gun safety--not one--despite the  gun violence that takes place every day and despite tragedies like this  tragedy over the weekend in Sutherland Springs, TX.   Every time a terrible shooting occurs, Republican leaders in Congress  say now is not the time to act. And then Congress never acts.   Congress still has not acted to close the 72-hour background check  loophole that allowed the Charleston church shooter to buy his gun in  2015.   Congress has done nothing to address the bump stocks that enabled the  Las Vegas shooter to turn a concert into a war zone.   Congress still hasn't even addressed the gun show loophole that  allowed the Columbine shooters to commit that massacre back in 1999.   Will Congress act in response to this latest tragedy? Will the  Republicans who control Congress finally stand up to the gun lobby and  put legislation on the floor to bring down the number of gun deaths? Or  will the Republican-controlled Congress ignore this public health  crisis once again?   The Republicans in Congress are rushing to pass massive changes to  our tax code in a matter of weeks, and yet they refuse to do anything  to prevent the next mass shooting. If the Republicans treated this gun  violence epidemic with a fraction of the urgency they are showing when  it comes to cutting taxes for the wealthiest one percent and the  largest corporations, we could save many lives.   I pray for the victims of gun violence in this nation, but I also  pray that my colleagues will act to reduce this gun violence epidemic.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on September 5, 2 months ago, Attorney  General Jeff Sessions announced the Trump administration's repeal of  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, better known as  DACA.   DACA provides temporary legal status to immigrant students if they  register with the government, pay a fee, and pass criminal and national  security background checks. It was renewable on a 2-year basis.   The young people protected by DACA are also known as Dreamers. They  came to the United States as children. They grew up knowing only this  country, believing this was their home and their future. Many of them  in their teenaged years were told quietly by a parent that their legal  status was not the status of an American citizen. These kids, who grew  up singing the Star Spangled Banner and pledging allegiance to the  American flag, have no country.   It was 7 years ago that I sent a letter to President Obama, joined by  Senator Dick Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. On a bipartisan basis,  we asked President Obama to establish a program like the DACA Program.  The President responded, and DACA has been a success. Almost 800,000  Dreamers have come forward. They have surrendered to their government  the information that many of their families kept secret for years. They  trusted us. They gave this information to the government and said: We  want to become part of America's future, and we are willing to sign up,  submit ourselves to the background check, pay our taxes, pay our filing  fee, and do whatever is necessary. They trusted us. These young people  who came forward and received DACA have then gone on to contribute more  fully to their country. They are teachers, nurses, engineers, first  responders, and servicemembers in our military.   Now, because of President Trump's announcement, the deportation clock  is ticking on these young people. Beginning on March 5, 2018, not that  long from now, every workday for the following 2 years approximately  1,400 Dreamers will lose their work permits and be subject to  deportation. These young people who trusted our government will now,  with the decision to end DACA, find themselves in an extremely  vulnerable position.   When they lose their DACA protection, if they are teachers, they are  forced to leave their students. If they are nurses, they are forced to  leave their patients. If they are first responders, they leave their  post. If they are soldiers willing to die for our country, they are  forced to leave our military service.   This isn't just a looming humanitarian crisis. It is also an economic  crisis. The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy  reports that DACA-eligible individuals contribute an estimated $2  billion a year in State and local taxes. The Cato Institute, a  conservative operation, estimates that ending DACA and deporting DACA  recipients will cost $60 billion and result in a $280 billion reduction  in economic growth over the next 10 years.   Poll after poll shows overwhelming bipartisan support for these  Dreamers. Even FOX News--no liberal media outlet--recently found that  79 percent of Americans support a path to citizenship for Dreamers,  including 63 percent of those who voted for President Trump. Sixty- three percent, or almost two out of three Trump supporters, supports a  legal status for Dreamers.   The answer is clear. Congress needs to pass the Dream Act, and we  need to  [[Page S7032]]  do it before we leave Washington, DC, for the holidays.   It was 16 years ago that I first introduced this bipartisan  legislation to give a path of citizenship to these young people. In  July I introduced the most recent version with my friend, Lindsey  Graham, a Republican Senator from South Carolina.   Over the years I have come to the floor almost 100 times to tell  individual stories of the Dreamers. These stories tell us what is at  stake when we consider the fate of DACA and the Dream Act. Today, I  want to tell you about Ha Eun Lee.   When she was 6 years old, her family came to the United States from  Korea. She grew up in Bloomfield Hills, MI. Here is what Ha Eun says  about her childhood in the United States: ``I was fortunate enough to  grow up learning that diversity is encouraged and differences are not  just tolerated but welcomed.''   Ha Eun was a good student and committed to public service. In high  school she was a member of the National Honor Society, received the  Principal's Academic Achievement Award, and was an Oakland Activities  Association Scholar Athlete. She was a member of the track and field  team during all 4 years of high school.   Ha Eun is now a senior at the University of Michigan, majoring in  English. She volunteers with the Red Cross, and she is copresident of  an organization called The Supply, which raises money to help students  in Nairobi, Kenya, obtain an education. As copresident, Ha Eun has  expanded this organization's efforts, and they are now volunteering  locally near Detroit.   Ha Eun was also a policy and programs intern for the Asian Americans  Advancing Justice Center.   As Ha Eun completes her last year of college, her dream is to become  a lawyer. She wrote me a letter, and here is what she said:         Although I'm legally labeled as an ``alien'' in this       country I call home, I believe I am an American. And I       believe this not solely because I live, study, work and       contribute to this country, but because I believe in the core       values all Americans share as a nation: liberty, justice, and       prosperity.    Ha Eun and other Dreamers have so much to contribute to our country,  but without DACA or the Dream Act, they will be deported back to  countries where they haven't lived since they were children. Will  America be stronger if we deport people like Ha Eun? I think the answer  is obvious.   When we introduced the Dream Act, Senator Graham said: ``The moment  of reckoning is coming.'' That moment has arrived. Congress has a  responsibility to do our job and make the Dream Act the law of the land  before the end of the year, before we go home for the holidays;  otherwise, we will bear the responsibility for forcing hundreds of  thousands of talented young immigrants out of the workforce and putting  them at risk of immediate deportation.   Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are interested in  finding a path to get this done. I salute all of them who in good faith  have offered their help. We have to focus now. We have to come together  and focus.   Many of my Republican colleagues have said that we need to put in  border security elements. Count me in. Let's sit down and have an  honest discussion about making our borders safer and stronger. I will  gladly join that conversation. I think there are many things we can  agree on that will lessen the likelihood that there will be those  coming across the border in the years to come.   I recently met with the head of border security, and we talked about  things that might be done. There is something called a Z Portal. I  didn't know about it. It is a virtual x ray machine, a low-level  radiation x ray machine that can x ray vehicles and determine whether  they are secreting individuals or contraband that shouldn't be allowed  in this country. He talked about one particular border crossing and  said: We have a Z Portal there, but it can be used on only about one  out of every five vehicles. He said: I would like to have more of them.   I think he should. Why wouldn't we make that part of border security?  I said: What about other things coming into this country, other than  people?   He said: One thing we are concerned about is fentanyl.   Fentanyl is a chemical that is used to enhance the addiction of  heroin, and, sadly, it is deadly. Many heroin addicts die when they  lace the heroin with fentanyl and inject it, so we try at the borders  to stop the importation of this fentanyl from China and other countries  into the United States. I asked him about it.   He said: Sadly, we don't have enough new spectrometers, which are  used to test these chemicals. We need them to stop the flow of this  deadly drug into our country and to protect the men and women who are  doing the actual surveillance.   Isn't that something we can agree on, on a bipartisan basis, to make  our borders safer, to lessen the likelihood of people dying from the  opioid heroin crisis? These are things we can do together.   Somehow we haven't been able to come up with a list of particulars  from the other side of what they would like to move forward on, but I  am ready, willing, and determined to get this done.   We have to do this this year. There is no excuse. There are too many  lives at stake, not just the 780,000 DACA individuals but all of the  people whom they are helping in their lives today. They are depending  on us.   We are running out of time. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to join me in this constructive and bipartisan effort.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
