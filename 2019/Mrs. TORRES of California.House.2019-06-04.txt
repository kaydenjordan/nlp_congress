 Mr. Speaker, I rise also in strong support  of H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act.   I recently met with a young Dreamer from my district who asked me a  simple question: Have you ever thought about doing something to change  someone else's life?   Passing the American Dream and Promise Act is that moment in history.  This is a historic day for the millions of hardworking young people  who, like me, were brought to the U.S. as children. And not just me,  but many other members of the new American caucus who are serving in  Congress today. They built lives here. They own businesses, homes, and  cars. Many have U.S. citizen children. They are not a national security  concern. These are our neighbors and our friends who have done  everything that they could possibly do to be on the right side of the  law and on the right side of our communities.   Immigrants make America great. I urge passage.
