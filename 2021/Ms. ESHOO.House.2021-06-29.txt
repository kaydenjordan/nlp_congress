 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me  and certainly for his wonderful leadership on this issue.   Anyone that is tuned in this evening from across the country is  hearing a lot of passion spilling over at the podiums here, and for  very good reason. In 2017, despite the opposition of every single  Democrat in the United States House of Representatives and some  Republicans, Congress passed a tax law that bulldozed the State and  local tax deductibility. This hurts a lot of people.   Now, that was close to a $5 trillion package and so why was this  bulldozed? They went through the Tax Code looking for things that were  deductible to lower the price tag of a highly inequitable tax package.  And the SALT deduction, as it is known, was then capped at $10,000 for  both individuals and then for married couples filing jointly.   I viewed this then, as I do today, as an assault on the middle class  of our country. It was one of the main reasons that I voted against the  2017 tax law. Now I think that if you ask the question of 435 Members  of the House: Do you support the middle class? They would all say  ``yes.'' But the Record shows something else.   We know that everyone aspires to get into the middle class, and we  know that the middle class, as my father always used to say, is made up  of extraordinary, ordinary people who are the backbone of this country.  And that is why this policy is so wrong and it is so hurtful.   This is a very important deduction for the middle class. Middle  class, you file long term, and you have four areas that you can deduct:  mortgage interest deduction, charitable contributions, healthcare  expenses, and State and local taxes. And they wiped that out.   Now, you tell me whether that is fair or not. I don't think so. And I  don't think people across the country do either. Capping the SALT  deduction affects nearly 200,000 families in my congressional district.   I am not talking about the whole State of California. I am talking  about California's 18th Congressional District, and it has raised taxes  on over a million households in the State of California. Prior to this  harmful cap, my constituents--hold on to your seats, hold on to your  hats--deducted an average of $63,083 in State and local taxes. Wiped it  out.   Some have unfairly, I think, maligned the SALT deduction as a benefit  for the wealthy. I think it is an essential deduction for taxpayers in  high-cost, high-tax States like California. And that has been spoken to  earlier. That is a very important legitimate case to be made. In the  bay area, the beautiful bay area of California, northern California,  the cost of living is really very expensive, and it keeps going up.                                time  2000    And it is so high that the Economic Policy Institute estimates that a  family of four needs to earn more than $100,000 to earn a modest but  adequate standard of living. That is simply a fact.   So prior to the law, more than 3 million households in California  with an income of less than that annually claimed this deduction, as  did nearly one-third of taxpayers nationwide.   This evening, I think each one of us can outline why this is wrong;  why the deductibility needs to be restored. Congress needs to reform  our tax code. And when we do, so should the restoration of this  deductibility be restored.   Why?   Because, again, the middle class is the backbone of America. We  should not be assaulting them. We should be assisting them.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for leading this effort this  evening. It is a worthy one.
