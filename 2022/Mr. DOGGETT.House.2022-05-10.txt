 Madam Speaker, tonight we stand with courageous  Ukrainians who refuse to give in to Putin's war crimes.   The morning after this unprovoked attack, I authored the first  sanctions legislation in this Congress. Eventually, it may help. But  what is needed immediately is more weapons and humanitarian relief.   Undoubtedly, Putin was encouraged by those he hoped would divide the  West, like his admirer President Trump, who declared Putin ``a genius''  and called this ``a peacekeeping mission,'' and his close adviser who,  even after the bombing got underway, claimed that Putin was being too  gentle.   With our weapons, Ukrainians defend not only themselves, but freedom  and democracy everywhere. Tonight, I hope that Republicans will join  Democrats in what is truly a test of our commitment to freedom.  Together, we offer strong support for Ukraine to push back on the  brutal aggressor, end this terror, and maintain its independence.
