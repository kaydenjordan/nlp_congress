 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the HEROES Act, our  fifth coronavirus aid package.   Right now, Americans are losing loved ones, jobs, their health  insurance, and their patience. The only aid that they will get is  whatever we provide them.   Government exists to help the country in times of great need, and  there might not ever be a greater time in our lifetime than right now.  I am shocked that many of my Republican colleagues seem not to care.   The price might be high, but the price of doing nothing is always  higher. Our constituents count on us to do the right thing. This bill  is the right thing for American workers, American families, and  American businesses.
