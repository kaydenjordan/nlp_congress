 Mr. Speaker, the irresponsible policies  of Biden have caused the most threatening border crisis in American  history.   This illegal alien invasion exposes families to potential terrorists,  human trafficking, and dangerous drugs.   Since Biden took office in January 2021, there have been over 5.2  million illegal crossings. Mr. Speaker, 10,300 illegal aliens came over  the border on May 9 this year, the highest ever.   Gruesomely, another 1.5 million illegal aliens have crossed without  being detained. That includes over 200 on the terrorist watch list,  putting every American family everywhere at risk of mass murder.   Drug cartels are destabilizing Mexico and killing over 107,000  Americans annually, mostly due to fentanyl.   I am grateful House Republicans, led by Speaker Kevin McCarthy, have  passed the Secure the Border Act, stopping illegal aliens.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the safe haven of Afghanistan to America with open Biden borders.                            ____________________
