 Madam Speaker, with the 50th anniversary of the Clean  Water Act, it is important to remind the Biden administration that  Congress did not give the EPA jurisdiction over every puddle in  America, despite what they are trying to claim.   The 2015 Waters of the United States rule was nothing short of a land  and water grab that gave bureaucrats the ability to meddle in  intermittent and ephemeral streams, such as the kind farmers use for  draining and irrigation.   Under the 2015 WOTUS rule, the EPA could fine farmers thousands of  dollars if they simply rotated from one crop to another on their own  land without first gaining permission from a Government entity.   Then the Trump administration, through the Navigable Waters  Protection Rule, eliminated the significant nexus standard set by the  WOTUS rule which solved much of the overreach and uncertainty around  it.   The Navigable Waters Protection Rule clearly identified WOTUS in six  categories and made further clarifications of the definitions of  tributaries and adjacent wetlands.    So I was very dismayed by the EPA's and U.S. Corps of Engineers'  decision to reverse the 2020 Navigable Waters Protection Rule and  restart the rulemaking process around the definition of what is a  navigable water.   If President Biden were serious about helping farmers grow food to  supply Americans and the world during this global food shortage, he  would return to the Navigable Waters Protection Rule to give farmers  certainty and then customers at the grocery store shelf certainty in  price and availability of food.                            ____________________
