 Mr. Speaker, rolling back financial regulations that are  in place to protect the American people will put them and our country's  economic security at risk. However, the Financial CHOICE Act that is  being considered by Congress today does just that: it erodes  protections against dishonest big bank practices that rob people of  their hard-earned salaries.   This bill repeals the Volcker rule. It dismantles the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, strips regulations in place to protect the  American people's savings, and actually lets the big banks maintain  even less capital that they need to absorb catastrophic losses, making  it so that they are relying once again on the American taxpayer to bail  them out.   We don't need to remind the families who have suffered so much about  the pain caused by the Great Recession. In my own home State of Hawaii,  from 2008 to 2010, our unemployment rate more than doubled, and 11  million people in America lost their homes. The big banks of 2008 are  even bigger and more powerful today.   I urge my colleagues to reject this dangerous bill and, instead, pass  H.R. 790, the Return to Prudent Banking Act, which would reinstate a  21st century Glass-Steagall Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Hawaii?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Hawaii?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, our current immigration policies are  hurting families, tearing them apart, and deporting people who are part  of the very fabric of our communities.   I have a few people in particular I plan to talk about and whose  stories I will be sharing, but first I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. O'Rourke ), my colleague and friend.   Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from  Hawaii for yielding to me and for her leadership on this issue. I  served with her for 2 years on the Homeland Security Committee of the  House of Representatives and saw her ability to balance the national  interests and capitalizing and maximizing the opportunity that  immigrants provide and have always provided to the United States while  ensuring that we protect the homeland and our sacred commitment to  every person and family that we represent to make sure that they are  safe.   I think that the community that I have the honor of representing in  Congress, El Paso, Texas, is a case in point. We are one of the safest  cities in the United States today.   If you use the FBI's crime statistics as crunched by CQ Press, they  routinely rank El Paso, Texas, the safest city in not just the State of  Texas, but in the United States. For the last 20 years, we have been  the safest, second safest, or third safest in the country. That is not  in spite of the fact that we are connected with Mexico--our sister city  is Ciudad Juarez--and it is not in spite of the fact that 24 percent of  the people that I represent were born in another country, most of them  in Mexico.   In fact, our security, our success, our strength is connected to the  fact that we are a city of immigrants, that we are connected to the  rest of the world through our shared border with Mexico, and that  understanding that is critical to preserving the security and public  safety which is such a critical part of our job. I will give you an  example.  [[Page H4691]]    Not too long ago, under this administration, a woman who was an  undocumented immigrant from Mexico was in an El Paso County courtroom  seeking a protective order because her boyfriend threatened her life.  The judge in that courtroom granted that protective order, and as that  woman was leaving the courtroom, she was apprehended by a plainclothes  Border Patrol agent. That has never, to my knowledge, happened in our  community in the El Paso County Courthouse.   The consequences of that are not just that this one person was taken  off the streets and placed into detention and custody. The consequence  is that we have fewer people from the immigrant community in El Paso  coming forward to serve as witnesses to crimes, to report crimes in the  first place, to testify, to take part in the criminal justice system in  a way that has kept our community safe.   By definition, today, because of that one act, because of the climate  of fear and intimidation and anxiety produced by this administration,  El Paso, Texas, the State of Texas, this country is less safe.   If we want to respond to the most urgent issue that each constituent  of ours depends on us for, that is their safety, their security, that  of the community and the country that we serve, then we need to make  sure that we treat everyone within our communities that we represent  with dignity and respect. We need to make sure that local law  enforcement is not seen as a tool of Federal immigration law, but that  they are there to preserve and to protect the peace and to serve the  constituents and the people who live in those communities.   I would also add that next week marks the fifth anniversary of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program implemented  under President Obama. It was an important step that this country took  to realize the gains that we and future generations will receive by  ensuring that those young people who arrived on our shores and through  our land ports of entry like El Paso, through no fault of their own, at  the tender age of 5 or 6 years old and who are now in school or want to  serve in our military or want to create jobs themselves are able to  stay here and flourish so that we receive the benefit of their  potential.   I hope this Congress, every colleague from both sides of the aisle,  will work with me and others to ensure that we have, if not  comprehensive immigration reform, which I think should remain the goal,  reform in those areas like for the DREAMers and the DACA beneficiaries  that is most urgent and to the States that we represent and serve, like  Texas, with 200,000 DACA beneficiaries out of 700,000 nationwide. It is  the right thing to do for our security. It is the right thing to do for  economic growth and job creation. It is the right thing to do in the  best interests and traditions of this country.   So I conclude by again thanking the gentlewoman from Hawaii for  leading this discussion on this critically important issue, and I thank  her for the privilege of being able to speak tonight.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his leadership and  his commitment to not only the families and the people in his district,  but to the challenges that many families are facing all across the  country, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on these  issues.   Some of these challenges that face families across the country touch  my constituents in Hawaii as well. I would like to share a few of their  stories and their challenges here today in the hopes that Congress and  this administration take action and do the right thing for them and for  our country.   We are a nation of immigrants. Andres Magana Ortiz's story is not a  new one. It is not one that will surprise anyone.                                time  1730    In fact, it will be quite recognizable to most of us. No tradition is  as American as telling the stories of our relatives and ancestors who,  against all odds and great difficulties, found and made a home here on  our shores.   But while our family histories remind us of how far we have come,  Andres' story demonstrates the progress that we have yet to make and  who is hurt and affected by the lack of that progress today.   Andres Ortiz came to Hawaii seeking the American Dream. With hard  work, perseverance, and a little luck, Andres demonstrated what we, as  Americans, know to be true and that we strive for: if you work hard,  you can succeed and get ahead.   Andres started a new life in 1996 picking coffee--backbreaking, tough  work, for anyone who has done it before--in the Kona region on the  island of Hawaii. He proved himself smart and capable, and he was soon  promoted to supervisor. By 2010, he saved enough to buy his own coffee  farm. Today, he owns 20 acres of coffee trees, and manages another 150  acres for his neighbors.   Andres quickly earned a reputation as a knowledgeable and skillful  farmer. When an invasive beetle, called the coffee berry borer, began  to ravish our Kona coffee farms and trees, Andres began a pioneering  system to help his community track and eradicate this infestation, even  before our U.S. Department of Agriculture took action. Now, this  infestation was not just a small matter. It was something that cost our  farmers millions of dollars.   Our country offered Andres the means to become an entrepreneur, and  he paid us back in full: he started a business, he creates jobs, he  takes care of his workers, and he is a leader in our community. Andres  is not a legal resident of Hawaii, but Hawaii owes him a debt for his  contributions.   Managing the coffee farm is a family affair for Andres. He is a proud  husband and father of three children. His wife and kids are all  American citizens, and his kids only know Hawaii as home.   Andres embodies the spirit of the American Dream, and serves as an  example of why we should welcome courageous, hardworking immigrants  into our community. The reality that Andres faces now, sadly, is far  different.   If Andres is deported to Mexico, as is supposed to happen in just a  few days, his family, their farm, and Kona coffee growers are going to  face an uncertain future. Without Andres to run the business, his  family could lose their farm and lose their home. Their neighbors will  lose a friend and a business partner. Brenda, his wife, will be without  her husband, and their three children will be without their father.   If Andres is forced to leave, the law will keep him from his family  for 10 years. Should the family move to Mexico with Andres, they will  have to learn a new language and a new culture. His daughter will have  to drop out of college at the University of Hawaii and begin a new life  in another country. Relocating to Mexico would deprive them of the  benefits afforded to the citizens of this country.   Now, unfortunately, Andres's story is not a singular one.  Unfortunately, there are more.   Just last week, Graham Ellis of Waimea, a 67-year-old British  national and leukemia patient, heard a knock on his door. It was two  Department of Homeland Security agents who have come to begin the  deportation process back to the U.K. after Graham had made Hawaii his  home for over 36 years. After a few short minutes of conversation in  front of his wife, Dena, who is an American citizen, Graham agreed to  turn himself in at a field office in Honolulu the following day.   Now, like Mr. Ortiz, Graham is a pillar within our community in  Hawaii. But unlike Mr. Ortiz, Graham had already made the decision to  return to the U.K. because he feared that deportation was inevitable  under the heightened threats faced under our current immigration  policies. Graham had made the decision to leave by the end of summer,  thinking that these remaining months would give him time to get his  affairs in order, and say good-bye to the community and the home that  he grew to love for so long.   A circus performer by training, Graham spent much of his life in  Hawaii teaching children from low-income and at-risk communities circus  arts, bringing smiles and laughter to their faces and their lives.   He served on the Puna Community Council, and was the founding  president of the Kalapana Seaview Estates Community Association.   In his remaining final months, he had planned to make a trip to  Kauai, where he would instruct his last group of young, passionate  students at a 2-week  [[Page H4692]]  superhero-themed circus camp before shutting it down for good.   Our immigration system is broken. We need a pathway to citizenship  for immigrants to ensure people who deserve to be here can find a way  to be a part of our great country. We need real immigration reform that  keeps families together and integrates hardworking, tax-paying  immigrants into our community. We need to preserve, protect, and  restore the values that underlie the greatness of our country.   I stand with Andres and Graham and the millions of hardworking  immigrants who built our great Nation; and I stand with these  immigrants who live in my community, who live in my district, and who  have a proven record of upstanding contributions to our community.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto), my  colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from  Florida for complimenting my State, but for, most importantly, again,  putting a face and names to those who are suffering as a result of our  broken immigration policy.   You know, for us here, we can stand here and talk about policies and  debate them and talk about legislation that needs to be passed. But it  is really those folks at home who make it all very real. It is not just  a bill number, it is their own family that is being torn apart, it is  their own children who are being affected.   Now, you know, I talked about Mr. Ortiz in Hawaii. He and his family  are going through this, as we speak, where, in just a few days, he  faces being deported. He and his family have exhausted all the options  available to them, given the time that they have.   Our delegation from Hawaii, both my colleague, Congresswoman  Hanabusa, as well as our Senators, Senator Hirono and Senator Schatz,  we have all sent a letter to Secretary Kelly, Department of Homeland  Security, urging him to reconsider this order and to halt Mr. Ortiz's  deportation, taking a consideration to him and his circumstance and his  longstanding commitment and leadership in our community.   I have introduced legislation, H.R. 2794, which is what is called a  private bill, specifically for the relief of Andres Magana Ortiz. And  the purpose of this bill is to help Mr. Ortiz with his extremely  challenging situation and to help him on his own path to citizenship.   I urge Chairman Goodlatte to give positive consideration to this bill  that has been referred to his committee. I urge Secretary Kelly, the  Department of Homeland Security, to revisit their policy and their  decision and to put a halt on Mr. Ortiz's deportation. He is not just a  number. He is not just a statistic. He and his family are facing this  reality today.   It is always the right time to do the right thing, and I urge these  leaders to do that right thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
