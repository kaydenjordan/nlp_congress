Sec. 3.  On any legislative day during the period from       January 16, 2017, through January 20, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time,  [[Page H317]]       within the limits of clause 4, section 5, article I of the       Constitution, to be announced by the Chair in declaring the       adjournment.        Sec. 4.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 3 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 5.

The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.    The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bost). The gentleman from Washington is  recognized for 1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my  good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my  good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Washington?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 40, providing for the consideration  of two important pieces of legislation: H.R. 238, the Commodity End- User Relief Act, and H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act.   The rule provides for the consideration of these measures under a  structured rule and makes in order any amendment submitted to the House  Rules Committee, including all five Democratic amendments to H.R. 78,  as well as all eight amendments submitted for H.R. 238, allowing for a  balanced debate on these very substantial issues.   H.R. 238 is essential to the smooth functioning of the American  economy and is long overdue for enactment into law. This important  legislation reauthorizes until 2021 the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission, also known as the CFTC, which had its statutory authority  lapse in 2013. The House passed the Commodity End-User Relief Act with  bipartisan support in the 114th Congress, and a similar bill was also  adopted in the 113th Congress, establishing a strong record of  bipartisan support for this measure. Unfortunately, in both instances,  the Senate failed to take up the legislation before the end of its  respective Congress, which is why it is imperative that we pass this  bill through both Chambers and send it to the President's desk.   After the financial crisis of 2008, practically everyone agreed that  changes needed to be made to our financial services sector in order to  protect families, farmers, small businesses, and our economy, as well  as to prevent another crisis in the future. Like many of my colleagues,  I have concerns with some of the reforms that were instituted in  response to the crisis because they have put overly burdensome  restrictions and regulations on our economy and our business  communities. But like every major, comprehensive law, there are always  unintended consequences that need to be addressed, and H.R. 238 does  exactly that.   For example, the authors of Dodd-Frank argued the law's main purpose  was to reduce systemic risk to our economy. However, I don't think  anyone would argue that farmers who are simply trying to lock in a good  price for their corn or their wheat are a systemic risk to the economy.  Similarly, restaurant chains looking to make sure they have enough  beef, enough pork, or enough potatoes to sell to their customers don't  pose a systemic risk, just as utility companies seeking to ensure that  they have adequate power supplies to meet the needs and demands of  their ratepayers did not cause the financial crisis. Unfortunately, the  current law imposes rules that treat all of these entities as major  risks to our economy, and it imposes overly burdensome capital and  paperwork requirements on them.   Mr. Speaker, critics may claim that this bill undermines consumer  protections. However, this could not be further from the truth.   Title I of the legislation puts in place greater consumer  protections, like requiring brokerage firms to notify investors before  moving funds from one account to another in order to prevent abuses  like those that occurred at MF Global prior to its bankruptcy.   Title II makes reforms to the CFTC and strengthens the cost-benefit  analysis the Commission must perform when considering the impacts of  its rules. Opponents have claimed that requiring cost-benefit analyses  will open up the CFTC to lawsuits. However, H.R. 238 merely gives the  CFTC a standard for writing good rules the first time, which will be a  benefit for all of us.   Title III provides relief to the farmers, the restaurants, the  manufacturers, the utilities, and other entities which rely on a steady  supply of commodities and inherently want to avoid risk but have been  caught up in the unintended consequences of the Dodd-Frank reforms.  These users have a genuine need to use markets to hedge against bad  weather, natural disasters, inflation, price shocks, and other  unforeseen circumstances that could jeopardize their ability to serve  their customers.   The rule also provides for the consideration of H.R. 78, the SEC  Regulatory Accountability Act. This legislation replaces guidance  adopted by the SEC in 2012 that currently governs the use of economic  analysis in SEC rulemakings and requires the SEC to identify and assess  the significance of problems prior to regulating. It directs the agency  to conduct a review of existing regulations within 1 year of  enactment--and then every 5 years thereafter--to determine the  sufficiency, the effectiveness, and the burdens associated with their  implementation. Further, H.R. 78 instructs the SEC's Chief Economist to  conduct a cost-benefit analysis on regulations the agency is  promulgating as well as to provide an explanation describing the SEC's  decision-making process, including the implications of not taking the  regulatory action.   Economic analysis is the cornerstone of prudent rulemaking and  entails evaluating the qualitative and quantitative costs and benefits  of proposed regulations as well as potential alternatives in order to  determine the correct action an agency should take. We must ensure  Federal regulators are thoroughly assessing both the need for the  regulation and adequately evaluating its potential consequences-- intended as well as unintended--to prevent small businesses and job  creators from being unnecessarily burdened by onerous Federal  regulations.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for the  consideration of two bills that will hold Federal agencies and their  rulemaking processes accountable to the American people. Voters sent a  clear message in November that they want a Federal Government that is  smaller, less intrusive, and more discerning in its regulatory actions.  House Republicans created our A Better Way agenda by listening to  Americans about the ideas for our Nation, and the new, unified  Republican government will continue our work to change the status quo  and provide real progress for all Americans. The adoption of this rule  and the passage of the underlying bills is yet another opportunity to  show that we heard this message loud and clear and that we will  reinforce our commitment to restoring the people's voice in our Federal  Government.    I am proud to support the rule providing for the consideration of  these measures, and I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, in fact, if I could read from a letter I received this  morning from over two dozen agricultural groups. In one sentence, it  says: ``Thank you in advance for your support of this bill that is so  important to U.S. farmers, ranchers, hedgers and futures customers.''  It is signed, like I said, by over two dozen organizations.   I include in the Record the letter I received this morning, I think,  as did my colleague, Representative Polis, from over two dozen  agricultural groups and associations located throughout the country in  unanimous support of H.R. 238.                                                   January 11, 2017.        Dear Member of the House of Representatives: The       undersigned organizations represent a very broad cross-      section of U.S. production agriculture and agribusiness. We       urge you to cast an affirmative vote on H.R. 238, the       ``Commodity End-User Relief Act,'' when it moves to the floor       for consideration.        This legislation contains a number of important provisions       for agricultural and agribusiness hedgers who use futures and       swaps to manage their business and production risks. Some,       but certainly not all, of the bill's important provisions       include:        Sections 101-103--Codify important customer protections to       help prevent another MF Global situation.        Section 104--Provides a permanent solution to the residual       interest problem that would have put more customer funds at       risk--and potentially driven farmers, ranchers and small       hedgers out of futures markets--by forcing pre-margining of       their hedge accounts.        Section 306--Relief from burdensome and technologically       infeasible recordkeeping requirements in commodity markets.        Section 308--Requires the CFTC to conduct a study and issue       a rule before reducing the de minimis threshold for swap       dealer registration in order to make sure that doing so would       not harm market liquidity and end-user access to markets.        Section 311--Confirms the intent of Dodd-Frank that       anticipatory hedging is considered bona fide hedging       activity.        Thank you in advance for your support of this bill that is       so important to U.S. farmers, ranchers, hedgers and futures       customers.            Sincerely,        American Cotton Shippers Association, American Farm Bureau       Federation, American Feed Industry Association, American       Soybean Association, Grain and Feed Association of Illinois,       Kansas Grain and Feed Association, Michigan Agri-Business       Association, Michigan Bean Shippers, National Association of       Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef Association,       National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council.        National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Grain and       Feed Association, National Milk Producers Federation,       National Pork Producers Council, National Sorghum Producers,       Nebraska Grain and Feed Association, North American Millers       Association, Northeast Agribusiness and Feed Alliance, Ohio       AgriBusiness Association, South Dakota Grain and Feed       Association, USA Rice, Wisconsin Agri-Business Association.   [[Page H319]]          Mr. Speaker, also, in response to just one of the  points that my colleague brought up, in the first 2 weeks of this 115th  Congress, the Speaker, as well as the chairman of the Rules Committee,  Representative Sessions, has provided opportunity for all Members to  appear before the Rules Committee, has invited all Members to submit  amendments. In fact, I can gladly say and happily say that every  amendment submitted on these two bills has been accepted, if they were  proven to be germane.   In fact, one of the arguments made by my good friend is that the  freshmen have not had an opportunity to weigh in on these two pieces of  legislation. Actually, the young freshman from Maryland had an  amendment brought forward, and it was accepted to bring for  consideration on the floor. So I think the arguments fall hollow that  Members have not had an opportunity to be heard.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Conaway), the good chairman of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, while I applaud the optimism and  enthusiasm of the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis) about defeating  the previous question, getting back to the debate on the rule, I have  no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the discussion over the past few  minutes. I believe that this rule and the underlying bills are strong  measures that are important to the future of our country.   This rule provides for ample debate on the floor, the opportunity to  consider and vote on both H.R. 238 and H.R. 78, as well as every  amendment that was submitted to the House Rules Committee, which  reflects the balanced, open, and deliberative process afforded by this  rule.   H.R. 238 is a solid, substantial measure that will address several  critical issues that the CFTC and end user are facing, while also  addressing the CFTC's lapsed reauthorization with reauthorizing the  Commission through 2021. While some opponents have called for an open  rule, this structured rule makes all eight submitted amendments in  order.   Mr. Speaker, no one wants to see complete deregulation of our  financial services industries and our commodities and derivatives  markets. However, it is critical that the regulations put in place are  appropriate for our economy and our users. These rules have to provide  safeguards and prevent systemic risk but should not hinder our entire  economy with one-size-fits-all regulations.   As we have discussed today, the current rules place enormous  compliance and financial burdens on small businesses, on farmers and  ranchers, utilities, and manufacturers. They take these small, risk- averse entities and place them under the same regulatory scheme as  large financial institutions and hedge funds. H.R. 238 will  differentiate and exempt the end users who are not a cause of systemic  risk--as these entities inherently want to avoid risk--and, thus,  shouldn't be subject to the same rules and requirements as financial  and investment firms that are less risk averse in nature.   The Commodity End-User Relief Act would make much-needed reforms at  the CFTC to strengthen their rulemaking process and add commonsense  consumer protections so these regulations are not a continual burden on  our Nation's farmers and small businesses.    Mr. Speaker, the rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 78  under a structured rule and makes all five Democratic amendments in  order. This legislation takes important steps to engrain a stronger  commitment to economic analysis at the SEC, which will facilitate the  promulgation of reasonable rules that do not unduly burden registered  companies or negatively impact job creation. The measure will increase  transparency and oversight, while facilitating additional analysis and  reviews of existing regulations, which should be something that all  Members of this body can support.   As elected Representatives, I believe we must ensure our regulatory  framework is not politicized and that Federal regulators are thoroughly  assessing both the need for the regulation as well as adequately  evaluating its potential consequences. This bill takes important steps  towards achieving all of these goals.   It is important to remember that the financial crisis was not caused  by the farmer who grows the food you eat for dinner, or by the utility  you buy electricity from, or by the people who provide the wood in your  desk or the metal used in your car. I don't know of any reason why we  should continue to treat them as if they were responsible, which is  what the current law does and is what H.R. 238 seeks to correct.   Further, better informing the American people of the true impact of  major regulations does nothing to diminish the ability of regulators to  adequately address illegal or inappropriate activities but, rather,  increases transparency and the efficacy of Federal rules, which is why  passage of H.R. 78 is so critical both to our constituents and to our  economy.   Mr. Speaker, this is a strong rule that provides for open and fair  consideration of these vital pieces of legislation as well as every  amendment that  [[Page H321]]  was submitted to the House Rules Committee. I am proud to speak in  favor of this rule, and I urge all of my colleagues to support House  Resolution 40 and both of the underlying bills.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 40 Offered by Mr. Polls         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       371) to address financial conflicts of interest of the       President and Vice President. The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the Majority Leader and the       Minority Leader or their respective designees. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 371.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
