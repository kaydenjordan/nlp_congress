 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill, authored by Representative Paul A. Gosar, authorizes the  conveyance of approximately 8,800 acres of Bureau of Land Management  land to La Paz County, Arizona, for the development of renewable  energy. The BLM land has been identified as suitable for disposal, and  the county is required to pay full-market value and all the  administrative costs associated with the conveyance. The bill also  includes important safeguards for Tribal cultural property and is  supported by the Colorado River Indian Tribes.   This is a targeted sale of public land for a very specific public  purpose that ensures a fair return for taxpayer-owned assets. Our  support for this bill does not mean that we support the wholesale  disposal of public land.   Federal land is a public resource, and the conveyance of any part of  this resource should include guarantees to protect the public's  interest. The proceeds of any conveyance authorized by Congress should  be reinvested back into land conservation efforts.   Without this important safeguard, the accumulation of individual  conveyances potentially threatens the viability of our system of public  lands. This is not yet included in this bill, so I do hope, Mr.  Speaker, that we can work with our Senate colleagues to make this bill  even better as it moves through the legislative process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), the bill's sponsor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to add a few words to this bill. Nearly 20  years ago, Congress authorized the Adams Memorial Foundation to  construct a commemorative work with private funds in honor of President  John Adams, First Lady Abigail Adams, President John Quincy Adams, and  other prominent members of the Adams family associated with the early  history of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Lynch and the entire  Massachusetts delegation for their hard work and commitment to honoring  the legacy of one their State's most influential political families.   A permanent memorial in the Nation's capital is a fitting tribute,  and I hope that we can work with our Senate colleagues to deliver this  bill to the President's desk and finally get it done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill extends the Lewis and Clark National Historic  Trail by 1,200 miles to include three new segments that correspond to  the preparation and return phases of the expedition.   Under the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2018, the study of  possible additional Eastern Legacy sites to add to the Lewis and Clark  Historic Trail identified three nationally significant trail segments.   The first trail identified is a segment of the Ohio River that  Meriwether Lewis used as a testing ground for supplies and weapons  prior to his epic journey.   Another trail, stretching from the falls of Ohio to the confluence of  the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, recognizes where Lewis and Clark first  met.   The last trail that will be included under this bill begins at the  confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi River and stretches until the  Wood River in Illinois, which is the current starting point of the  National Historic Trail.   The Lewis and Clark story is an important part of our collective  history, and I hope that we can continue working together to discover  and preserve pieces of America's legacy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill  sponsored by Representative Luke Messer.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that the full House will soon vote on  my bill, H.R. 5875, supported by all six Members of Congress  representing the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. My  bipartisan bill will ensure that Guam, the other U.S. territories, and  D.C. receive their fair share of annual funding under the Pittman- Robertson and Dingell-Johnson acts.   This Federal funding supports fish and wildlife conservation and  enhances hunting, sport fishing, boating, and other outdoor  recreational opportunities at no cost to taxpayers.   Each State and territorial fish and wildlife agency receives a yearly  allocation of this Federal funding. However, current Federal law places  arbitrary caps on how much funding the five territories and D.C. may  receive, forcing us to split the smallest State's share six ways. My  bipartisan bill will fix this by providing each territory and D.C. the  same funding percentage guaranteed for each State.   My bill will also allow the Secretary of the Interior to exercise his  or her full discretion in allocating this funding based on the same  criteria applied to the States.   Lastly, H.R. 5875 will make technical changes in the U.S. Code to  correct errors in these two Federal laws.   I thank our Natural Resources Committee chairman, Mr.  Rob Bishop,  for his partnership in bringing my bill to the floor.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Representative McClintock  from California, for his very favorable comments on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, which is sponsored by Representative Rogers  from Kentucky, establishes the Mill Springs Battlefield National  Monument in the State of Kentucky to preserve, protect, and interpret  for current and future generations, the historic resources of the Mill  Springs Battlefield and its role in the American Civil War.   Mill Springs Battlefield in Pulaski County, Kentucky, was the site of  the Union's first decisive victory in the western theater of the  American Civil War. Given the Confederacy's presence in the South, the  Union's performance in Kentucky was perceived as a pivotal turning  point in the war.   President Abraham Lincoln articulated the strategic importance of  Kentucky by stating: ``I hope to have God on my side, but I must have  Kentucky.''   This monument designation is a fitting tribute to the historical  significance of Mill Springs and an encouraging sign that we can  continue to work across political lines to ensure that our most  important places are preserved for future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this bill. I have no  further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is sponsored by Mr. Reed of New York, and it  officially designates the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New  York, as the National Comedy Center and recognizes it as the only  museum that exists to celebrate comedy in the United States.   The National Comedy Center is set to open for the first time early  next month. This honorary recognition will highlight the museum and the  importance of the comedic arts which brighten the lives of everyday  Americans.   I want to congratulate Congressman Reed for his hard work on behalf  of Jamestown, New York, and the Comedy Center. I am very happy to lend  my support to the preservation of institutions that preserve parts of  our cultural identity, and I do urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we should all be smiling when we say we  support this bill--and that is no laughing matter.   Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes a small change to the previously  approved water rights settlement in order to allow the White Mountain  Apache Tribe in Arizona to complete work on a rural water system.   Specifically, the bill clarifies that funding Congress has already  authorized for water-related economic development projects can be used  to cover possible construction cost overruns associated with the  Tribe's main water project, which will provide drinking water supplies  for Tribal members once completed.    In addition, section 2 of the bill clarifies that the Pueblos of  Santa Clara and Ohkay Owingeh in New Mexico are authorized to lease all  of their Tribal lands for up to 99 years. Currently, the Pueblos have  the option to enter into 99-year leases only on their trust lands, as  this option is not extended to their restricted fee lands.   Passage of this provision will correct that discrepancy, allowing the  Pueblos the same flexibility in leasing terms that other Tribes already  possess.   I would like to thank our New Mexico colleagues, Senator Tom Udall  and Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, for advocating for this issue and for  getting this provision included in the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill which is sponsored by Senator Jeff Flake.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, as amended, would designate the Quindaro  Townsite in Kansas city, Kansas, as a national commemorative site, an  honorary designation under the National Park System.   The town of Quindaro was founded in 1857 and was a key site during  the Bleeding Kansas conflict, serving as a safe port of entry into  Kansas on the Missouri River for those opposed to slavery. In addition,  the town aided runaway slaves as they escaped to freedom in Kansas  through the Underground Railroad.   Local government, private entities, and individual stakeholders in  the area have been working to elevate the status of the Quindaro  Townsite for years, and I am glad we were able to recognize its  important cultural legacy with this bill.   I want to congratulate Congressman Yoder on his hard work, and I want  to commend my colleagues from across the aisle for coming up with an  appropriate designation for this site. Designation of Quindaro Townsite  as a national commemorative site is a fitting tribute that ensures the  sacrifices, struggles, and triumphs of its early residents will never  be forgotten.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6631]]         Mr. Speaker, I wish to mention that I have enjoyed  working with Mr. McClintock of California on these Natural Resources  bills. It was a joy to have bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
