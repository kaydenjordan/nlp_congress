 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5497,  ``Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act of 2021''  or BURMA Act.   The purpose of this bill is to authorize humanitarian assistance and  civil society support, promote democracy and human rights, and impose  targeted sanctions with respect to human rights abuses in Burma.   The legislation condemns the actions taken by the Burmese military  during its coup on February 1, 2021 and its aftermath.  [[Page H4212]]    The BURMA Act:   Authorizes sanctions on individuals and entities who helped stage the  February 1 coup d'etat and are responsible for the subsequent  repression of fundamental freedoms, human rights abuses, use of  indiscriminate violence towards civilians, and other gross atrocities.   Prohibits the import of precious and semi-precious gemstones from  Burma into the United States.   Authorizes a new position at the State Department, a Special  Coordinator for Burmese Democracy, to promote an international effort  to impose and enforce multilateral sanctions on Burma and coordinate  United States Government interagency efforts on Burma.   Authorizes support to civil society and for humanitarian assistance  in Burma, Bangladesh, Thailand, and the surrounding region.   Calls for the Department of State to make a genocide determination  with regard to the persecution of the Rohingya.   Calls for the United States to pressure the United Nations to take  more decisive action with regards to Burma.   By authorizing targeted sanctions against the Burmese military, the  Burmese Administrative Council and affiliated entities, the bill holds  accountable those responsible for the perpetration of the coup and the  ensuing atrocities that have claimed over a thousand lives.   It has been a little over a year since the Burmese military staged  its illegal and illegitimate coup, reversing years of reform and  Burma's fragile transition to democracy.   The military regime has killed more than 1,728 people since February  of 2021, including around 100 children, and illegally detained more  than 13,084 people.   The violence toward its own citizens has displaced roughly 400,000  people within the country.   This brings the estimated total of internally displaced persons to  776,000 and of refugees and asylum-seekers in neighboring countries to  more than 1 million.   People in Myanmar desperately need food, clean water and protection  to survive.   The BURMA Act would address these gaps by funding humanitarian  assistance and addressing issues in Myanmar including human rights  violations, displacement, and armed conflict.   Having previously lived under military rule and authoritarianism for  decades, the people of Myanmar responded to the coup with courage and  resistance.   Democracy activists flooded the streets, formed a shadow government,  and carried out a massive civil disobedience movement to shut down the  machinery of the state.   The tragedy underway in Myanmar epitomizes the battle between  democracy and authoritarianism.   However, the people of Myanmar have not received much support from  the international community, in efforts to condemn this coup the United  States must act now by expanding targeted sanctions to halt this.   The toll on the people of Burma has been truly staggering, under the  military's harsh rule, no one is safe from violence, arbitrary  detainment, military attack, and infringements on human rights.   I am optimistic that we will pass the BURMA Act to apply economic  pressure, provide humanitarian support, and redouble diplomatic efforts  against the military junta.   The people of Burma can no longer afford to wait, so neither should  we.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 5497 because these  people who have survived crimes against humanity, discrimination,  gender-based violence and forced displacement in Myanmar need the  humanitarian assistance this bill would provide.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the leadership of our  chairman and the working relationship with the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I was in Lithuania as the Russians were coming in, and I  spent a couple of days there with the hopes and dreams of many people  that, in actuality, there would not be an invasion of Russia into  Ukraine, even though we were being briefed on the 30,000 to 40,000  troops in Belarus.   Even on that day, we spoke to Ukraine parliamentarians, who indicated  that they were leaving the meeting we were in and taking a 17-hour trip  back to Ukraine as their son was standing up to join the Ukrainian  military.   Little did we expect--as some people said, ``just a couple of  days''--that we would be at a point where--we will not call it World  War III, but we will call it the most brutal, vicious, and murderous  effort in Europe and the world almost since World War II.   I cannot fathom the bodies found in a pit. I cannot understand moms  and babies dying in the street. I cannot understand or accept the  numbers of civilians targeted, their bodies strewn throughout the  various cities.   The movement to the east, the destruction of Odessa, and the  unwillingness of Vladimir Putin to even think of being serious at the  peace table--it is important to say pronounced war crimes have been  committed, that he must be at The Hague.   I believe Europe should be more pronounced in its annunciation. I  frankly believe that there is a heavier penalty that he must pay. I  don't believe he should sit at another table of Western civilization.   Most importantly, I rise to support this legislation and believe  America is right to insist on Mr. Putin being tried for war crimes.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7276 the  Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability Act, to  direct the President to submit a report to Congress on the United  States efforts to collect and analyze evidence and information related  to the war crimes committed by the Russian Federation during their  full-scale invasion of Ukraine.   This legislation requires the Administration to detail the process  our government will undertake to collect, analyze, and preserve  evidence of these war crimes, so that perpetrators of these and other  atrocities are held accountable.   There is no question of whether the Russian Federation, under the  direction of Vladimir Putin has been defying the laws of war throughout  its unprovoked, unjust, and unlawful invasion of Ukraine.   H.R. 7276 will ensure the U.S. maintains a coordinated effort to  collect evidence to be used to prosecute Russian war crimes in Ukraine.   This bill will help to deter future war crimes by ensuring Russian  troops and their commanders know the world is watching closely.   In the three decades since gaining its independence, Ukraine has  sought its own path to sovereignty and has pursued closer economic,  social, and political ties with the free market and democratic nations  of the West.   Since 2013, the Russian Federation under the direction of President  Vladimir Putin, has imposed a campaign of political, economic, and  military aggression against Ukraine.   In February 2014, the Russian military began the invasion of eastern  regions in Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula. The military also  backed separatist insurgents in the Donbass region, where fighting has  killed over 14,000 people.   Today the world is witnessing the unprovoked aggression and invasion  ordered by Vladimir Putin.   President Putin and his associates must be held personally liable for  the war crimes committed against the people of Ukraine.   Russia claims it is not attacking civilians, yet thousands of people  have been killed, mostly from explosive weapons with a wide impact  area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket  systems, and missile and air strikes.   Families are being separated by war, adults and children are being  ruthlessly killed, and civilian infrastructure has been completely  obliterated in parts of eastern Ukraine.   These reckless Russian attacks have leveled homes, preschools, post  offices, museums, sports facilities, hospitals, and factories.   Power and gas lines have been severed, bridges and railway stations  blown up intentionally to restrict refugee movement within the country.   Civilians have been killed in their cars, while waiting in bread  lines, and while seeking treatment in hospitals.   Remnants of a missile were found in a Ukrainian zoo, residential  neighborhoods have been shelled to pieces and morgues are overflowing  with bodies.   Additionally, a rogue Russia is violently crushing political speech  opposing the war from its own citizens.   As Russian ground forces advance in Ukraine, Ukrainians are  sheltering from artillery shells and cruise missiles in subways and  bomb shelters.   But in addition to the conventional military forces that Russia  brings to bear, Russia has been utilizing nonconventional warfare for  years.   Russia has been running a long-running campaign to cast Ukrainians as  Nazis and the perpetrators of genocide against Russian-speakers in  eastern Ukraine in order to justify an invasion.   The western world must continue to march in lockstep against this  senseless Russian invasion of a sovereign nation.   We will make it clear to President Putin that there is no possibility  for him to win this war when our alliances are as united and as  fortified as they are now and will continue to be throughout the entire  duration of this conflict.   Putin may seize ground, but he will never hold it.   Thank you, and I look forward to discussing recommended measures to  hold Russia accountable for this manufactured war.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, the people of the United States deserve  to know the truth. With all the ranting of my friends across the aisle,  the Constitution indicates that this Nation was formed to create a more  perfect Union.                                time  1445    There were those who incited January 6. There were those who  surrounded President Trump who did nothing to stop the violence and  terrorism of January 6. If witnesses come before a duly authorized  bipartisan committee and refuse to provide the American people with the  truth, then we need to stand here and provide them with a contempt  order so that the truth can be found.  [[Page H4227]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for this  contempt order for the truth for the American people and the sanctity  of the Constitution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager for yielding, and I  thank him for his leadership. I thank, of course, the chairwoman of the  Small Business Committee, Mr. Blumenauer, and the many supporters who  have provided support for this legislation.   I am hoping that as my colleagues begin to see the light, that they  will understand that it will be far worse for all of the employees who  are in restaurants that may close that they will not even be employed  to think about paying for any gas prices no matter how much they might  be.   I stand with them to ensure that inflation goes down and that we  respond to gasoline prices. But they are not clear in what we are doing  today. We are helping small and hard-hit businesses--sole proprietors,  independent contractors, and businesses that are not over 200  employees--to keep these employees who have suffered from the  devastation of the pandemic.   We are doing more. We are not spending an extra penny because we are  capturing those dollars from those who fraudulently used dollars  before. So we are making good on our promise to spend the American tax  dollars correctly. We are having a data collection. We are going to  have oversight on this particular program to ensure that it is spent  effectively.   We are going to respond, if you will, to the needs of the mom and  pops, the really oldest and distinguished restaurants like This is It  in Houston, Texas; Burns Original BBQ; and J&J as people who have  stood the storm yet, have kept employees but that didn't know whether  they could keep their doors open.   This is an important and vital piece of legislation. I support the  underlying legislation, which is the bill that deals with relief for  restaurants and other hard-hit small businesses and the underlying  rule.   Don't you get it?  [[Page H4235]]    We are keeping businesses open and keeping people employed. That is  what we are doing today. Support the rule and the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule to  consider H.R. 3807, the ``Relief for Restaurants and Other Hard Hit  Small Businesses Act of 2022,'' which provides $70.6 billion in FY2022  for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this committee is reconsidering this  critical piece of legislation for America's restaurant owners. The  American Rescue Plan made great progress in providing the funding in an  equitable manner, prioritizing women, veteran, and economically and  socially disadvantaged restaurant owners. In addition, the majority of  funds were reserved for restaurants whose gross receipts were no more  than $1,500,000 dollars.   It is essential to promote equity through the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund Mr. Speaker, considering that only 8 percent of  restaurants are owned by blacks and 23.8% of Asian owned businesses are  restaurants. As legislators we must do everything we can to ensure  their survival.   To underscore the personal importance this funding holds to me, I  would like to mention a widely loved, black owned, and historic Third  Ward restaurant: Cream Burger.   Cream Burger sits on the corner of Elgin and Scott and has been in  operation for 60 years. It is a cash only restaurant that has only had  two additions to the menu across the entirety of its existence: chili  cheese fries and bacon.   The Greenwood family has been serving the residents of the Third Ward  their delicious burgers and homemade ice cream for decades and has no  plans of closing any time soon.   The original owners of the restaurant, Verna and Willie Greenwood,  opened the restaurant to generate their own income and create  generational wealth, which they certainly have done. Ever since their  tragic passing, the business is now owned and operated by their  daughters, Beverly and Sandra.   Beverly and Sandra hope to pass the business onto the next generation  of children so they can, ``see it through. Maybe 100 years,'' Beverly  said.   The restaurant sees a range of Third Ward customers every day, from  the students at the University of Houston to the cashiers working at  the historic Houston Food Mart just down the street.   Cream Burger is iconic in the city of Houston, and I hold it in the  highest reverence. It, and so many restaurants like it, is one of those  restaurants that would receive funds from this legislation.   It is for that reason Mr. Speaker I support the rule to consider H.R.  3807, the ``Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Businesses  Act of 2022.'' It will help save so many businesses like the beloved  Cream Burger, so I urge my colleagues to support the rule as well.    Mr. Speaker, I will start with associating myself  with my colleagues who have just spoken and say, ``Glory to Ukraine''  and to indicate that my heart is broken. The words will not elevate the  despicable actions of Vladimir Putin.   Today we voted to secure and seek, I hope, an indictment. He is a war  criminal, and he is killing children.   But I must, Mr. Speaker, suggest that we have a difficult problem at  the border exacerbated by Governor Greg Abbott, who wishes to make a  mockery of the desperate people coming, including Ukrainian refugees,  who gather at the southern border. Today, he has announced that he will  bus these migrants to Washington, D.C.   I am embarrassed.   With the likes of George H.W. Bush, Ann Richards, Henry B. Gonzalez,  as well as Barbara Jordan, who are brothers and sisters of Texas, I now  have to live with Governor Greg Abbott who disgraces us by suggesting  that we must take migrants and drop them off on the steps of the  Capitol.   I welcome them.   Why don't we sit down and resolve how we deal with these desperate  people? Why don't we find a way, as we were trying to do with George W.  Bush, to have an immigration policy? But when he does that, he will  also do that to Ukrainian refugees at the southern border.   Enough is enough.                            ____________________
