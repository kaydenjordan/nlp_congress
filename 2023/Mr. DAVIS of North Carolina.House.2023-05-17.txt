 Madam Speaker, over the course of our  country's history, generations of American servicemembers have made  remarkable sacrifices to defend the freedoms we hold dear.   As we celebrate Armed Forces week, I ask for everyone across our  country to join me in saluting the men and women who protect us, defend  our freedoms, and safeguard the world from danger.   As a veteran of the United States Air Force, our servicemembers and  military families hold a special place in my heart, and I will always  fight to ensure they receive the respect and honor they deserve.   Madam Speaker, to the men and women who serve our Nation, I thank  them for their selfless service.                            ____________________
