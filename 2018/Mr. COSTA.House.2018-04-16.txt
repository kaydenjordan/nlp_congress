 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make clear the dangers of a  partisan farm bill that we are considering in the House Agriculture  Committee this week.   Bipartisanship is not simply a buzzword. Bipartisanship is vital for  policies to serve the widest range of Americans. Sadly, it is in short  supply these days in our Capitol. The House Agriculture Committee has,  for over 40 years, traditionally been a very bipartisan committee  because our Nation's food supply affects everyone: rich and poor,  farmers and consumers, Democrats and Republicans alike.   Our farm bill is America's food bill, and it needs to be about  feeding all of us. I always say it is really a matter of our national  security, yet the bill we are considering this week is, without  question, a partisan farm bill.  [[Page H3320]]    We see this in how it fails to serve key parts of our Nation and  abandons many of our food insecure. A partisan farm bill is bad policy,  plain and simple. It will not succeed legislatively nor can it be  implemented successfully.   I ask that we put aside these partisan differences, do as we have  done traditionally, and work together to pass a bipartisan farm bill in  the House and in the Senate that the President can sign.                            ____________________
