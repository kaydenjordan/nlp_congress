 Mr. President, I hear colleagues from the other side of  the aisle talk again and again about how they want patient-centered  healthcare. That is the refrain--patient-centered healthcare. Make no  mistake about what this resolution is all about. It turns that phrase  on its head because what it says to certainly women who are patients:  You are not free to go get the healthcare you want.   It seems like this never ends--another day, another effort to deny  women the opportunity to have the kinds of healthcare choices and the  healthcare services that they feel strongly about.   I am not going to take long; I know colleagues are in a hurry. I just  want to say that the next time you hear this lofty rhetoric-- particularly from the majority--about how everything they are going to  do in American healthcare is going to put the patients at the center of  healthcare, give people more choices, and protect the freedom that they  talk about in healthcare--understand, if you vote for this resolution,  you are repudiating all of those speeches. I have heard Senator Murray  talk about it. She says it very eloquently.   The bottom line is that this resolution not only doesn't support that  lofty rhetoric about patients being at the center of healthcare, this  resolution deprives women of choices and access to healthcare services  they want.   I hope my colleagues will join Senator Murray and understand the  dangerous consequences of what is at stake. Oppose this resolution and  save the Vice President the trip to the Hill.   I yield back.
