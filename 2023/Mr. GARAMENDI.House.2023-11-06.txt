 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague Representative  Beatty for her leadership.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment to highlight  the importance of the HOME Investment Partnership Program in meeting  the needs of working families across America.   Hardworking Americans deserve to have a house, and they deserve to  have a home. We face drastic shortages of affordable housing in  California and in most every other part of America. Housing costs have  skyrocketed significantly, outpacing incomes.   This is why the President's budget rightfully included $1.8 billion  for the HOME Investment Partnership Program. This funding will help  construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing as well as  providing  [[Page H5453]]  homeownership opportunities for working families. We must support the  funding programs like HOME to ensure that every American has a home.
