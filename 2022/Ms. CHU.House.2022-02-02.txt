 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the America  COMPETES Act, which will make historic investments in America and  ensure we remain a global leader in science and technology.   From climate change to cybersecurity, many of the greatest challenges  facing our country can only be met through research and innovation that  will develop new products and create new jobs, but in order to rise to  this moment, we need to turbocharge America's scientific sector. And  that is what this bill would do by investing $52 billion for  semiconductor production here  [[Page H815]]  at home, an investment that will improve the supply chain for almost  every product in our lives.   And it modernizes the National Science Foundation to advance  America's scientific leadership by supporting institutions like  Caltech, based in my district, which is one of NSF's most trusted  partners.   I thank my colleagues today who have modeled responsibility in  debating this bill by focusing on what we gain and not who we should  fear.
