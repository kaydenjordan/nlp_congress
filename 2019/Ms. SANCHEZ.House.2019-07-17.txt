 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Middle Class  Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act, and I want to thank Chairman Neal and  Mr. Courtney for their tireless efforts to get this legislation passed.   I have been proud to support the repeal of the Cadillac tax for many  years. Last Congress, I offered an amendment to repeal the tax during  the healthcare repeal and replace debate.   It is important to remember that the Cadillac tax does not just  affect high-value plans. If Congress does not act, the tax will hit  hardworking Americans and their families who receive employer-sponsored  insurance. Employers  [[Page H5966]]  have already started shifting costs to their workers in anticipation by  increasing deductibles, copays, and coinsurance.   Congress has voted twice to delay the tax, but now is the time to  officially repeal it. I am pleased that we are finally taking this vote  today. I look forward to passage today and will keep working to  strengthen and protect America's healthcare.   I include in the Record letters from CWA, UAW, AFSCME, AFT, and AFGE  and the AFL-CIO in support of this bill.                               Communications Workers of America,                                                      July 15, 2019.        Dear Representative Neal: On behalf of the officers and       700,000 members of the Communications Workers of America       (CWA), I am writing to urge you to vote in favor of H.R. 748,       the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019, when       it comes before the House this week.        This bill will permanently repeal the 40% tax on employer       health benefits which is currently scheduled to take effect       in 2022. It will provide relief to our members, and working       people everywhere, whose health benefits are under continual       attack by employers looking to shift the cost of care to       workers.        A recent study by the Commonwealth Fund found that the       number of Americans who are underinsured as a result of high       out-of-pocket costs and deductibles has grown by over 50%       since 2010. The fastest growth in under-insurance has come       from Americans with employer-provided coverage.        This is consistent with our members' experience at the       bargaining table, where fights to preserve affordable       coverage and prevent plan cuts dominate our negotiations at       every employer. The 40% benefit tax will exacerbate this       trend and force cuts across our health plans, making health       care less affordable.        Our members are currently negotiating agreements with       employers that extend to 2022. Current data indicates many of       our largest member health plans will be subject to this tax       immediately when it goes into effect that year. That is why       action now to resolve this issue now is critical.        H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act,       will improve health care for working people across the       country, providing relief to workers who are paying high       prices for their negotiated healthcare. CWA will consider       votes on this bill on our Congressional Scorecard.        Thank you in advance for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                      Shane Larson,      Director of Legislative, Political and International Affairs.                                   ____           International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &             Agricultural Implement Workers Of America--UAW                                        Detroit, MI, July 16, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than one million       active and retired members of the International Union, United       Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of       America (UAW), we urge you to vote yes on the Middle Class       Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 748). This bill would       permanently repeal the excise tax on high cost employer-      sponsored health coverage. The tax is scheduled to be levied       on the aggregate amount of employer-sponsored coverage       exceeding thresholds established in the law ($11,200 for       individual coverage and $30,100 for family coverage). The       excise tax is currently set to take effect in 2022.        The UAW believes affordable comprehensive health care       should be a right for every American. That is why we strongly       support the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and vehemently oppose       all efforts to repeal the law. The ACA has made important       strides towards the goal of universal, comprehensive,       affordable coverage. In fact, since its passage in March       2010, more than 20 million people have gained health care       coverage. In addition, tens of millions more with preexisting       conditions have been able to get affordable and comprehensive       insurance because discriminating against people with pre-      existing conditions is prohibited under the ACA. Workers with       employer sponsored coverage have benefited from this and       other protections, like the prohibition on lifetime caps,       found in the law. Without these protections, unionized       workers would have to collectively bargain for these       essential, common sense protections.        Like any comprehensive law, the ACA needs to be refined and       repealing the scheduled tax on employer sponsored coverage       would improve our health care system.        As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and prominent       economists have predicted, employers have responded to the       impending tax by increasing worker's deductibles, copays,       and/or coinsurance in order to avoid being hit by the tax.       Employers have increased cost sharing under their plans,       switched to lower cost benefits, eliminated plan options, or       narrowed provider networks in anticipation of the tax,       according to a 2016 national survey of employers conducted by       the Kaiser Family Foundation.        The percentage of employers with a plan reaching the       threshold is projected to grow fairly rapidly over time, to       28% in 2025 and 37% in 2030.        If Congress fails to act, working families will be       negatively impacted as employers turn to a range of options       to avoid the tax by reducing the value of health care       coverage, which could include increasing deductibles, copays,       coinsurance and out-of-pocket limits. This tax places a       disproportionate burden on working families and makes health       care less affordable.        We urge you to vote in support of the Middle-Class Health       Benefits Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 748).            Sincerely,                                                       Josh Nassar,      UAW Legislative Director.                                   ____                                                           AFSCME,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members of American       Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME),       I urge you to support passage of the bipartisan ``Middle       Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019'' (H.R. 748),       which would repeal the 40 percent (``Cadillac'') tax on       employer-sponsored high cost worker and retiree health       benefits. AFSCME strongly supports H.R. 748 to prevent       further increases in workers' health costs and erosion of       their health benefits.        Repealing the 40 percent tax is needed because it       encourages employers and insurers to reduce working families'       health benefits thereby raising medical copays, coinsurance,       deductibles, and related out-of-pocket health expenses.       AFSCME seeks immediate repeal because, while the tax does not       take effect until 2022, it already is reducing benefits--as       AFSCME (and other stakeholders) are already negotiating       multi-year contracts extending beyond early 2022. This tax is       troubling because it is regressive, disproportionately       burdens working families, and discriminates against female       dominated occupations like nurses and teachers. Groups of       workers who are relatively older, less healthy, or working       jobs with relatively high health risks will also suffer       additional health costs.        More broadly, America's health care system faces an       escalating affordability crisis and this 40 percent tax       worsens it. For example, the Congressional Budget Office       (CBO) analysis of this tax states, ``empirical evidence       suggest that it will be passed on to employers who purchase       or provide insurance that is subject to the tax--and then       ultimately passed on to workers.'' To help workers and       improve affordability, this 40 percent tax should be repealed       now. This tax also is a poorly targeted and ineffective tool.       It will soon affect tens of millions of working families and       recently released data reports 21 percent to 31 percent of       employers offering health benefits in 2022 will owe this tax.       Others estimate more large employers will owe this tax,       dispelling the myth that this tax only affects plans with       strong benefits.        H.R. 748 has diverse and broad support, including       endorsements from 43 national labor unions, many patient and       consumer organizations, such as Families USA, groups that       treat and cure diseases such as American Cancer Society       Cancer Action Network, and prominent business interests like       the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable.       Furthermore, the public has opposed this tax for years and a       2018 Election Day poll reported 81 percent of voters oppose       taxing employer-provided health coverage. Repealing the 40       percent tax is a vital step to help make health care more       affordable. We urge you to support the bipartisan ``Middle       Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act,'' H.R. 748, and vote       yes on this important legislation.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                              AFT,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.7 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, I urge you to vote       YES on H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal       Act.        The AFT has always opposed the 40 percent excise tax on       high-quality healthcare plans, included in the Affordable       Care Act, which will negatively impact families that have       worked for, and earned, strong healthcare coverage. We have       been gratified that Congress has pushed back the       implementation date of this tax in the past. It is clear,       however, that full repeal of this excise tax is needed to       prevent employers from using the threat of the tax as a       cudgel to demand reduced benefits or coverage from educators,       nurses, bus drivers, social workers and other AFT members.        The AFT strongly supports the ACA's expansion of health       insurance, as well as the act's consumer protections and       emphasis on preventive care. We know firsthand that having       affordable, high-quality health insurance is a key component       to upward mobility and a sustainable middle class. Under       current law, the number of insured Americans is higher than       ever before; that includes the large number of contingent       workers we represent, who make up an increasing share of       today's workforce.        The ACA was intended to help ensure that we all have access       to high-quality healthcare without depleting our paychecks       and compromising our ability to save for the future. The       excise tax, rather than expanding high-quality healthcare,       would do the opposite. If  [[Page H5967]]       the 40 percent excise tax on the cost of employer-sponsored       health insurance plans is implemented, working families will       be hurt.        Some analysts argue that this tax will lead employers and       employees to seek out ``more efficient'' plans and perhaps to       an increase in wages. However, we have not seen an increase       in wages and remain concerned that workers will be moved to       high deductible/co-pay health plans as a result of this tax.       The cost curve will not bend; costs will simply be shifted       over to those lower- and middle-income workers already       struggling because of stagnant wages. This will lead to more       workers forgoing necessary care or going into debt to pay for       the high out-of-pocket costs.        In addition to having the potential to shift costs to       working families, the excise tax will disproportionately       affect older workers and women. This is of particular concern       to the AFT, as a substantial number of our members are       female, and many live in high-cost regions. Congress did       recognize the obvious impact on women and older workers by       trying to mitigate it with the ``age and gender adjustment''       provisions in the law. However, these provisions are       insufficient, and implementation of the tax would almost       certainly lead to higher healthcare costs for these groups.        There is near-universal agreement between employers and       employees that the excise tax is bad policy for American       workers, and must be repealed. That is why more than 360       members of the House have co-sponsored this much-needed,       bipartisan legislation. I urge you to join them and vote YES       on H.R. 748.        Finally, I want to thank Rep. Joe Courtney, who introduced       H.R. 748, for his relentless efforts and commitment to       repealing this counterproductive tax. His determination and       leadership on this issue have been remarkable, and our       members appreciate his dedication.        Thank you for considering our views on this important       matter.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,      President.                                   ____                                              American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO.         Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 700,000       federal and District of Columbia employees represented by the       American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE),       I write to urge your support for the bipartisan ``Middle       Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019'' (H.R. 748)       which would eliminate the unfair and unwarranted 40 percent       tax on relatively high cost employer-sponsored health       insurance. We ask that you vote ``YES'' when the bill comes       to the floor later this week.        Most federal employees and federal retirees participate in       the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). The       premiums for almost every plan that participates in FEHBP       would be hit by this tax, making a very expensive program       even more expensive for both taxpayers and participants.       FEHBP plans are expensive, and thus are subject to this tax,       not because the benefits they provide are so comprehensive,       but because the structure of FEHBP leads to high premiums.       FEHBP plans yield enormous political power to charge high       prices, escape audit by virtue of their exemption from       application of the government's cost accounting standards,       and are characterized by risk segmentation that raises their       premiums above the actuarial value of their benefits. Indeed,       the generosity of benefits is a relatively insignificant       factor in the overall size of FEHBP's premiums. Age, gender,       health status and program structure are the most important       factors in determining premiums, and premiums determine       whether a plan is subject to the tax.        The 40 percent excise tax is not scheduled to take effect       until 2022, so now is the time for repeal, before it has any       further deleterious effect on the working and middle class       families that are its targets. Support for repeal of this       regressive tax is widespread. There is no doubt that its       effect will be to make health insurance less affordable. That       is certainly true for federal employees and retirees whose       compensation has declined in real terms over the past decade       due to pay freezes and retirement benefit reductions. AFGE       strongly urges you to support H.R. 748, the ``Middle Class       Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019.''            Sincerely yours,                                                  J. David Cox, Sr.
