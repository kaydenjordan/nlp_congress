 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last night the Senate passed an awful,  partisan rewrite of the Tax Code. I said a good deal about the bill  over the course of the debate and added my concluding thoughts into the  Record before the final vote, but let me just reiterate one point. The  Republican tax bill will cement the Republican Party as the party of  the wealthy and the party of the big corporations against the middle  class and the working people of this country.   Corporations get permanent tax breaks. The individual tax breaks  expire. By 2027, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 83  percent of the middle class--that is almost 145  [[Page S8155]]  million American families--will either get a tax increase or a tax cut  of less than $100.   Meanwhile, according to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent of  earners in our country will reap 83 percent of the benefits of the tax  plan.   Let's go over that again. The middle class, 83 percent, either get a  tax increase or a tax break of less than $100. The top 1 percent, the  wealthiest, get 83 percent of the benefits. Middle-class America is  asking something: Why does the top get far more than I do? Why do I get  a tax increase when so many of them get a huge decrease? To boot,  millions of middle-class Americans will now go without health insurance  and millions more will see their premiums rise. At the same time,  multinational corporations and wealthy hedge fund managers enjoy a  massive tax break. To repeat, the legacy of this bill will be to cement  the Republican Party as the party of the rich and powerful against the  middle class.   We Democrats have been saying this for years, but our Republican  colleagues with this tax bill have done us a major favor. Even their  Republican supporters are realizing where the Senate Republicans and  House Republicans are--on the side of the most wealthy, on the side of  the big powerful corporations, not on the side of the middle class.   Whenever we have had a Republican President and Republican Congress,  we get the same thing--a program of tax cuts for the rich, higher  deficit and debt, and then threats to Social Security and Medicare.  That is what happened under President Bush, and we are seeing the exact  same playbook today. There is nothing about this bill that is suited to  the needs of the American worker or the American economy. My Republican  friends would propose it in a booming economy or recession, whether we  have surpluses or deficits. No matter what, it seems to our Republican  friends that tax cuts for the rich and big corporations are the answer  to our problems. The benefits will trickle down like magic to the rest  of us.   Trickle down is the entire philosophy of this tax bill--trickle down.  When they say they are helping the middle class, when they say they are  creating jobs, it is because the wealthy get money and, in their  belief, will create jobs. It hasn't happened. It hasn't happened.  Corporate America has more money than ever before. The stock market is  higher than ever before, and job creation isn't.   That is where this bill is at. There is nothing about this bill that  suits the needs of the American worker, as I said. Trickle down has  been widely discredited as an economic theory. It has been discredited  by recent history, and it will be discredited again.   Our Republican colleagues are clinging. They are saying: This bill is  so unpopular, but don't worry, once the economy takes off, once people  see hundreds of dollars in their pockets, they will change their mind.   The economy is not going to take off. The wealthy will do better.  There will be a lot of dividends. There will be a lot of stock  buybacks, not too much job creation. AT&T is a big American company and  a fine American company. Their tax rate over the last 10 years was a  mere 8 percent, and they cut 80,000 jobs. That one statistic belies all  this trickle-down bunk that our Republican colleagues still cling to  even though it is outdated and disproved, and the American people will  have their chance in 2018 to reject this philosophy and move our  country in a dramatically different direction--back toward government  that works to lift up the middle class rather than one that gives more  to those who already have so much. From now until then, we Democrats  will focus like a laser on making things better for working Americans  and the middle class. The contrast, particularly this tax bill, which  so benefits the wealthy and powerful, could not be more clear.                            ____________________     Now to the end of the year, Mr. President, as a result  of the Republican efforts to jam the tax bill through before the end of  the year, we now have precious little time left to keep the government  open and to solve a legion of problems.   We still haven't reached a budget deal to lift the spending caps  equally for both defense and urgent domestic priorities such as  combatting the opioid crisis, improving veterans' healthcare, and  building infrastructure.   We have not reached a deal to reauthorize the Children's Health  Insurance Program, community health centers, or to extend the 702 FISA  Court program.   Two major sticking points remain in the form of the disaster  supplemental, which still does not treat Puerto Rico, California, and  the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as Florida, Texas, and Louisiana.   Of course we have the Dreamers and a moral imperative to protect  them. These are kids who were brought here very young through no fault  of their own. Many of them know no other country but ours. They learn  in our schools, work in our companies, serve in our military, and want  to be Americans more than anything in the world. They are Americans in  every single important way but one; they lack the paperwork. We have to  solve that problem.   We have been negotiating with our Republican counterparts for weeks  in search of a deal to pair DACA protections with reasonable border  security. Democrats have always believed in border security, as the  comprehensive immigration bill in the Senate showed. I hope now that  the tax bill is behind them, my Republican colleagues are finally  willing to reach an agreement, but because of the particular importance  of all of these issues, especially Dreamers, we cannot do a short-term  funding bill that picks and chooses what problems to solve and what not  to solve. That will not be fair and will not pass. We have to do them  all together instead of in a piecemeal fashion.   Whether that global deal comes before the week is out or a later date  in January, it has to be a truly global deal. We can't leave any of the  issues behind. Our Republican colleagues on tax and healthcare decided  not to work with us. In this case they have to work with us, and  working with us means that we sit down around the table and decide  there are some things you want, some things we want, and let's  compromise and get it done--not just picking and choosing what you want  to get done and telling us to deal with it. That will not work this  time.   I can assure my friend the majority leader that my caucus will be  working in good faith with his caucus as long as they choose to work  with us, and we will work with our colleagues in the House as well to  reach a deal as soon as possible.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
