 Mr. President, Republicans need to leave the kids alone-- leave the kids alone. Right now, they are trying to deny food to LGBTQ  kids because they have disagreements about policies concerning trans  people. Instead of debating those disagreements among adults, they are  holding school lunches for kids hostage.    I want to be really clear about what this proposal would do and the  message that it would send to millions of Americans. It would overturn  a policy that prevents LGBTQ kids and adults from being discriminated  against while accessing Federal nutrition assistance like school meals,  food banks, SNAP benefits.   You have an issue with high school sports? I think you are wrong, but  have at it. You have a view about trans people? I think you are wrong,  I think it is terrible, but have at it. But leave the kids alone. Let  them eat. Let the children have a lunch. Every kid deserves a square  meal. Leave them alone.   Most people are fortunate enough to not have to worry about where  their next meal will come from. It is just a routine part of life. But  that isn't the case for many queer Americans who are twice as likely to  experience food insecurity, according to the Census Bureau. And trans  people are three times as likely to be food insufficient compared to  cisgender individuals.   This policy is not just another line in the rule book; it is the  difference between people having a meal and going to bed hungry. If we  can't hold kids harmless--if we can't hold kids harmless--what the hell  are we doing here? Can't we have some boundaries to the culture wars?  Can't we have some disagreements without looping in the children? They  are kids; we are adults. We are responsible for their health and  safety. Let them have a square meal.   I yield the floor.
