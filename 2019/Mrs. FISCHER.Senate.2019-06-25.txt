 Madam President, today I want to recognize my deputy  communications director, Chanse Jones, who is leav1ng my office in  early July after more than 4 years of service to the State of Nebraska  and to me.   Although he is a Mississippian by birth, Chanse has become an adopted  son of Nebraska. He started with me in Washington as a press assistant  in 2015. I quickly learned he was someone with a big personality, big  ideas, and a lot of creativity, so I promoted him to the role of deputy  press secretary. He worked hard, and it wasn't long before he became my  press secretary and then my deputy communications director.   As the years went by, Chanse came to love and be loved by so many  communities across the State of Nebraska. He joined me for many road  trips all across the Good Life. These trips took us from Omaha to  Scottsbluff, to my ranch outside of Valentine, to the northeast part of  the state, and many places between--the stories he could tell about our  ``adventures.''   During these journeys, Chanse endeared himself to Nebraskans with his  charming nature. He is a delight, and he made friends just about  everywhere he went. While on the road, he also captured Nebraska's  beauty in many ways, including through wonderful photographs that I  will forever cherish.   When carrying out his job responsibilities whether in Nebraska or in  Washington, Chanse always brought a sense of fun to every task. He has  been a dear friend to me and a fierce protector. He is also an original  ``Friend of Fred'' and godparent of my goldendoodle, Fred Fischer. In  fact, he helped us find Fred and was with us when we rescued him a few  years ago.   The three of us, Fred, my husband Bruce, and I, are certainly going  to miss Chanse's company.   I want to thank Chanse for his friendship and his service to the  people of Nebraska over the years. I wish him all the best in this next  chapter of his career, and I am excited to see what life has in store  for him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the fiscal year  2020 Defense authorization bill. I want to begin by thanking the  chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  for their leadership and for their hard work in crafting this bill and  managing it on the floor.   The bill before us today is the worthy successor to last year's John  S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act. Like its immediate  predecessor, this bill's overarching objective is to reorient the  Department of Defense toward the great power competition that our  Nation faces today.   Overall, the bill supports a total of $750 billion in defense  spending, which includes $642 billion for the Department of Defense's  base budget, $23 billion for the Department of Energy's defense  activities, and another $76 billion for overseas contingency  operations. This meets the level of spending requested by the President  and provides the Department of Defense with real growth above the rate  of the inflation in recognition of increasing threats our Nation faces.   The bill also supports the All-Volunteer Force, providing a 3.1- percent pay raise for our men and women in uniform. It meets the  President's request with respect to end strength for an Active-Duty  force of 1,339,500 soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines.   I serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, which  has jurisdiction over nuclear forces, missile defense, and national  security space programs, and the U.S. Strategic Command, to which  Nebraska is home.   I am fond of quoting the statement of former President Obama's  Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, that ``Nuclear deterrence is the  bedrock of our security and the highest priority mission of the  Department of Defense.''   That was true in 2016 when he said it, and it is even truer today as  Russia and China continue to expand their nuclear arsenals and  deterring great power conflict becomes the central focus of our  military.   With this changing security environment in mind, this bill fully  funds the nuclear mission of the men and women of USSTRATCOM, including  the sustainment of our nuclear forces, as well as the modernization of  our triad, our nuclear command and control systems, and the Department  of Energy's nuclear complex.   This legislation builds upon last year's support for the supplemental  systems announced in the President's Nuclear Posture Review by  authorizing funds for the deployment of low-yield ballistic missile  warhead. Numerous senior military leaders have testified that this is  what is necessary to address gaps in our current deterrence posture.   The fiscal year 2020 Senate NDAA also supports the Navy's ongoing  study of restoring a sea-launched cruise missile capability in order to  further enhance deterrence and also to reassure allies.   Moreover, the legislation includes a requirement for the  administration to submit a report assessing four major categories of  nuclear arms that are currently not captured by the New START Treaty.  As many of my colleagues are aware, the administration  [[Page S4521]]  has announced its intent to pursue a more comprehensive approach to  arms control beyond the traditional bilateral limitations of land-based  ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and our heavy bombers.   The administration's logic is simple: Threats are shifting. As Russia  invests in new and novel nuclear systems that are not captured by the  New START Treaty and China's arsenal expands, a new approach is needed  that accounts for these new dynamics. In support of this effort, this  provision would require that the administration provide a comprehensive  assessment of these factors.    Additionally, the Strategic Forces Subcommittee authorized resources  for a number of key unfunded priorities for our warfighters. This  includes an additional $113 million for the development of the next  generation of GPS receivers to ensure the U.S. military continues to  have access to resilient position, navigation, and timing capabilities,  and an additional $108 million for the Missile Defense Agency to  continue the development of space-based sensors to track advanced  threats, including hypersonic weapons. Finally, it fully authorized  critical bilateral US-Israel cooperative missile defense programs.   The critical resources this bill provides will be appreciated by our  strategic partners and our men and women in uniform around the globe,  as well as those in each and every State here at home.   I am honored to represent the men and women of Offutt Air Force Base,  the 55th Wing, and the Nebraska National Guard, and I am proud to say  that this legislation authorizes several critical investments that not  only support our uniformed men and women in Nebraska; it better enables  them to fulfill their roles in defending this Nation.   By passing the fiscal year 2020 NDAA, we keep the ``fighting 55th''  Wing flying. The bill authorizes full funding for the Air Force budget  request to support the C-135 family of aircraft. It supports  significant upgrades to the capabilities of the RC-135 Rivet Joint, the  continued conversion of KC-135 tankers to WC-135R nuclear detection  aircraft, and enables the ongoing OC-135 Open Skies recapitalization.   Just as critically, the bill helps the Air Force to evolve its ISR  capability and move toward a more survivable, networked environment,  with manned, unmanned, and sensors all acting as key components to give  battlefield commanders the best information possible. To achieve this,  the bill includes two amendments I authored that will direct the Air  Force to examine the integration and dissemination of data from  surveillance platforms like the RC-135 to the warfighter.   While the bill authorizes these important new investments, it also  provides funding to address ongoing disaster recovery efforts, which  are essential to restoring military installations that were affected by  the recent flooding in Nebraska. Rebuilding Offutt Air Force Base and  the Nebraska National Guard's Camp Ashland are top priorities, and I am  happy to report that the bill authorizes millions of dollars in funding  to aid in the continued process of cleanup, design, and construction  for the facilities that were destroyed.   Because I believe Nebraska's bases are a core component of the  Nation's defense, I was also proud to offer two amendments that further  support the process of rebuilding. These measures increase the cap on  minor military construction for recovery at bases impacted by recent  disasters and encourage the military services to work quickly to  rebuild Offutt Air Force Base and Camp Ashland.   I strongly urge all of my colleagues to work together to support this  disaster recovery effort. Many key military installations have been  affected across several States, and the work to rebuild these bases  must be a collaborative effort. We owe it to our men and women in  uniform to do this together.   For 58 years, the NDAA has been the subject of a bipartisan consensus  in Congress. Despite other disagreements that may arise and the  significant debates we face, this bill has long been a unifying subject  of agreement on Capitol Hill. There is good reason for that, and a  record that spans a half century does not happen by accident. The fact  is that no matter what other issues arise, an area where we must forge  agreement is in supporting our servicemembers and enabling the defense  of the Nation.   This year, we had a productive markup, with substantive debate on the  issues in this bill. The process worked the way it was intended, and we  emerged with a strong bipartisan consensus on the bill before us. I  encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation so that we  can continue our tradition of authorizing full funding for the military  and ensure that this legislation is signed into law on time.   In that same spirit, it is essential that we take the next step and  work to secure a budget agreement that not only supports a robust top  line for national defense, but that we do so swiftly to give the  Department of Defense the predictable funding they need to plan and  budget for the coming year.   Passing NDAA is only half of the job. Yes, we must authorize full  funding for our military, but if we are truly committed to our military  men and women, we must also vote on the defense appropriations bill to  fund what we do here this week on NDAA. As we continue to debate the  fiscal year 2020 NDAA, we should all remember the reason we have this  debate every year. One of the primary responsibilities of Congress is  to provide for the common defense. That responsibility is written in  the Constitution, and it is an oath each of us swore to uphold. I am  reminded of that oath frequently when I am back home in Nebraska. Each  time I shake hands with a Nebraskan in uniform or meet a family member  with a loved one overseas, I think about the responsibility we have and  the debt we owe the ones who serve.   Over the years, countless sons and daughters of the heartland have  answered that call to service. They are regular men and women from  every background and every walk of life, united by their desire to  safeguard their homeland and protect the cause of freedom. Yes, they  are regular men and women, but they are also exceptional Americans, and  their spirit and their sacrifice are examples that we should remember  every day.   I hope we can come together in the spirit of service and work  together to swiftly pass the fiscal year 2020 National Defense  Authorization Act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
