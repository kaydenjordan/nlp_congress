 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the two Articles of  Impeachment against President Trump for abuse of power and obstruction  of Congress.   Voting to impeach the President is a weighty decision. It is not  something you reach for; it is something you are brought to reluctantly  when the evidence presented can no longer be denied.   In this sober and historic moment, Members of Congress are called  upon to uphold our oath of office and our duty to the Constitution.  Today, we answer that call.   The President's actions compromised the national security of the  United States, undermined the integrity of our democratic process, and  betrayed the trust of the American people.   In soliciting foreign interference, President Trump took direct aim  at the heart of our democracy. The American people should decide our  elections, not a foreign country. As long as the President continues to  invite foreign interference into our democracy, the integrity of the  2020 election remains at risk.   The question is: Will Congress allow the President to place his  personal interests above those of his country?   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to join me in  answering that question with a resounding ``no'' because no one, not  even the President of the United States, is above the law.
