 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to continue to lift up the  voices of millions of Americans who are demanding policing reform as a  necessary  [[Page S5276]]  step on the path towards racial justice in this country. The challenges  in defeating systemic racism can seem insurmountable, but there are  clear next steps.   We need to start by transforming our policing system to root out the  systemic racism and the culture of violence that is killing Black and  Brown and indigenous people and people of color.   I want to talk today about four areas of this work that need our  urgent attention.   First, we need to bring justice, accountability, and change to police  departments by passing the Justice in Policing Act.   Second, we need to invest in new models of public safety by  supporting community-led reform and innovation. I am asking the Senate  to take up and pass my new bill to do just that.   Third, we need to end the criminalization of poverty, which happens  when other social systems fail.   Finally, we need to root out racism in our systems of education,  healthcare, housing, and economic opportunity so that everyone in this  country can have the freedom and the opportunity to build the lives  they choose.   In order to bring justice, accountability, and change to policing  departments around the country, we need to start by passing the Justice  in Policing Act. Led by Senator Booker and Senator Harris, this bill is  a comprehensive set of needed Federal-level reforms to a system that is  designed to shield police officers from accountability and consequences  and denies justice to victims of police violence.   These reforms--like ending qualified immunity, establishing a  national use-of-force standard, creating a registry of police  misconduct, and banning dangerous practices like choke holds and no- knock warrants--are long overdue.   Indeed, communities and activists have pushed for many of the reforms  in this bill for decades. A few weeks ago, I spoke on this floor about  the urgent need to pass this bill. Unfortunately, this critical  legislation is still sitting on Leader McConnell's desk. But I promise  that I will keep fighting until the Justice in Policing Act is signed  into law.   Policing needs other changes, too, like banning so-called warrior  training, which encourages law enforcement officials to see the public  as hostile enemies. We need to empower the Civil Rights Division of the  Department of Justice to independently investigate police departments  that systematically violate the constitutional rights of our  communities   We need to reform Federal sentencing to repeal 1994 crime bill  provisions, like mandatory minimums and draconian sentencing  enhancements, and we need to prohibit police union contracts that  create unfair barriers to effective investigations, civilian oversight,  and holding police departments accountable to the communities they are  sworn to serve.   In our work to transform policing, the second step we need to take at  the Federal level is to support local community-led innovation in  public safety.   Although Congress has the responsibility to establish national  standards for justice and accountability, Federal-level change can only  go so far. State, local, and Tribal governments are responsible for  overseeing policing in their communities. I believe that these  communities know best what will work in their own cities and towns. The  Federal Government, though, can play a catalytic role by supporting and  funding innovative, anti-racist policing reform.   With this in mind, today I am introducing a bill, the Supporting  Innovation and Public Safety Act, which would help State, local, and  Tribal governments reimagine policing in their communities by funding  innovative projects and best practices that will transform how we  deliver public safety and other social services.   My bill would empower local governments to develop and implement  projects to improve public safety through systemic change, not just by  growing police department budgets.   There are great examples of innovation already happening. Local  jurisdictions are experimenting with new ways to provide mental health  crisis response. They are addressing ways of dealing with gun violence  as a public health issue and even how to enforce low-level traffic  safety violations without involving an armed police officer.   I have long believed that those who are closest to the work know best  how to get the work done. Through these grants from the Federal level,  we will be able to help local communities adopt new approaches to  public safety, tailoring their needs and unique circumstances to what  they need to do. Then we can develop robust evaluation of these  community-led projects, which will generate new data and new models of  public safety in policing and also sow the seeds of progress and broad  transformation.   The third thing we need to do at all levels of government is to work  together to stop criminalizing poverty and using the criminal justice  system as the solution for every social ill.   For decades, we have dramatically underfunded efforts to support  housing, mental health, and substance abuse. And then we criminalize  the results of this lack of support. We ask police departments to  control behavior like loitering or trespassing, public intoxication,  and public nuisances--all offenses that largely don't threaten public  safety. Then we put people in jail because they have a mental illness  or lack a safe place to live. Poverty becomes the reason why people,  especially people of color, get caught up in the criminal justice  system.   It is time that we stop criminalizing poverty and start investing in  solutions to get to the root causes of social problems. We need to  refocus policing on violence prevention and crisis response, which  connects people to the services that they need.   A good place to start is by dramatically reforming cash bail so that  those who haven't been convicted of a crime don't remain in jail just  because they can't afford bail. Almost 60 percent of the nearly 750,000  people currently in jail have not been convicted of any crime. They are  in jail just because they cannot afford bail, and the data tells us  that this is yet another burden that falls disproportionately on  communities of color.   Indeed, when we criminalize poverty, we facilitate the systemic  racist harassment, surveillance, and control of Black and Brown, and  indigenous communities. That is why we need to ban the use of quotas  for law enforcement officers to enforce so-called broken windows  offenses. These offenses do not threaten public safety, and they are  disproportionately enforced on communities of color.   A recent New York Times investigation found that in many large police  departments, serious violent crimes make up only about 1 percent of all  calls for service--1 percent. Many of those same departments are  solving less than 30 percent of those serious crimes. We could actually  improve public safety by devoting resources to combating violent crime  rather than overenforcing low-level offenses in communities of color.   Let's think about what this means for marijuana offenses. The Federal  marijuana prohibition is a failed policy that contributes to mass  incarceration and overpolicing of communities of color. White and Black  people use marijuana at roughly the same rate, but a Black person is  almost four times as likely to be arrested for a marijuana offense.   The Federal Government is behind both State law and public opinion.  Forty-two States and the District of Columbia already allow some type  of marijuana use, despite the long-time Federal prohibition.   It is time to legalize marijuana, and we should do it in a practical  and commonsense way that protects the health and safety and the civil  rights of our communities.   We need to take up and pass Senator Harris's Marijuana Opportunity  Reinvestment and Expungement Act, the MORE Act, which I am proud to  cosponsor. The MORE Act would address the devastating impact on  communities of color on the War on Drugs by expunging marijuana-related  convictions and reinvesting in community.   Also, I recently introduced a bill, the Substance Resolution and  Safety Act, which would ensure that marijuana is regulated to protect  the health and the safety of youth, of consumers, and of drivers. We do  this without replicating the racist enforcement patterns of our current  drug policy.  [[Page S5277]]    Finally, we need to recognize that racial justice is not only about  policing and criminal justice reform. We need to root out racist  policies that are built into our systems of housing, healthcare,  education, and economic opportunity.   The legacy of slavery, of oppression, and of discrimination is  pervasive in these areas and our communities bear the scars of these  past crimes even as new injuries accumulate. This is why a Black or a  Brown child living in the neighborhood where George Floyd was murdered  has fewer opportunities than a White child living just a few miles  away.   The impact of generations of stolen labor, of systemic violence, and  exclusion from opportunity is revealed today in legal disparities,  achievement gaps, housing instability, and the dramatic difference in  wealth and wages between White people and people of color.   Addressing these challenges are crucial to the unfinished work of  racial justice in our country. This means that we need to implement  anti-racist practices and policies, like ending the use of armed police  officers in schools, eliminating discipline disparities, and shutting  off the school-to-prison pipeline. It means addressing the systemic  exclusion of Black and Brown and indigenous people from the wealth- building opportunities of homeownership. It means tackling the root  causes of racial health disparities, including environmental injustices  and discrimination in healthcare. It means supporting economic  opportunity for all by removing racist barriers to employment,  entrepreneurship, credit, and capital.   The scale of the injustice that we see in our country can sometimes  feel overwhelming, and the path can seem very long. These are some  concrete steps that we can take on that path, and they are necessary  steps, to fulfill our country's promise of freedom and equity for all  of us. Community leaders and activists are showing us the path forward,  and following this path requires us to be courageous, requires us to be  humble, and, at times, requires us to be uncomfortable. But it is a  path rooted in love and trust and hope.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Grassley, and Ms.          Ernst):   S. 4481. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency to update the modeling used for lifecycle greenhouse  gas assessments for corn-based ethanol and biodiesel, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.
