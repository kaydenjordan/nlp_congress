 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7289,  the Federal PFAS Research Evaluation Act, as amended. This bill,  introduced by Representatives Lizzie Fletcher and Peter Meijer, is  another example of strong bipartisanship from Science Committee members  on a critical issue facing our Nation.   Manufactured carbon and fluorine-based chemicals, known as PFAS, are  pervasive throughout the environment due to their inability to be  broken down. Traces of PFAS can be found in everyday household items,  clothing, and even in our drinking water. They have also increasingly  been found to have negative impacts on public and environmental health.  Our low-income communities, and communities of color, are at risk for  high levels of exposure to PFAS due to these communities being  disproportionately located near chemical plants containing PFAS. This  can lead to higher instances of morbidity and mortality for these  communities as well.   To effectively reduce the presence of PFAS in our environment, we  must be guided by strong science. The Federal PFAS Research Evaluation  Act would direct the Environmental Protection Agency to enter into  agreements with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine to publish studies that identify major research gaps  associated with our understanding of PFAS. These studies would also  inform the Office of Science and Technology Policy's work to develop a  comprehensive federal research effort for PFAS.   Families across the Nation depend on the Federal government to ensure  their safety when it comes to PFAS contamination in drinking water and  consumer goods. The findings of the studies authorized in this bill  will help support ongoing Federal efforts to protect our communities  from the dangers of PFAS. I urge my colleagues to support this  critical, bipartisan, bill.    Madam Speaker, I rise I support of H.R. 3952,  the NOAA Chief Scientist Act, as amended. This bill takes measures to  better support and define the role of the Chief Scientist at the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   One of my great priorities as Chairwoman of the Science Committee has  been reinforcing the importance of scientific integrity across our  federal science agencies. The NOAA Chief Scientist Act prioritizes  scientific integrity at the highest levels of leadership at NOAA by  requiring the Chief Scientist to publicly acknowledge his or her  commitment to agency scientific integrity policies. Scientific  integrity and transparency are integral to ensuring federal agencies  can maintain their status as trusted resources to Americans.   This bill lays out qualifications for the Chief Scientist, as this  role should be held by someone with expertise and experience in the  field. This bill includes additional provisions that would support the  expanded role of the Chief Scientist and make the science and  technology activities of the agency transparent and accessible to the  public.   This bipartisan bill was introduced by Representative Sherrill of New  Jersey and Representative Feenstra from Iowa, who worked together on  its provisions. I am proud of the Science Committee's work this  Congress to develop scientifically sound, bipartisan legislation. I am  pleased to be a cosponsor of a bill that advances scientific integrity  at NOAA and urge my colleagues to support it.   I include in the Record an exchange of letters on H.R. 3952 sent  between the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and the  Committee on Natural Resources.          House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                      Washington, DC, May 24, 2022.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, Longworth House           Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I am writing you concerning H.R.       3952, the ``NOAA Chief Scientist Act'' which was referred to       the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology and       sequentially to the Committee on Natural Resources. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       bill. I recognize that the bill contains provisions that fall       within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural       Resources. I acknowledge that you will waive further       consideration of H.R. 3952, that this action is not a waiver       of future jurisdictional claims by the Committee on Natural       Resources over this subject matter.        I will make sure to include a copy of our exchange of       letters in the Congressional Record and will support the       appointment of conferees from the Committee on Natural       Resources during any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation. Thank you for your cooperation on this       legislation.            Sincerely,                                             Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                       Washington, DC, May 24, 2022.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chair, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Johnson: In recognition of the goal of       expediting consideration of H.R. 3952, the ``NOAA Chief       Scientist Act,'' the Committee on Natural Resources agrees to       waive formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Natural Resources.        The Committee on Natural Resources takes this action with       the mutual understanding that, in doing so, we do not waive       any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that the Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar       legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues within our jurisdiction. Our Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of conferees to any       House-Senate conference involving this or similar       legislation.        I also ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this       matter be included in the Congressional Record. I appreciate       your cooperation regarding this legislation and look  [[Page H7097]]       forward to continuing to work with you as this measure moves       through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,                          Chair, House Natural Resources Committee.     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7361,  the National Weather Service Communications Improvement Act.   We are seeing the impacts of climate change on severe weather events  across the country. Inclement weather is more intense than ever and  happening more frequently. Fortunately, due to the advancement of  forecasting science and dissemination, we have not seen a corresponding  increase in deaths. With climate change supercharging severe weather,  we need to ensure emergency response professionals can communicate  without interruption. This communication is vital to warn and protect  Americans during times of severe weather events.   The NWS Communications Improvement Act is a bipartisan bill led by  Congressman Feenstra of the Science Committee. It would require NOAA to  upgrade the aging National Weather Service's instant communications  system to current technology standards. The current communication  system, known as NWS Chat, has faced delays and outages during recent  weather events. This critical tool needs to be updated to address these  issues and improve reliability. The safety of all Americans depends on  it.   The House's consideration of this bill is very timely as the National  Weather Service announced last week that it will be transitioning NWS  Chat to a commercially available instant messaging platform.  Congressional direction, and the corresponding authorization of  appropriations language in this bipartisan commonsense bill will  support the Weather Service's ongoing efforts on this important issue.   With today's technology, disruptions in communication during  emergency events should never occur, let alone be common. This critical  bill will update NWS Chat, a very important communication tool, to be  more dependable. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.
