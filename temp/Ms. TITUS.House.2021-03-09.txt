 Mr. Speaker, I stand in favor of the PRO Act. And what a  perfect acronym it is, because this bill is, indeed, proworker,  procapitalism, proeconomic recovery, profamily, prowomen, just pro- American.   I am proud to represent a State with a large union presence, a large  organized labor presence that has over 161,000 union members, just as I  am proud to vote for this bill.   We have seen firsthand how unions enable workers to have better pay,  better benefits, better working conditions. Unions also help address  the gender wage gap and promote diversity. Indeed, they are the tide  that lifts all ships; yet, across the country, the right to unionize  has come under assault.   In the face of these attacks, the PRO Act is the strongest upgrade to  workers' collective bargaining rights in nearly a century.                                time  1345    It will empower workers to exercise their rights and hold employers  accountable when they try to stand in the way.   I include in the Record a letter from UNITE HERE also in support of  the PRO Act.                                                        Unitehere!,                                         Office of the President,                                       Las Vegas, NV, March 9, 2021.      Re Support the PRO Act (H.R. 842).       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: I urge you to support the Protecting       the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, H.R. 842. Like President       Biden, the workers we organize in the casino, hotel, and food       service industries believe the union is the path to the       middle class. The PRO Act will remove many obstacles to       joining a union and achieving a union contract through       collective bargaining. It will give millions of workers a       real opportunity to lift up themselves and their families       into the American middle class.        One of the most significant provisions of the PRO Act is to       introduce meaningful, enforceable penalties for breaking       federal labor law. President Biden has spoken forcefully for       the need to hold corporate executives personally accountable       for interfering in union elections and violating other labor       laws. We should hold corporate decision makers personally       responsible in order to protect employees against illegal       anti-union actions just as we hold executives responsible in       order to protect investors against illegal financial       reporting practices under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.        In Las Vegas, workers at the Station Casinos chain have       fought for over a decade to unionize. These workers--cooks,       food servers, bartenders, cocktail servers, porters, hotel       housekeepers--have seen their efforts thwarted every step of       the way by Station Casinos. The company and its two       billionaire owners have faced little consequence for the       company's long-running anti-union campaign of threats,       intimidation, promises, and other interference in employees'       efforts to exercise their right to join a union as well as       Trumpian refusals to recognize workers' democratic decisions       to unionize without costly litigation. The experience of       Station Casinos workers shows exactly why it is vitally       important to pass the PRO Act to provide for real penalties       to corporate and executive wrongdoing when it comes to worker       rights.        In September 2012, the National Labor Relations Board ruled       that Station Casinos broke the law dozens of times in its       initial response to worker organizing at its Las Vegas       casinos. As a remedy, the NLRB required the company to post a       notice at all its properties promising not to do so again.       Given this mere slap on the wrist by the government, it is       perhaps unsurprising that Station Casinos would continue to       use certain of the same tactics to oppose unionization that       it promised it would not engage in.        Notwithstanding their employer's opposition, Station       Casinos workers persevered and won NLRB-conducted       representation elections at several of the companies'       properties. They did so amidst Station Casinos' ongoing anti-      union campaign: at Boulder Station, 67% of workers voted Yes       to joining the union in September 2016; 78% voted Yes for the       union at Green Valley Ranch Casino in November 2017; 83%       voted Yes at Palms Casino in April 2018; 82% voted Yes at       Sunset Station in June 2019; 85% voted Yes at Fiesta Rancho       Casino in June 2019; and 57% voted Yes at Fiesta Henderson       Casino in September 2019.        But these election victories have not led to bargaining       victories. Station Casinos refused to accept the results of       several of these landslide results. Instead it mounted a       time-consuming litigation campaign through the NLRB and, in       two instances, the courts, seeking to overturn workers'       democratic choices. It did so despite public statements that       it would respect the results of NLRB elections.        Even after Station Casinos stopped litigating election       results and started to negotiate with the union, it has made       massive unilateral changes in what the Union alleges is an       effort to frustrate the possibility of reaching collective       bargaining agreements. While the Union expects that the       NLRB's Acting General Counsel's office will do everything in       his power to address these alleged unfair labor practices, he       still has no better remedies available to him than when       Station Casinos was first cited with lawbreaking in 2012.        Years of facing no real consequences culminated in a       frenzied campaign by Station Casinos to stop workers at its       largest property, Red Rock Resort, from voting for the union       in December 2019. The company's action was so brazen and       egregious that the NLRB is currently seeking a rare federal       court injunction against it. But it should not have gotten to       this point for there to be potentially real consequences for       a company that repeatedly breaks federal labor law.       Recidivism should have consequences.        Station Casinos has been able to attack its employee's       federal rights to organize and collectively bargain for years       with impunity because the company and its decision makers--      ultimately its billionaire owners--have not had to pay,       literally and figuratively, for management's breaking the       law, denying workers' right to organize, and refusing to       recognize the democratic decision to unionize.        The PRO Act would begin to change this unfair situation by       putting real teeth into the National Labor Relations Act,       including permitting the NLRB to impose personal liability on       corporate directors and officers who participate in       violations of workers' rights or have knowledge of and fail       to prevent such violations. This and other changes are       necessary to change the anti-union behavior of those who are       insulated from the consequences of lawbreaking by their       enormous amount of legal and other resources at their       disposal.        Real monetary penalties and personal liability--including       jail time, as President Biden has argued--are what will make       corporate decision makers understand that it is the national       policy of the United States, enshrined in the National Labor       Relations Act, to encourage unionization and collective       bargaining. With the PRO Act, we can begin to modernize our       legal system to advance American workers' rights to organize       and collectively bargain in accordance with that national       policy.        I urge you to vote Yes on the PRO Act.            Sincerely,                                                         D. Taylor,                                                         President.
