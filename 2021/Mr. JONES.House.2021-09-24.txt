 Madam Speaker, a few weeks ago, the far right, a 6-3  majority on the Supreme Court, quietly overturned Roe v. Wade.   Today, we pass the Women's Health Protection Act to restore  reproductive freedom nationwide and protect fundamental rights that the  Supreme Court will not.    These justices will do whatever they can to erase reproductive  rights. So we  [[Page H5152]]  must also restore balance to the Supreme Court by adding seats. The  American people agree. Not just 90 percent of Democrats, but 61 percent  of Independents.   Until we end the domination of the far-right majority, reproductive  freedom will never be secure.
