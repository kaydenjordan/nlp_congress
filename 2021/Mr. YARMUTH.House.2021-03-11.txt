 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago this Saturday, a young couple  in my hometown of Louisville were in bed when their door was broken  down. The terrified couple leaped for cover, and the man, a licensed  gun owner, fired a single shot toward the men busting into his home,  hitting one in the leg.   The intruders responded with a barrage of gunfire so wild that it not  only killed the woman but narrowly missed a 5-year-old in another  apartment.   There is no mystery about the killers' identities, yet they remain  free.  [[Page H1339]]    That this is unjust, tragic, and an abomination should be beyond  debate. Instead, it is hardly unique in America for two reasons,  because the killers wore badges and their victims were Black.   One year later, we are still demanding justice for Breonna Taylor,  for her grieving friends and family and aching community and country.   Until this horrific story stops repeating, until we can say that, in  America's policing and justice system, Black lives truly matter, we  will not stop fighting; we will never stop demanding justice for  Breonna; and we will never stop saying her name.                            ____________________
