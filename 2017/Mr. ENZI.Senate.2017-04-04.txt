 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to offer my support for the  nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United  States of America.   Several weeks ago, shortly after President Trump announced this  nomination, I came to the floor to say what an admirable choice he had  made and had known him for some time.   After meeting with Judge Gorsuch to discuss his nomination and after  reviewing his qualifications and after observing my colleagues on the  Senate Judiciary Committee thoroughly vet him, I am all the more  convinced that this man is eminently qualified to serve as America's  next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.   I was impressed that both of his Senators introduced him to the  committee for the hearing. I was kind of surprised that the biggest  comments that I heard about the hearing itself, were that he did not  answer some of the questions directly. As with previous Justices, they  do not answer questions directly when they are asked a theoretical  question about some possible future case that might come before them  and are without the details.   Another reason that I am convinced that he is very qualified is that  the people with whom he went to school have all had good comments to  say about him. The people he went to law school with have had good  comments. The people who have been on the bar with him--in the legal  arena--have had good comments to say about him and so have the other  judges with whom he has worked through the years as he has moved up  through the different processes.   I am confident that he is qualified to be our next Justice because of  his extensive judicial experience, his commitment to the rule of law,  and his principled character.   Neil Gorsuch's first job out of law school was a couple of blocks  from here. Even back then, he was already preparing to serve his  country on the  [[Page S2329]]  Supreme Court by learning from some of the best jurists in America. He  performed clerkships first for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC  Circuit and later for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy at the  U.S. Supreme Court.   After working in private practice and at the Department of Justice,  in 2006 President George W. Bush nominated Judge Gorsuch to serve on  the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. The Senate confirmed  him by a voice vote. That is unanimous.   Let me say that again because it is relevant to the misplaced--in my  opinion--partisan rancor we are hearing over this nomination. In 2006,  only Lindsey Graham bothered to attend the Senate Judiciary Committee's  hearing to consider Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Tenth Circuit  Court of Appeals. This body--including then-Senators Joe Biden, Hillary  Clinton, and Barack Obama--was so confident about Neil Gorsuch's  character and his qualifications to serve as a Federal judge that he  was confirmed by the Senate without anyone even asking for a recorded  vote.   With what was in essence an endorsement from three of the most  influential political figures then serving in the Senate among my  colleagues across the aisle, I find some of the opposition to Judge  Gorsuch and the questioning of his qualifications somewhat baffling. I  hope my colleagues in the Senate will put aside the political bickering  and scorekeeping that have dominated Washington over the last several  months and give Neil Gorsuch a fair vote, up or down, based on his  qualifications and his suitability for service on the Supreme Court.   Since joining the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has been a busy man,  doing exactly the kind of work that makes him qualified for this  nomination. The Tenth Circuit exercises appellate jurisdiction of  Federal cases originating in eight States that cover about 20 percent  of America's landmass. That jurisdiction does include my home State of  Wyoming.   As a member of the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch estimates that he sat  on appellate panels considering approximately 1,800 criminal cases and  1,200 civil cases. The list of citations of case decisions he has  authored is a single-spaced, 21-page document. After hearing all of  those cases and drafting all of those opinions, even Judge Gorsuch's  detractors have criticized only a mere handful of the hundreds of  opinions he has authored.   I am confident that Neil Gorsuch is qualified to be a member of the  Supreme Court because of his steadfast commitment to the rule of law.  The many opinions he has written are known for being clear and easy to  understand. But, most importantly, his opinions reflect his respect for  following the law as it is written and for applying and adhering to  judicial precedent. He is a judge who applies the law to the facts of  the case and reaches the conclusion that the examination yields,  regardless of his own personal beliefs.   As he said, ``Personal politics or policy preferences have no useful  role in judging; regular and healthy doses of self-skepticism and  humility about one's own abilities and conclusions always do.''   Judge Gorsuch is an adherent to, and defender of, America's  Constitution and the separation of powers that document prescribes. As  he said, ``Judges must allow the elected branches of government to  flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives, to make  laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the day.''   Throughout this nomination process, during all of which Judge Gorsuch  has been under a political microscope, we have seen that he is a man of  admirable character with a temperament that makes him well suited to  serve as a Supreme Court Justice.   We know he has a resilient character and thick skin--qualities  important to any Justice--because we have seen his demeanor and  response to the criticism of his career and negative characterizations  about some of his previous decisions--very few of them, I should add.  We have seen his reaction in the face of accusations about his judicial  independence. In the face of that--biting disparagement about the work  he has spent his life trying to perfect--Judge Gorsuch has been  respectful, remarkably patient, and resolutely committed to upholding  the ethical canons and conduct demanded of him as a jurist.   We have glimpsed Judge Gorsuch's character as he has spoken about the  people he values and those he strives to emulate. His legal heroes are  people like Justice White, who he said ``followed the law wherever it  took him without fear or favor to anyone''; Justice Anthony Kennedy,  who, Judge Gorsuch said, ``showed me that judges can disagree without  being disagreeable''; and Justice Scalia, who reminds us ``that the  judge's job is to follow the words that are in the law--not to replace  them with words that aren't.''   Neil Gorsuch has told us that he has also looked closer to home, to  his family, to shape his character: his mother, who he said ``taught me  that headlines are fleeting, but courage lasts''; his father, who he  said showed him that kindness ``is the great virtue''; his paternal  grandfather, who Judge Gorsuch said taught him that ``lawyers exist to  help people with their problems, not the other way around.''   Neil Gorsuch has demonstrated his commitment to the law, his  scholarship, and his temperament befitting that of a judge. He is  eminently qualified to be a member of the Supreme Court--not in my  opinion--that is what the judges have said.   I am not the only one who believes this. My office has received  hundreds of calls and letters from my constituents in Wyoming urging  the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch. He has a lot of support from folks  in the Wyoming legal community, from both parties, whom I know and  trust and whose opinions I value.   Judge Gorsuch has earned a ``well qualified'' rating--the highest  rating they award from the American Bar Association. To give him this  rating, the ADA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted  a peer review of Judge Gorsuch's integrity, professional competence,  and judicial temperament.   As children we all learn that you might be able to fool your parents  or our teachers, but you can never fool your peers. You especially  cannot fool ones with whom you have worked long hours like most judges  and lawyers are known to do. You can't fool your peers. They are the  ones who see you at your best and at your worst. That is why it is so  remarkable that dozens of Neil Gorsuch's Harvard Law School  classmates--people representing many different political and  philosophical persuasions and who have known him for more than a  quarter of a century--signed a letter supporting his nomination to the  Supreme Court.   Among our most important duties as Members of this body is to  carefully vet all nominees who come before us. Never is that  responsibility so stark and so substantial than when our Nation faces a  vacancy on the Supreme Court.   In November, millions of people went to the polls and rejected the  kind of tired, partisan bickering when they voted for a change in  Washington. Those same voters went to the polls knowing that there was  a vacancy on the Supreme Court and that whoever became the next  President would choose that nominee.   For many weeks now, Judge Gorsuch has been before us as that nominee.  He has undergone scrutiny under which most of us would wither. We have  all had time to examine his record.   I thank Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and all of our  Senate colleagues who serve on the Judiciary Committee for conducting  such thorough and detailed nomination hearings that provided us ample  opportunity to examine Judge Gorsuch's qualifications and temperament.   I believe there is only one logical conclusion to reach after all of  this examination; that is, that Judge Neil Gorsuch is supremely  qualified for and capable of the solemn and mighty task of serving as  the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this confirmation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I appreciate having this opportunity to  recognize the 102nd annual conference of the Wyoming State Society,  Daughters of the American Revolution. This year's conference is being  held in Casper and once again promises to be an interesting,  informative, and inspirational event.   In the years since the National Society Daughters of the American  Revolution was founded on October 11, 1890, the organization has kept  its focus on the preservation and promotion of the ideals, principles,  and values that are reflected in our Charters of Freedom--the  Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  They knew what a great gift we have been given with our citizenship in  the United States of America and they wanted to show their great pride  in those who had fought for our freedom as a nation and won it.   With such a strong base on which to build, it is no wonder that the  DAR continues to grow in size and influence. Year after year, more and  more people are drawn to join the DAR and help to promote the  principles and values of our Nation. That is why it is really no wonder  that the DAR can now boast of over 185,000 members all over the world.  In Wyoming, that enthusiasm shows itself as each chapter continues to  encourage its members to be more active and involved in the day-to-day  workings of our government on the local, State, and national levels.   There is only one qualification for membership in the DAR. You must  be able to trace your lineage back to the days of our fight for  freedom, when a young nation took up arms to sever the ties between the  United States and Great Britain. Some member of your family must have  been a part of our American Revolution for you to be accepted into the  DAR as a member. It is then up to you to continue the work that a  member of your family began.   That legacy has been handed down to the members of the DAR and to all  of us as American citizens. It is also the legacy we will hand down to  our children and grandchildren.   We recognize the members of the DAR and the difference all of you are  making as individuals and as members of an organization that has been  keeping the ``Spirit of `76'' alive for generations now. The principles  and values that are embodied in our Charters of Freedom have helped you  to make a difference and that has helped to make our nation a better  place for us all to live.   Thank you for the good work you do.                            ____________________
