 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of SECURE 2.0.  Since my time as Kansas State Treasurer and a member of the Ways and  Means Committee, increased retirement security for Americans of all  ages has been a major policy priority for me.   Building on our great success with the SECURE Act in 2019, SECURE 2.0  includes a number of provisions for new employees and near-retirees,  like my bill to improve the required minimum distribution rules, and my  bill that  [[Page H3942]]  would make it easier for employees to save for retirement and pay off  their student loans.   Employers who are part of an employee stock ownership plan--like the  Kansas workers I have talked to at Inland Truck Parts, Conco, and  others--benefit from the bipartisan ESOP provisions in SECURE 2.0.   The bill also ensures public-sector and nonprofit retirement programs  have the same access to low-cost retirements, just like for-profit  retirement plans.   It allows individuals who have decided to pay down a student loan  instead of contributing to a 401(k) to still receive an employee match  for their retirement plans.   These commonsense retirement security reforms deserve to be law, and  I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on SECURE 2.0.                                time  1630
