 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind us  all of the great American Red Cross program, Holidays for Heroes, an  opportunity to thank and support our military, veterans, and their  families throughout this holiday season.   We all look forward to gathering with family and friends and loved  ones this time of year. For our servicemembers, that is a luxury that  all too often is not able to happen.   These men and women spend many months at a time--at times over a year  and, in their service, years--away from their families. That is  difficult no matter what time of year it is, but it is around the  holidays their sacrifice is magnified.   I would like to encourage everyone to reach out to their local Red  Cross chapters to find out how to send a card, how to volunteer or get  involved however they see fit to spread some holiday cheer to our  heroes. Even a small gesture can brighten the holiday season for those  that are deployed; a reminder that they are remembered, that they are  appreciated every day, especially during this holiday season.   So take a moment out of your day today to let a soldier know just how  much you appreciate them.                            ____________________
