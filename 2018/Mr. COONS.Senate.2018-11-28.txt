 Madam President, I am proud to join the Senator from  Arizona and the Senator from New Jersey on the floor today in calling  for action on a bipartisan bill--a bill that has been crafted to  protect our institutions and safeguard the rule of law in this country  not just right now but for future Congresses and administrations as  well.   Today, we will be asking our colleagues to give the Special Counsel  Independence and Integrity Act the consideration here on the floor of  the Senate that it deserves. This bill would do something simple but  powerful: It would codify Department of Justice regulations that  prevent the removal of a special counsel without good cause. That might  seem like a small detail, but it is important. Independence is required  to ensure that a special counsel can do his or her job and find the  facts.   Our bipartisan bill would put this restriction in statute and give  the special counsel a clear legal remedy. If removed without cause, the  special counsel would have a 10-day period to take the case to a three- judge panel for expedited consideration. If the special counsel doesn't  wish to contest his removal, it would proceed without interference.   Both Republicans and Democrats recognize that removal of the current  special counsel without a valid basis would be a significant, even a  catastrophic event. It would be a constitutional crisis that would  threaten the Presidency and the rule of law. We can work together to  prevent a crisis.   President Trump should be the first person to support this bill. He  has raised concerns about oversight of the special counsel. He has  accused the prosecutors of making partisan, politically motivated  decisions. This act would ensure that regulations providing for  supervision and oversight of the investigation are not just codified  but strengthened. It would ensure that Congress gets a complete picture  at the end of the investigation.   My colleagues Senators Graham, Tillis, Booker, Grassley, and  Feinstein were instrumental in crafting this balanced legislation, and  it passed the Judiciary Committee by a strong bipartisan margin of 14  to 7, 7 months ago. The time to take up and pass this bill in the  Senate is now.   Some have questioned the need for this legislation. They have said  the President would never fire Special Counsel Mueller, and I hope and  pray they are right. I don't think it would be in President Trump's  interest to remove the special counsel and certainly not in the  interest of our country.   The President has repeatedly, publicly, and directly attacked the  special counsel and his investigation. Just yesterday, he called his  investigation a ``phony witch hunt'' that is ``doing tremendous damage  to our criminal justice system.'' The President has already fired the  FBI Director and forced the resignation of the Attorney General, citing  grievances related to this investigation in both cases.   We have an Acting Attorney General not confirmed by the Senate, with  no nominee in sight to conduct oversight of this investigation, which  is unprecedented and not acceptable.   This bill addresses threats not just to this special counsel but  future special counsels. I would ask my colleagues who are holding back  this bill to consider whether they may wish it were the law in a  Democratic administration as well. We should all appreciate the ways in  which this protects the rule of law.   Let me close by quoting what my colleague Chairman Grassley said when  he expressed his view back in April that this should be considered by  the full Senate during our Judiciary Committee markup on the bill:         In some ways, today's vote will say a lot about how each of       us views our responsibilities as Senators. We took an oath to       protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, but       we're not judges or Presidents. We are stewards of the       legislative branch. The Founders anticipated that we would       wield the powers the Constitution affords us with great       ambition so that we could effectively check the powers of the       other branches. This bill certainly does that.    I am confident that, if allowed to go to a vote, this bill would pass  with more than 60 votes.   History will judge us for how we work together to confront the  challenges that face our Nation. The rest of the world is watching. It  is important to take up and pass this bill.   I now recognize my colleague, a cosponsor of this legislation, the  Senator from New Jersey.    Will my colleague from Utah consider a question?    Was Justice Scalia's dissent in Morrison v. Olson a  majority opinion?    Madam President, will the Senator yield for another  question?    Let me just conclude by saying that the DC Circuit  reconsidered this issue just this year and in their decision said that  Morrison remains valid and binding precedent.   I know we have other urgent business to move to, but I will simply  say that I am grateful for the work of my colleague from Arizona.  Despite the objection of my colleague from Utah, I am convinced this is  an important bill that we should continue to bring forward on the floor  of the Senate.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Marcus Wright  of my staff be given floor privileges for the remainder of this  Congress.
