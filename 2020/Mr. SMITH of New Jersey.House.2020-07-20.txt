 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank Mac  Thornberry for his tremendous and exemplary work in Congress,  especially for all things related to the military. What a tremendous  chairman, now serving as ranking member. I thank him for that service.   Mr. Speaker, last year, I was joined by my friend and colleague,  Collin Peterson of Minnesota, to offer an amendment to the NDAA to task  the Pentagon IG to probe whether ticks were ever weaponized with Lyme  disease or any other dangerous pathogen. Our legislation passed the  House but died in the Senate. I was told that the IG did not have  sufficient capacity or bandwidth to investigate.   So, tonight, the new Smith-Peterson amendment instead tasks the GAO  with that job.   Mr. Speaker, for years, books and articles have been written credibly  asserting that significant research at Fort Detrick, Plum Island, and  elsewhere was conducted to turn ticks into bioweapons.   In her book, ``Bitten: The Secret History of Lyme Disease and  Biological Weapons,'' Kris Newby includes interviews with Dr. Willy  Burgdorfer, the researcher who is credited with discovering Lyme  disease. It turns out that Dr. Burgdorfer was a bioweapons specialist.   The interviews, combined with access to Dr. Burgdorfer's files,  reveal that he and other bioweapons specialists stuffed ticks with  pathogens in a quest to cause severe disability, disease, and death.   Mr. Speaker, with Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases  exploding in the United States, an estimated 300,000 to 427,000 new  cases each year, and 10 to 20 percent of those people with chronic Lyme  disease, Americans have a right  [[Page H3580]]  to know whether or not any of this is true.   Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of questions that we ask in the  amendment, but the most important question of all: Can any of the  information that might be gleaned from a GAO study help current-day  researchers find a way to mitigate and, hopefully, cure Lyme disease  and other tick-borne diseases?   Mr. Speaker, the amendment tasks GAO to ask the hard questions. I,  again, thank my good friend for his leadership.                                time  2030     Mr. Speaker, as the proud representative of  two Navy bases in NJ, I come to the floor today to offer an amendment  that addresses one of the most serious threats to our Navy and sailors:  North Korean & Iranian mini-submarines.   Today, Mr. Speaker, we have no realistic training to defend U.S.  carriers & other ships from this threat.   A Los Angeles-class submarine captain told me how he lost sleep over  the two-man, diesel-electric mini-submarines that can lie on the bottom  of waterways undetected.   Decades ago, North Korea secretly purchased a mini-sub from a German  company, and reproduced copies for itself and Iran, which also began  reproducing copies.   That the same German-designed mini-sub has a twin--today owned by a  small American company in my district, and is available to help train  U.S. sailors to detect such weapons.   My amendment proposes a $15 million investment to use this American- owned mini-submarine for detection training, a project that has the  support of numerous current and former Navy personnel.
