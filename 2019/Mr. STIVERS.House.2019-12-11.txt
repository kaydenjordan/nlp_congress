 Madam Chair, I thank Ranking Member Walden for yielding,  and I commend him for his efforts to limit drug prices and continue  innovation.   I have a concern about the increased costs that both H.R. 3 and H.R.  19, as well as Senate proposals, could have on small manufacturers  through the part D redesign.   These small manufacturers often serve the Low-Income Subsidy  population that are our most vulnerable, and it would  disproportionately affect their access to lifesaving and life-changing  medications, such as drugs for mental illness and addiction. H.R. 3 is  catastrophic to this population.   Madam Chair, I ask to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from  Oregon and seek his commitment to ensure small manufacturers and the  LIS population are not inadvertently penalized as this process moves  forward of our alternative.
