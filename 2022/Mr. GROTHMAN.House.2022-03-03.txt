 Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss a few topics which  should be of interest to all Americans.   Obviously, many Americans have been glued to their TVs this week to  see what is happening in Ukraine and what is going on with the Russians  and the way they are treating the Ukrainian people.   I would like to emphasize one more time that it amazes me the  journalists of this country and the politicians of this country can  talk about the two countries, Russia and Ukraine, without talking about  the Holodomor.   I have asked children, college students, law enforcement officers,  journalists. Amazingly, they have gone through 8 or 12 or 16 years of  schooling and don't know what it is.   The Holodomor took place in 1932 to 1933 when communism had in the  last few years taken over Russia and taken over Ukraine. Of course,  communists, above all, hate freedom. I don't know if you could describe  Russia's communists today--maybe a little more fascist than communist.  But at the time, there was no question it was communist, and they  didn't like the fact that the farmers, called the kulaks, were, to a  degree, free and independent. They were going to crack down on them by  taking away their grain and making sure they would starve to death.   Now, perhaps because it has not been adequately studied, we don't  know how many people were killed by the Communist Party in Ukraine  during the years 1932 to 1933, but if you peruse the internet, it is  somewhere between 3 and 17 million.   Interestingly, at the same time these people were starving, the  person The New York Times put on the case was a guy by the name of  Walter Duranty, who they have since admitted they recognized he had  some significant flaws in his study, but he managed not to report the  starvation. The readers of The New York Times at that time thought that  things were going great in the Soviet Union and that this might well be  the wave of the future.   This is what happens when we have people, progressives, whatever you  want to call them, who are blind to the inevitable, horrible things  that happen when you let the hardcore left, or what I would call the  atheistic totalitarian left, take over a country.    I would hope, as we talk about Ukraine and Russia, that our media  outlets, be it newspaper or otherwise, use this as an opportunity to  educate the American public as to how many millions of people starved  to death during this time.   Every New York Times employee should have to listen to this show upon  employment about what happened and about what the readers of The New  York Times were not told about during these years. Every journalism  major should spend a few classes when they begin journalism school on  this topic. No American schoolchild should graduate eighth grade  without hearing about the Holodomor.   Not only is it a warning for what happens when we let the hardcore  left take over, but I don't know how you can understand American  history, the last 80 years, unless you know a little bit more about  communism.   How can American children know why we fought in Korea? How could  American children know why we fought in Vietnam? How will American  children know what we had a Cold War over?   I don't understand how you can talk about Ukraine and Russia without  hearing about the first Ukrainian experiences with communism. It is the  reason why some people like me are so befuddled why Senator Blumenthal  is given kind of a free pass when he shows up at a communist  anniversary. It is why people like me find it so offensive that two of  the cofounders of Black Lives Matter were Marxists and that  organization is treated with respect.   This is why I am so concerned when we have owners of high-tech quasi- monopolies try to suppress information hostile to their progressive  ideology. Just like in a hardcore leftist state, they would oppress the  ability of the local people to find out views on all sorts of opinions.  By the way, that is going on in the Soviet Union today.                                time  1245    We turn on the TV and we get all sorts of information about what is  going on in the Ukraine. The average Russian citizen, whose children  are dying in the Ukraine, they don't get to find out what is really  going on. Some people call it Communist; some people call it Marxist. I  don't think Progressive is exactly the same thing, but clearly  Progressive is meant to be further left than Liberal.   I would hope that by the time this Ukrainian/Russian situation wraps  up that American journalists make sure that everybody knows about the  Holodomor.   Mr. Speaker, the next thing I would like to talk about in President  Biden's annual speech, I think he got away--because of what happened in  the Ukraine--without addressing some of the other problems that are, I  think, unaddressed.   I am going to talk a little bit about inflation. I am not like my  good buddy from Arizona with huge graphs, but I want people to look at  this little graph that is on a topic that is normally considered  boring: the money supply.   Here we have a graph showing the degree to which the money supply  goes up year over year. You will notice the money supply, compared to  historic levels, went up rather dramatically, sometimes over 6 percent  in the 1970s. People like me are old enough to remember that that is  when mortgages were 20 percent and inflation was so high.   If we look at this graph, we see that recently the money supply went  up around 7 percent, then dropped down to almost nothing in the 1990s.  It recently has hit a year over year increase of 40 percent. I would  hope that President Biden realizes that one of the reasons costs have  gone so far up might have something to do with this dramatic increase  in the money supply. This is an amazing graph.   President Biden--understanding so much about business--has simply  advised us the way to deal with inflation is to tell businessmen to cut  costs. Well, I will tell you, my district has more manufacturing jobs  than any other district in the country and it is also a big agriculture  district.   When I had a couple weeks off in the past, I toured a lot of  factories around my district. One of the things I heard, in addition to  the huge labor shortage,  [[Page H1295]]  is the huge increase in the costs of production, particularly in  metals. Aluminum is going through the roof. Metals are up 300, 400, 500  percent compared to a couple years ago.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask President Biden: How do you lower costs if  the cost of metals that are going into your product are up 300 to 400  percent?   I mentioned I also have a big agriculture district, a lot of dairy,  some corn, some potatoes. What do I get from the farmers? They are  actually very concerned also about their costs of production: feed,  fertilizer, chemicals. Again, it is all skyrocketing. It is not a  matter of just telling businesses to cut their costs.   These are the reasons why inflation is so high and why our young  people--who I worry about so much because they should be able to get on  with their life, they should be able to build a new house, they should  begin to be able to have children. I look at the costs that are  necessary to live the American Dream.   Housing. Did you ever look at how much the price of a house has gone  up the last 18 months? Apartments. Now, I realize the cost of  apartments varies dramatically, but in my area you used to be able to  get an apartment for $600, $700, $800 a month. Now apartments are being  rented for $1,500 a month.   I don't know how the young people are going to be able to afford the  American Dream unless politicians begin to realize that when you have  these big spending programs and the Fed has to print dollars to pay for  them, you are inevitably going to get inflation.   I beg President Biden and I beg the members of the Budget Committee  and the Appropriations Committee that as we work towards the next  budget, we try to hold down the level of spending. It wouldn't be too  much to ask if we had year over year no increase in spending at all.   I beg President Biden and other members of his party not to push  through another massive spending bill. They talk about a $3 trillion  bill, and he still dreams of getting it through. If it is not a $3  trillion bill or if they get a $2 trillion or $1 trillion bill, it will  further put the price of housing beyond reach of the young people in  the country.   One of the reasons it is so tempting for politicians to just print  more money is because then they can say: I don't know how this increase  in prices got here. It is not my fault. Just tell the businessmen to  cut costs. It is not a coincidence that we had a lot of inflation in  the 1970s when M2 was going up significantly.   It is not going to be a coincidence when inflation continues to go up  year after year as the business community and the agriculture community  tells me it will. If politicians in Washington, in their path to  reelection, decide that it means having the Federal Reserve print more  money, let the costs go up, and then turn around and tell the American  public: I don't know how this happened, tell the businessmen to cut  costs. Please address inflation like the great concern it is.   Mr. Speaker, the next thing I would like to address that I don't feel  was adequately addressed the other night is the way we treat police in  the country.   President Biden tried to address spending on police. It is true that  particularly in big cities with strong Democrat city councils, strong  Democrat mayors, they have not treated the police well the last few  years. I don't think President Biden addressed what I believe is the  big reason why police have not been as effective in holding down the  homicide rates compared to a few years ago.   I think the major reason is that cheap politicians are out there  lying and telling the public that they are racist. They are saying we  ought to sue them, they are saying that we ought to pass legislation  here in which it will make it easy to sue them. You wind up in a  situation where the police become passive.   As bad as the reduction in the number of police is, I think this  constant harping on racism and the police and let's make it easier to  sue them makes matters even worse. I want to commend President Biden,  he didn't talk about racism on Tuesday night, and that was a great  improvement from his inaugural speech where it was kind of like all  racism, white supremacy, blah, blah, blah.    It would be nice if he would use the forum of the annual State of the  Union address to apologize to the police of the country and educate the  American public that the police, by and large in this Nation, are not  racist. When you look at studies, and there are a variety of studies we  can pull up here, a Justice Department analysis of the Philadelphia  Police Department found that White police officers were less likely  than police officers of color to shoot unarmed Black suspects, for  example.   When you adjust, sadly, for violent crimes committed, again, you  don't find this racism. In an effort to win the next election--and they  had success in the last election--again and again politicians are  tearing down police departments and threatening to have the police  sued. It is not surprising when the police become very passive, knowing  that if you arrest somebody you could get a complaint filed against  you; knowing that if you have to handcuff somebody or tackle somebody  that there are politicians out there that want you to be sued. It is  not surprising if the police become passive.   In the big, urban city closest to my heart, Milwaukee, where I was  born and where my district is right up against, 2 years ago we hit the  all-time record by a mile in murders. I didn't think it could get any  higher, but they broke the record again last year.   I know if you talk to the police--they won't say it publicly--but  they aren't policing the way they could 10 years ago because they are  afraid they might get in trouble, they might get complaints, they might  get sued or whatever. They back off and a lot of people have paid for  that backing off with their lives.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly wish President Biden would change his tune,  stop pushing bills that make it easy to sue police, and above all,  change the tone of discussion about policing in this country by  admitting how un-racist the police are in this Nation and bring out  more respect for them and allow police to not be afraid to do their  job.   Mr. Speaker, the next issue that I would like to address--and I wish  President Biden would have used his opportunity on Tuesday night to  address--he mentioned COVID and COVID deaths go up and COVID deaths go  down. We still have about 1,500 people a day dying of COVID. I have  known four people, who I think were relatively healthy, who passed away  in the last 4 months of COVID. We shouldn't forget about it.   There are some things I have talked about COVID, and for whatever  reason the public health establishment--and I think to a degree the  President does control the public health establishment--have not  addressed vitamin D.   There were studies that came out of Israel this week that they should  have advertisements on all over this country. Israel found that  patients with a vitamin D deficiency--and I think a vitamin D  deficiency was described under 30-nanograms per milliliter--were 14  times more likely to have a severe or critical case of COVID-19 than  those people with sufficient vitamin D in their system.   The mortality rate for those who had insufficient vitamin D levels  was over 25 percent compared to 2.3 percent. In other words, you were  more than 12 times as likely to die of COVID if you didn't have  adequate vitamin D in your system.   I don't know why the public health establishment won't talk about  this more. I have been talking about it for almost 2 years now. I  realize that you can get nice bottles of vitamin D for $15 or $20 at  Walgreens or wherever, so nobody is going a make a lot of money on it.  And certainly, there are a lot of ways people made a lot of money with  COVID so far.   I do believe that if they pushed vitamin D--not everybody would  believe the commercials and not everybody would follow through--but I  think it is entirely possible that you would reduce the number of  fatalities by one-half.   I asked President Biden to weigh in with his agencies and weigh in  with the CDD or NIH, and have them educate the public on the huge  potential savings in lives if Americans would have an adequate amount  of vitamin D.   I don't like breaking out people of different ethnic backgrounds, but  right now people of color are much more likely to be vitamin D  deficient than people of European descent. So by not  [[Page H1296]]  trumpeting from the rooftops that vitamin D can save your lives, you  are unquestionably disproportionately causing people of color to die of  this horrible disease. I realize there are other things that could be  done.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, I will repeat here: insufficient vitamin D levels, 25.6  mortality rate compared to 2.3 percent with adequate levels. People  with vitamin D deficiency are 14 times more likely to have a severe or  critical case of COVID.   Why does the average person not know this?   I tell them when I run into them, but I can't talk to everybody. It  would be nice if the public health establishment would talk a little  bit more about that.   One other thing, by the way, I was hoping on COVID he would do, the  protocol of a lot of hospitals is to determine the drugs they prescribe  by what is recommended out of the big agencies in the government. And  there are a lot of very intelligent people who feel that we would have  saved a lot of people if we could have used off-label drugs rather than  the $3,000-a-day remdesivir. In other words, they felt there were  better drugs that would probably cost one-hundredth of the amount of  the drug that was being pushed out of CDC. It would be nice in America,  the land of the free, if we would allow doctors in hospitals to use  these other drugs. I think, again, Mr. Speaker, you would have  significant savings compared to where we stand right now.   These are some of topics that I think were not addressed and should  have been addressed and would save lives if appropriately addressed in  the State of the Union.   We will mention one more because we have a little bit of time here.  President Biden, to his credit, pointed out that a lot of people are  dying from illegal drugs. He didn't exactly have any concrete proposals  as to what to do. When I got this job 7 years ago, 47,000 Americans  were dying every year from illegal drug overdoses. Fifty-seven thousand  people died in 12 years in the Vietnam war. And they made a big deal  about that when I was a child. Now you have 47,000 in 1 year, Mr.  Speaker, when I got elected.   Do you know what it is now, Mr. Speaker?   One hundred thousand. It is as if we are having two Vietnam wars  every year, and the politicians hardly talk about it.   Now, I think one of the reasons President Biden wouldn't come up with  anything concrete is that almost all the fentanyl--a drug which he  wouldn't even mention by name which is responsible for most of these  deaths--almost all of the fentanyl is coming across the southern  border, and, of course, our President doesn't like to talk about the  southern border because we have a largely open southern border in which  90 to 100,000 people every month are coming across.   It also may mean a little bit more of an aggressive law enforcement  going after the people who sell the fentanyl. But, of course, we can't  say we should have more aggressive law enforcement, and we can't say  that more drug dealers should wind up in prison because then we would  have more in prison.   So rather than doing these things, why don't we just let 100,000  people a year die?   Some people can say drug possession and sale of drugs is a victimless  crime. I say if you think about the parents or the spouses or the  children or the siblings of the 100,000 people who die, I don't know  how we cannot do more to address this problem.   I would hope that next year in the State of the Union speech  President Biden does a little more to address the 100,000 people who  are dying of drug overdoses and does a little more to address the  perhaps hundreds of thousands of people whose lives could be saved if  we freed up doctors to prescribe whatever drugs they wanted to and if  we would have pushed a little bit more vitamin D.   I think we would have a much more well-informed electorate if the  educational system and the journalist establishment did a little more  to educate the public about the Holodomor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
