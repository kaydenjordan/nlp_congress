 Mr. Speaker, I have one question. Why are we using an  infrastructure bill to write the rules for new technology?   That's exactly what's happening today.   The cryptocurrency tax reporting provision in this bill will have  long-lasting and harmful implications for innovation here in the U.S.   So, we need a fix. The ``fix'' debate started in the Senate. But it  didn't go anywhere. And I said in August, if the Senate can't get it  done, we'll fight it out in the House.   So, I'll be introducing a bill to put the guardrails in place to  clarify the scope of the new reporting requirements.   We need to keep America at the forefront of innovation.  [[Page H5477]]
