 Well, thank you.   Mr. President, I want to thank my best friend in politics, Senator  Mark Warner. And I just realized something. John Warner defeated in an  election my best friend in politics, and John Warner also defeated in  an election my political hero, my father-in-law, Linwood Holton, who  was Governor of Virginia from 1970 to 1974.   So I want to talk a little bit about John's effect on me personally  and then also his great partnership when I was mayor of Richmond and  Governor and into the Senate, and then I will hand it back to our  senior Senator for his comments.   When John Warner came out of the Pacific at the end of World War II,  he went back to complete his studies at Washington and Lee. He was a  surface ship guy in the Pacific Navy and went back to Washington and  Lee in Lexington. My father-in-law, Linwood Holton, was a submariner in  the Pacific during World War II and also came back to complete his  studies at Washington and Lee. John Warner and Linwood Holton, my  father-in-law, met in 1946 at W&L, and they were part of the same  fraternity, and John Warner used to always say that my father-in-law  broke a paddle across his backside in a fraternity hazing ritual.   But those friends began a friendship that went to 75 years--75 years  of friendship. My father-in-law is still alive. He will be 98 in  September, and it was an amazing friendship. They worked on projects  together.   As Senator Warner mentioned, they had to build the Republican Party  in Virginia. We were a one-party State, dominated by the Byrd machine  Dixiecrats, and they had to build the Republican Party with just a  handful of others.   My father-in-law became the first Republican-elected Governor of  Virginia, elected in 1969, at the time that John was Secretary of the  Navy.   One day, a Navy ship, moored on the Elizabeth River, broke free and  ran into and destroyed a bridge.   And my father-in-law called: Mr. Secretary.   Yes, Governor.   One of your ships has broken one of my bridges.   They had so much fun together as friends.   In 1978, they ran against each other to be in this body--a four-way  Republican nominating convention. Neither of them won. Dick Obenshain  won that convention. John Warner was second, my father-in-law was  third, and someone else was fourth.   Dick Obenshain was killed in a plane crash, and it was unclear how it  would sort out and who would be the nominee. My father-in-law threw his  support behind John Warner. John Warner got the nomination. John Warner  ran and then became the longest serving Senator in Virginia history,  with 30 years.   When I married Anne in 1984, I was adopted into the John Warner  friendship society because of being part of the Holton family. We were  friends, and I enjoyed him. I admired him, and I saw his work here.   I came into public life as a city councilman and mayor in Richmond,  and John Warner: I have to produce for the mayor of my capital city.   I was a young whippersnapper. I was mayor when I was--I think I was-- 39, and by now John Warner was in his mid-seventies, but he would  produce for the capital city.   And then, as Mark knows, because he had the same relationship when he  was Governor--I was Governor, and I was about 45 or 46, and by now John  Warner was nearly 80--John Warner had an old-fashioned sense: You do  what the Governor says. There are two Senators, but there is only one  Governor.   I treated him like he was the senior partner, but he kind of treated  you, when you were Governor, as, sort of, ``Well, we have to produce  for the Governor.''   We were working on the Metro Silver Line project, the rail to Dulles,  and the project during the George W. Bush administration was about to  be unplugged from life support, after decades of work, and John Warner  helped us get in and save that project.   A tremendous friend, a tremendous supporter, but I will say this and  then hand maybe to Senator Reed, who might want to say a word, and then  back to Senator Warner, because I think Senator Warner might want to be  our closer here.   I got to know a new side of John Warner when I came to the Senate. I  mean, I felt like we were like best friends and family friends, and he  helped me when I was mayor and Governor. I came to the Senate in 2013,  and he had been gone for 4 years. But I started to meet people whom I  didn't know--John McCain and Carl Levin and Jack Reed and so many  others whom I did not know before I was here--and then I really learned  about John Warner.   I learned about his service as the chair and ranking of the Armed  Services Committee. I learned about the fact that he was always in the  middle of whatever gang was trying to do something good. I learned  about his love for this institution. I learned about his love for his  fellow Senators.   I was on a ticket with one of those fellow Senators, Senator Hillary  Clinton, and stood with John Warner when he came out to endorse us, and  he talked with such depth about working together with Senator Clinton  on the Armed Services Committee.   I asked John Warner to come to lunch with me one day in the Senate  Dining Room, and it was like I had brought the Pope in. I mean, we sat  down and everyone--all the staff, everybody working in the Senate  Dining Room, all the Senators and their families--were coming over to  talk to John Warner because they loved him so much. And one of the  reasons they loved him is they knew how much he loved the institution.   There is so much more I could say, but I just want to tell one more  thing. John and I, at some point during my first term, were talking  about the Senate, and we were both regretting that the Senate of today  was not the Senate that John Warner served in--that the relationship- based Senate was turning into a more partisan Senate. And we were just  being candid about that.   But when we finished, John said to me: Old friend--old friend is what  he would call you--old friend, that is the way it is. But it is not in  the water supply, and it is not sick building syndrome. It is just in  the character and priorities of the people who walk in the doors every  day. So if you don't like the way it is right now, guess what. You will  walk in the Capitol tomorrow, and it can be different tomorrow if you  try to make it better.   That was just John's attitude about this country and about this  institution, and it leaves a big hole in my life. I am just grappling  with the big hole in my life now not to have John Warner to go to and  seek his advice.   With that, I yield to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,  the Senator from Rhode Island    Mr. President, amid high unemployment rates across the  Country exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses continue to  face challenges in hiring the skilled workers they need to grow and  thrive. Simultaneously, individuals looking for work may not have the  skills and support that they need to enter or renter--and remain--in  the workforce. Unfortunately the pandemic has slowed the number of  students attending some form of postsecondary education, but even prior  to the pandemic the supply of middle-skilled workers, whose work  requires more than a high school diploma but not a four-year degree,  fell short of industry demand. It's important that States make  strategic investments now to set students up for success in the  constantly-evolving labor market, and the best training for high-wage,  high-skill, or in-demand jobs is often offered by community colleges.   For many people seeking a job, attending a community college is the  most affordable and accessible pathway to higher paying employment  opportunities. In Virginia, we have 23 community colleges that serve an  estimated 400,000 people across the state, providing them opportunities  to earn an associate's degree, certifications or licensures in some of  the most cutting-edge and in-demand fields in our workforce. The impact  of community colleges nationwide is even greater, and our rapidly  changing economy demands increased investment in the pathways these  institutions provide to keep up with changing skill demands. The  rapidly changing U.S. economy demands agile education and workforce  development systems that can keep up with changing skill demands.   Today, I am proud to reintroduce the Assisting Community Colleges in  Educating Skilled Students (ACCESS) to Careers Act with Senator Young.  This bill builds on lessons learned from the Trade Adjustment  Assistance Community College and Career Training grant program  (TAACCCT), and provides grants to community colleges to partner with  private and public sector entities to create innovative career pathways  directly between two-year institutions and employers. The ACCESS to  Careers Act also provides grants to states and community colleges to  scale evidence-based strategies that will help prepare our students  with the skills necessary to succeed in our in-demand industry sectors  and occupations. These grants can be used to expand dual enrollment,  work-based learning opportunities, apprenticeships, and other pathways  to best meet the skill needs of students and employers in our evolving  workforce. The bill also emphasizes the importance of student services  to ensure that students have the support they need to complete their  programs.   As our Country begins to recover from the widespread job losses we've  seen over the last year, the success of our economy will depend on our  ability to provide people with the resources they need to quickly enter  or reenter the workforce. This legislation makes strategic investments  in students to ensure they have access to programs that properly  prepare them for good-paying, in-demand jobs as we continue to build  back better. The ACCESS to Careers Act represents a necessary step to  take the evidence-based innovations we've seen on the local level to  scale in order to fill jobs in high-needs industries. I strongly  encourage my colleagues in the Senate to consider this commonsense,  bipartisan legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Scott of South Carolina, Mr.          Menendez, Mr. Portman, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Young, Ms. Smith, and          Mr. Kaine):   S. 1860. A bill to amend the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention  Act to provide for additional procedures for families with children  under the age of 6, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
