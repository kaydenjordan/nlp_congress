Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering my bill, H.R. 4465, the  Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Extension Act of 2017.   This bipartisan bill extends efforts to promote the dual goals of  recovering certain fish species protected under the Endangered Species  Act, while ensuring the continued reliability of water and power  operations in the West.   I would like to thank the Members of Congress, both Republican and  Democrat, who have cosponsored my bill. I also appreciate the work of   Rob Bishop as chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee and his  help over the last several months to move my bill through the  legislative process.   I think it is also worth mentioning that we have received over 20  letters of support for this bill from a wide range of stakeholders,  including water conservation districts, Indian Tribes, conservation  organizations, State governments, and more.   With a total water storage capacity of more than 30 million acre-feet  and a capacity to generate over 5 billion megawatt hours of energy  annually, the Colorado River Storage Project, or CRSP, has been vital  to the economics of the Upper Colorado and San Juan River Basin States  of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona.   Four fish species listed under the Endangered Species Act also call  the basin home, and the threat of water and power restrictions  resulting from these listings prompted the affected States to enter  into an agreement with Federal and non-Federal partners to ensure the  continued reliability of the water and power operations in the West.   These agreements resulted in the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish  Recovery Program and the San Juan River Basin Recovery Implementation  Program. In 2000, Congress enacted legislation to establish Federal  participation and cost-sharing agreements, including the authority to  use CRSP power revenues, to support these two programs.   Congress reauthorized the programs in 2012, but also added necessary  oversight and accountability reforms to ensure that funds are going  towards recovery.   H.R. 4465 extends the use of CRSP power revenues through 2023, which  aligns with the recovery deadline for these programs and does not  require any new Federal spending of Americans' hard-earned tax dollars.   In addition, the bill extends the existing transparency improvements  and adds a report to highlight the programs' performance. This  reauthorization is necessary to ensure that the more than 2,300 water  and power projects in the five-State region can continue to operate in  compliance with the Endangered Species Act.   I am hopeful that at the conclusion of this reauthorization through  2023, these programs will have accomplished what they are seeking to  achieve: the recovery and delisting of four endangered fish species.   Mr. Speaker, I believe this bill is a great example of how Members of  Congress can work across party lines to solve an issue facing their  respective  [[Page H1516]]  States. I look forward to working together with my colleagues and  solving other problems with a similar commonsense and bipartisan  approach.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1800) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer  certain Federal land to facilitate scientific research supporting  Federal space and defense programs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1800         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LAND CONVEYANCE, WASATCH-CACHE NATIONAL FOREST,                     RICH COUNTY, UTAH.

A determination by       the Secretary under this subsection shall be made on the       record after an opportunity for a hearing.

If amounts are collected       from the Foundation in advance of the Secretary incurring the       actual costs, and the amount collected exceeds the costs       actually incurred by the Secretary to carry out the       conveyance, the Secretary shall refund the excess amount to       the Foundation.        (2) Treatment of amounts received.--Amounts received as       reimbursement under paragraph (1) shall be credited to the       fund or account that was used to cover those costs incurred       by the Secretary in carrying out the conveyance. Amounts so       credited shall be merged with amounts in such fund or       account, and shall be available for the same purposes, and       subject to the same conditions and limitations, as amounts in       such fund or account.        (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal       description of the property to be conveyed under subsection       (a) shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the       Secretary of Agriculture.        (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary of       Agriculture may require such additional terms and conditions       in connection with the conveyance under subsection (a) as the       Secretary considers appropriate to protect the interests of       the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Voyageurs National Park, established in 1975, is a  218,200-acre national park located on the northern border of Minnesota.  The name ``Voyageurs'' commemorates the French-Canadian fur traders who  were the first European settlers to frequent the area. The park has  remarkable water resources and islands and is popular with canoeists,  kayakers, other boaters, and fishermen.   The Bureau of Land Management currently manages lands within the  boundaries of the park that were not transferred to the National Park  Service at the park's establishment. H.R. 1350 formally transfers these  Bureau of Land Management lands to the National Park Service. Enactment  of the legislation is expected to save taxpayer money and agency time  by eliminating duplicative land management.   In addition, this legislation resolves an outstanding land management  issue faced by the State of Minnesota and a county by authorizing a  land exchange between the State and the National Park Service. Certain  State tax-forfeited tracts within the boundaries of Voyageurs National  Park will be traded for a National Park Service-owned tract outside the  park boundary.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
