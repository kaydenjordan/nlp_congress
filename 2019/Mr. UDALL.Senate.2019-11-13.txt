 Mr. President, every November, the Senate observes Native  American Heritage Month to recognize the contributions of American  Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States.   Today, the promise of Native achievement burns brighter than ever.  Just a few months ago, Joy Harjo, a member of the Muscogee Creek  Nation, became the Nation's 23rd Poet Laureate. The first Native  American appointed to the laureateship in the history of the Library of  Congress, Ms. Harjo is an inspiration to the next generation of Native  American writers, poets, and artists to share their diverse and  powerful voices with the world.   In this spirit, I am proud to have worked with Ms. Harjo, the Library  of Congress, the Institute of American Indian Arts, and the Boys and  Girls Club of America to host an exhibition of Native student poetry in  the rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building this month. The  display showcases Ms. Harjo's poetry alongside original works written  by Autumn Abeyta, Ambrosia Morning Gun, Jewel Palmer, Paige Hannan,  Lindsey Toya-Tosa, Delaney Keshena, and Rebekkah Autaubo--Native  students attending schools in my home state of New Mexico and  representing Tribes in New Mexico, Montana, New York, Wisconsin, and  Oklahoma.   This year's inaugural exhibit represents the countless ways Native  peoples have harnessed their strength, resilience, and unique  perspectives to shape nearly every facet of our national identity.   As the vice chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I work every  day to achieve Indian Country's priorities and uphold the Federal  Government's trust and treaty responsibilities to Indian Country. I  hope this month will serve as an opportunity for this entire body to  reexamine how we can strengthen our commitment to Native peoples and  recommit to our shared responsibilities.                            ____________________
