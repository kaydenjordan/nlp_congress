 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the Congressman from  the General Motors Lordstown plant. We had some bad news this week that  we are going to lose 1,600 jobs in Lordstown. When you factor in the  supply chain, four, five, six times the amount of that in our  community--seat manufacturer, logistics company, trucking, and all the  rest. Many communities in the last week have been dealt a pretty bad  hand. I think this speaks, Mr. Speaker, to the broken economic system  that we have in the United States.   This company, many years ago, got a rescue package from the taxpayers  in the United States. When many years later, last year, they got $157  million in a tax cut that we were told was going to be spent for  workers, factories, and jobs in the heartland, and turned around and  cut 14,000 jobs and their stock price goes up 6 percent, that is a  broken economic system that we have in the United States of America.   We need an industrial policy in this country where the government,  the agencies, the departments, the Tax Code, and the investments in  infrastructure and education are all moving in the same direction that  will create manufacturing jobs here in the United States. We have to  have policies that move venture capital out of the three main States,  California, New York, and Massachusetts, which is 80 percent of all  venture capital.   I am not sure, Mr. Speaker, that the people on Wall Street or the  people in the high-tech centers of our country fully appreciate what is  happening in communities all over the United States of America. They  are being hollowed out and disinvested in.   We need this government to begin to modernize itself and to look at  the world as it is, and to recognize that globalization may yield great  benefits and great wealth but that those benefits aren't shared  everywhere in the United States of America.   They are not shared in the industrial Midwest. Wages have been  stagnant for 30 years. People work hard, play by the rules, and still  get to their retirement, and they lose their pension or their pension  is cut in half.   This is not working. This is not working, Mr. Speaker, and the  American people are fed up.   How much can the worker take? How much can their families take?   Year in and year out for 40 years, this has been going on in this  country. People who have money continue to make money. The top 1  percent continues to do well. I don't hate anybody because they are  rich. But my goodness gracious, when everyone else is suffering, when  communities in Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, western Pennsylvania, Kentucky,  and Minnesota that have done so much for so long, whether there is a  war or manufacturing, it has been these communities who have responded.  Now they have been cut loose, and the stock price goes up.   It is time for us to reclaim the American Dream for these communities  and these workers who have done nothing wrong. They have done  everything right. They support their church; they support the Little  League; they sit on the boards of the booster clubs; and they coach  football. They have done everything right. Everything our society would  ask of them, they have done, and they get cut loose. Now we live in  communities that have blight; they don't have broadband; and they don't  have investment.   Some people will say: Just cut taxes for the wealthiest people, and  all that wealth will trickle right down to the Lordstowns, the  Youngstowns, and the Gary, Indianas of the world.   Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? We have been trying this for 40 years.  Since 1980, the supply-side economic policy has been pushed in this  country. If it is so damn good, then why isn't it working for working  class people? That is what I want to know.   If this economic philosophy is so great, why does the worker in  Lordstown get screwed and the stock price for the company goes up 6  percent?   Why do the CEOs of these companies get 350 times the amount of money  that the worker on the factory floor gets? Does that seem fair to  anybody?   These people work hard and play by the rules. They can't get  healthcare. People out working hard, pension gets squeezed, kid gets  sick, can't afford it, got to go to the emergency room, opiate  epidemic. Try to work hard and go to college, end up $30,000 in debt,  $40,000 in debt, have to move out of your own community.   The systems are broken in the United States, Mr. Speaker, and it is  our job here in Washington, D.C., to remember these families who have  done everything right.   That is our commitment. Our responsibility is to fix this broken  system. There have been a lot of promises made over the last few years  for these communities. Things are moving in the wrong direction, and it  is our obligation to fix it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
