 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Master Sergeant  Christopher Neal Houser as Tennessee's Second District's Veteran of the  Month.   He served in the United States Air Force during the Gulf war, the war  on terrorism, and the Cold War.   Chris was raised in Clinton, Tennessee, and graduated from Clinton  High School in 1980. He then attended Tennessee Tech University, where  he received his degree in business administration and business  management. On July 23, 1982, he enlisted in the Tennessee Air National  Guard, and he served his country for over 31 years, Mr. Speaker, with  the 134th Air Refueling Wing as a personnel specialist.   Outside of his military life, Chris was known as a bit of a hometown  hero for all the time that he gave to Blount County student athletics.  He coached Little League baseball, youth basketball, and football, and  he volunteered at William Blount High School to work with the baseball  and softball teams as the field guy for over 17 years. The softball  field is now named after him in honor of his many years of volunteer  service.   Just a few weeks ago, on May 24, 2022, unfortunately, Chris passed  away after a 9-year battle with lung cancer, with his family by his  side. I offer my condolences to his wife of 36 years, Donna; his  children, Drew, Jessica, and Jennifer; his mother, Jean; and the many  other family members and friends who loved him dearly right up to the  end.   It is my honor to stand here today and commemorate Chris' lifetime of  service to his country and to his community by naming him as  Tennessee's Second District's Veteran of the Month.                            ____________________
