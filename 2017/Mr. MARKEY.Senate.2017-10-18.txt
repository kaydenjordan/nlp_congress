 Madam President, I would like to begin by quoting David  Stockman. David Stockman was the head of the Office of Management and  Budget in the Reagan administration. He wrote a famous book after his  tenure running the Office of Management and Budget. It is called ``The  Triumph of Politics: Why the Reagan Revolution Failed.'' Let me read  you a quote from David Stockman's book. This is what he says:         The hard part of the supply-side tax cut is dropping the       top rate--the rest of it is a secondary matter. . . . Then,       the general argument was that, in order to make this       palatable as a political matter, you had to bring down all of       the brackets. But, I mean, [the plan] was always a Trojan       horse to bring down the top rate.    I quote from David Stockman in his book ``The Triumph of Politics.''  He wrote about how President Reagan sold massive, deficit-busting tax  cuts for the wealthy by making knowingly erroneous arguments, by making  faulty economic arguments.   As we stand here on the Senate floor today, debating the Trump budget  of 2017, we focus on what Mark Twain once said: History does not repeat  itself, but it does tend to rhyme.   This looks very much like what Reagan tried to pull off in the early  1980s, to no avail, and his book is very clear as to why they were  unsuccessful. The Reagan-era promises of economic growth and budget  surpluses turned out to be massive debt and deficits. There is some  kind of nostalgia, political nostalgia, for a Reagan era that never  existed and, instead, a painting of a past that just has to be  replicated today. Let's look at what David Stockman said he did and why  it turned out so unsuccessful for President Reagan. The Republicans are  back again with a new budget, but they are using the same old bag of  tricks and gimmicks from more than 30 years ago.    This is their plan, which is very simple, and it is identical: No. 1,  claim unspecified funding cuts to many domestic programs many, many  years in the future; No. 2, assume unrealistic growth from your  policies that will magically balance the deficit; and finally, No. 3,  use those questionable economic assumptions to provide massive tax  breaks for the wealthy and big corporations in our country.  [[Page S6509]]    The budget we are debating today hits all of these points. It claims  to balance the deficit, while in reality it is a blatant attack on the  middle class for the benefit of these super rich.   First, let's start with the budgetary trick: unspecified cuts to  domestic programs. Back in the 1980s, David Stockman called these  ``magic asterisks,'' meaning that the Reagan administration would count  the savings from these future cuts, but in reality, they would be  someone else's problem to figure out at a later time.   Today, we are dealing with a budget containing more than $1 trillion  in completely unspecified and unallocated funding cuts over the next  decade--the magic asterisks, programs to be cut but not specified.  Please vote for this budget, but do not take any responsibility, my  Republican colleagues, for actually telling the American people what  programs are going to get cut--the magic asterisks.   Second, we have the same unrealistic economic growth assumptions that  Stockman referred to in the 1980s as a rosy scenario. That is what he  called it.   Today, we are being told that tax cuts for the wealthy will magically  grow the economy to the tune of an additional $1.2 trillion and will  somehow pay for themselves. History taught us that tax cuts do not pay  for themselves. It was not true under Reagan, and David Stockman, his  budgetary expert, tells us this. It was not true under Bush, and it  will certainly not be true under Donald Trump as well.   The Republicans forget recent history and continue to use these fairy  tale economic assumptions for the same reasons they did in the 1980s.  The tax cuts for the wealthy do not look completely irresponsible to  the rest of the American people. Can we sell the American people once  again on magic asterisks, on rosy scenarios, on unspecified cuts, on a  budget that is balanced sometime in the future but is not the  responsibility of these Members of the Republican conference at this  time out on the floor of the Senate? Can we pull it off again? Can we  fool the American people again? Can we hide our real agenda, which is  to give a huge tax break to the wealthiest people in America?   In the same way that David Stockman called that the Trojan horse to  get the tax break for the wealthy, so too have they built another  budget as a Trojan horse to get the tax breaks without any of those  specific cuts in programs that they know will be like touching  political kryptonite. They are not going to lay out which programs are  going to get cut at some point in the future.   That is why these tax cuts are irresponsible. The framework that  Republican leadership has presented is devoid of details for what it  will do to families. It doesn't specify what it will do for small  businesses, and it is completely silent on how it will assist workers,  who have been struggling for years to keep up with the rising costs of  living.   What the Republican tax framework is crystal clear on is how it will  benefit the wealthiest Americans and corporations. In fact, the tax  framework released by the Republican leadership will send 80 percent of  the benefits directly to the top 1 percent of the wealthiest  individuals in this country--Ronald Reagan redux, David Stockman redux.  And 80 percent of the benefits go to the upper 1 percentile. What did  David Stockman say? ``But, I mean, [the plan] was always a Trojan horse  to bring down the top rate.''   What we have now is a Republican Party genetically hard-wired in  order to do the same thing that failed as an economic policy in the  early 1980s. It was such a catastrophe and it was so bad that  Republicans actually had to get together with Democrats in order to fix  it after it went into effect.   This particular version of it will provide tax cuts for shareholders  and CEOs. It allows the richest 1 percent of all Americans to  concentrate wealth to an even greater degree than they already can,  while many middle-class families will actually see their tax bill go  up. They want to take away the State and local tax deduction. We are  going to see millions of Americans with an actual tax increase. They  are the middle class. There is almost nothing in this bill that helps  the middle three quintiles. From 20 percent to 80 percent, there is  almost nothing in this bill that helps them.   They know it, by the way. They know what they are doing. They know  that 80 percent of this is going to the upper 1 percentile. They know  almost nothing goes to the middle three quintiles, and they also know  they are going to take away the tax break for State and local  deductions from those people as well. It is not a tax plan. It is a tax  scam.   Despite their talk about how these tax giveaways for the rich will  pay for themselves, the Republican tax plan will create a $2.4 trillion  hole in the deficit. We know what Republicans and the Trump  administration will do with those deficits. They will be used to go  where the 1980s plan did not ultimately go, and that is to gut  Medicare, to gut Medicaid, and to gut Social Security.   Let's give them credit. In this bill, at least on Medicare and  Medicaid, they actually do talk about these specific cuts. They  actually talk about it. There is a $470 billion cut in Medicare. You  can hear that, grandma or grandpa. They are going to cut Medicare by  $470 billion in this bill. I tell you one thing. Both grandma and  grandpa may be old, but they are not stupid. They are not stupid. They  know what you are doing. They are going to figure this out.   They want to cut Medicaid by $1 trillion, as well, for those tax  breaks for the upper 1-percenters. There is your plan. It is pretty  simple to understand. Grandma and grandpa are going to understand it.  The American people are going to understand it. It is all toward the  Trojan horse to get the tax break for the upper 1 percentile.   The recent report from the Democratic staff of the Senate Budget  Committee found that the budget would also slash $5 trillion from  critical programs like education and transportation. It is unspecified  at this particular point in time because they know it would create a  political nightmare for them. It would be ``nitro hits glycerin''  politically if they specify at this time where those cuts would come  from.   Over the last 8 years, our friends on the other side of the aisle  explained to us that the Federal deficits were the greatest threats  facing our country. We couldn't invest in clean energy. We couldn't  finance infrastructure. We couldn't do anything about healthcare or the  people who need it in our country because of the threat to our national  debt. Before that, we were famously told in the 2000s that deficits  don't matter. Of course, that was after President Clinton's budgets in  the 1990s put us on a path to a budget surplus.   Before that, David Stockman was convincing President Reagan that  deficits were of no concern and should not get in the way of tax cuts  for the wealthy. We have seen this movie before, and now, once again,  it sounds like the present rhymes with the past.   We come back to the central erroneous premise of the Republican  Party, which they continue to try to sell to the American people--that  it is possible, simultaneously, to have massive tax breaks for the  wealthiest 1 percent, to increase defense spending simultaneously and  massively, and to balance the budget at the same time. It is not  possible. The American people know it. They have seen it in the past.  They are trying to run the same old movie past the American people, but  it is all--in the immortal words of David Stockman--toward the goal of  creating a Trojan horse to bring down the rates for the wealthiest  people in America. That is the choice the American people are going to  have to make.   This budget is a moral disgrace to be considered on the floor of the  Congress--Medicare and Medicaid, a sacrifice for a tax break for the  wealthiest people in our country. This is a shameful day in the history  of this institution.   I yield back the remainder of my time.
