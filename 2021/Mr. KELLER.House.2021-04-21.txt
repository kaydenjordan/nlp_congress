 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, improving America's infrastructure should be  bipartisan. Revitalizing our Nation's roads and bridges, delivering  broadband to rural America, and working together to build a more  connected society are all things we can and should strive to  accomplish.   The Biden administration's so-called infrastructure plan is not  infrastructure, and it is definitely not bipartisan. Less than 2 months  removed from the last multi-trillion-dollar bill, the American people  are about to be saddled with another massive tax-and-spend package-- this time with a price tag of $2.3 trillion and a bag of empty  promises.   With only a fraction of the $2.3 trillion going toward things like  roads, bridges, waterways, dams, airports, and broadband, the majority  of the plan is instead filled with non-infrastructure items.   Case in point: Joe Biden spends 74 percent more of your money on  subsidies for electric vehicles than it allocates for rural broadband.  It is ironic that Washington Democrats talk about improving  infrastructure while simultaneously working to dismantle and eliminate  American energy jobs. Make no mistake, it takes American energy to  build American infrastructure.   While Washington Democrats talk about improvements to American  infrastructure, they fail to recognize that Biden's $2.3 trillion plan  is not the answer. Instead, we must embrace America's domestic energy  industry, which has made greater strides in investing in our Nation's  infrastructure than Joe Biden's wasteful spending plans ever could.   If Joe Biden truly believes this is an infrastructure package, it is  evidence that he has been in Washington, D.C., for far too long.
