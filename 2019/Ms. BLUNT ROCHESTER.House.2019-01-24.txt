 Madam Speaker, on this, the 34th day of the  longest shutdown in American history, I sat down with a group of air  traffic controllers in my office today.   These workers told me about how an already stressful job has been  made even worse by this shutdown, that many of them are working 6 days  a week, 10 hours a day with no pay.   They know that their work requires no mistakes because it is life and  death, but to make matters even worse, 30 percent of them are already  stretched thin and currently are eligible to retire, and many are  considering retiring earlier so that they can at least get a paycheck.   In the words of Ranika, one of the air traffic controllers: This  shutdown is the perfect storm for a national emergency.   Madam Speaker, the collateral damage of this shutdown is difficult to  fathom, but this much is clear: Every day that goes by, we are less  safe, our economy is more weakened, and all Americans from all  backgrounds suffer.   This must end. Open the government.                            ____________________
