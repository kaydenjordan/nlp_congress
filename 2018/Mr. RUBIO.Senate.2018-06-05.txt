 Mr. President, today I am honored to recognize Kyle  Dencker, the Orange County Teacher of the Year from Timber Creek High  School in Orlando, FL.   Kyle thanked colleagues, mentors, and administrators for receiving  this award and challenged educators to make computer science available  at all of the county's public schools. He believes every student should  have the opportunity to take computer science.   Colleagues say Kyle recruits students who traditionally avoided  computer science, sometimes just by walking around campus, introducing  himself and explaining why they might want to learn to code. He has  earned national awards for his efforts to recruit young women into  computer science and help them succeed in those classes.   Many students have found success in his classroom, in State  competitions, and in securing internships. He had 186 students take  advanced placement computer science principles last school year, and  nearly 77 percent passed the AP exam, exceeding the national rate.   Kyle has been a computer science teacher at Timber Creek High School  for 9 years. In that time, enrollment in the school's computer science  classes has grown from about 30 students to nearly 400, making it the  largest such program in the Orange school district. He has spent nearly  a decade getting students to see past the stereotypes regarding  computer classes.   I thank Kyle for his dedication to expanding computer science to  students that were previously uninterested in this important subject. I  express my sincere gratitude to Kyle and look forward to hearing of his  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Jason Poole, the  Clay County Teacher of the Year from Fleming Island High School in  Fleming Island, FL.  [[Page S2990]]    Jason was named Teacher of the Year because he represents the core  values of Clay County District schools: hard work, integrity, and  respect. He acts as an example for everyone in the teaching profession.  Jason said it was an honor to receive this award and is thankful for  all of his colleagues and administrative staff who have supported him  throughout his time at Fleming Island High School. He believes there  are many great teachers throughout Clay County and will do his best to  represent them.   Jason graduated from Western New England University with a degree in  English literature in 2005. He teaches AICE Global Perspectives and  coaches cross-country, a program he started at the school after he  began teaching in 2006.   I extend my sincere thanks and gratitude to Jason for his dedication  to his students and look forward to hearing of his continued success in  the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Kate Sturman, the  Flagler County Teacher of the Year from Rymfire Elementary School in  Palm Coast, FL.   When Kate was named Teacher of the Year, she was honored because she  felt there were many other amazing teachers at their annual  celebration. Her fellow teachers believe she goes above and beyond for  students by always volunteering to help with afterschool activities and  has been flexible by teaching second, fifth, and sixth grade.   As she describes, there is nothing more rewarding than watching a  student blossom from a seed into a magnificent flower. Kate considers  herself as not only a teacher for her students, but as a cheerleader,  advocate, and friend. She believes to have the most rewarding job in  the world and loves teaching for these reasons.   Kate is in her 16th year as a teacher and has been with Flagler  Schools since 2005. She moved to Rymfire Elementary School in 2006,  teaching second grade for 10 years and sixth grade for 1 year. She  currently teaches fifth grade English language arts and social studies.  She is also a coach with the school's Future Problem Solvers and  Community Problem Solvers.   I express my sincere thanks and appreciation to Kate for all her hard  work for her students, and I extend my best wishes for her continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Kaitlin Van Heusen,  the Bradford County Teacher of the Year from Bradford Union Technical  Center in Starke, FL.   After receiving this award, Kaitlin told her peers that her  inspiration for teaching comes from the students taking her class. She  finds these students to be the ones who are beginning to give up on  teachers, the education system, and their own ability to succeed.   Kaitlin takes special pride in watching her students walk across the  stage at graduation and speaking in front of their peers. Her joy as an  educator comes from seeing their initial struggles and witnessing the  moment when it all finally comes together for them.   Kaitlin graduated from the University of Florida in 2015 and Florida  Gateway College in 2013. She is an agriculture and diversified career  technology teacher and, since 2016, a Future Farmers of America adviser  at Bradford-Union Technical Center.   I express my sincere gratitude to Kaitlin for her dedication to  teaching and wish her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Kiera Vargas, the Madison County Teacher of the Year from Madison  County High School in Madison, FL.   Kiera was honored with this award because of her motivation for  encouraging and educating her students. As a teacher, she enjoys all  aspects and feels her success comes from her personal interactions with  her students. Her students note she listens to their needs and helps in  every way she can.   These students feel empowered by Kiera as she encourages them to  always believe in themselves. She tells them, if they do this while  working hard and following their heart, they will achieve their dreams.  Kiera feels her students have taught her more than she has taught them.   Kiera was offered her first teaching job while planning to take the  dental admission test. She originally planned to be a dentist but  realized teaching was her true passion. Kiera says she has never looked  back since her first teaching job and has no desire to do anything  except teach and assist her students.   She previously worked at the college level as a full-time lecturer  for 7 years, taught in K-12 classrooms for 4 years, and served as an  adjunct lecturer for several years. Kiera has a bachelor of science  degree in journalism and mass communication with a concentration in  public relations, a master of science degree in English education, a  juris doctor from the Charlotte School of Law, and her masters in  library science and information sciences from Drexel University.   I express my appreciation to Kiera for all of the great work she has  done for her students and extend my best wishes on her continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________
