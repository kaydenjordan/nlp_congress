 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to  me.   The Freedom for Health Care Workers Act. Really? Freedom? Freedom  from what?   We know that vaccine mandates are absolutely not new, and healthcare  workers are often required to get vaccinated against infectious  diseases, for various diseases. During the pandemic, the COVID-19  vaccine allowed our heroic nurses and healthcare workers to save lives  and protect the most vulnerable, including senior citizens.   But, you know, we are not done with it yet. People are still getting  sick and dying. If you have a loved one in a nursing home, if you know  people, people you care about, that are immunocompromised, if you have  a child who is in fragile health, don't you want to make sure that when  you seek care, that the nurse that is going to be serving them, that  the healthcare provider, is going to be safe and not bring that  disease, not bring COVID to them?   I think this is really a serious mistake that we are making. This is  not about freedom. This is about healthcare. Doctors, nurses,  hospitals, and the American Medical Society believe that requiring  COVID-19 vaccines for healthcare workers saves lives.   Let's do that. Let's save lives. Vote ``no'' on this legislation.
