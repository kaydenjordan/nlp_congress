 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Graves for his  leadership trying to find a bipartisan framework on our Nation's  infrastructure priorities.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my amendment that  would add crucial taxpayer safeguards to the Railroad Rehabilitation  and Improvement Financing.   With this amendment, 67 percent of total funding for projects would  be required to come from sources other than the Federal Government.  This ensures Federal funds are going towards projects with sound  financials that partner with other public or private entities.   My amendment would require borrowers to document a revenue stream  with the sole objective of paying off the loan. If the Federal  Government is going to lend money to a project, we have to make sure  they have a plan to pay it back. And this provision does just that.  [[Page H3539]]    Another provision would require the Federal loan be repaid, along  with primary debt, if the loan defaults. This requirement protects  taxpayers from bearing the brunt of costs from bankrupt projects.   In my district, constituents are seeing firsthand how high-speed rail  projects with uncertain financing and lacking necessary permits in  place, are looking to the RRIF program for funding. Even though Texas  Central Railroad vowed for years to not seek Federal funding for the  high-speed rail projects, just last year they lobbied Congress to  loosen the RRIF lending requirements even further.   This amendment protects Federal taxpayers not only in my district,  but across America, to make sure our constituents aren't stuck holding  the bag when rail projects default on their loan.   Madam Speaker, I urge bipartisan support.
