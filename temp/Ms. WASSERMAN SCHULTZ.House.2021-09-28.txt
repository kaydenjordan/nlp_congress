 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a historic investment that will  create millions of good-paying jobs and support America's future global  competitiveness.   This bill will do so much to repair our ailing infrastructure and  will create two million labor-friendly jobs each year for a decade.   Florida has 408 bridges and more than 3,564 miles of highway that are  in poor condition.   Through this bill, Florida will receive $13 billion for federal-aid  highway programs and $245 million for bridge repair.   Florida will also receive $2.6 billion for public transit systems and  $1.2 billion for airport development.   To further help us cut down on transportation emissions, the bill  will provide Florida with nearly $200 million to support the expansion  of an electric vehicle charging network.   I have also heard, Mr. Speaker, from so many municipalities  throughout south Florida who are struggling with obsolete water  infrastructure. Thankfully, this bill provides Florida with $1.6  billion to get rid of lead pipes and improve water infrastructure.    For Florida's highways and byways, which are some of the most  dangerous in the Nation, this legislation will usher in a ``Safe  Streets for All'' program to help reduce crashes and fatalities.   Also important for Florida, this bill provides the Army Corps of  Engineers with $1.9 billion for aquatic ecosystem restoration projects.   The Florida delegation expects the Corps to use a large portion of  this money on Everglades restoration to bolster the funding we already  secured through the regular appropriation process and get the project  back on track.   This bill is a big investment in surface transportation and hard  infrastructure, but it is only a segment of President Biden's Build  Back Better agenda.   I am looking forward to passing the revolutionary climate and  resiliency programs in the Build Back Better Act.   For my own constituents and the children and grandchildren of  everyone in this Nation, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this important bill  and the Build Back Better Act. That will allow us to truly rebuild our  working class and set us on a path to prosperity.                            ____________________
