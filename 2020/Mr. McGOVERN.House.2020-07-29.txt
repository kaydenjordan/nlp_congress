 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1067 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1067         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 7617) making       appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal       year ending September 30, 2021, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 116-60, modified by the       amendment printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply       during consideration of the bill. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to  [[Page H3891]]       final passage without intervening motion except: (1) 90       minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations; (2) the further amendments described in       section 2 of this resolution; (3) the amendments en bloc       described in section 3 of this resolution; and (4) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2. After debate pursuant to the first section of this       resolution, each further amendment printed in part B of the       report of the Committee on Rules not earlier considered as       part of amendments en bloc pursuant to section 3 of this       resolution shall be considered only in the order printed in       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may be withdrawn       by the proponent at any time before the question is put       thereon, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be       subject to a demand for division of the question.        Sec. 3. It shall be in order at any time after debate       pursuant to the first section of this resolution for the       chair of the Committee on Appropriations or her designee to       offer amendments en bloc consisting of further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution not earlier disposed of.       Amendments en bloc offered pursuant to this section shall be       considered as read, shall be debatable for 30 minutes equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective       designees, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not       be subject to a demand for division of the question.        Sec. 4. All points of order against the further amendments       printed in part B of the report of the Committee on Rules or       amendments en bloc described in section 3 of this resolution       are waived.        Sec. 5. During consideration of the amendments described in       sections 2 and 3 of this resolution, it shall not be in order       to consider an amendment proposing both a decrease in an       appropriation designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii)       of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of       1985 and an increase in an appropriation not so designated,       or vice versa.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave    Mr. McGOVERN: Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1067, providing for consideration of  H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water  Development, Financial Services and General Government, Homeland  Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act of 2021.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7617 under a structured  rule, with 90 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations.  It self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairwoman Lowey. It makes  in order 340 amendments and provides that the chair of the Committee on  Appropriations or her designee may offer amendments en bloc, which will  be debatable for 30 minutes. Finally, the rule provides one motion to  recommit with or without instructions.   Mr. Speaker, the measure before us is what it looks like when you  don't take an ax to our priorities, as the President has advocated, but  instead, you invest in what is important to the American people. This  is what it looks like when we actually lay the groundwork for a real  recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, instead of just wishing it away  as this President has done.   There are billions and billions of dollars in emergency funding here  to build and repair water projects, to modernize energy infrastructure,  and rebuild our Nation's crumbling infrastructure in this time of  COVID-19. These projects will help get Americans back to work and kick- start our economy.   The bills included in this underlying package also make long-term  investments in our Nation: In food safety, curbing tobacco use, and  combating domestic abuse and sexual assault; all at levels that exceed  the President's budget request.   There is also landmark grant funding to carry out police reform  efforts, and, yes, even funding to address the health impacts of  climate change because, Mr. Speaker, this majority believes in science,  and we believe in facts.   This bill also includes provisions to stop costly, endless wars by  sunsetting the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, the  AUMF, repealing the 2002 AUMF, and prohibiting funds for the use of  force against Iran.   Just as important as what this measure does is what it ensures this  administration cannot do: Like steal money for President Trump's  ineffective border wall, implement its dangerous plan to restart  explosive nuclear testing, or launch another endless war using the 2001  AUMF.   This is about addressing our Nation's emergency needs during this  pandemic today, while building a strong foundation for the future.   Thinking that this pandemic will magically vanish, as this President  has suggested, is not a plan. Hoping that COVID-19 just goes away  without a vaccine, as this President has done, is not a plan.   Real resources like those in this bill, especially when taken with  those in the HEROES Act that passed this House over 2 months ago, will  enable us to confront this virus and build a true recovery.   340 amendments were made in order under this rule, many of which will  make this bill even stronger.   Among them is an amendment I authored to provide more money for radon  testing and mitigation. A national investigation recently uncovered  this harmful chemical in public housing units across the country,  including in my hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts.   This administration, and HUD in particular, has an obligation to act.  This language will help ensure more funding is there to help protect  people's health and safety.   I am also proud that the underlying bill sets aside $10 million to  create a new nationwide pilot program to help the many grandparents who  are raising their grandchildren today. This funding will provide more  access to safe, affordable, and appropriate housing.   Mr. Speaker, there are two policy ideas put forward during this  process that I especially want to highlight.   The first was an effort led by my good friend, Congressman   Bobby  Rush, to create a more 21st century approach toward Cuba. This  President has taken us back to a failed Cold War policy that held our  country back for more than 50 years, a policy that hurts the Cuban  people, and a policy that denies American farmers and American  businesses the opportunity to engage with their counterparts in Cuba.  In short, our policy, Mr. Speaker, is an embarrassment.   The gentleman from Illinois wanted to mitigate some of the pain U.S.  policies impose on the Cuban people by providing easier access to food  and medicine and by making it easier for families in the United States  to send support to their relatives still on the island, especially  during this pandemic.   Now, although the gentleman from Illinois has withdrawn his  amendments, I want to recognize him for his leadership. He has shined a  bright light on a failed policy that badly hurts the Cuban people, and  it urgently needs to change.   Mr. Speaker, we have to change our policy. We must and we will change  our policy, and I look forward to being part of that effort. If we can  trade with China and Russia and Vietnam, we certainly can trade with  Cuba. If Americans can travel virtually to any country in the world, we  ought to be able to travel to Cuba without restriction. And if we  really care about human rights and human suffering, then we ought to  recognize that the American blockade on Cuba is causing tremendous  suffering to the Cuban people.                                time  1030    So I hope, Mr. Speaker, that we will in short order take a fresh look  at our policy and move to a more mature, sensible, thoughtful approach  to dealing with Cuba.  [[Page H3892]]    I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, Representative Ayanna  Pressley, along with Representatives Lee, Ocasio-Cortez, Schakowsky,  Chu, DeGette, Tlaib, Omar, Pocan, and Speier.   Together they led an important effort to repeal the Hyde Amendment.  This disastrous policy prevents so many, particularly low-income women  and women of color from deciding their own future.   Constitutional rights should not belong to just the wealthy or the  privileged. They belong to every single American, regardless of where  they get their health insurance.   And although this amendment wasn't able to be made in order here  because of several budgetary points of order, I want to say loud and  clear here today that they are right. We need to end this  discriminatory policy, and I look forward to working with them to do  just that. This is a fight that we must have.   Mr. Speaker, getting this broad package here today was a herculean  effort by so many in this Chamber, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support this rule and the underlying measure. Let's get our communities  the resources they need, and let's get our economy back on its feet.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentleman's comments. And I acknowledge, I think we  all acknowledge, that we are living in an unusual moment, dealing with  a health pandemic that has already claimed the lives of 150,000 of our  fellow citizens, that has infected millions of our other fellow  citizens, and we are trying to do our best to operate and to get the  people's business done amidst this pandemic.   So, we have given committee chairs en bloc authority to try to  consider amendments en bloc so we can consider more ideas.   In the package that we are bringing before the House today, there are  341 amendments in order. Some of them will require separate votes on  amendments because, quite frankly, there isn't a consensus on some of  them. But many of them are good ideas that can be put in an en bloc  amendment and be incorporated into this bill.   I just say that because the alternative in the middle of this  pandemic is to have fewer amendments, and I don't think that that is  something that Members would want to see happen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, just to respond to my good friend, Mr. Cole, who I have  great, great admiration for, but the gentleman said that more  Democratic amendments were made in order. Well, let's kind of put that  into context. More Democratic amendments were submitted, period.  Actually, more than half of the amendments were Democratic.   Let me put it this way: Twice as many Democratic amendments were  offered as Republican amendments, and there was a big chunk of  bipartisan amendments that were made in order.   I don't like to compare our record to their record because the  gentleman wasn't chair of the Rules Committee when the Republicans were  in charge. But I just want to throw this little tidbit out there so  that people can have this: We have made in order 25 percent more  amendments this month than were made in order in all of 2018 under the  Republican control of the House.   Again, I know my friend wasn't the chair at the time, but I just  wanted to point that out for the Record because I think it is a nice  statistic.   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. McAdams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me remind my colleagues what the previous question vote is all  about. It really isn't about substance. It is about turning control of  the House over to my friends on the Republican side.   As the chair of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China who  is very, very concerned about these Confucius Institutes and about  China's continuing escalation of activities within our country, I am  happy to sit down with the gentleman and anyone else to try to bring  legislation to the floor.   We brought a lot of legislation to the floor to check China's growing  power in the world. But this is really not about the Confucius  Institute. This is about turning power over to my friends on the other  side of the aisle.   If they were to succeed, they could bring up whatever they want to  within the rules of the House. And based on some of the statements in  recent weeks by some of my friends on the other side of the aisle about  some of their priorities, it could be some pretty, in my opinion, awful  stuff.   So, I would urge my colleagues to reject the gentleman's plea here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more requests for time on my side. I would  just say to my colleagues before I yield to the gentleman for his  closing remarks that I think these are good bills that will help us not  only get through this pandemic, but help set the stage for the economic  recovery that we need.   While we are all here talking, I hope my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle are picking up the phone and calling their Senate  counterparts and calling the White House and urging them to get serious  about a coronavirus relief package that we desperately need.   Schools in some districts are about to open up, and there is no  Federal aid to help with what they may need to keep our children and  our teachers safe. There is no money going to our cities and towns that  are financially strapped because of our economy having shut down, no  money to protect people so we can have safe elections, nothing--not  anything--to help the millions of people in this country who are  hungry.   The Senate proposal, which I am not even sure it is a proposal  anymore, has no money in it for SNAP. The most vulnerable people in  this country get nothing when it comes to putting food on the table.  They have reduced unemployment benefits, and then they sneak in money  for an FBI building and money for defense contractors while they  shortchange everybody else.   We are in a healthcare crisis, we are in an economic crisis, and we  need to respond. These appropriations bills, again, are a way to help  us get back on our feet; but, in the immediate term, we need to get the  Senate to get serious and respond, as the House did over 2 months ago,  and extend a lifeline to the American people.   This is serious. Mr. Speaker, I don't care whether you are a Democrat  or a Republican. I hear from constituents of all political persuasions  who are begging us to do something to help teachers and  superintendents.   Where is the help? Mayors, town managers, and city managers are  asking: Where is the help?   The House acted over 2 months ago--nothing from the Senate. So I  think these appropriations bills are good, but we need to get something  else done even before these become enacted.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the Rules Committee staff and  members for all of their incredible work during the last few weeks. We  have processed thousands of amendments. We have had hours and hours and  hours of hearings. We have listened to countless Members testify, and  we were able to get through it all.   But, again, I want people to appreciate especially the work of the  staff. I say that in a bipartisan way that the Democratic staff and the  Republican staff of the Rules Committee worked incredibly hard. I don't  think most people even know it, but they ought to know it because this  is a lot of work.   I say to the gentleman from Oklahoma who is my friend, we don't  always agree on everything, but I am very fortunate to have him as a  ranking member because I think he respects this institution and he  fights very hard for his beliefs. I fight hard for my beliefs. But even  when we disagree, it is not in a personal way. We can disagree without  being disagreeable, and I appreciate him for that, and my other  colleagues as well.                                time  1115    Mr. Speaker, this rule is about moving forward to consider a measure  to get annual and emergency funding moving to help put people back to  work, to reinvigorate our public health system, to rebuild our aging  roads and bridges, and to put an important check on this  administration. This rule also is about whether we should debate  hundreds and hundreds of amendments from Democrats and Republicans.   Mr. Speaker, this is ultimately about whether we fulfill one of our  most fundamental responsibilities. I urge all of my colleagues to come  together in support of this rule and the underlying legislation. Let's  ensure this Congress continues to provide the leadership the American  people are demanding.   The material previously preferred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1067         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (S. 939) to establish limitations regarding Confucius       Institutes, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Education and Labor; and (2) one motion to commit.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of S. 939.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
