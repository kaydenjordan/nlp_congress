 Mr. Chair, today, my colleagues and I will vote on H.R.  3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018. H.R. 3053  provides practical reforms to ensure that the federal government  fulfills its legal obligation to dispose of nuclear waste currently  present in 121 communities across 39 states. The federal government is  20 years behind in implementing this disposal program. As a result,  current litigation costs have totaled more than $6 billion--mounting to  nearly $800 million a year and approximately $34 billion in future  liabilities. I am proud to support this legislation, and I ask my  colleagues to vote for H.R. 3053.   H.R. 3053 reforms the program's broken financing mechanism. The  Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established the Nuclear Waste Fund  financed through the collection of fee receipts paid by nuclear  utilities and ratepayers. However, under current scorekeeping, these  receipts are credited as offsetting mandatory receipts rather than  discretionary appropriations in the federal budget. Consequently, the  program cannot be adequately funded because the collected fees are not  credited toward discretionary appropriations for future program  expenditures.   Addressing the budgetary classification of these fees prior to the  Department of Energy resuming their collection is a top priority. In  order for this program to operate as intended, the collection of these  fees must be classified as discretionary spending. H.R. 3053  accomplishes this by offsetting future spending for nuclear waste  management as discretionary spending and ensuring long-term funding for  the program. The circumstances of the Nuclear Waste Fund are unique due  to the delay in implementation of the program and the resulting  litigation. As a result, both the fee collections and the program's  subsequent spending need equivalent budgetary classifications.   The scorekeeping treatment in the bill should not be viewed as a  precedent for future legislative activity in other, unrelated programs.   We are 20 years behind fulfilling this program's promise. We owe it  to the taxpayer, ratepayer, and nuclear industry to pass H.R. 3053 and  uphold our legal and contractual obligations to collect nuclear waste.  I support the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018 and urge its  passage.    Mr. Speaker, section 30104 of the Bipartisan Budget Act  of 2018, Public Law 115-123, requires the chairs of the House and  Senate Budget Committees to submit for printing in the Congressional  Record committee allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary levels  for fiscal year 2019.   Pursuant to section 30104 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, I  hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record: (1) an  allocation for fiscal year 2019 for the House Committee on  Appropriations, (2) committee allocations for fiscal year 2019 and for  the period of fiscal years 2019 through 2028 for all committees other  than the Committee on Appropriations, and (3) aggregate spending levels  for fiscal year 2019 and aggregate revenue levels for fiscal year 2019  and for the period of fiscal years 2019 through 2028.   In the case of allocations for committees other than the Committee on  Appropriations and for the spending and revenue aggregates, the levels  shall be consistent with the Congressional Budget Office's most recent  baseline, adjusted to account for any legislation enacted since the  date the most recent baseline was issued.   This filing is made for technical purposes as required by section  30104 the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Associated tables are  attached. These committee allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary  levels are made for the purposes of enforcing titles III and IV of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budgetary enforcement  provisions.   If there are any questions on these committee allocations,  aggregates, and other budgetary levels please contact Brad Watson or  Mary Popadiuk of the Budget Committee staff.
