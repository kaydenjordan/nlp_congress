 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Coach Kim  Mulkey and her Baylor University Lady Bears for winning the 2019 NCAA  Women's National Basketball Championship, their third national  championship in 14 years.   ``Together to Tampa'' was the adopted slogan for the team, and that  is exactly what they did: they played together as a team to get to  Tampa and they won together as a team in Tampa.   The Lady Bears played an incredible season, ending with an overall  record of 37 and 1, and a 29-game winning streak.   It was also a monumental season for Coach Mulkey, who eclipsed the  550 career wins mark and is now only the third women's basketball coach  to win at least three national championships.   Congratulations to Coach Mulkey, the Lady Bears Basketball Team,  Baylor University, and all of Baylor Nation on another national  championship.   Sic `em, Bears.                            ____________________
