 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 24,  expressing the sense of Congress that the report of Special Counsel  Mueller should be made available to the public and to Congress and  which is at the desk; further, that the concurrent resolution be agreed  to; the preamble be agreed to; and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to make  remarks as in morning business.    Madam President, last Friday, Special Counsel Mueller  submitted his report to Attorney General Barr. On Sunday, the Attorney  General provided a four-page summary of that report to Congress and the  American people.   Unfortunately, the Attorney General's summary tells us little about  what Special Counsel Mueller actually found. In fact, according to the  summary, Mueller's office spent 2 years investigating, with a team of  19 lawyers and 40 FBI agents and other professional staff. The special  counsel issued  [[Page S2013]]  more than 2,800 subpoenas, executed nearly 500 search warrants,  obtained more than 230 orders for communication records, issued almost  50 orders authorizing the use of pen registers, made 13 requests to  foreign governments for evidence, and interviewed approximately 500  witnesses. That is quite a record.   The fact is, a four-page summary cannot possibly illuminate what this  thorough of an investigation uncovered. I find it so disappointing that  so many are rushing to judgment without being able to see the full  report or all of the underlying facts.   This report should be made public. As has been, I think, well stated,  not only is the official government interested, but the American public  is interested in our findings as well.   We know the Russian Government interfered with the U.S. election.  That has been reported by the intelligence community and intelligence  committee--I sit on that committee--and it has been reaffirmed by the  special counsel's investigation.   We also know, from court filings, documents, and press reports, that  the President and at least 17 people associated with his campaign had  more than 100 contacts with Russia or Russia's intermediaries.   However, Attorney General Barr's summary provides no information  about any of these contacts or multiple offers from Russian-affiliated  individuals to assist the campaign, and that is a quote--``multiple  offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the campaign''-- referenced in the Attorney General's summary.   Congress must determine the risks to national security, whether there  was, in fact, misconduct, whether existing laws are sufficient to deter  and punish election interference, and what next steps are appropriate.  The American people also have a right to the truth about what happened  in the 2016 election and to judge the facts for themselves.   Special Counsel Mueller also did not draw a conclusion, one way or  the other, as to whether the President committed a crime through his  efforts to obstruct the investigation. Instead, Mr. Mueller wrote:  ``While this report does not conclude that the President committed a  crime, it also does not exonerate him.''   Since Special Counsel Mueller elected to describe the facts but did  not decide whether to charge the President with a crime, we don't know  why he made this decision, but clearly we do need to see the facts for  ourselves to be able to make a decision about how to proceed and what,  if any, additional steps are necessary.   While the Attorney General concluded there was no crime of  obstruction committed, we knew that was his conclusion 9 months ago  when he wrote a 10-page memo explaining why the President can't be  charged with obstruction of justice. Special Counsel Mueller found that  there is ``evidence on both sides of the question.'' Congress and the  American people should be able to see that evidence and make a  determination, including what the appropriate next steps are, if any.   I am very disappointed that some Republicans are saying Democrats  need to move on before we even see the report or underlying evidence.  Many of these Republicans called for eight congressional investigations  into the Benghazi attack and demanded and received 880,000 pages of  documents related to the Clinton email investigation. We have also  already obtained documents related to Mueller's investigation,  including classified FISA Court applications.   Of course, unwarranted foot-dragging is really not good, and really  bad for this country. I had thought we were past that with prior events  where we did take action, and we were able to see both sides. After 37  indictments, 6 of whom were indicted Trump advisers, as well as 7  guilty pleas, surely spending more than a week on understanding what  happened and asking for the full report is warranted. How can we have  37 indictments, 6 Trump advisers, as well as guilty pleas, without  being able to understand what actually happened and not be afforded the  material to gain that understanding?   I hope this can be a bipartisan effort to ensure the full record is  produced and the facts are uncovered. It is really puzzling to me why  the Republican side would not want to do this. Do they presume guilt on  their side, and therefore they want to hide it from the public? If you  don't, why wouldn't you want whatever the true facts are to come out?  The American people deserve no less.   On March 14, the House of Representatives passed a resolution calling  for Special Counsel Mueller's report to be made public. The vote was  unanimous, 420 to 0--420 to 0. Both sides of the House of  Representatives said this should happen.   Senator Schumer, our minority leader, has now twice sought unanimous  consent for the Senate to consider that resolution. These requests have  been blocked by Republicans. I don't understand that. If the House can  consider this, why can't we look at what the House has done? This, to  my knowledge, in the quarter of a century that I have been in this  body, has never happened before, where the Senate has actually refused  to look at information.   I very much hope there can be a change of mind and allow the U.S.  Senate to do its due diligence in this matter. Hiding the information  will not solve the problem.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce the  ``Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act.'' This legislation  would update the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management  Act to phase out the use of harmful drift gillnets and replace them  with more sustainable fishing gear. I would like to thank my colleague,  Senator Capito, for once again co-leading this important bill.   Drift gillnets, which are approximately one to one and a half miles  long, are intended to catch swordfish and thresher shark off the coast  of California. Tragically, nearly 60 other species are frequently  caught and killed in the nets, including dolphins, porpoises, whales,  sea lions, and sea turtles. These are known as bycatch.   While some of these species can be sold, most are wastefully thrown  back into the ocean either dead or seriously injured.   According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, these harmful  nets account for 90% of whale and porpoise species killed in West Coast  Fisheries. In the 1980s, Congress enacted legislation to end the  domestic use of driftnets approximately 1.5 miles or longer. Under  President George H.W. Bush, the United States entered binding  international agreements banning such nets worldwide.   Driftnets are prohibited or are not utilized off the United States'  Atlantic and Gulf coasts as well as in Washington State, Oregon,  Alaska, and Hawaii. Mexico permanently banned the use of these nets in  the Gulf of California in 2017.   However, neither domestic nor international law currently includes  the drift gillnets used in Federal waters off the coast of California  to catch swordfish and thresher shark, despite their significant impact  on protected marine life. This California-based fishery is the last  place in the United States where these deadly driftnets are allowed.   Last year, the California legislature passed a bill, subsequently  signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, to phase out these large-mesh  drift gillnets in State waters and establish a buyout program over a  four-year period.   The State law requires the California Department of Fish and Wildlife  to establish a voluntary ``permit transition program'' by March 2020  that will compensate fishermen during this transition process.  California has already dedicated $1 million for the program and another  $1 million is being sought through a public-private partnership.   Now that these nets are banned in State waters, our legislation to  ban the nets in Federal waters is more timely than ever. The ``Driftnet  Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act'' would phase out the use of  drift gillnets over the five years after enactment. The bill also  authorizes the Department of Commerce to assist fishermen in  transitioning from driftnets to more sustainable gear types, which  studies have shown actually increase profitability.   Updated fishing gear that could replace driftnets is available and  has been successfully deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and in trials in  the Pacific Ocean. Deep-set buoy gear, for example, allows fishermen to  more accurately target swordfish and other marketable species in deep,  cold water. The gear alerts fishermen immediately when they have fish  on the line, so the fish can be retrieved and delivered to market  quickly, thereby garnering a higher price.   In a 2016 poll, California voters overwhelmingly supported efforts to  end the use of drift gillnets to catch swordfish, with 87 percent of  those surveyed in a poll commissioned by The Pew Charitable Trusts  agreeing that fishermen should use less harmful gear.   Our bill enjoys support from a wide range of commercial fishing  companies, sportfishing groups, and environmental organizations,  including: the American Sportfishing Association, the International  Game Fish Association, Coastal Conservation Association of California,  Yamaha USA, Okaiwa Corporation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, Oceana, Sea  Legacy, and Mission Blue.   Our ``Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act'' will protect  valuable marine life unique to the West Coast, including several  endangered species. This bill will also help fishermen to provide  fresher, more profitable, and more sustainable seafood to American  consumers.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ``Driftnet  Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act.'' Thank you, Mr. President. I  yield the Floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mrs. Gillibrand):   S. 908. A bill to provide for an equitable management of summer  flounder based on geographic, scientific, and economic data and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.

I  yield the Floor.                                  ______    Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Women's  History Month to recognize the tremendous achievements women have made  for the United States and pay tribute to their tireless efforts to  fight for themselves, their families, and all Americans.   We have set aside this month for over 30 years to give us the  opportunity to not only reflect on the past and observe the many  accomplishments of American women, but to also inspire the next  generation of women leaders. I look upon the great courage our  foremothers have displayed with great admiration and continue to  personally be inspired by those who blazed the trail for women like me.   When I first came to Washington in 1992, they called it the ``Year of  the Woman.'' Only two other women were serving in the Senate, and four  women had just been elected to the chamber, myself included. Today, a  quarter of the Senate is represented by women and a record 102 women  serve in the House of Representatives, including the first woman  speaker. I am proud of the progress we've made and hopeful we will  continue to build on that momentum toward full equality..   Even at record levels, though, the number of women in Congress falls  far short of the 51 percent of our Nation's population that are women.  I have great hope in the next generations of women to rise up and help  lead the way in building a better California and United States.   As in government, women have been and continue to be leaders in major  social change efforts in our Nation. The business world has been  transformed by powerful women at the table, as have science, music,  film, athletics, literature, and much more. Today, there are more than  10 million women owned American businesses and half of our workforce is  made up of women.   Enrollment numbers at medical and law schools are now almost evenly  split between men and women. Our women warriors serve in critical roles  in the U.S. Armed Forces, with more than 200,000 active-duty  servicewomen proudly serving and a growing number of women veterans  representing every branch of service.   Women who have selflessly answered the call to duty have served their  Nation with honor, courage, and distinction. I have the utmost respect  for the dignity and valor they exhibit and they are commended.   As a United States Senator proudly representing California, I ask you  to join me in celebrating the stories and greatness of American women  who accomplished the unprecedented and honor their legacies by  continuing to defend the rights they worked so hard to achieve. Thank  you Mr. President and I yield the floor.  [[Page S2057]]                                ____________________
