 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, a Tennessee director of  schools named Russell sent me an email about a problem he is having  with some of his students. The so-called devious lick TikTok trend  caught on in his district, and it is more than just a viral gag. The  idea behind this devious lick TikTok trend is to destroy school  property and document it on TikTok so that all the world can see--the  more violent, the better.   Here is how Russell described what is going on in his schools:         In Cleveland City Schools, we have seen fire extinguishers       stolen, mirrors removed from walls, a toilet was removed from       its foundation, and multiple other acts of vandalism. I know       of stories from other school districts, where even more       serious types of vandalism and theft have taken place.    He went on to tell me that this trend has caused thousands of dollars  in damage, and that he has had to resort to threatening suspensions,  court citations and other actions to deter students from demolishing  school property--all from a TikTok video trend.   I want to state for the record that this is absolutely insane. This  is not normal teenage behavior. It is criminal activity, and these kids  are posting it online thinking that they are building social media  clout.   TikTok banned the trending hashtag, but last night, it took a member  of my staff about 10 seconds to unearth posts featuring students  trashing their school bathrooms.   Russell is at a loss as to how to get his students to stop body  slamming doors off their hinges, and so are thousands of parents all  across Tennessee who are wondering how it is even possible that a tech  company is getting away with encouraging criminal behavior in its  underage users.   They want more than just an apology and a tweak to an algorithm. They  are looking for accountability, and I am happy to say that we at the  Senate Commerce Committee are working to get that accountability from  these Big Tech companies.   The issue of Big Tech's toxic influence on children and teens is  finally getting some much-needed bipartisan attention from the Senate.  Earlier this month, I hosted a hearing in the Commerce Committee's  Consumer Protection Subcommittee with Chairman Blumenthal, where we  examined Facebook's role in promoting content to teenagers that drove  young users into spirals of despair, eating disorders, self-harm, and  suicidal thoughts.   Now, our ideas about what Congress should do to force accountability  into the equation might differ a bit, but maybe for the first time  ever, the relationship between Republicans and Democratic tech  watchdogs in this Chamber is far less contentious than the relationship  between Big Tech and Members of Congress. And, Madam President, that is  something worth noting.   If we keep this up, Silicon Valley, as they currently operate, is in  for some big changes because, as much as I appreciate our role as  lawmakers, I also believe in the importance of our ability to compel  transparency from officials and companies that refuse to offer it up  voluntarily. Sunlight is often a better disinfectant than legislation.   Fortunately, at least some players in tech are reading the writing on  the wall. Tomorrow, representatives from YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok  will testify before the Consumer Protection Subcommittee regarding  safety protocols they have inserted between underage users and the  seediest corners of the internet. Yes, I did say ``underage users.''   I want to thank them in advance for agreeing to appear because we are  not going to take it easy on them. They should not expect a comfortable  day. We have evidence that these platforms have endangered children and  teens while collecting--yes, collecting--their personal data and  leveraging it through the advertising side of their businesses. The  danger is real.   As we were preparing for the hearing, my staff hopped on YouTube and  searched for ``how to slit your wrists,'' and the videos YouTube spit  out--well, let's just say that any questions about how to do such a  thing were answered in full, unfortunately.   Earlier this year, a 9-year-old boy in Memphis died trying to  participate in a TikTok ``strangulation challenge'' that had gone  viral.   And we know for a fact that child predators use Snapchat to troll for  victims. This spring, law enforcement arrested a 48-year-old man for  statutory rape after they caught him with a 16-year-old girl.   Where did he meet her?   On Snapchat.   We also have serious questions about data collection and disclosure  policies and whether or not the market research tactics that are used  by YouTube, Snapchat, and TikTok are as invasive and dangerous as the  ones that we now know Facebook uses.   As the saying goes, if the service is free, you are the product. And  if we let them, tech companies will continue grooming our kids into  accepting status as commodities and being their product, regardless of  who it hurts.   Big Tech's relationship with children is a problem, but we also need  adult tech enthusiasts to care about their own entanglements with these  companies. We need everyone to care about how their own ``virtual you''  is harvested and sold to the highest bidder.   Many adult users believe that, because they have lived so much of  their lives online, these things don't matter anymore. But, yes,  indeed, it does matter, and I will give you just one example of why.   For a long time now, we have raised serious concerns about the  connection  [[Page S7334]]  between TikTok and the Chinese Communist Party. We suspect, with very  good reason, that ByteDance, which is TikTok's parent company, handed  over biometrics and other sensitive user data to the Chinese Communist  Party. This app has been Beijing's very best detective, a fact most  users aren't aware of and don't want to give a second thought to.   Parents are completely unaware that TikTok is owned by ByteDance and  that they are in cahoots with the Chinese Communist Party. Parents are  unaware that the biometrics and other sensitive data of their precious  children is now in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.   Madam President, we just cannot afford to continue this. This one app  on its own is a master class on artificial intelligence, machine  learning, and facial recognition technology, and our most dangerous  competitor is using it to corner the market on the world's most  valuable commodity: the virtual you.   It is all part of Beijing's grand strategy to gain control over  strategically important sectors of the global economy. Yes, indeed,  they intend to be globally dominant by the time we get to the midpoint  of the century; and, yes, indeed, they are an adversary.   We see them carrying out more of this agenda via the Belt and Road  Initiative programs. And they are doing it online by training us to  consume content that is so twisted that it drives young users to  violence and to self-destructive behavior.   Interconnectivity has benefits and consequences, and, Madam  President, it is an urgent need to take action against the  consequences. We know from previous investigations that digital content  is a weapon. It can damage self-esteem, destroy relationships, and tip  the balance of global power in the wrong direction.   I hear from Tennesseans like Russell regularly. They will say: We saw  this coming a mile away. We have watched this become a snowball rolling  toward us.   They are appreciative that Congress has finally caught up to them-- parents and teachers who are watching what is happening on social  media--and they are ready for us to pull all those Big Tech skeletons  out of the closet and put them on display.   I will say this: These teachers and parents are not people who are  anti-innovation. They don't want to get in the way of private companies  offering exciting new products. They appreciate interconnectivity, and  they appreciate technology. But what they won't do is tolerate these  companies--tolerate them trolling the data of our children, selling it  as a product, and then turning around and weaponizing the content  against us, the American people.   Big Tech needs to understand that we are not going to hold back, and  it would be in their best interest to work with us on the issues of  online privacy, children's online privacy, data security, and make the  virtual space a safe space.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
