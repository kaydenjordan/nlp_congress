 Mr. President, just 4 weeks ago, Members of the Senate  gathered just down the hallway in Statuary Hall. We gathered to honor  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first woman to lie in state at the  U.S. Capitol. Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer, a woman who may have  stood at just over five feet tall but was nonetheless a giant of the  law. The nation grieved for her, not simply because she wasa a  brilliant lawyer and Justice, but because she was a fighter. And she  fought for those who needed fighting for most--Americans for whom the  promise of America was still just a promise.   I have spoken at length about what Justice Ginsburg meant to the  struggle for equality for millions of Americans. I will not repeat  those words today, except to say that Justice Ginsburg's life's work  left our nation a more perfect union. We will forever be in her debt.   A day after we gathered in Statuary Hall, with the nation in  mourning--and days before Justice Ginsburg was laid to rest with her  husband in Arlington Cemetery--the President held a celebratory  ceremony to nominate her replacement. The masks were off at that Rose  Garden ceremony, in more ways than one. Republicans made it clear they  would stop at nothing to confirm Justice Ginsburg's replacement before  a Presidential election just weeks away. Yes, the masks were off.   From that moment, the confirmation process for Judge Amy Coney  Barrett has been a caricature of illegitimacy. I will not dispute that  it is the responsibility of this body to consider Justice Ginsburg's  replacement to the Supreme Court. But this is not how we should do it.   Not during such a polarizing time for our country, just one week from  a Presidential election after more than 57 million Americans have  already voted. Not at the expense of every precedent and principle this  institution once stood for. Not when doing so requires that half of the  United States Senate go back on their word, contradicting every  argument they once made about Supreme Court vacancies during an  election year. Not when this sprint to confirm Judge Barrett gave the  Judiciary Committee just 2 weeks to prepare for her hearings, when the  Committee has afforded itself three times as long to vet other modern  nominees to our nation's highest court.   Not when records of Judge Barrett's undisclosed speeches and  materials have continued to pour in, even after her hearings, revealing  what a slipshod process this has been from start to finish. And not  when the Senate is doing nothing--nothing--to pass a desperately needed  COVID relief bill.   Every Senator knows in their heart this is wrong.   Senator McConnell ramming this nomination through no matter the cost,  while worrying about the politics of providing relief to millions of  Americans suffering during this still-worsening pandemic--which has  left 225,000 Americans dead--says everything one needs to know about  the priorities of today's Republican Party. Yes, the masks are off.   It is far from a secret why President Trump and Senate Republicans  are hell-bent on confirming Judge Barrett before Election Day. All you  have to do is look at the calendar: On November 10, the Supreme Court  will hear arguments in California v. Texas, the Republican-led lawsuit  to strike down the Affordable Care Act. And Republicans see a Justice  Barrett as an insurance policy to ensure there will be a five-vote  majority to finally strike down the law.   Judiciary Committee Republicans spent last week crying foul,  complaining that it is fearmongering to claim that they see this  vacancy as an opportunity to overturn the ACA. But fear mongering  implies that we're not talking about the facts. So let's review some  basic facts.   It is the Republican Attorneys General who are asking the Court to  throw out the entire ACA. Not just part of it--all of it. It is the  Trump Justice Department that has sided with the Republican-led  lawsuit. And it is this Republican-led Senate, in a vote just weeks  ago, that gave the green light to the Trump Justice Department to take  this position--a position that, if successful, would terminate health  insurance for more than 20 million Americans, terminate the Medicaid  expansion for 15 million more, and terminate protections for 130  million Americans with preexisting conditions. While disappointing,  this Senate vote was hardly surprising. Republicans in Congress have  now voted to repeal or gut the ACA at least 70 times--seventy, as in  seven-zero.   As if Republicans could not be clearer about their intentions, just  days ago President Trump was asked on national television about the  fate of the ACA before the Supreme Court. He said: ``I hope that they  end it. It'll be so good if they end it.''   Like Captain Ahab of Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Republicans have  been single-mindedly obsessed with killing the ACA--their great white  whale--since the moment the law was enacted. Having failed thus far in  both Congress and the courts, they see Judge Barrett as the final  harpoon to once and for all end the law. So when Republicans plead  innocent and claim they have no intentions of taking away people's  health care protections, Americans will remember that their actions  speak much louder than their words.   And Republicans have yet another horse in this race--that is, the  actual race for the White House and Congress. Always one to say the  quiet part out loud, President Trump has repeatedly stated his  expectation that his nominee will side with him in any election-related  dispute. Baselessly claiming that Democrats have ``rigged'' the  election and falsely labeling mail-in ballots as a ``scam,'' President  Trump promises to challenge any election loss in the courts. That's why  he says ``it's very important that we have nine justices.'' Another  Republican on the Judiciary Committee has echoed the President,  claiming that the ``entire reason'' they need Judge Barrett confirmed  now is to ensure that no election-related dispute is deadlocked in a 4  to 4 decision. Mind you, I do not recall Republicans making this  argument when they blocked Judge Merrick Garland from receiving a vote  for 8 months prior to the last presidential election.   Just this week, we have seen why Republicans are all of a sudden so  anxious  [[Page S6461]]  to have a ninth justice seated before Election Day. The Republican  Party is waging an all-out war on voting in the courts right now, with  the goal of disenfranchising as many minority, poor, elderly,  vulnerable, and young voters as possible. Knowing that voters are  relying on mail-in ballots in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic,  Republicans are unapologetically fighting State and local attempts to  make absentee voting easier.   And it's clear that Republicans believe having Judge Barrett on the  Court will help them to suppress the vote. Last week, deadlocked 4 to  4, the Supreme Court left in place a Pennsylvania supreme court order  requiring officials to count absentee ballots received within 3 days of  the election.   Yesterday, anticipating Judge Barrett's imminent confirmation may tip  the scale, the Pennsylvania Republican Party asked the Supreme Court to  review the case again--less than a week after losing the first time.   Unfortunately, for her part, Judge Barrett said nothing during her  hearings last week to assuage the American people that she would be  anything but a green light for the deeply harmful, unpopular objectives  of President Trump and Republicans.   First and foremost, Judge Barrett repeatedly declined to distance  herself from her litany of anti-ACA comments and writings. She also  repeatedly declined to confirm whether she would follow Supreme Court  precedent upholding the ACA.   Judge Barrett once wrote: ``However cagey a justice may be at the  nomination stage, her approach to the Constitution becomes evident in .  . . [what] she writes.'' Using Judge Barrett's own standard, then, one  cannot escape the conclusion that she will view the ACA as a Justice  the same way she has always viewed the ACA: unconstitutional and  unsalvageable.   My concerns only grew when Judge Barrett refused to commit to  recusing herself from any election-related disputes. President Trump  has put Judge Barrett in an unenviable position by making it impossible  for Americans not to question her impartiality should she vote in his  favor in an election dispute. If a Justice Barrett votes to throw the  election for President Trump, I fear not just the Court but our  democracy itself would suffer an existential blow to its legitimacy.   My concerns grew into alarm when Judge Barrett refused to affirm even  the most basic tenets of our democracy. She would not affirm to me that  a president must comply with a court order and the Supreme Court has  the final word. She would not state whether the President can  unilaterally postpone a Presidential election, despite the law clearly  stating he cannot. She would not affirm to me whether our Constitution  contemplates a peaceful transition of power, despite the 20th Amendment  laying out the procedures for precisely such a transition. And she  would not state whether it is illegal to intimidate voters at the  polls, despite federal law explicitly making voter intimidation a  criminal offense. I've never seen a self-described originalist so  hesitant to merely restate the plain text of our Constitution and laws.   In fact, Judge Barrett refused to say much of anything about pretty  much everything. She refused to answer over 100 questions during her  hearings and over 150 written questions. She did so by spuriously  invoking the so-called ``Ginsburg rule,'' which falsely purports that  the late Justice Ginsburg avoided answering any and all substantive  questions during her confirmation hearings.   Well, I participated in Justice Ginsburg's hearings. Justice Ginsburg  gave detailed answers on a number of constitutional issues, including  unequivocally affirming her belief that a woman's right to choose is  central to her dignity. In all, Justice Ginsburg took clear positions  on dozens and dozens of cases during her hearings. In stark contrast,  Judge Barrett wouldn't even restate--not even comment on or discuss,  but just restate--black letter law.   I have never seen such top-to-bottom refusals to answer basic  questions in the 16 Supreme Court confirmation hearings I have  participated in. But in some ways, it was only fitting that a  confirmation process that has been a caricature of illegitimacy  concluded with such hearings-hearings in which the nominee wouldn't  even acknowledge that masks inhibit the spread of COVID-19, or that  climate change is real, or that voter discrimination exists. I fear for  what this means for the future of the Judiciary Committee's  confirmation process, now that Republicans have reduced our committee's  role to a mindless rubberstamp of a President's nominees, just as they  have diminished the Senate to a subordinate arm of the executive  branch.   The Republican argument for proceeding in this way, just 1 week from  a Presidential election, boils down to this: We have the votes, so  anything goes. Yet, having the power to do something does not make it  right. The damage that will be left in the wake of this confirmation  will stain this body for generations. When the word of a senator is  rendered meaningless, when the words ``Advice and Consent'' are  rendered meaningless, then this institution will be rendered  meaningless.   Justice Ginsburg left us with a more equal and more perfect union.  She stood up for the right to vote. She stood up for the environment,  and for holding all those in power accountable. She stood up for the  rights of women to be free from discrimination, to control their own  bodies, and to be equal to men.   She stood up for the rights of minorities, the rights of the LGBTQ  community, and the rights of all those who have been marginalized.   Judge Barrett, if confirmed, will not. Based on my review of her  record and based on her testimony, I believe a Justice Barrett would  set the clock back decades on all of the rights that Americans have  fought so hard to achieve and protect.   I have said that Justice Ginsburg would have dissented from this  process. The least I can do is join her. I will vote no.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit all news  organizations and hit them hard at a time when they have rarely been so  essential to the American people and our communities.   News organizations have had to severely trim their staffs, while  coping, as we all have had to do, with the pandemic's health threats  and uncertainties. It is a great credit to our Fourth Estate that so  many news organizations nonetheless have managed to produce such heroic  work in meeting this vital challenge.   Most news outlets have had to transition to an online distribution  model in distributing their reporting during this pandemic. These  valiant efforts have included those by online-only news organizations  such as ``Vermont Digger,'' in Vermont. The New York Times recently  recognized the vital work of such Vermont news outlets as ``Vermont  Digger'' and ``Seven Days'' in the face of these unprecedented  challenges.   Vermont stands almost alone in the Nation in our State's successful  efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19. Much of that can be attributed  to the bold steps taken by State and local communities and leaders at  all levels, including Governor Phil Scott, to follow the science in  promoting mask wearing and social distancing. Sensible and responsible  leadership, and strong and steady reporting by Vermont's news  organizations, have produced ``a high degree of social trust,'' as the  Washington Post has reported.   Recently ``Vermont Digger'' was recognized by the Local Independent  Online News Association for its local coverage of COVID-19, and that  recognition is richly deserved.   Vermonters know that in troubling times like these, we fare best when  we make the difficult but important decisions to protect our families,  our neighbors, and our communities. This pandemic continues to rage,  but I am proud that my fellow Vermonters are once again leading the  Nation in our efforts to conquer out this virus.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to recognize Nancy Everhart  on the occasion of her retirement from the Vermont Housing and  Conservation Board. Nancy Everhart has been a true Vermont leader in  agriculture and conservation, dedicating her decades-long career to the  protection of farmland and the viability of the farmers who rely on it.  She retires with an extensive list of accomplishments. The passion she  applies to her work has had a tremendous impact on the Vermont  landscape, as well as our Nation's agricultural future.   Nancy was a farmer first. As a strong pioneer of Vermont's organic  movement during the 1980s, she was among the first Vermonters to sell  organic milk to her community. Her work and that of other like-minded  farmers in Vermont were catalysts in the early organic movement that  ultimately led me to introduce the Organic Food Production Act as  chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Enacted as part of the  1990 farm bill, that bill created the first-ever standards and label  for what is now a $50 billion industry. Even as she became a national  leader in conservation, Nancy has still maintained a small,  diversified, organic farm at her home in Marshfield, VT. Her personal  experiences as a farmer have afforded her a unique perspective and  credibility to bring to each phase of her career.   As the conservation director for the Vermont Housing and Conservation  Board, Nancy has led or contributed directly to the conservation of  more than 77,000 acres across nearly 500 parcels of Vermont farmland.  These projects have helped to keep Vermont farms viable by allowing  farm owners to access substantial capital and benefit from their most  valuable asset, their land. Those benefits, however, do not stop at the  fence line. Nancy knows that investments in preserving working  landscapes benefit the rural communities that surround them and  contribute greatly to the tourist and outdoor economies of rural States  like Vermont. They can be a bridge to the next generation, often  providing young and beginning farmers the opportunity to overcome their  biggest hurdle: accessing affordable farmland to start and grow their  enterprise. When that succession of stewardship is broken and working  lands fall out of production, it can exact an immeasurable price from  the community.   Nancy's decades of work have exemplified and brought home to Vermont  exactly the outcomes that I envisioned when I worked to establish the  Federal role for farmland protection in the 1990 and 1996 farm bills.  Since that time, Nancy has drawn on her vast experience to provide  counsel on how to expand that role and continually improve farmland  conservation provisions, including most recently in the Agricultural  Conservation Easement Program --ACEP--provisions of the 2018 farm  [[Page S6592]]  bill. Those provisions greatly enhance the delivery and flexibility of  farmland conservation programs, not just for Vermont but across the  entire United States.   As a farmer herself, Nancy Everhart understands the challenges that  farmers face, and she has dedicated a portion of her work to improving  farm viability, increasing diversification, and providing opportunities  for young Vermonters to realize their own farm dreams. As she retires,  Nancy's enthusiasm and commitment to Vermont agriculture will continue  to be reflected in our State's working landscape and resilient farmers.                            ____________________     Madam President, 150 years ago, Georgetown Law convened  its first class in Washington, DC, where 25 students from 12 States  began what has now become a century and a half long legacy of learning.  While Georgetown Law's entering classes look quite different now--over  500 students from nearly all 50 States and from countries around the  world--the institution's dedication to justice and service remains the  same. Since opening its doors in 1870, Georgetown Law has educated  generations of bright, driven, and passionate future lawyers who embody  the school's motto: ``Law is but the means, justice is the end.''   I had the great fortune of attending Georgetown Law and received my  juris doctorate in 1964. While laptops may have replaced legal pads  since my law school days, Georgetown Law's commitment to producing  competent, fiercely principled attorneys has never changed. The  education I received at Georgetown Law had a profound, indelible impact  on me and the way I view the world.   Georgetown Law furthered my inspiration to become a U.S. Senator.  Attending classes just blocks away from Capitol Hill and the Supreme  Court, I and many others were constantly reminded that the law is not  just an academic endeavor, but a very real one, impacting the lives and  rights of millions. It filled me with awe to be learning the law in the  city where laws are being made. It is no wonder that so many alumni of  Georgetown Law dedicate their lives to public service and government.   Georgetown Law stands out among our Nation's law schools for ensuring  that students are not just learning the law, but putting it into  practice. The law center offers top-ranked clinical programs and  practicums, in which law students learn the art and science of  lawyering. From asylum seekers to victims of domestic violence, from  appellate arguments to criminal defense proceedings, Georgetown Law  students learn what it truly means to zealously advocate for real  clients in need.   Georgetown Law also boasts world-renowned centers and institutes that  push the legal profession to be both introspective and innovative. A  special place of pride for me is the school's Center on Privacy and  Technology, which trains the next generation of lawyers who will carry  on a cause that has been one of my top priorities as a U.S. Senator:  fighting for Americans' privacy rights.   During these difficult times, it is steadying to know that Georgetown  Law still embraces one of its oldest but most timeless traditions:  imbibing the spirit of service in its graduates. That, without a doubt,  is the lasting legacy of Georgetown Law, educating generations of  lawyers who believe that the law is an instrument for good.   My congratulations to Georgetown Law on this milestone. Here is to  150 more.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to call attention to the  important work done by the Children's Literacy Foundation--CLiF--a  Waterbury Center, VT, based organization that was established in 1998  to address children's literacy in Vermont and New Hampshire. CLiF's  founder, Duncan McDougall, set out to improve access to books and other  learning resources for children in low-income, at-risk, and rural  communities through a diverse set of programs, from story-telling  events with authors to partnerships with elementary schools to  distribute books to students. Over the last 22 years, the foundation  has touched the lives of thousands of children in Vermont and New  Hampshire.   As schools in Vermont have opened their doors in a more limited  capacity this fall, learning has become more difficult for many  students, and access to books at home has become even more critical.  Luckily, CLiF quickly moved to address this new challenge. Since March,  the foundation has partnered with schools and libraries to fill some of  the gap left by remote learning, distributing 40,000 books across our  two States, and facilitating remote and in-person literacy workshops  and story-telling events. Not only has this been beneficial for  children, but it has helped parents as well, many of whom are  simultaneously juggling teaching, and working full-time. As a father  and a grandfather, I truly understand the importance of access to books  in the home, and I am truly grateful for the efforts made by Mr.  McDougall and the rest of the team at the Children's Literacy  Foundation to make books more available for students in Vermont and New  Hampshire.   Reading is, as they say, fundamental, and I often think of my days  visiting Kellogg Hubbard in Montpelier when I was growing up. Providing  children the resources and tools to grow in their reading journeys is  providing them a lifelong tool for success.   The Children Literacy Foundation was recently featured in an article  in Vermont's ``Seven Days.'' I ask unanimous consent that the article,  ``Waterbury Literacy Nonprofit Distributes 40,000 Kids' Books During  Pandemic,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From Seven Days, Sept. 30, 2020]    Waterbury Literacy Nonprofit Distributes 40,000 Kids' Books During                                  Pandemic                            (By Sasha Goldstein)         Anyone with kids knows how difficult WFH life can be during       a pandemic. But a local nonprofit has tried to make things a       bit easier for families.        Since March, the Waterbury Center-based Children's Literacy       Foundation has given away nearly 40,000 books to kids across       Vermont and New Hampshire. The gesture is all the more       important at a time when kids have been isolated and soaking       up screen time, said Erika Nichols-Frazer, the foundation's       communications manager.        ``Our program partners have gotten really creative with       it,'' Nichols-Frazer said. ``Some of them send books home in       meal packages or with other learning materials; others have       done curbside pickup . . . So we're making sure we're still       getting them books at this time, which is obviously more       important than ever.''        The foundation's mission, according to its website, ``is to       inspire a love of reading and writing among low-income, at-      risk, and rural children up to age 12.'' Nichols-Frazer said       the pandemic has made that a more urgent undertaking. Such       groups of kids are the most likely to fall behind when they       aren't in school or are learning remotely.        Earlier this month, the foundation launched its Year of the       Book program and donated $25,000 to schools in Chelsea,       Windsor, Danby and Clarendon, as well as J.J. Flynn       Elementary School in Burlington. Each student at those       schools will receive 10 new books they may keep and will       participate in virtual and in-person readings and workshops       with local authors and illustrators. The school libraries,       classrooms and even the local community libraries will each       receive cash to buy new books, Nichols-Frazer said.        Despite the pandemic, she said, a group of volunteers in       the Waterbury area has continued to help put nameplate       stickers in each book so the kids can personalize their       reading materials. ``It might sound small, but it's an       important thing for these kids to own books,'' Nichols-Frazer       said. ``A lot of the kids we work with don't have their own       books, and so having that little sticker in there that says       `This is my book' is kind of a special thing for them.''                            ____________________
