Transmittal No. 22-01       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-120C-7/8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air       Missile (AMRAAM) is a supersonic, air launched, aerial       intercept, guided missile featuring digital technology and       micro-miniature solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shootdown, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures,       and interception of high and low-flying and maneuvering       targets. The AIM-120C-8 is a form, fit, function refresh of       the AIM-120C-7 and is the next generation to be produced.        2. The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a guidance       kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into an       accurate, adverse weather ``smart'' munition. The Guidance       Set consists of a Tail Kit, which contains the Inertial       Navigation System (INS) and a Global Positioning System       (GPS), a set of Aerosurfaces and an umbilical cover, which       allows the JDAM to improve the accuracy of unguided, General       Purpose (GP) bombs. The Guidance Set, when combined with a       warhead and appropriate fuze, forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit       (GBU) and gives the bomb an adverse weather capability. The       JDAM weapon can be delivered from modest standoff ranges at       high or low altitudes against a variety of land and surface       targets during the day or night. The JDAM is capable of       receiving target coordinates via preplanned mission data from       the delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors (i.e.,       FLIR, Radar, etc.) during captive carry, or from a third-      party source via manual or automated aircrew cockpit entry.        The KMU-556 is the tail kit for a GBU-31 fitted with a       2,000LB (Mk-84 GP) bomb body.        3. GBU-48 Enhanced Paveway II (EP-II) is a maneuverable,       free-fall, laser-guided bombs (LGBs) that guide to reflected       laser energy from the desired target. The ``enhanced''       component adds GPS guidance to the laser seeker. This dual-      mode capability allows the weapon to operate in all weather       conditions. The LGB is delivered the same way as a normal GP       warhead, except the semi-active guidance corrects for       employment errors inherent in any delivery system. Laser       designation for the weapon can be provided by a variety of       laser target markers or designators from the air or ground.       The Enhanced Paveway system consists of a non-warhead-      specific Enhanced Computer Control Group (ECCG), a warhead-      specific Air Foil Group (AFG) that attaches to the nose and       tail of GP bomb, and a fuze. The weapon is primarily used for       precision bombing against non-hardened targets.        The GBU-48 is a 1,000LB (MK-83 GP) bomb body fitted with       the MXU-667 AFG and MAU-210 ECCG to guide to its laser-      designated target.        4. The FMU-139 Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) is a multi-      delay, multi-arm and proximity sensor compatible with General       Purpose blast, frag, and hardened-target penetrator weapons.       The FMU-139 settings are cockpit selectable in flight when       used with numerous precision-guided weapons. It can interface       with numerous weapons, including GBU-31 and GBU-48.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7.
