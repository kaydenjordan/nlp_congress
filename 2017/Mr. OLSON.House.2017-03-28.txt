 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 34,  which will protect consumers and the future of internet innovation.   The internet is changing the way we communicate, shop, learn, and  entertain. It is changing how we control our homes, our cars, and many  other parts of our lives, including my two teenage kids. These changes  give us certain expectations of privacy on the internet.   Until last year, the Federal Trade Commission provided a robust,  consistent privacy framework for all companies in the internet services  market. Their holistic and consistent approach struck the right  balance. Consumers' use of internet services continues to increase and  their privacy has been protected.   The resolution we are voting on today puts all segments of the  internet on equal footing. It provides consumers with a consistent set  of privacy rules.  [[Page H2497]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for S.J. Res. 34.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I remind my  friends once again that this does not put us on equal footing. The FTC  has no power to regulate ISPs under current law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Capuano).                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I must confess, as my wife and kids know, I  am not the most romantic guy. I have never dreamed I would be a  matchmaker. Believers say the Lord works in mysterious ways, and, Mr.  Speaker, those words are, oh, so true.   In 2007, I came home and ran for Congress. It was brutal: a 10-person  primary, a runoff against a former Member, and a general election  against an incumbent. But I had a secret weapon on my campaign: this  man, Luke Marchant. Luke is the son of our colleague, Kenny. Luke would  show up in a campaign office with ratty flip flops, in wrinkled, baggy  shorts, and an unwashed T-shirt. Luke was a beast. But a beauty showed  up like out of Disney: Katie McDonald. The matchmaking began. Beauty  and the beast fell in love.   I was there on June 12, 2016, when they were married. Last week,  Walker Ross Marchant was born to these two amazing young friends.   Katie and Luke, congratulations. In the future, for number two, maybe  Peter Graham Marchant should be a name you all should consider.                            ____________________
