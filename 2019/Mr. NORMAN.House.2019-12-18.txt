 Madam Speaker, I oppose this resolution, and I include my  statement in the Record.   Madam Speaker, Today I have heard my Democratic warn that our  Republic is in a constitutional crisis. Yet the only crisis I see is  the crisis of one party unable to accept its defeat.   When you lost, you called for the abolishment of the Electoral  College, to redraw the electoral map, and now for impeachment   You claim to be the Defenders of our Constitution, but is there any  article you would not shred to gain power?   But if we pretend for a second that you are sincere about the dangers  to our Republic, I am left wondering:   Why would you not follow the historical precedent of impeachment  processes?   Why would you not have an open and fair investigation?   Why would you rush through the entire process?   In other words, if you are so concerned with the fate of our  Republic, why on earth would you play politics with it?   The truth is, yours words do not match your actions.   As you pretend to cry about the state of our Republic, save a few  tears for the state of your own party.
