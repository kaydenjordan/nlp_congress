 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.    I am opposed.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to  the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   Mr. Speaker, my motion to recommit is simple and should garner the  support of all Members who dislike government waste and abuse of power.   My motion goes to the heart of the costly ethical violations by EPA  Administrator Scott Pruitt and his penchant for flying first class in  violation of Federal regulations and billing it to taxpayers.   He has done this at a time when he has supported cuts to EPA clean  water and clean air initiatives in the communities we represent back  home.                                time  1430    So my amendment is simple. It says: ``Nothing in this act may be  construed to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency to charter a flight, or travel in any class of air  accommodation above coach class.''   See, Federal regulations right now require government officials to  consider the least expensive class of travel that meets their needs.  Now, agencies are allowed to travel first class in very rare instances,  such as a flight of 14 hours or more, a medical disability, or for  exceptional security circumstances if your life or government property  is in danger.   Well, Administrator Scott Pruitt has abused these exceptions. This  came to light after the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked the  EPA Administrator to explain his costly travel records, which showed he  repeatedly booked first class flights at taxpayer expense, and he hoped  no one would notice. There is no adequate justification for this  wasteful spending and abuse of power by Scott Pruitt. If he enjoys  flying first class and staying in luxury hotels, then he should pay for  it himself and not ask the taxpayers to foot the bill.   Here is what we know per press reports and committee research: last  June 5, Pruitt settled into his $1,641 first class seat for a short  flight from D.C. to New York. The ticket cost more than 6 times that of  the two media aides who traveled along with him and sat in coach. In  Manhattan, Administrator Pruitt made two brief television appearances  praising the White House's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris  climate agreement. He stayed in an upscale hotel near Times Square and  returned to Washington the next day. That Wednesday, after traveling on  Air Force One for an infrastructure event in Cincinnati, Pruitt and  several staffers raced back to New York on a military jet, at the cost  of $36,000, to then catch a plane to Rome. The transatlantic flight was  part of a round-trip ticket for the Administrator that cost over  $7,000, according to EPA records, several times what was paid for other  officials who went.   In total, the taxpayer-funded travel for Pruitt and his top aides  during that stretch in June cost at least $90,000, thanks to the  Environmental Integrity Project, which got the records. His travel  practices are quite different from previous EPA Administrators', who  very rarely traveled first class and always announced their travel  schedule to the public.   But Scott Pruitt's travel is different. It is secretive, it is  costly, and it is frequent. In fact, we have come to learn that this  year he plans to travel to Israel, Australia, Japan, Mexico, and  possibly Canada. None of those have been officially announced, but we  have been digging. Pruitt rarely discloses where he plans to be.   So, at the request of congressional Democrats, the EPA's Office of  Inspector General is conducting probes of Pruitt's travel. He has  attempted to justify his luxury travel by noting that he has been  approached by people in the airport numerous times to talk about his  environmental record. However, it is unclear why this justifies  purchasing first class tickets.   These new justifications also contradict previous explanations of  this questionable travel as a way of providing an opportunity to hear  directly from people affected by the EPA. The Administrator simply  prefers to be wasteful with taxpayer dollars.   We have asked about other conflicts of interest. He has continually  sided with dirty energy and chemical companies, so it is no matter that  members of the public would like to discuss these pressing issues with  him. According to the Environmental Integrity Project, new travel  records shared with the media show Pruitt and EPA employees spent up to  $150,000 on premium commercial and chartered flights just in a 6-month  period.   So, Mr. Speaker, Administrator Pruitt says he will start flying coach  after all the attention it has garnered, but he hasn't promised to do  so. Through this motion to recommit, we would like to make it  permanent. We would like to hold him accountable.   And for anyone who would like to eliminate waste in government and  make sure that our officials do not abuse their power, it is time to  adopt this amendment, and I urge Congress to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
