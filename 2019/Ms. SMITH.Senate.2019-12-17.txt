 Madam President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate  the lives of James Rogers, Charles Nord, and Kort Plantenberg, all  members of the Minnesota National Guard, who tragically lost their  lives in a helicopter accident on Thursday, December 5. After returning  home safely from deployment to the Middle East in May, this loss is  especially heart wrenching. These men conducted medical evacuations in  the Middle East, and their service to our troops and allies will not be  forgotten. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice for Minnesota  and our country.   CW2 James Rogers, often remembered for his curious nature, served 10  years in the Minnesota National Guard, having enlisted before his high  school graduation. CW2 Charles Nord enlisted in 2007, and he leaves  behind his wife, young daughter, and a child on the way. SGT James  Plantenberg enlisted in 2016, was a member of the Guard's biathlon  team, and was preparing to start flight school. We are all indebted to  these men for their service, and I wish their families peace during  this time of tragic loss.                            ____________________
