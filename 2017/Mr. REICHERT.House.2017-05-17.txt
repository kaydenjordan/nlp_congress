 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday this week, hundreds of families,  friends, colleagues, and loved ones from every corner of the country  gathered at the United States Capitol for the 36th annual National  Peace Officers Memorial Day. They were here to honor all of those names  at the memorial, 21,000 names, Mr. Speaker. And this year, 394 more  were added. Now, some of those are over past years--not this past year,  but prior years--but 394 additional names were added to the National  Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Their names will ever be etched in  our hearts and on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers  Memorial, and, as I said, with 21,000 others who came before them.   People who walk by and view these names may not recognize the names  or may not know all of the names. They may have a special loved one  whose name appears on those hollowed walls. But the thing to remember  here is that these are brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, and some  even grandfathers. They are real people who sacrificed their lives.  Some were ambushed and executed, and some lost their lives responding  to a call to save a life or someone who called for help. These are the  men and women who gave their lives so we could, in many cases, keep  ours.   I have a lot more to say on this, and we have some time. I am going  to yield to other Members, Mr. Speaker, who arrived here tonight to  share their stories and remember the officers who served their  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Chairman Goodlatte, chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I thank him for all  his hard work in his committee to support law enforcement across the  country. I look forward to working with him on some of the law  enforcement reforms that his committee is looking at. I appreciate it.   It is an honor for me, Mr. Speaker, to lead this Special Order. I am  very humbled at the response that we have received tonight by the  Members who want to be here and talk about their law enforcement  officers in their communities.   Another one of our Members who wants to share his thoughts and  feelings is the son of a State trooper from Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia. As he  shared his story about his father, it reminded me of my own story of  coming home to my three young kids and my uniform being torn and  bloodied, in some cases. I never really thought about what my kids or  my spouse was thinking when I came home. I was still wrapped up in the  shift that I had just come from and the struggles that I had been  through on the streets.                                time  1900    I served for 33 years in the King County Sheriff's Office, and I  would do that job all over again, Mr. Speaker. I loved it.   But I wanted to share another story, too, of Officer Jake Gutierrez  from the Tacoma Police Department, which is a city just south of  Seattle. Officer Gutierrez tragically died in the line of duty. He lost  his life while protecting a woman from domestic violence. Jake was  supposed to exchange wedding vows with his fiancee just a few weeks  later. Instead, his fiancee, his three daughters, and his granddaughter  attended his funeral. They struggled--and I am thinking they are still  struggling today--to picture a life without him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Gowdy). Our U.S. Attorney, prosecutor, knows law enforcement well, and  he has a story to tell about one of his officers.    Mr. Gowdy, I have a feeling that Kevin knew anyway when  he left that courtroom how you felt. Thank you for sharing that  powerful story. I think it really clearly points to a lot of things:   One, the job is tough and you have got to make those split decisions,  and they are life and death decisions;   Two, that the human side of the police officer is not very often  recognized; that the connection to their family--as I said in my  opening statement, these are people that are fathers, they are sons,  they are sisters, they are mothers, in some cases they are  grandparents.   Sometimes we see a person just wearing a uniform, but there is a  human being inside that uniform wearing that badge and carrying that  gun to make sure that we can get home to our families and enjoy our  families.   I lost a best friend and partner in 1982. It still hurts today. If I  can get past the emotional part, I might share that story a little bit  later.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge Poe for his words. When he  mentioned police officers don't do this for the money, I always  considered it a calling. And I think if you talked to any police  officer or deputy out on the street today, I think they would tell you  that they felt called to serve, and called to serve in the uniform, and  called to put their life on the line and to risk their life for others.   I was going to share the story of my partner, Sam Hicks, who was  killed in 1982. He left behind five sons. He was ambushed and shot in  the chest and killed instantly.   The killer was a man who was already wanted for murder. One of the  hardest things I ever did--I was the only homicide detective at the  scene when they captured him--was to sit in the back seat with this  killer, advise him of his rights, and get him a glass of water and  something to eat because he had been on the run for 3 days. I spent an  hour in the back seat of that cop car with this killer, knowing that  Sam's five sons no longer had a father.   Thank you for your words tonight, Judge.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Jacksonville, Florida (Mr.  Rutherford), the second sheriff in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the sheriff for being here tonight  honoring those who fell in his community and under his command. I thank  him for his 40 years with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. I am proud  to serve with him in Congress. We need more sheriffs in Congress, by  the way.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. DesJarlais).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee  (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana  (Mrs. Brooks).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Demings), the former police chief of Orlando.                                time  1945     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chief. It is an honor to serve  with the gentlewoman. I know the gentlewoman has a special quality  about her now that I heard her husband was a sheriff. The gentlewoman  is all thumbs up on my team, and I thank her for her sincere,  thoughtful comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran)  who is a former Chicago police officer.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
