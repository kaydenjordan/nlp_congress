 Madam Speaker, today we will be considering the Helping  Emergency Responders Overcome Act, or the HERO Act.   This has been an unprecedented time of stress and pressure on our  first responders: firefighters, police officers, and our frontline  healthcare workers. This is a no-nonsense bill that will provide  necessary resources to understand first responder suicide and pressure,  but also to provide grants to provide peer-to-peer conversation and  proactive reaching out to these first responders who are our heroes.   So, again, I urge all my colleagues to pass this bill unanimously. It  has passed previously. It will make a difference, and it will help save  lives and help treat these heroes as they have taken care of us.                            ____________________
