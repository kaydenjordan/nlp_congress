 Mr. Speaker, yesterday President Trump signed an  executive order, an order that he said was to stop separation of  families at the border. This is a policy that he caused, and he has now  taken a victory lap. It is ridiculous.   My response: To stop family separation once and for all, President  Trump must end his failed zero-tolerance policy. Replacing family  separation with indefinite family detention is not the solution. We  cannot continue to overwhelm our immigration system and incarcerate  families who pose no threat to the United States to please immigration  hardliners.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  Goodlatte bill and in opposition to the rule.   Do you know how many Democrats were involved in crafting the  Goodlatte bill? Zero. If they had included Democrats, we could have  told them that this bill does nothing to resolve the humanitarian  crisis happening at the border.   Do you know how many hearings we had on the Goodlatte bill? Zero. If  they had included Democrats, we would have told them that this bill  does nothing to provide meaningful relief for Dreamers, and is dead on  arrival in the Senate.   How many Dreamers does this help earn citizenship? Zero.   How many children does this bill put back in the arms of their  parents? Zero.   How much compromise does this bill show people in need? Zero.   This administration likes to talk about zero tolerance. Well, we have  zero tolerance for this President's anti-immigration agenda and the  Republicans who enable it.   Bottom line, Mr. Speaker, this bill is a sham. It is the Republican's  attempt to make it look like they want to help Dreamers, but, in  reality, it is a nonstarter, and it is another heartless action taken  by this Congress. Oppose this bill. Oppose this rule.
