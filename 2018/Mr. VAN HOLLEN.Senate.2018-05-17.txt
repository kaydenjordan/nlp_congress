 Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Budget  Committee, I am disappointed that Republican leaders have not even  begun the process of debating a budget for the upcoming year in our  committee. The United States needs a budget that addresses our national  debt, which is increasing significantly faster due to a Republican tax  plan that delivers huge windfalls to millionaires, billionaires, and  multinational corporations.   Unfortunately, the budget proposal we considered today would take  health coverage from tens of millions of Americans because its massive  spending cuts would almost certainly mean huge reductions in Medicare  and Medicaid. This budget would also make it harder for struggling  families to afford food, housing, and childcare, and it would slash  vital economic investments in infrastructure, education, and scientific  research.   At the same time, this budget does not achieve even one penny of  deficit reduction from reducing the tax cuts that Republicans just  provided to those at the top. I will not support a budget that is  balanced on the backs of working families and the middle class.   We need a budget that invests in our future, supports a basic  standard of living for all Americans, and safeguards our health and  safety. This budget proposal fails to do so, which is why I voted  against the motion to proceed to its consideration.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we observe National Police Week, I  rise today to recognize Sean Matthew Suiter and Sander Benjamin Cohen,  two Maryland law enforcement officers who lost their lives in the line  of duty in 2017. It is important that we give thanks to all the men and  women who put themselves at risk every day to protect our communities.   Sean Suiter was an 18-year veteran who was shot in west Baltimore  while investigating a triple homicide. Relatives describe him as an  anchor in his family, devoted to his wife and three children who ``. .  . was focused on trying to [. . .] raise them to be strong and good  citizens.''   Sander Cohen, who served as deputy chief in the Maryland Office of  the State Fire Marshal was killed in December while assisting a  disabled motorist. His friends and family describe him as funny with an  infectious smile and as ``an example of the good in people.''   As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to  support programs that provide our law enforcement officers with the  funding and training they need to protect themselves and our  communities.   Police officers bear a unique burden. While we can never fully repay  them for their sacrifices, we should all take the time to thank police  officers who put their lives on the line every day to protect our  safety. We must honor their sacrifice and support the families of those  we have lost in the line of duty.                            ____________________
