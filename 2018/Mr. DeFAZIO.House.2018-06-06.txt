 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 8, the Water Resources  Development Act of 2018. This is the product of many months of hard  work by members of the committee and staff, and I particularly want to  congratulate the chairman. This will be his last WRDA bill, but until  his leadership, water resources bills had languished for, I believe, a  decade. So this has been a tremendous achievement.   This is a good bill. However, it could be better. In the last  Congress, I offered an amendment in committee to take the harbor  maintenance trust fund off budget, allow the Corps to spend the  proceeds in the trust fund every year, and draw down the surplus that  deals with a backlog on all of our ports.   Ports affect the entire Nation, any time you have an import or an  export, which covers virtually all of the States of the union. These  red dots are harbors that are critical to our infrastructure. On a  daily basis, our major ports are at about 35 percent of their  authorized depth. 35 percent. Why is that? Well, because we don't have  the money to fix them. And the jetties are falling apart. We don't have  the money to fix them.   Well, actually, we do have the money to fix them, but some very  shortsighted people around here want to play games. They want to  collect a tax from the American people--a minuscule tax, 0.0125 cents  on the value of every imported good that comes through a harbor. That  is, if you buy a $30,000 car, you are going to spend about $37.50 that,  starting with Ronald Reagan, was dedicated to maintaining our harbors  at proper depths and maintaining the jetties for these harbors, not  limiting the funds just to the commercial harbors, but to small and  emerging ports, which are also critical to the Nation: the fishing  industry, recreation, and others.   However--and this has been a bipartisan problem, starting even when  Democrats have been in charge--this has been underspent on an annual  basis. Today, there is $10.5 billion of taxes collected from the  American people sitting idle or having been spent somewhere else. It  has got a theoretical trust fund.   Now, that is going to grow every year as we underspend this tax. It  could grow to $20 billion within a decade. So we don't have the money  to dredge the ports and we don't have the money to fix the jetties,  because Congress is diverting the money. I actually worked on this with  the chairman's father quite some time ago, and the chairman has been  supportive of my efforts.   Unfortunately, it was stripped out of that bill by the Rules  Committee 2 years ago. And this year, again, the Rules Committee found  that they would not allow this to go forward. So we offered it in a  different form to get around their technical objections about budget  caps and discretionary spending.                                time  1445    So we offered--well, there actually is a way around that. They didn't  like that either. They want to continue to steal money from the  American people and divert it to be spent who knows where--somewhere  else, but not on our harbors and our ports.   Now, the administration actually sent to what is called their  statement down to us with an SAP--and it really is a SAP; they are  SAPs--a Statement of Administration Policy is what it stands for. They  sent down a provision where they said: This is great that you are not  allowing the Congress to spend the tax collected from the American  people on the stated purpose.   What? Really? Yes. That is their position. They say that the ports  should have greater flexibility to spend local money on the ports.   Well, they have all the flexibility in the world to spend local money  on local ports. They can partner with the Corps and fund Corps  activities. I did that a number of years ago in Oregon. They don't have  the money, and we are depriving them of the money.   But this is the Trump administration's solution. The big  infrastructure package? This is going to be counted. We are going to  add $3 billion to the pile of unfunded Corps projects.   We have got today $96 billion of Corps projects that have been  authorized by Congress that aren't funded in the foreseeable future. At  the end of this debate there will be $99 billion--almost $100 billion-- quite an achievement, and the administration is applauding this. They  think this is just great because it gives the local ports the  capability of raising money they can't raise to spend on the  improvements they can't make.   Meanwhile, we are stealing money from the American people. It is a  very sad day. So with that said, I will move on. There are other issues  in this bill that are critical.   We have $3 billion to new Chief's Reports which will go on the shelf  for the indefinite future, maybe 100 years or longer. But people can go  home and say: Well, I got that project, all we need to do now is get  the money.   Maybe a future Congress--maybe next year--we will decide to start  spending the harbor maintenance tax on harbor maintenance. Who knows?  It might depend upon who is in charge around here.   There are other provisions in here that are critical, authorizing the  national levee safety initiative, the national dam safety program-- those are pretty important things--promoting improved safety measures,  and reducing the risk to life and property.   There are a couple of provisions that benefit or would go for Corps  projects in my district, one related to Fern Ridge Dam, and a  collapsing road near the dam. A number of years ago, we had to expedite  funds to fix a collapsing dam, now we have a collapsing road by the  collapsing dam, and hopefully, the Corps can get to that before we have  a major problem; and then delivering on a very long-ago promise to  [[Page H4801]]  Indian tribes that were displaced by dams that were built three- quarters of a century ago. Their villages were flooded and displaced,  and this would authorize the Corps to provide housing assistance to  those tribes.   There are other meritorious things in this bill. Again, I want to  congratulate the chairman on what will be the third conservative 2-year  authorization of the Water Resources Development Act. We just need to  find the will and the money to fund the necessary projects.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I support the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Chair, wouldn't it be in order just to move along?  If people aren't responsible enough to be here, they don't get to offer  the amendment.    The gentleman did not respond to my previous inquiry.   There were 53 amendments offered. The Rules Committee didn't give us  en bloc authority. We need to expedite this. If people aren't here, we  need to move along.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield to my colleague from Louisiana,  Garret Graves.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today regarding missed votes due to  a medical issue. Had I been present for rollcall vote No. 237, the  Motion to Recommit H.R. 8, I would have voted ``yea.'' Had I been  present for rollcall vote No. 238, H.R. 8, the Water Resources  Development Act of 2018, I would have voted ``yea.'' Had I been present  for rollcall vote No. 239, the Senate Amendment to H.R. 3249, I would  have voted ``yea.'                            ____________________
