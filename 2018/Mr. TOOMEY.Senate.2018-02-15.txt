 Mr. President, Kate Steinle didn't have to be shot and  killed on a pier in San Francisco. A 13-year-old child didn't have to  be raped in the city of Philadelphia by Ramon Ochoa. Both of those  crimes were committed by people who were in this country illegally  after previously committing multiple crimes and after having been  deported. In both cases, the  [[Page S1147]]  cities in which these crimes occurred--the police departments--had  these criminals in custody shortly prior to the commission of these  crimes. But in both cases, when the Department of Homeland Security  asked for a temporary detention until they could take these people into  custody and deport them, that was not allowed because these were  sanctuary cities. These sanctuary cities systematically forbid the  local police from even sharing information or cooperating with Federal  immigration officials, even in the case of criminals.   My amendment is a bipartisan amendment. I want to thank the Senator  from West Virginia for cosponsoring it. This is an amendment that will  ensure that any legal liability for wrongful detention is held by the  Federal Government, and nonsecurity funds--CDBG grants and some other  categories--will be withheld from sanctuary cities.
