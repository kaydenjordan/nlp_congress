 Madam President, our farmers, ranchers, and foresters  are the greatest stewards of the land, and many have been working for a  long time to preserve natural resources and protect the environment  through on-farm practices. And now, more than ever, farmers, ranchers,  and private forest landowners are looking to explore opportunities to  benefit financially through emerging voluntary environmental credit  markets.   New opportunities to generate benefits through environmental  practices hold a great deal of promise. However, producers and  landowners must navigate a complex and costly landscape in order to  access these markets.   The Growing Climate Solutions Act provides a framework for producers  to access technical assistance, guidance, and resources in these  emerging markets as they investigate whether to pursue this new  opportunity.   USDA certification of entities who will assist farmers in how best to  navigate these markets will improve market integrity and provide  farmers and ranchers more confidence as they take the first steps. The  information gathered by USDA through the certification process will  serve as a reliable resource to producers seeking to learn about both  the entities involved and the practices being implemented to generate  credits that are transacted in voluntary environmental credit markets.   These markets and the key players are evolving very quickly, and this  bill directs USDA to first assess the current state of voluntary  environmental credit markets because it is important that we all have  an understanding of the landscape first.   Further, this bill is farmer-friendly. It acknowledges that for  farmers and ranchers to be successful, there cannot be a one-size-fits- all approach. A corn farmer in Indiana, a cherry farmer in Michigan,  and a rice farmer in Arkansas have different soil types and varying  potential for carbon sequestration. So this bill recognizes the  diversity of agriculture and the practices that may be employed by  farmers. It provides educational resources for producers who decide  this new market opportunity works for their unique business model.   The bill ensures farmers comprise a majority on the USDA advisory  committee and protects the information farmers and ranchers share as  part of the program.   For these market to work, they must work for our farmers, foresters,  ranchers, and landowners. In order to do that, they must be at the  table. This bill provides our stakeholders that voice.   Finally, this bill epitomizes a great deal of bipartisan work, while  addressing the pressing needs of farmers, ranchers, and foresters. I  thank Senators Braun and Stabenow for helping us to make this the best  bill possible.   Many farmers and stakeholders are excited about this legislation, as  are many Members who cosponsored the bill and voted to report it out of  committee.   The bipartisan nature of the work of the committee was exciting to  see. We came together and accomplished something significant. I hope  this spirit of cooperation continues as Congress considers new policies  on climate change.   We need to ensure that any policies are farmer-friendly and farmer- focused, remain voluntarily, and avoid a one-size-fits-all approach.   Again, thank you to Chairwoman Stabenow and Senator Braun for their  efforts. I look forward to the debate and very much support the bill  through final passage.   With that, I yield to Senator Braun.    Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dan  Hendrix, who is retiring as president and chief executive officer of  the World Trade Center Arkansas and associate vice chancellor of the  Division of Economic Development at the University of Arkansas after a  remarkable career dedicated to economic growth in the Natural State.   Dan is a proud Arkansan who has spent his life demonstrating his  commitment to the State and developing opportunities to help businesses  grow and flourish. He learned the tools that helped him succeed at the  University of Arkansas and Arkansas State University, where he earned a  bachelor of science in business administration with minors in marketing  and management.   He started his career at ABF Freight System, where he established the  subsidiary Container Carrier Corporation to transport ocean containers  to and from major ports in the United States and throughout the world.  Under his guidance, the company expanded import and export operations  to U.S. ports of entry, and he served in several leadership positions  within the company. He brought his skills to an Oklahoma Transportation  Company in 1998.   In 2001, Dan joined the University of Arkansas and established the  Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations, where, among other  successes, he led efforts to raise more than $1 billion for the  university as part of the institution's Campaign for the Twenty-First  Century.   As president and CEO of World Trade Center Arkansas, Dan has used his  talent and experience to help connect businesses in the State with  international partners since its creation in 2007. His efforts have  resulted in significantly increased exports of Arkansas goods and job  growth. Today, businesses from all over Arkansas export products to  nearly 200 countries and support 350,000 jobs in the State.   During Dan's tenure as leader of the World Trade Center Arkansas, he  has also educated university students in global commerce through the  center's student intern program. The center has hosted dignitaries from  more than 50 countries and enhanced diplomatic relations between the  State of Arkansas and the United States with a variety of nations and  economic partners.   I applaud Dan for his outstanding leadership and accomplished career.  He has led a life of service and deserves our thanks for his military  service and vision for expanding Arkansas's footprint around the globe.  Dan is leaving a lasting legacy that will benefit future generations of  Arkansans. I have been honored to work with him, and I appreciate his  friendship. I know his wife Marilyn, children and grandchildren, who  are very proud of him, are looking forward to spending more time  together. I wish him the best on his retirement.                            ____________________
