 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 447.   Apprenticeships are well recognized as a way to help local economies  grow by providing career opportunities for young people. However, the  current national apprenticeship system does not adequately support the  creation of apprenticeships in the Marianas and other insular areas.  That inequity ends today.   H.R. 447 incorporates my bill, the Outlying Area Apprenticeship  Expansion Act, which I introduced in the last Congress. My bill  provides $2.5 million over 5 years for the Marianas to create and  expand apprenticeships, and it provides more than $11.2 million for the  insular areas in total.   Our island schools already equip students with the skills employers  seek. With these additional funds and participation in the national  apprenticeship program, we will be able to build that connection  between what was learned in the classroom and real-world work. With  widespread unemployment due to the coronavirus, that link is needed now  more than ever.   I thank Chairman Scott for including the outlying areas in this  program and for his work to update this law first enacted in 1937.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from the Association  of Woodworking and Furnishings Suppliers.                         [From AWFS, Jan. 29, 2021]       AWFS Stands in Support of National Apprenticeship Act of 2021         Anaheim, CA.--The Association of Woodworking and       Furnishings Suppliers (AWFS), a national       trade association for the wood industry and owner/operator of       the AWFSFair trade show, is in support of the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2021. AWFS has officially       signed on as a supporter of the Act.        ``Our industry, comprised primarily of small businesses, is       experiencing a skills gap,'' says AWFS Executive Vice       President Angelo Gangone. ``We need to utilize all tools and       resources available to us to attract and train new talent,       including apprenticeships.''        The expanded opportunities to Registered Apprenticeships,       youth apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeships made available       through the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 will help       small wood manufacturers who lack the capacity to create an       apprenticeship on their own. Congressman Robert Scott (D-VA-      3), Chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor       has introduced the bill (H.R. 447), an amendment of the       National Apprenticeship Act of 1937. According to Rep. Scott,       the Act ``will begin to bring America's investments in       apprenticeship more in line with countries around the world''       as ``our peer industrialized nations spend roughly six times       as much as a share of GDP on apprenticeships as the U.S.''        ``There are multiple successful U.S. apprenticeship models       comprised of companies collaborating together and with local       school and community partners.'' says Gangone. ``This is a       critical element that will help us solve the workforce gap       and strengthen our industry into the future.'' The Act's       encouragement for employers, industry associations, labor and       joint labor-management organizations, education and training       providers, credential providers, and apprentices to work       together to establish and expand apprenticeships will have a       meaningful impact on the skilled workforce and the future of       industry careers.
