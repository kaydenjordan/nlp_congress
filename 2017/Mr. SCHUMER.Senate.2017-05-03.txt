 Mr. President, a note on healthcare.   As the House Republican caucus continues their effort to revive  TrumpCare, I just want to remind my friends in the House of a few  things.   First, for all the significant changes House Republicans are  proposing to the bill, it would still cause premiums and deductibles to  rise, it will still jack up the costs on low-income and older  Americans, and, most importantly, it doesn't change a thing about the  24 million fewer Americans who would get healthcare. It may actually  increase that number, but it certainly will not decrease it.   Second, it is unwise and irresponsible to rush through a brandnew  bill without a new CBO score, without committee hearings, and without  any debate on the floor of the House. If this thing were so good, why  wouldn't there be open debate? Why wouldn't there be discussion? I  hope, if the bill gets to the Senate--I don't know if it will. I hope  it doesn't, but if it does, I hope we will not mimic the House, have no  committees, no hearings, no CBO score, not much debate. That would be  very wrong.   Third, even if the new version of TrumpCare passes the House--we hope  it doesn't--its chances for survival in the Senate are small. We don't  even know if the new version would survive under the rules of  reconciliation.   The amendment to allow States to drop preexisting condition  requirements, for instance, very possibly violates the Byrd rule. If  the moderate group in the House gets an additional amendment to deal  with the very same issue, that may violate the Byrd rule as well  because if Republicans try to throw money at their problem, as it has  been reported, they may end up violating the budget instructions to  reduce the deficit, and they will not even know if it does violate the  Byrd rule because, again, they will not have a CBO score.   As my friend, the Republican Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham,  said, talking about the TrumpCare bill, ``I just don't see how you  square the circle here. Some of the things the Freedom Caucus wants  probably won't make it through the Senate.''   The same is true for the group of moderates who are angling for more  changes to the bill right now.   The reality is, TrumpCare cannot pass the Senate. So to my moderate  Republican colleagues in the House, I ask: Why would you risk a ``yes''  vote for a bill that is devastating to your constituents and has  virtually a minuscule chance--probably no chance--of becoming law?   Now, we Democrats--as we have said time and time again to both the  President and to our Republican colleagues--are willing to work with  you on ways to improve the Affordable Care Act and our healthcare  system in general. Drop repeal, and then come talk to us about finding  a bipartisan way forward. We are always willing to work in a bipartisan  way, but, again, to repeat, ``bipartisan'' means talking to both sides  and taking things from both sides, not just throwing a bill down and  saying you have to support it. That is what bipartisanship is.                            ____________________     Mr. President, let me talk about the retirement CRA, the  vote that is coming before us quite soon.   So far this Congress, the Republican majority has passed 13 CRAs-- Congressional Review Act resolutions--all on party-line votes. Far from  being a major accomplishment, these CRAs just overturn rules passed at  the very end of the Obama administration. To make them a major  accomplishment of the first 100 days misreads what they are and  history, when compared to many other Presidents. Most of them, to boot,  even worse, rather than benefiting the American people, just benefit  large, wealthy, special interests--not just this one but just about all  of them. They are not for working people. They are not for middle-class  Americans. If there is some narrow special interest that doesn't like  it, then this Republican-led Congress goes along. It is not right. Let  me give a few examples.   The Republicans passed a CRA that removed protections for our waters  and streams from the harmful pollution that comes from the runoff of  mining sites. Why? Large mining companies wanted it. The American  people weren't crying out for it.   This Republican Congress passed a CRA that would make it easier for  the adjudicated mentally ill to purchase firearms--a priority of the  gun lobby, certainly not of the American people. They even passed a CRA  that allowed large oil, mining, and gas companies to make payments to  foreign governments--essentially bribes--without even having to  disclose them.   That is not the America we know. That is not the Shining City on the  Hill. That is not the lady in the harbor with a torch.   Today, the Republican majority is going to have a vote on another  CRA. This one may be the worst of all because it would block  initiatives by States to provide alternative retirement savings options  for millions of Americans. Is that because Americans are clamoring:  Take away my ability for retirement if my company doesn't give me one.  No, we haven't heard a peep about that. It is because the private  financial institutions--Wall Street--that manage retirement plans don't  want to see any competition from city or State retirement plans. This  is just another giveaway to the wealthy special interests that will  hurt working Americans who should have more low-cost choices when it  comes to their retirement.   We all know our Nation faces a serious retirement security problem.  Pensions, often a guarantee for large numbers of Americans, are  vanishing. New employers often don't provide pensions. Older employers'  pension plans are running low. People who used to feel, when they  retired, there would at least be something there so they could live  their final years in dignity, are worried, as they should be. Fifty- five million working Americans do not have a way for retirement to save  through their employer. That is nearly half--half--of all private  sector workers aged 18 to 64. It is a huge concern.   So what did the Obama administration do in its last few months?  Wisely, they said States could set up initiatives for employees to save  through their employers' payroll systems. The Obama administration  acted to allow States to pursue these initiatives by exempting them  from overreaching  [[Page S2690]]  Federal regulations and then provided necessary consumer protections.  That is what people want. Now, maybe some of these big financial  interests don't want it because the plans the States head up will be a  lot cheaper than the private sector plan, but we have to adapt to the  21st century. Any way we can help people with security in their golden  years with retirement savings, we should.   Here is another issue. We hear a lot from our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle about States' rights. This regulation doesn't force  the States to do it. It allows the States to do it. It gives them a  choice. This CRA vote would re-regulate the States.   My Republican friends--who spare no opportunity to decry regulation  and exhort States' rights--will impose a new regulation on States from  Washington. My Republican friends talk about increasing Americans'  freedom of choice in all sorts of matters. What about their choice in  terms of retirement, one of the most important things to the American  people. Middle-class incomes are squeezed in so many different  directions. It is harder to scrape and save for retirement when the  cost of college, medicine, and other essentials go up while take-home  pay is stagnant. It makes sense to give Americans a choice to start  saving earlier, at a lower cost, for retirement. That is why 23 State  Treasurers from States across the political spectrum--across Utah and  Kentucky, our two speakers before me--have written to their Senators  opposing this CRA. Red States and blue States alike want to pursue this  option. Polling shows that across party lines, 77 percent of voters  support State-facilitated retirement savings, but Republicans want to  block it. We haven't heard one good reason--one good reason. We know  the real reason. Financial institutions don't want competition,  particularly if it is a little cheaper for the worker.   Another example of special interests taking hold of the Republican  agenda: Almost every one of these CRAs has been at the behest of a  narrow special interest over the interests of working Americans.  Unfortunately, it is a metaphor for both the new Trump administration  and how our Republican colleagues are marching in lockstep to support  the wealthy--people doing great--over the middle class and working  people who need help.   President Trump promised over and over again in his campaign to stick  up for working Americans. He said he would be their voice and their  champion. Since he has taken office, President Trump sure hasn't  governed that way. He is pursuing policy after policy that would help  the wealthy and hurt the middle class, breaking promise after promise  after promise to working Americans. I ask him to veto this legislation.   Leader Pelosi and I are putting out a statement that asks just that.  Stand up for working people. There is no good argument against what the  Obama administration did. There is no good argument against letting  workers decide on their own volition that they want a retirement plan  and are willing to put some money into it.   This CRA is another test. If our President and our Republican  colleagues were truly a champion of working men and women, they  wouldn't support this resolution. If President Trump were truly a  champion of working men and women, he would veto this resolution. We  call on him to do so.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
