 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an American hero,  Mr. Dennis Wolfe, Sr. Recently, during this recess, I had the privilege  to visit the Vietnam War Museum in my district in Elmira, New York; the  first museum of its kind in America.   It was there that I had the distinct pleasure of meeting Denny Wolfe.  Denny's story is one of sacrifice, service, and unwavering dedication  to our great Nation.   He served with distinction in Vietnam as a helicopter crew chief with  the Army's First Air Cavalry Division during some of the most  challenging years of the war.   In those years, we lost thousands of our brave American heroes, and  Denny himself lost dear friends that he told me about.   His service to our country did not end when he returned home.  Instead, Denny chose to dedicate his life to preserving the legacy of  his fellow servicemembers and those that paid the ultimate price in  Vietnam.   He and many other patriots in that region founded the Vietnam War  Museum in Elmira. As its president, he has poured his heart and soul  into telling the stories of those who served.   Thank you, Denny, for your service, your unwavering commitment to  your fellow veterans, and your love for our country. You serve as an  inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
