 Madam Speaker, this week, our country lost a great  American, and I stand here today to remember a giant: General Colin  Powell.   He was a statesman who loved his country fiercely. He was a  trailblazer who served with love, integrity, and pride. He helped shape  American foreign and military policy for years. He believed public  service was the most important job in the world.   His leadership, full of honesty and listening, inspired generations.  He treated every person with dignity and respect. Until his dying day,  he opposed the fear and the hatred dividing this country. He believed  in America's promise, and he left that as his legacy. He stood on  principle and believed in the good of life.   Today, we remember his steadfast leadership, his commitment to  family, and his strong enduring presence.   Please join me in sending love and prayers to Alma and the Powell  family in the difficult times ahead.   I close with some of the General's own wisdom: ``The ties that bind  us together are far stronger than the occasional stresses that separate  us.''                            ____________________
