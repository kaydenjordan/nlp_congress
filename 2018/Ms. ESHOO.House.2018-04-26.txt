 Mr. Chairman, first, I want to acknowledge the hard work  that my colleagues Congresswoman Speier and Congressman Panetta have  done, along with myself, to address airplane noise in our Bay Area  congressional districts.   I am pleased to support Mr. Panetta's amendment to H.R. 4, which  requires the FAA to consider alternative metrics to the current average  day-night sound level standard, including actual noise sampling. This  will ensure that the FAA has an accurate measure of the noise in  communities surrounding airports and allow them to take steps to  mitigate it.    Since the FAA implemented NextGen in 2015, my Silicon Valley district  constituents have been consistently subjected to a higher volume of  noise complaints impacting their lives daily. I have never experienced  anything like this in 25 years of representation. It is unprecedented.  There is a 1,000 percent increase in noise complaints.   So this amendment is an important first step, and it is a first step  in alleviating the constant noise, consistent noise over our  congressional districts, and I am committed to working with the FAA and  the many engaged, really, hundreds and hundreds of engaged constituents  in my district until this issue is resolved.
