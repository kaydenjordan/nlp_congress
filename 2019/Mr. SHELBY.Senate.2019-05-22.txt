 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  Honorable T. Michael Putnam, who is formally stepping down from his 32- year term as a U.S. magistrate judge, effective on June 7, 2019. Judge  Putnam served the Northern District of Alabama as a magistrate and  chief magistrate judge during his many years of service to the court.  He is the longest serving magistrate judge in the history of the  [[Page S3053]]  Northern District of Alabama, and I certainly commend him for this  accomplishment. At the time of his appointment, Judge Putnam was the  youngest magistrate judge in the country at age 32.   Instrumental in the expansion of the role of magistrate judges, Judge  Putnam worked to highlight their value in the judicial process. He  acted as the chair and vice chair of the Northern District's Criminal  Justice Act Administrative Committee, playing a significant role in  ensuring the highest quality of representation of indigent criminal  defendants in the Northern District under the Criminal Justice Act.   Judge Putnam is widely known for his volunteer work at the Cumberland  School of Law in Birmingham, AL. He has taught a pretrial practice and  procedure class since 2006 and directed many trial advocacy and moot  court programs. The Cumberland School of Law named Judge Putnam the  2019 recipient of the Friend of the Law School Award in recognition of  his time and dedication to the betterment of students at Cumberland.  The Young Lawyers Section of the Birmingham Bar Association also  selected him for the Judge Drayton Nobles James Award in 2016, where  they honored his spirit of volunteerism.   As an advocate for the Northern District, Judge Putnam played an  active role in using technology to improve efficiency. He has been a  judicial resource for the Office of the Clerk while implementing  procedural changes to the electronic filing system. Judge Putnam led  the Court in establishing the eVoucher system, making it easier for  attorneys and courts to process vouchers for appointed counsel in  criminal cases.   Judge Putnam received his bachelor of arts from the University of  Alabama and his juris doctorate from the University of Alabama School  of Law. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class and was a Hugo  L. Black Scholar.   Judge Putnam's contributions to Alabama's judicial system are truly  remarkable and will have an impact for generations to come. I am proud  to take this time to recognize and thank him for his service to the  people of our great State and his unwavering commitment to the rule of  law. I join Judge Putnam's friends, family, and colleagues in wishing  him the best of luck as he transitions into a new chapter of his  life.                            ____________________
