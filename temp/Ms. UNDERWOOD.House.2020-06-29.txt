 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act.   Last June, I visited Kaylee Heap at her family's farm in Minooka,  Illinois. Mrs. Heap told me: It would be really nice to come home and  work on the farm with my husband and grow our business, but I can't do  that until we overcome the obstacle of getting quality, affordable  health insurance.   People like Kaylee are why I introduced legislation, the Healthcare  Affordability Act, to improve premium tax credits to make insurance  more affordable to more Americans, including those who don't currently  qualify for tax credits.   This legislation would reduce premiums by hundreds or thousands of  dollars for nearly 20 million Americans, and I am so pleased that it  was included in this bill today.   This bill delivers on our promise to ensure that all Americans have  access to quality, affordable healthcare. I urge all of my colleagues  to support this bill and join me in this effort.
