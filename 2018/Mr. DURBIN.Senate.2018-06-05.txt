Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, history is a great teacher, if you learn  your history. The history of the United States, when it comes to  refugees, is a checkered history.   Back during World War II, there were people who came to the borders  of the United States and begged for our mercy, begged for our help.  Nine hundred of them were on a ship called the SS St. Louis. They were  Jews who came from Europe seeking refuge in the United States from the  Nazis. Sadly, the United States turned them away. Several hundred of  them were forced back to Europe and died in the Holocaust. On the floor  of this U.S. Senate, a Democratic Senator from New York,  [[Page S2984]]  Robert Wagner, offered a measure to allow 10,000 Jewish children to  come to the United States during World War II and escape the  possibility of imprisonment and death during World War II in the  Holocaust. That measure was defeated on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  Those children were denied refuge in the United States.   Toward the end of the war, things started changing. Our policies  became more open. We started accepting more people, but the record had  been written. During the darkest days of World War II, the United  States virtually closed its borders to those who were trying to escape  Nazi terror.   After World War II, we decided we were wrong, that we had made a  mistake, and that the United States would demonstrate to the world that  we did care about those who came to the United States as refugees and  those who came from other countries seeking asylum. We wrote an amazing  history after World War II. When you think of the many different  nations that turned to us when they faced the worst circumstances  imaginable, you think about what happened in the United States.   The Cuban population escaping communism in Cuba, where did they come?  They came here, and you can still find them. You can find them all over  the United States but especially in Florida, near Miami, in New  Jersey--but everywhere. The Cuban Americans have made an amazing  contribution to this country. They came as refugees, but they became  real Americans. In fact, they love this country so much so that I  believe three of our Members of the U.S. Senate are Cuban Americans  today.   That is quite a story, but it is not the only story about refugees  coming to this country. You could add to that litany of people who came  the Vietnamese after the end of the war in Vietnam, the Soviet Jews who  escaped persecution in Russia to come to the United States, and the  list is long. It includes refugees from all over the world who came to  this country.   Now, we don't just open our doors and say: Walk in and make yourself  at home. We ask questions. We do background checks. We do everything we  can to be sure the person coming is the person they say they are and  that they will be safe for the United States.   Over the years, the number of refugees we accepted on an annual basis  went up to 80,000 and 100,000, and the United States developed an  international reputation--a reputation for caring for people who were  in the worst circumstances who came here looking for refuge. I run into  refugees, their families, their children, and their grandchildren every  single day. They have made a great contribution to our country, and we  have made a great model for the world when it comes to accepting people  who are in the worst, most terrifying circumstances.   That is about to change. We are in the process now of facing the  worst refugee crisis in the history of the world in so many different  places, and the United States, instead of maintaining this image and  this model of accepting refugees from other countries, under President  Donald Trump, has decided to do just the opposite. It would cut in half  the number of refugees we would clear, review, interrogate, and accept  in the United States each year to 45,000, which is the official number,  but in actuality only about 14,000 have been accepted so far in the few  months of this year. It is an indication we will not even reach 45,000.   There is something going on as well when it comes to those who seek  asylum or refuge in this country that is equally horrifying and  objectionable. The Trump administration has decided to discourage those  who would come to our borders looking for safety by telling mothers who  bring their infants and children that those children will be taken away  from them by the Government of the United States when they arrive at  our border. It is hard to imagine, but that is the stated policy now of  the Trump administration. It is a cruel policy. It is not a policy  consistent with American values.   Since our Nation's tragic failure during World War II to help Jewish  refugees fleeing Adolph Hitler, generations of Americans have tried to  set an example for the world by providing a safe haven to the world's  most vulnerable people. Now we face the worst refugee crisis in the  history of the world, with more than 65 million people around the world  displaced from their homes, but the Trump administration is admitting  the fewest refugees since World War II and going to extreme lengths to  prevent victims of war and terrorism from seeking asylum in the United  States.   So far this year, about 15,000 unaccompanied children have been  apprehended at our southwest border. This is not necessarily a crisis  in a nation of 325 million people, especially at a time when we are  asking friendly nations--our allies in the Middle East--to do much more  in accepting refugees.   The real crisis that gives cause to people showing up at our southern  border asking for asylum can be traced to three countries--Honduras, El  Salvador, and Guatemala--the so-called Northern Triangle. These  countries in Central America have among the highest homicide rates in  the world. Young girls face a constant threat of sexual violence with  little or no protection. That is why families are doing desperate  things, taking extraordinary risks to come to our border and ask for  protection. Is there any parent who would not do the same to save their  child?   How has the Trump administration responded to this refugee crisis on  our border? They are trying to discourage families from fleeing to our  borders by separating parents from their children. In March, we learned  in my office in Chicago about a 7-year-old girl and her mother who came  from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I have been there. It is a  land of terrible massacres, barbarism. It is a land of violence. The  Democratic Republic of the Congo had these two, a mother and daughter,  come to our shores. They were separated for 4 months--a 7-year-old girl  from her mother.   I asked the Department of Homeland Security inspector general to  investigate this. Why would we separate a 7-year-old girl from her mom  who is coming from the Congo seeking protection? Well, at the time, the  Trump administration said: We don't separate families. That was the  official statement at the time.   Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the  separation of children from their parents was a new ``zero tolerance''  approach, and now family separation has become the official policy of  the Government of the United States of America. In just the first 2  weeks of this policy under Attorney General Sessions, 658 children have  been impacted.   White House Chief of Staff John Kelly says separating families is ``a  tough deterrent'' to parents who are fleeing persecution, and he  dismissed any concerns because ``the children will be taken care of-- put into foster care or whatever.''   Well, our Nation's leading medical experts disagree. The American  Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association have  condemned this official policy of the Trump administration separating  families in immigration detention. Here is what the President of the  American Academy of Pediatrics said:         Separating children from their parents contradicts       everything we stand for as pediatricians--protecting and       promoting children's health. In fact, highly stressful       experiences, like family separation, can cause irreparable       harm, disrupting a child's brain architecture and affecting       his or her short- and long-term health. This type of       prolonged exposure to serious stress--known as toxic stress--      can carry lifelong consequences for these children.    The Trump administration has been taking some heat, deservedly, for  separating families. In typical fashion--no surprise--they have decided  the real cause of the problem would be the Democrats. Just this  morning, President Trump tweeted: ``Separating families at the Border  is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats,'' but the law  he is talking about wasn't passed by the Democrats. It is the  bipartisan Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which  was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and was signed into law  by Republican President George W. Bush. President Trump has his facts  wrong again.   This law has nothing to do with the separation of families. Instead,  it ensures the United States meets its international obligations to  protect unaccompanied children seeking safe haven in our country. It  was a response to concerns by Republicans and Democrats that children  apprehended by the  [[Page S2985]]  Border Patrol were being returned to countries where they might be  further persecuted or killed.   Under this law, unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle  countries I mentioned earlier are transferred to the Department of  Health and Human Services and placed in deportation proceedings, giving  them a chance to make their case to a judge as to why they are seeking  protection in America.   Consider ``Samuel'' and ``Amelie,'' who are siblings, ages 3 and 6,  from Honduras. They are 3 and 6. When they arrived in the United  States, they were traumatized and refused to speak. After months of  counseling, Amelie revealed that both children had been raped by drug  cartel members. Without the protection of this law which the President  condemned this morning, these children would have been returned to  Honduras and almost certain exploitation or death.   Two weeks ago, there was a hearing on unaccompanied children in the  Senate Immigration Subcommittee which I serve on as a ranking member.  We examined the administration's claim that the law the President  objects to is being exploited by gangs. Here is what we learned:   Unaccompanied children undergo multiple screenings and background  checks when they present themselves at the border, and the law gives  the government the authority to place any unaccompanied child in a  secure facility if there is any notion of a threat. Since the year  2012, 6 years ago, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection has processed  more than 250,000 unaccompanied children. Of those, how many were  confirmed or suspected of affiliation with the MS-13 gang that the  President talks about nonstop? Sixty. It was 60 out of 250,000--60 over  6 years, which is 10 a year, fewer than 1 a month. The President says  we have to separate these kids because of drug gang worries. I don't  want a single member of any gang anywhere admitted into this country,  period. For goodness' sake, 250,000 children and 60 over a 6-year  period were confirmed or suspected of affiliation with MS-13? Instead  of stoking fears, we should focus on preventing unaccompanied children  from being recruited by gangs.   Sadly, the Trump administration's budget is slashing funding for the  Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government agency that is  responsible for these important gang prevention efforts.   At our hearing, we also discussed the conditions in the Northern  Triangle countries in Central America that are driving families to flee  to our border. If people were migrating because of the so-called legal  loopholes, which we hear so often about from this administration, they  wouldn't be just coming from three countries; they would be coming from  all over the region, but we learned more than 90 percent of the  unaccompanied kids referred to the Department of Health and Human  Services are from three nations--the three of the Northern Triangle.   Instead of addressing the root causes that are driving migration from  these countries, the Trump administration is making the situation on  the ground worse. The administration's budget request for the region  would slash aid by more than one-third, and the administration is  terminating the temporary protected status for two of these countries-- El Salvador and Honduras, forcing many people to return to them even  though these countries are clearly unstable.   Last year, the administration also ended the Central American Minors  Program, which permitted children from the Northern Triangle to apply  for refugee resettlement from their home country. We said to mothers  with their babies and their infants: Don't make this dangerous journey.  If you are in danger in your home country and want to seek asylum or  refuge in the United States, make the application from where you are  before you have to make that journey. Unfortunately, that came to an  end with the administration's request to stop the program.   There are many issues to come before the American people but few that  have stoked emotions more than this issue. The notion that the United  States of America--over 300 million good and caring people--would make  it an official policy to separate these infants and toddlers and  children from their mothers and fathers is not American. It is extreme,  it is mean, and it is cruel. Sadly, it is the official policy--the so- called zero-tolerance policy that has been announced by Attorney  General Sessions.   We learned a bitter lesson back in World War II. We ignored the  realities of human suffering. People across the world asked: What is  going on in America? What are their values? After that war, we tried to  make it clear what we do stand for, the things that are clearly  important, and now this administration has decided we can no longer  afford to do that. We have to separate children from their mothers,  separate them by thousands of miles, put them into foster care, remove  them from their mothers, even if that parent qualifies for protection  here in the United States under our laws of asylum.   This is a sad and cruel policy. I hope Americans across the board  will stand up and speak up. We are a better Nation than this.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
