 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. Harry  Hafford of Masardis, ME, as he retires his gavel as chair at the  Northern Maine Veterans Cemetery. Harry is an extraordinary man, a  passionate community leader, an honorable veteran, and a friend to me  and my staff. Harry is special in so many ways and has quietly led  countless efforts to improve the lives of others. Aroostook County and  the entire State of Maine is a better place because of folks like Harry  Hafford.   Harry returned to his home town of Masardis, ME, to spend his  retirement years quietly after a long career at General Motors, where  he also served as a strong and steadfast union steward. This next  chapter of Harry's life seemed ideal for some much deserved rest and  relaxation, but that isn't who Harry is; instead he became an active  member of his community, continuing to serve our State and its people.  Harry went back to work serving others. Harry shared his lifelong love  of the beautiful natural resources in Maine by advocating for more  access to waterways and working with State and local officials to  provide additional boat landings in Ashland, Masardis, and Oxbow in  northern Aroostook County, including one that is named for him, so that  the public would have more access to the beautiful Aroostook River and  its native brook trout fisheries. He was a loyal member of the Ashland  Rotary Club and earned a Paul Harris Fellow for his service above self.  He is an active member of the Caribou American Legion, a moderator for  town meetings, a lifetime member of AMVets, Ashland and Presque Isle  Fish and Game Clubs, and Sportsman's Alliance of Maine.   Harry's honorable service in the U.S. Army is something I am very  appreciative of, but in addition, what is truly inspirational is the  dedication Harry has shown to veterans for all of his adult life,  especially in retirement. He was instrumental in creating and  sustaining a veteran's surplus clothing organization to ensure that the  needs of his fellow veterans were met. Perhaps his most notable and  impressive work was as a founding member of the Northern Maine Veterans  Cemetery Corporation, which developed the Maine Veterans Cemetery- Caribou. I was proud to be Governor of Maine when this effort began and  was pleased to sign the document creating the committee to determine  the cemetery's viability. Had I known Harry then as well as I do now, I  could have just looked for his name on the roster of volunteers and  been immediately assured of 100 percent success. Harry has chaired that  committee since its inception in 2003 and has decided to retire his  gavel at the end of 2018.   People like Harry are a rare breed. They give for the right reasons  and ask nothing in return. The entire State of Maine has benefited from  Harry's hard work for many years, and while we will miss him, we hope  that he can finally enjoy retirement the way it should be.                            ____________________
