 Mr. Speaker, on July 21, 2020, President Trump issued a  Presidential Memorandum to exclude undocumented immigrants from being  counted in reapportionment for Congress.   The Constitution explicitly requires an ``actual Enumeration'' of all  ``persons,'' imposing on the federal government the duty to count the  ``whole number of persons in each State.'' In other words, each  person--regardless of citizenship status--must be counted. President  Trump's plan to prohibit undocumented immigrants from being counted in  the apportionment of Congressional seats, violates the plain text of  both the Constitution and the governing statutes.   I submitted an amendment to H.R. 7617 to block this effort by  prohibiting the use of any and all federal funds to implement,  administer, or enforce this Presidential Memorandum. Although this  memorandum is unconstitutional, my amendment would end any confusion  caused by the President, and avoid costly litigation.   Mr. Speaker, immigrants have always been America's strength, and  during the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen how so many immigrants have  put themselves on the front lines to help combat the coronavirus. They  have made enormous sacrifices, working tirelessly to provide the  critical services we need and depend on. Immigrants are part of the  fabric of our nation, and we shall not allow them to be kicked to the  curb by this President.
