 Mr. President, judges are making decisions around the  country right now on voting rights, on civil rights, on women's rights,  on LGBTQ rights, decisions that could limit those rights not just for a  year or for a decade but for a generation. They make decisions on  healthcare; they make decisions on sentencing; and they make decisions  on corporate power. We have seen judge after judge, especially on the  Supreme Court, put their thumbs on the scales of justice by favoring  corporations over workers, by favoring Wall Street over consumers, and  by favoring health insurance companies over patients. That is,  fundamentally, why we in Ohio cannot afford to have Chad Readler on the  bench.   Look at an op-ed he took upon himself to write as a private citizen,  which reads we should allow the execution of 16-year-olds--kids,  children who are 16 years old.   This is at a time when we are taking important, bipartisan steps  forward on sentencing reform, and this Senate doesn't come together  very often. This Senate, under Senator McConnell's leadership, actually  came together in a bipartisan way. After all of the mostly unworkable  pieces of legislation he has written that always help the rich, the  President of the United States signed a bill, in this case, in which we  did the right thing by taking bipartisan steps forward on sentencing  reform.   How do you turn around and put someone on the bench for life who  supports executing children? That is what a 16-year-old is--still a  teenager, still a child under the law. Yet he thinks it is something we  should do--execute children who are found guilty.   During his nomination hearing, it was pretty unbelievable that  Readler stood by his op-ed and refused to disavow his support for using  the death penalty on high schoolers and, possibly, on even younger  children. I guess I give him credit for consistency.   His record on voting rights is equally despicable. He worked on  behalf of a far-right group and argued for the elimination of Golden  Week, something passed by Republicans that had been in effect for more  than a decade, which means he was limiting the amount of time people  can vote early, and he defended restrictive voter ID and provisional  ballot laws. We know exactly whom those laws target--people of color,  the elderly, young voters. They are the same people, in many cases, who  face literacy tests and poll taxes. They are the people   John Lewis  and the foot soldiers of Selma were marching for 54 years ago tomorrow  across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.   It is shameful that, half a century later, we are fighting that same  fight. Chad Readler again is on the wrong side. We can't afford another  judge on the bench who works to undo Selma's legacy.   We can't afford another judge who has made it his mission to take  away Americans' healthcare. Chad Readler's work threatens the  healthcare coverage of 20 million Americans who have preexisting  conditions. Last summer, Readler did what three career attorneys with  the Department of Justice refused to do. He filed a brief that  challenged the law that protects Americans with preexisting conditions.  He filed a brief nobody else was willing to file. They all recused  themselves. They all refused to do it. They thought it was  [[Page S1675]]  something improper and unconstitutional. One of them, I believe,  resigned.   Do you know what happened then? The next day, he was nominated for  this very judgeship.   So the message is loud and clear from the administration: If you go  after preexisting conditions under consumer protections, if you attack  workers' rights, if you attack voters' rights within any job you hold-- and there is a real incentive to do this from this administration--you  may get a good, lifetime Federal judgeship. The arguments he made in  his brief were unprecedented. As I said, three attorneys withdrew from  the case. One resigned altogether in his objections to the Department  of Justice's unprecedented actions.   One of our Republican colleagues, Senator Alexander, who works with  Senator Murray to run the HELP Committee, called Readler's argument as  farfetched--Senator Alexander's words, who is a conservative Republican  from Tennessee--as he had ever seen. Yet, in December, a partisan Texas  judge decided to go along with Readler's opinion, and he handed down  the decision that undermines preexisting condition protections for all  Americans.   Right now, judges are deciding the future of Americans' healthcare  every day. We can't afford to put another extremist--and he is way out  of the mainstream--in my increasingly conservative, Republican State.  He is way out of the mainstream among lawyers, way out of the  mainstream among judges, and way out of the mainstream as a citizen. We  can't afford to put another extreme judge on the court who will not  defend Americans' right to healthcare.    We know there have been a number of times this body has refused to  take away the consumer protections for preexisting conditions. We  remember the vote late at night when we defeated the repeal of the  Affordable Care Act. We know that all kinds of Republican candidates  who were victorious went on television and said they were going to  defend the consumer protections for preexisting conditions. We heard  that over and over.   Why did we hear that? Even though that was not their position a few  months earlier, in the cases of a lot of them, we heard it because they  knew how popular it was and how much the public cared about the  consumer protections for preexisting conditions. In a moment, I am  going to share some letters from Ohioans who make the point that even  though, this year, Republican candidates thought it was all OK to say  we are going to preserve preexisting conditions, a vote for Judge  Readler is exactly the opposite.   Don't go home and say you support consumer protections for  preexisting conditions and then vote for a judge who has a history of  wanting to take that right away and who will now have a lifetime  appointment and get another chance to likely take away the protections  for preexisting conditions.   Let me share a few letters from people.   A man from Sandusky wrote to me about how the marketplaces that were  created by the Affordable Care Act helped him to start his own business  because he had a way to purchase insurance. He was later diagnosed with  lung cancer. He wrote: ``I am watching the dismantling of the only  program available to me with a pre-existing condition that I can  afford. I am devastated.''   I don't know what Mr. Readler thinks when he reads something like  that, but let me give another example.   A woman from Cleveland writes:         Protect real health care coverage for all people with pre-      existing conditions. Real people's lives depend on it. My       husband's life depends on it.    Chad Readler wants to be a judge. Chad Readler did the President's  bidding and the insurance industry's bidding at the Department of  Justice. I don't know if he knows these people exist, like the woman  from Cleveland or the man from Sandusky. I hope Chad Readler would have  gone out and, as President Lincoln said, gotten his public opinion  badge by actually listening to how the decisions he makes affect real  people.   A woman from Chagrin Falls, which is a fairly wealthy suburb of  Cleveland, wrote:         I've been a cancer patient since 2011. If pre-existing       conditions are no longer covered, I--along with countless       others--will probably be screwed.    A mother from Waynesville, OH, wrote:         My family has lived every day worrying about the ACA being       dismantled. We have a son who was born with a neurological       condition before the ACA.        We lived in constant fear of medical caps and pre-existing       conditions.    Just putting Chad Readler on the bench increases people's anxiety. Is  Congress going to take away the Affordable Care Act? Is Congress going  to wipe away those protections for preexisting conditions? If Congress  isn't, are judges going to do that? No wonder people are so anxious  about that.   A woman from Fairborn writes:         I previously lost health insurance from a possible       preexisting condition and now, being a 2-time cancer       survivor, I'm scared of losing coverage again.        The security of having insurance since the ACA allowed me       to sleep at night and focus on my health.    My editorial comment on her comments is to focus on her health, not  on whether she loses her coverage.         It is unimaginable that politicians want to deny so many       Americans access to health insurance and quality of life.    Senator Murray and I sat and watched a bunch of mostly men on the  other side of the aisle cast their votes--all who had good health  insurance--to take away insurance for millions of Americans and for  hundreds of thousands in my State and to take away their consumer  protections for preexisting conditions.   A mother from New Albany writes:         My daughter had two autoimmune diseases by the age of 6--      SIX. That means her entire life she will be a ``preexisting       condition.'' But she isn't just a label. She is a person.       Please protect my baby. She already deals with enough.    I mean, hear the passion in that letter, the strong feelings in that  letter, the cries for help in that letter. Yet this body may be about  to put on the Sixth Circuit, in a lifetime appointment, someone who  clearly doesn't care about people like them.   Another woman from Hillsboro writes:         We are a family of pre-existing conditions and survive       because we have insurance that we can afford. My husband       works long, hard hours and has to work 60 hours a week for us       to make it. I'm a teacher. I work about 18 out of 24 hours a       day but make $40,000 a year. We can't work any more than we       already do.    Again, these are people who are working hard and who are doing  everything right. They didn't ask to be sick. They didn't ask for their  healthcare costs to go up. Are we going to put somebody on the court  who wants to take away the consumer protections for people like this  lady from Hillsboro?   These Americans work hard. They pay their premiums. Many of them deal  with all that comes with caring for a child or a family member who has  a chronic condition. How can Members of Congress and how can this  President--all who have good insurance paid for by the taxpayers--stand  by and allow activist, partisan judges to dismantle these protections  that Americans rely on?   It is bad enough that so many Members of Congress want to take away  these consumer protections. Now it is unelected judges the American  public really doesn't know, and this body is about to put one more of  them on the court, even more extreme and younger than so many other of  these judges.   We can't afford another judge on the courts who will vote to take  away Americans' healthcare, who will vote to take away Americans'  voting rights, who will vote to take away Americans' civil rights.   I ask my colleagues to vote no on Chad Readler for the Sixth Circuit.    Mr. President, I rise to speak on the judicial nomination  coming up and the cloture vote on the other nominee.   With both nominees, I offered the White House cooperation to choose  two more moderate nominees for Ohio, both of whom had been vetted by a  bipartisan commission Senator Portman and I had, and the White House  said they would rather pick these two extremist judges--these two  young, far-right judges who have attacked America's healthcare and have  attacked the consumer protection on preexisting condition.   Judges are making decisions right now--in this body, fortunately, as  Members of the Senate, we all have good coverage and health insurance-- that try to take insurance away from millions of Americans and several  thousands in my State, even as they have tried to eliminate the  consumer protections for those people who have preexisting conditions.  There are millions of Americans who are anxious about holding onto  their insurance because they get sick a lot and it is expensive to take  care of them. They are afraid of having their insurance canceled, and  they can't get insurance because of a preexisting condition, and this  Congress tried to repeal that law and it failed.   Now, Senator McConnell has turned to the Federal Judiciary, and the  President of the United States seems to think the only way to eliminate  the consumer protection for those with preexisting conditions is  through the Judiciary. Judges are making decisions right now on voting  rights, on civil rights, on women's rights, LGBT rights, on healthcare,  on sentencing, and on corporate power--decisions that could limit those  rights for a generation.   We know that the Federal Judiciary already puts its thumb on the  scales of justice to support corporations over workers, to support Wall  Street over consumers, and to support insurance companies over  patients. We know that the Federal Judiciary and the Supreme Court have  done that dozens of times. We know that the Federal Judiciary,  increasingly, is looking like a group of far-right, young, detached  people who never go out and get their public opinion pass, as Lincoln  said. They never consider what the public wants in this country.   Chad Readler, the nominee whom we will vote on in a moment, took it  upon himself as a Jones Day lawyer--one of the greatest law firms in  the country, headquartered in Cleveland--to write an op-ed as a private  citizen saying we should allow the execution of 16-year-olds. He  actually wasn't that specific. He implied it could be even younger than  that. He said we would allow the execution of teenagers. At a time when  this body--something we should be proud of--took important bipartisan  steps forward on sentencing reform that was supported by the White  House, supported by a lot of Republicans, and supported by virtually  all Democrats, how do we turn around and put someone on the bench for  life who supports executing children? How does that compute? How we can  do that?   He argued on behalf of the far-right think tank for the elimination  of ``Golden Week'' in Ohio, a period where people can vote early. They  can register and vote early. It was passed by a Republican legislature.  It has bipartisan support, but not by this rightwing nominee who thinks  it is OK to eliminate people's right to vote and restrict it. He  defended restrictive voter ID. He defended the squeezing of provisional  ballot laws.   On the eve of the 54th anniversary tomorrow of Bloody Sunday in  Selma, AL, it is shameful to put on the bench another judge who will  rubberstamp modern-day literacy tests and poll taxes. Fundamentally, it  is the same purpose. You find ways to suppress the vote. You find ways  to take people's voting rights away. You find ways to disqualify people  who want to vote.   Chad Readler's record on healthcare is clear. He has been a  ringleader in the Republican effort to take away the protections on  preexisting conditions for all Americans. He wrote the White House's  brief. We all know that now. He wrote a brief that nobody else above  him at the Justice Department was willing to do. Three people refused  to write it. One actually resigned. The next day, he was rewarded by  this lifetime appointment as a Sixth Circuit Federal judge. Remember  that. The White House rewarded him after suggesting that we block the  consumer protections for preexisting conditions for millions of  Americans and for hundreds of thousands in Virginia, Arkansas, and in  Ohio. Millions of Americans would lose their consumer protections under  his views, and the next day the White House decided to reward him with  a judgeship.   As I said, three career attorneys withdrew from the case. One  resigned altogether in objection to doing this. Senator Alexander, our  friend from Tennessee, who sits near where Senator Kaine is sitting,  said this was just amazingly awful language that Chad Readler had  suggested.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an  additional 2 minutes.    Mr. President, judges are deciding the future of America's  healthcare right now, the right to vote right now, civil rights right  now, LGBTQ rights right now, women's rights right now. Judges around  the country are deciding that. We can't afford to put another out-of- the-mainstream judge on the court--and he is clearly out of the  mainstream among Ohio lawyers, among Ohio judges, among Ohio citizens-- who will not defend America's right to healthcare.   I ask my colleagues to think about the families you promised to vote  for. If any of you in your campaigns, if any of you in discussions you  have had with your constituents, if any of you in your public  statements, and if any of you running for office committed that you  would support consumer protections for preexisting conditions, the only  way you can prove you actually believe that is by voting no on Chad  Readler in about 1 minute from now. If you really believe in preserving  preexisting condition consumer protections so you don't see in your  State--in Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, and Ohio--millions of  Americans lose their insurance, then your only way to support what you  promise is to vote no on Chad Readler.   I yield the floor.
