 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of our  Nation's veterans struggling with PTSD and their family members anxious  for help.   This week, I spoke with the mother of a young man who joined the  Marines out of patriotic duty following 9/11. He served four tours.   His mother told me that when he came home, he was a changed man  struggling with PTSD.   She took him to the VA when he said he was contemplating suicide. She  was told all the beds were full; they couldn't help.   He was later denied extended treatment at an inpatient facility after  he began self-medicating. A year-and-a-half ago, he died of an  overdose.   We have to do better. The VA needs more and better addiction and  mental health resources. This young man's mother said to me, after  losing her son, she is in the fight now. I am, too, and I hope you will  join me.                            ____________________
