 Mr. Speaker, 15,208.   15,208: That is how many Americans lost their lives to gun violence  in this country last year.   For each life lost, there is a compounding grief of the friends, the  parents, the children, the spouses, the loved ones, survivors whose  lives are forever altered, forever shattered by this preventable public  health crisis.   At the current rates of gun violence, nearly every American will know  at  [[Page H855]]  least one victim of gun violence in their lifetime. Imagine who that  might be in your own life.   344: That is the number of days that have gone by since House  Democrats passed not one but two safety bills to help bring an end to  senseless suffering. For 344 days, both of these bills have been met by  Mitch McConnell's wall of obstruction. These are bipartisan bills that  are also supported by 90 percent of Americans across political  ideology, and they require immediate action.   Senator McConnell, your complacency is lethal. Every day you fail to  act is another day that more Americans suffer loss. Stop the silence.  Start doing your job, and change the course of gun violence in this  country.
