 Madam President, it is the 21st of December, and we       don't have information from the Department of Homeland Security on how       many people illegally crossed our border in November. What is       interesting about that is, Jeh Johnson, when he was the director,       talked openly and often about how often he got a report of how many       people had illegally crossed the border. In fact, he said, when he was       the director of DHS, that every single morning he got a report of how       many people illegally crossed the border the day before. They knew to       the day.        I have been to a facility here in Washington, DC, where they can       actually track to the hour how many people have illegally crossed our       border every single hour of the day, 365 days a year. But it is the       21st of December, and we have requested how many people have illegally       crossed the border in the month of November, and they said they are       still working on it.        Let me just tell you why that is relevant: because the Department of       Homeland Security is in full-on chaos mode trying to figure out how to       be able to manage thousands and thousands of people illegally crossing       our border not yearly, not monthly, daily now--daily.        Jeh Johnson, when he was at Homeland Security under the Obama       administration, said he knew it was going to be a very bad day when a       thousand people crossed the border illegally the day before.        Best guess, over the last 24 hours, 9,000 people illegally crossed       our border in the last 24 hours. I couldn't tell you that exactly,       though the Secretary does know because they keep records to the hour.       But they won't let Congress know that because they don't want the       American people to know what is really happening on the border right       now. So they are hiding facts.        The hard part is, they can't hide the facts because even the       Washington Post is down on the border now looking at what is going on       at the southern border and saying: That is chaos.        It is not an accident. It was by design, and it was by design over       several policy issues. The first of which is that, in the first days of       the Biden administration, they said: We are setting aside what is       called title 42 authority. That was a temporary authority, during the       pandemic, to say that individuals who            [[Page S9749]]            are requesting asylum can't just automatically come into the country;       we were turning them away.        Now, that was designed to be a temporary authority, and everyone knew       it. And so that is the reason I have asked, for over a year, of the       Secretary: What is the plan when title 42 authority goes away? And what       I was told was, as recently as early this year: Oh, we have a six-point       plan. In fact, not only do we have a six-point plan; we have already       started that six-point plan.        Just weeks ago, I asked the Secretary again: What is the plan when       title 42 authority goes away, because it will go away the 1st of       December? And I got the same response again: We have a six-point plan.        But on their six-point plan that they are carrying out, they have       continued to see the rapid rise in the number of people illegally       crossing our border every day. It used to be 1,000. And then it was       2,000. And then it was 3,000. And then it jumped to 5,000. And then it       jumped to 7,000. And now it is up to 8 or 9,000 every day.        Again, to put it in perspective, what is going on at our southern       border, even before the title 42 authority goes away--to put this in       perspective, during the Obama administration, the big year of the       largest surge that happened on our southern border during the Obama       administration was that just over half a million people illegally       crossed that year.        The best we can tell, we have had half a million people illegally       cross our border in the last 2 months. This is full-on crisis.        So what is happening with it? Of the 2 million people that have       illegally crossed our border in the last year, somewhere around 700,000       of those folks were turned around under title 42 authority. Many of       them were single males who were coming into the country who were turned       around. So of the approximately 2 million, approximately 700,000 were       turned away.        This administration has asked for the courts to take away title 42       authority and to say we are going to ignore that, and we are just going       to process everyone under what they call title 8 authority.        Let me clarify what that means. Title 8 authority is the issue of       processing people in the normal structure. But what is happening right       now with title 8 authority under this administration? Well, two things.       One is, they have said we are putting people under expedited--      expedited--process. Well, that sounds great. And it is a great little       title in the media to say: Oh, they are in expedited removal hearings.       Except, when you look at this administration, they have actually       removed 7 percent of the people whom they put under expedited removal.       So they are basically giving them a title of expedited removal but not       actually removing them.        Of the 1.3 million people who have illegally crossed our border in       just the past year who were allowed to be able to come into our country       under title 8 authority, 1.3 million people have come into the country.       ICE, whose budget has been cut and their purpose has been repurposed,       used to be for prosecuting individuals to be able to move out of the       country. Now ICE has been repurposed, and they are actually processing       paperwork of individuals in the country illegally. It used to be that       they were processing out. Now they are processing in. So 1.3 million       people have crossed our border illegally. Less than 70,000 people have       actually been deported this year. That is a record low number of people       that have actually been deported.        The chaos continues on our southern border. And for whatever reason,       this administration chooses not to care.        I have asked the Secretary how many of the individuals have had       criminal vetting from their country of origin, and his answer was: I       will get back to you on that. He knows the same answer that I do. The       answer is zero.        The American people believe there is some kind of vetting happening       coming across the border. There is not. They are checked to see if they       are on the terror watch list. They are checked to see if they have       committed a crime in the United States. But we literally don't know       individuals crossing the border from over 150 countries so far this       year--we literally don't know if they are fleeing poverty or fleeing       justice. We have no idea because no one is checking. They are just       ushered into the country.        Now they are given expedited removal, which we know now is not       actually removal, or, worse yet, the vast majority of those individuals       are given what is called parole. Why? Because parole is faster. They       can actually process people into the country quicker if they parole       them. The only thing about parole is, they actually get a work permit       the first day that they are in the United States.        Help me understand this. The current policy of the Biden       administration--they say they are trying to stop illegal immigration,       but they are actually paroling people into the country as fast as they       can, giving people a work permit the first day they are actually here,       and then they are setting them up for a hearing with ICE to process       them in. The backlog with ICE now is 5 years long, so it is 5 years       until they get that done and then 10 years after that for the next       time. So they are currently up to 15 years that they are in the country       with a work permit.        Why is title 42 such a big issue? Because title 42 is at least       turning away about 40 percent of the folks who are at the border. Once       that goes away, everyone comes in, and this accelerates even more. The       best evidence that we have at this point is there are tens of thousands       of people just south of the border right now waiting for title 42       authority to go away because they have been turned away in the past,       and they are rapidly coming in now, just waiting on the courts to be       able to turn this off.        Currently, no one seems to care. The Biden administration has become       the administration of chaos on the border. The American people see it       plainly. I have to tell you, the American people are not opposed to       legal immigration, but they do not like this chaos.        As much as the administration can say: We are just not going to tell       you the numbers, or as much as this Senate has just refused to do       hearings on this matter, we are still at the same spot. Tens of       thousands of people are illegally crossing our border in record-high       numbers, and there seems to be no deterrent to that.        So I come to this floor with two requests. The first of that is to       keep title 42 in place. I have had a bipartisan bill that has been out       there since April of this year asking a very simple question: Maintain       the title 42 authority. Give that tool to the Secretary to be able to       at least turn away individuals who are illegally coming into the       country, to be able to say to those individuals: You do not have a       standard for asylum here. Turn those folks away. Stop the massive flow       that is coming into our country on at least that level. Don't make a       terrible situation even worse.        This bill has broad support. This is a bill that will actually help       this administration to enforce the law and to decrease the chaos on our       southern border. It is not a radical idea; it is a straightforward idea       to say that if we are interested in securing the border, this is a way       to do that.        (Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.)        Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,       Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration       of S. 4036 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I       further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed       and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the       table.         Mr. President, if we are going to object to maintaining       the title 42 authority, which has been widely used, then I would ask       for something else that the administration is considering.        The administration has gone back and forth in consideration on what       is called a transit ban for asylum; that is, for individuals who are       coming to our country right now from 150 different countries, literally       flying in on an aircraft, hopping to several different countries they       go to and landing in Mexico, and then the cartels shuttle them to the       border. They show up with luggage. If you don't believe me, there are       lots of video of it, of people from all over the world who are coming.            [[Page S9750]]              The administration has considered a transit ban to say that you can't       fly to four different countries and land here and walk in and say: I       need asylum here. That is not asylum; that is economic opportunity.       There is a visa process for that. The administration is considering a       transit ban to say you can't go through multiple countries and then       show up in the United States and say: Now I want asylum.        I have a bill that deals with this. Quite frankly, it is a       straightforward policy that multiple other countries around the world       also have. This policy will help our administration to enforce the       border and give the tools to the Border Patrol to make decisions along       the border that actually help protect the safety of our Nation.        The current process, let me remind you, is thousands of people       literally being paroled into our country, saying: Fifteen years from       now, we will figure out what to do with you. That is the current       process, which is incentivizing illegal immigration. It doesn't slow       down. This is not a matter of, it is going to one day get better. We       are the greatest Nation on Earth. There are billions of people who want       to be able to come here. So this is a simple, straightforward way to be       able to deal with that, and it is the transit issue, to be able to       resolve that issue for asylum.        Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the       immediate consideration of S. 5350, which is at the desk. I further ask       that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the       motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.         Mr. President, this body is wearing what is happening       on the border right now. I know a lot of the national media decides       they are going to look away and say it is no big deal, but I am telling       you, more and more reporters, even on the far left, are looking at what       is happening on the border and saying this is an out-of-control       humanitarian crisis. If this body keeps ignoring that, America is going       to continue to suffer.        May I remind you, this is the Department of Homeland Security. What       is more basic than actually securing our borders? Please don't tell me       this is not possible under current law. Four times as many people have       illegally crossed this border that happened under the Obama       administration--four times as many. It can be done. They are just       choosing not to. That lays on this body as well.        I yield the floor.
