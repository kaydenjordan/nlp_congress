 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Walorski, Jackie, if  I may, for her leadership and showing courage on this important topic.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act protects the lives  of babies who survive abortions by requiring the healthcare  practitioner to save the life of the baby. Sounds pretty much like  common sense, doesn't it?   I am a proud cosponsor of Ms. Ann Wagner's bill fighting for the  sanctity of life.   As a former pastor, I value each and every life that is brought into  this world, and that is why it is imperative that we pass this  legislation and put an end to the senseless murders of innocent babies.   Earlier this week, I asked for unanimous consent, before being  gaveled out, to bring the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act  to the House floor for a vote. Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues  put their party leadership and affiliation over voting for what is  morally right.   The statistics are staggering. In just looking at a few States, we  found 25 children that were born alive that survived a botched abortion  just in 2017. It is concerning to think how much higher those numbers  would be if we looked throughout the entire country.   Simply put, I stand with 80 percent of Americans who support  legislation to protect the life of a baby who survives a failed  abortion.   At a time when States like New York and Virginia are matching  abortion laws of North Korea in making it easier to perform abortions  until the birth of a child, it is absolutely necessary for us to stand  in unity and fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.
