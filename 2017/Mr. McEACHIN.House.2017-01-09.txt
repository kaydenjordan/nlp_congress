 I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for organizing  this hour today.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today because I believe that confirming  Jeff Sessions as Attorney General for the United States would  jeopardize the progress we have made for equal rights and against  discrimination.   Mr. Speaker, it is an affront to common sense to confirm someone who  has criticized the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and believes that this  landmark law, which provides all Americans with the right to cast a  ballot for candidates in our democratic process, is intrusive. It is an  affront to common sense, Mr. Speaker, to confirm a nominee who views an  old advertisement calling for the death penalty of people who are later  exonerated as a mark of conservatism.   Mr. Speaker, it is an affront to common sense to confirm someone who  was previously rejected as a choice for a Federal judgeship to lead a  Department that, in part, vets future Federal judges. It is an affront  to common sense, Mr. Speaker, to confirm someone who does not believe  in justice for all to lead the Department of Justice.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this nominee would not act in the best  interest of all Americans, regardless of color, gender, country of  origin, sexual orientation, or economic status. Mr. Speaker, it is my  fervent hope that the Senate of the United States will deny the  confirmation of this nominee.
