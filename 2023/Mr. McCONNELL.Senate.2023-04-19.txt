 Mr. President, we are 2 years into the latest chapter  of Washington Democrats' war against our own domestic energy. America  spent decades working toward affordable, reliable energy independence,  and Democrats have tried to reverse it all, turned it all around: less  exploration for American oil and gas, more dependence on immoral  Chinese supply chains. Even as the left wants Big Government to gamble  our whole grid on less reliable new technologies, they don't even want  to let us mine here in America on our own soil for the rare earth  minerals those technologies actually require.   The Democrats have fundamentally misunderstood both the economics and  the geopolitics of American energy. So the result is going to be fewer  jobs for our workers, bigger bills for our families, less security for  our country, and more vulnerability to foreign actors who don't like  us.   Just last week, the Biden EPA announced it will try to slap a radical  and unprecedented new mandate on our country regarding electric  vehicles. The same people who can't handle inflation and can't secure  our border want to stick their noses into Americans' garages and our  driveways. The administration's radical plan would cut down the  marketplace of affordable and reliable vehicles that most Americans  actually want to drive. It would massively increase demand on already  highly taxed electrical grids with no workable plan to grow capacity,  and it would force rich liberals' lifestyle choices onto the whole  country.   Good luck--good luck farmers, ranchers, rural Americans. California  wants to dictate what you drive. See, California is the proving ground  for these bad ideas. They have already set their own punitive targets  for electric vehicle sales, and--surprise--the math actually doesn't  work. At the same time Governor Newsom is mandating his citizens buy  electric vehicles, he is telling people not to plug them in--don't plug  them in--for fear of blackouts.   California expects to see 15 times more electric vehicles on the  roads and on their electrical grid by 2035--the same California that  already had to spend last summer begging citizens to turn down their  air-conditioning because their grid can barely survive as it is right  now.   Democrats want less American energy, less production, and, of course,  less reliability. Republicans want more, more, and more--more  production, more independence, more affordability, and more security.   The House Republican majority's landmark H.R. 1 goes right at this  very issue. It would be a huge shot in the arm for American energy. But  here in the Senate, the Democratic leader controls the floor, and he  has declared the bill ``dead on arrival''--dead on arrival here in the  Senate.   It is the clearest possible contrast. Republicans are fighting for  cheaper and more reliable power, stronger supply chains, and a stronger  America on the world stage; and Democrats, they are actually fighting  us.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Alabama (Mrs. Britt) and the Senator from Arkansas (Mr.  Cotton).   The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 49, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 91 Leg.]                                  YEAS--47       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski      Paul      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--49       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--4       Britt      Cotton      Feinstein      Whitehouse
