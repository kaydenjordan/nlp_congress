 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 151, the Pallone- Thune TRACED Act.   Robocalls are an epidemic and anyone with a phone knows this. I hear  from my constituents daily about robocalls, and I know all of  [[Page H9245]]  my colleagues do as well. Just last month Americans received a near  record of 5.5 billion robocalls. I'm subjected to this harassment and  so are my colleagues.   These calls are highly annoying, but they are also used to scam and  swindle people. Last year, an estimated 43 million Americans were  scammed out of $10.5 billion.   The American people are demanding that Congress take action to combat  this national nuisance and today the House will deliver a victory for  them. I'm proud that this bipartisan, bicameral agreement will put a  real dent in our robocall problem.   We know that no one bill can completely solve such a complex problem,  and it's why the FCC and Congress must remain vigilant to ensure  statutory and regulatory protections are sufficient to protect  consumers.   This legislation will bring relief to millions of Americans, so let's  pass it and get it signed into law pronto.
