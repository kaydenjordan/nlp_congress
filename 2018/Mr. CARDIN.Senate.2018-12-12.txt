 Thank you, Mr. President.   I take this time to support the passage of S.J. Res. 54. I commend my  colleagues who have brought this resolution forward. The impact of this  resolution would be to end the U.S. military engagement in Yemen, and I  believe that military engagement should end for several reasons.   First, let me comment on what others have already pointed out, and  that is that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is one of the worst, if  not the worst, in the world. That is saying a lot because there are a  lot of areas around the world where we are seeing humanitarian  challenges.   In Yemen today, 10,000 people have been killed due to the war, and 22  million-plus--75 percent of the population in Yemen--are at grave risk  today. It is estimated that there are 400,000 children under the age of  5 who are at the risk of starvation due to hunger and malnutrition, and  85,000 children have died, according to Save the Children, from  starvation.   The U.S. military engagement has really not assisted in ending this  humanitarian crisis. There are 1 million people with cholera and 8.4  million people on the verge of famine. For a long time, we have been,  focused on the Port of Hodeidah, saying that it had to be opened in  order to be able to deliver humanitarian assistance. I think many of us  thought that because of our military involvement in Yemen, at a  minimum, we could get the port open. We find we are not able to have  safe routes for the delivery of humanitarian assistance, so through our  military we have not been able to impact the horrible tragedies that  are taking place because of this humanitarian disaster.   Secondly, I think most experts will tell us there is no military  solution to the war that is taking place in Yemen that dates back to  2014. The warring sides are not going to end as a result of the  military. It is going to take diplomacy, and our military involvement  has not assisted in a diplomatic answer. We have not made the progress  I think many of us would have expected. So, yes, I do believe America  needs to be engaged in Yemen, just not from our military. Let's do an  all-out press on diplomacy and bring the parties to the peace table and  end this horrible conflict.   Yes, make no mistake about it, the Houthis are not nice people. I  understand that, but we are not going to win this by our military. So  let's concentrate on diplomacy. I think many have pointed out that,  yes, we have been in this region since the attack on our country on  September 11. Nothing in this resolution would affect our ability to  fight against al-Qaida and its associated forces.   The resolution specifically exempts--specifically exempts--from the  withdrawal of American military our campaign against al-Qaida and  associated forces.   There is also no question that since the Saudis have engaged in this  conflict, there have been many violations of human rights. Yes, we are  facilitating and helping. I am not saying we are committing, but we  are certainly part of the Saudi effort. We are supposedly helping them  with targeting. That means giving them intelligence information to  minimize civilian casualties. I am certain the American military is  helping in that regard, but the bottom line is, we are told that 61  percent of casualties are due to coalition strikes. There is tremendous  civilian loss as a result of this campaign, and the United States is  one of the honest brokers in trying to minimize that. We have not been  successful through the use of our military.    The use of our military has never been authorized by Congress. Now,  this is a debate we have had many times. I know the distinguished  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has been part of  that debate and has wanted us to come to grips with a congressional  authorization for military use in Yemen. I applaud the chairman. I am  very proud to be on that committee. I think if it were left up to our  committee, we may have been able to agree on a resolution, but it was  clear we couldn't get it through the Senate, couldn't get it through  the Congress. That was clear. I am not saying we are culpable for not  passing authorization, but we have not passed authorization, and there  is no authorization for the use of military force in Yemen, despite the  fact that article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution of the  United States gives the Congress the sole power to declare war.   We are responsible for the military, and if you can't get that  authorization, there should at least be a presumption that we shouldn't  be using our military. If you can't get the support of Congress--if the  President, Commander in Chief, can't get the support of Congress for  the use of force, there should not be a sustained use. We know about  emergency situations. We expect it of the Commander in Chief. This is  not an emergency situation. This is a situation where there should be  an authorization for the use of force if we are to remain. I don't  believe we should remain.   We have had our disagreements with the President on the use of force.  Congress passed the War Powers Act in 1973. The President didn't like  it. We passed it anyway. We believe the President should not only  notify but respect the will of Congress's power under article I to  declare war and authorize our military presence.   Section 5(c) gives the power to Congress to pass a joint resolution  to remove our troops where there has been no authorization. So what is  being done today--the resolution that is before us--is the vehicle that  we determined to be the appropriate way to remove our troops from  unauthorized war. Therefore, it is an appropriate action by the  Congress--probably the only action we can take in order to end the war  in Yemen with U.S. participation.   I want to make a comment about the relationship between the United  States and the Saudis. I heard many of my colleagues talk about it. I  think it is a very important relationship. I think the Saudis are a  strategic partner of the United States. I had many opportunities to  visit with the Saudis. I know about a lot of the things they are doing,  but make no mistake about it, that relationship is important to the  United States, but it is very important to the Saudis. It is more than  just our military support for a war in Yemen. It has a lot to do with  security issues generally. It has to do with intelligence sharing. It  has to do with economics.   Our relationship should always be wrapped in our values. Our foreign  policy should always be based upon our values as Americans, and our  values in regard to what is happening in this war in Yemen tell us we  should not be participating in it.   I haven't even mentioned the tragic death of Jamal Khashoggi. When  taking a look at what happened there and the involvement of the royal  family and the Crown Prince, that clearly cannot go unchallenged. Human  rights violations and the military campaign, all of that cries out for  the United States not to be engaged in the military aspects of what is  happening in Yemen, and the passage of S.J. Res. 54 will, in fact, make  that a reality, and I urge our colleagues to support that resolution.                      TIME Magazine's Person of the Year    Mr. President, it is a related subject.   I am going to talk about TIME magazine for their selection of their  Person of the Year, the ``Guardians and the War on Truth.'' I say it is  related because Jamal Khashoggi is one of the figures that is on the  cover of TIME magazine as one of the guardians.   In making their selection, TIME magazine wrote: ``For taking great  risks in pursuit of greater truths, for the imperfect but essential  quest for  [[Page S7493]]  facts that are central to civil discourse, for speaking up and for  speaking out, the Guardians'' are the Person of the Year.   TIME magazine wrote:         As we looked at the choices, it became clear that the       manipulation and abuse of truth is really the common thread       in so many of this year's major stories . . . this ought to       be a time when democracy leaps forward, an informed citizenry       being essential to self-government. Instead, it's in retreat.       And the story of this assault on truth is, somewhat       paradoxically, one of the hardest to tell.    TIME magazine wrote in this week's issue:         In Annapolis, Md., staff of the Capital, a newspaper       published by Capital Gazette Communications, which traces its       history of telling readers about the events in Maryland to       before the American Revolution, press on without the five       colleagues gunned down in their newsroom on June 28. Still       intact, indeed strengthened after the mass shooting, are the       bonds of trust and community that for national news outlets       have been eroded on strikingly partisan lines, never more       than this year.        ``I can tell you this,'' declared Chase Cook, a reporter       for the Capital Gazette [on that fateful day]. ``We are       putting out a damn paper tomorrow.'' Cook's promise . . .       came just a few hours after five of his colleagues were       killed. The man charged with their murders had been obsessed       with the paper since it wrote about his harassment of a high       school classmate--part of its routine coverage of local legal       proceedings. He made the office a crime scene. To put the       damn paper out, staffers set up laptops in the bed of a       pickup in a parking garage across the street.        When the next edition arrived--on schedule--the opinion       page was blank but for the names of the dead. Gerald       Fischman. Rob Hiaasen. John McNamara. Rebecca Smith. Wendi       Winters. Beneath their names was . . . written with a goose       quill: ``Tomorrow this page will return to its steady purpose       of offering our readers informed opinions about the world       around them, that they might be better citizens.''    I must tell you I am very proud of what the Capital Gazette has done.  They continued through very difficult times with the quality reporting  and opinion pages they have been known for, for a long time--a real  treasured institution in our State's capital.   One of the four TIME magazine covers includes the journalists of the  Capital Gazette, the Annapolis, MD, newspaper where five employees were  murdered by a gunman last June.   I spoke about this shooting on the Senate floor last June, and the  Senate unanimously adopted S. Res. 575, which I authored and which was  cosponsored by all Members of the Senate. This Senate resolution  commemorates the lives, careers, and service of five victims of the  Capital Gazette shooting in Annapolis, MD; honors the survivors of the  attack and the families of the victims and pledges to continue support  for their recovery; thanks law enforcement officers and other emergency  first responders for their heroic actions; and reaffirms the commitment  of the Senate to defending the First Amendment of the Constitution of  the United States.   Wendi Winters was among the five Capital Gazette employees killed in  the June 28 shooting. According to eyewitness accounts from survivors,  Wendi armed herself with the closest weapons at hand--her trash and  recycling bins--and charged the shooter, shouting for him to stop. It  is believed Wendi's actions distracted the shooter enough to enable  several of her coworkers to escape.   We think of violence against reporters as something that happens in  other countries, in war zones and the like, but not here, not in the  United States of America. All around the world, reporters work to  gather facts, ask questions, and report the news in the spirit of free,  open, and transparent societies and governments that all people  deserve. Too often, reporters are harassed, jailed, and even killed  simply because of the nature of their work, which often exposes  cronyism and corruption.   Jason Rezaian, a reporter with the Washington Post who was falsely  imprisoned in Iran for doing his job as a journalist, had this to say  earlier this year. He talks about the attack I referenced earlier in  Annapolis.         Mostly I have covered attacks on the media taking place on       the other side of the world, usually in countries where the       flow of information is restricted or conditions are such that       a sense of desperation or political or tribal affiliation can       compel individuals to take heinous action. . . . Writing       about a deadly attack that happened less than 30 miles away,       in an idyllic town that I recently visited with relatives       from overseas, is a new experience for me. And I have to say       that I don't relish the task.    We Americans have certain rights and responsibilities granted to us  through the Constitution, which established the rule of law in this  country. Freedom of the press is one of those most basic rights, and it  is central to the First Amendment of the Constitution: ``Congress shall  make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the  free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the  press.'' This precious freedom has often been under attack,  figuratively speaking, since our Nation's founding.   Today, attacks on the American media have become more frequent and  more literal, spurred on by dangerous rhetoric that has created an  ``open season'' on harassing the media for doing its job--asking the  questions that need to be asked, investigating the stories that need to  be uncovered, and bringing needed transparency to the halls of power,  whether they are in Annapolis, Washington, DC, or elsewhere.   Then-candidate and now-President Trump's rhetoric--calling the media  ``a stain on America'' and ``the enemy of the American people''-- certainly has caused damage. At the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the  President said to the audience that they are ``not to believe'' what  they see and hear. The President of the United States told a crowd of  veterans:         Stick with us. Don't believe the crap you see from these       people, the fake news. . . . What you're seeing and what       you're reading is not what's happening.    That is the President of the United States saying those comments-- again, demeaning the press and the importance of the free press.   Why is the President doing this? Earlier this year, CBS ``60  Minutes'' correspondent Leslie Stahl, an icon in the news business,  shared comments from President Trump from an interview she did with him  soon after the 2016 election win. Stahl recalled that she said to  Donald Trump about his attacks on the media:         Why are you doing this? You're doing it over and over. It's       boring and it's time to end that.    The candidate's response was straightforward and shocking. He said:         You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and       demean you all so that when you write negative stories about       me no one will believe you.    Let that sink in for a moment. A man who was about to assume the  position of President of the United States explicitly acknowledged he  was purposefully working to diminish the integrity of the free press.   After the Capitol Gazette shooting, Donald Trump said: ``Journalists,  like all Americans, should be free from the fear of being violently  attacked while doing their job.'' But how do we interpret his sincerity  when, more frequently, he is calling the media ``fake news'' or  ``totally unhinged'' and telling the people of America that reporters  are truly bad people?   Donald Trump's constant dismissal needs to end. He needs to accept  that one of the press's most important roles is to speak truth to  power--truth to power, including to the President of the United States.   Here at home, we are left to wonder whether Donald Trump is more  inclined to agree with Russian President Vladimir Putin's view of the  press--where journalists are routinely jailed and physically attacked-- than with Thomas Jefferson, who famously said: ``Were it left to me to  decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or  newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to  prefer the latter.''   Journalists, like all Americans, should be free from the fear of  being violently attacked while doing their job--both figuratively and  literally. The right of journalists to report the news is nothing less  than the right of all of us to know. Media freedom and media pluralism  are essential for the expression of, or ensuring respect for, other  fundamental freedoms and safeguarding democracy, the rule of law, and a  system of checks and balances.   Every one of us in this body--Democrats and Republicans--has sworn an  oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. As  leaders of this great Nation, we have a responsibility to defend the  rights of our  [[Page S7494]]  citizens, including the freedom of press.   Yesterday, TIME magazine featured three covers in addition to the  Capital Gazette. One is Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post  contributor who was killed at the Saudi Arabian Consulate in Istanbul  in October. I would note that this is the first time that a TIME Person  of the Year is a deceased person.   The United States of America must stand up for justice and human  rights at home and abroad. I agree that Saudi Arabia is a strong ally  in a variety of important areas, but that should only strengthen their  understanding of America's commitment to the rule of law, and we as a  Nation cannot sanction extrajudicial killings. America's national  security is harmed, not helped, when dictators and strongmen believe  they can get away with such heinous actions as the killing of  journalist Jamal Khashoggi.   Congress must act to demand accountability for those responsible for  Jamal Khashoggi's murder and to send the right signal to the world that  America will continue to be a beacon of justice and defender of human  rights.   Another cover features Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters  journalists who were arrested 1 year ago in Myanmar while working on  stories about the killings of the Rohingya Muslims. These journalists  remain behind bars, but their wives were photographed for the cover.  From this floor, I stood in solidarity with these Reuters reporters who  were detained in Burma for shining a light on the horrific abuses that  occur in the Rakhine State.    I have stood in solidarity with Ethiopian journalists and bloggers  who are routinely arrested for criticizing the Ethiopian Government and  exposing human rights abuses in that country. I have talked frequently  about China, a country that engages in routine censorship and online  blocking, harassment, reprisals, and detention of journalists, visa  delays, and denials for journalists.   Another TIME cover shows Maria Ressa, the chief executive of the  Philippine news website, Rappler, who was indicted on tax evasion  charges by President Duterte's administration as part of a crackdown on  free speech and dissent.   According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent,  nonprofit organization that promotes press freedom worldwide, more than  600 journalists and media workers have been killed in the last 10 years  while doing their job.   Of the member States of the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe, Russia remains the deadliest country for  journalists.   Turkey is the largest jailer of journalists in the world, and scores  of media outlets have been closed since the attempted coup there. The  heavyhanded measures used against media freedom in Turkey, both before  and during the recent elections, illustrates the lengths to which the  government went to control the information available to voters. It also  serves as a reminder of the essential role of a pluralistic media for  free and fair elections.   I have also worked on many other countries that have infringed upon  the freedom of press in my role on the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee as a ranking Democrat on the Helsinki Commission. I could  give you examples of what we have done in Malta, what we have done in  Slovakia, what we have done in Belarus--and the list goes on and on.   I therefore ask the Trump administration and my colleagues in the  Senate to redouble their efforts to protect the freedom of the press,  both at home and abroad. We must lead by example as the very  foundational legitimacy of a democratic republic is at stake.   America's leadership is essential to protect the freedom of the  press--an essential institution for a democratic state. We must lead by  first setting an example by our commitment to the freedom of press here  at home. We must demand that freedom of the press be a priority in our  global affairs, recognizing it is important to our national security.   TIME magazine got it right by naming the ``Guardians and the War on  Truth'' as persons of the year.   I yield the floor.
