 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous  question so that we can immediately consider H.R. 6858 to begin  unleashing America's energy dominance.   From day one, from minute one of the Biden administration, the war on  energy independence began.   We all woke up this morning to see gas at $4.52 a gallon, the highest  sticker price I have ever seen in my lifetime. The day President Biden  took office, gas was a mere $2.38 a gallon.   Policies have consequences, and we are feeling the consequences of  the Biden administration's decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline,  restrict drilling on Federal lands, and increase our reliance on  foreign dictators for oil and gas.   Yet, somehow, this administration has learned nothing from the  failures of their first year in office. Last week, President Biden  again canceled offshore oil and gas lease sales off the Gulf and  Alaskan coasts. This was a mere 2 days after he addressed the Nation  and blamed everyone but himself for the inflation crisis.   The only thing lower than Biden's approval rating is the purchasing  power of the American dollar. Washington Democrats have the House. They  have the Senate. They have the White House. No matter how much the  President deflects the responsibility for our inflation crisis, it  squarely falls on his shoulders.   By bringing up H.R. 6858 for consideration, Republicans are offering  Democrats the chance to correct the past 16 months of America-last  energy policies.   Mr. Speaker, we must end our assault on our energy sector. Unlike the  Democrats' socialist price-fixing act, this bill gets at the heart of  our energy crisis and takes steps to resolve it.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of the father of the praline and Savannah's Candy Kitchen founder,  Stan Strickland.   Stan became nothing short of an industry in the Savannah community  with the founding of River Street Sweets and Savannah's Candy Kitchen  40 years ago.   Savannah's waterfront is a staple of the city. River Street Sweets  has been a major part of the waterfront for many years.   Stan brought the joy of candy and an unforgettable experience to  anyone and everyone who had the pleasure of visiting his business.  Savannah's Candy Kitchen has become a major brand across the Southeast,  with stores in both Atlanta and Nashville as well.   Stan was also an avid fisherman with a deep passion and love for the  fish of the sea. It was even rumored that he had been a fishing partner  of the great Ernest Hemingway. His competitive nature and his love for  the sport led to his relentless pursuit of every sport fish in the  ocean.   This is truly a great loss for the Savannah community, and I pray  that the Lord be with Stan's family and his many friends.                            ____________________
