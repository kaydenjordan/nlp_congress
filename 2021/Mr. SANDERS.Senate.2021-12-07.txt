 Mr. President, I find myself in the somewhat  uncomfortable and unusual position of agreeing with Senator Paul. And  let me thank him and Senator Lee for their hard work in reclaiming  Congress's congressional war powers, another very important issue. The  understanding that it is Congress that has the constitutional  responsibility to authorize war--not the President--should, in fact,  transcend partisan disagreements.   On November 18, we introduced a congressional resolution of  disapproval to block the sale of 280 air-to-air missiles, 596 missile  launchers, and other weapons and support--totaling some $650 million-- to Saudi Arabia. That is what we will be voting on in a few minutes.   Let me be very clear. As the Saudi Government continues to wage its  devastating war in Yemen and repress its own people, we should not be  rewarding them with more arms sales. We should be demanding that they  end the devastating war in Yemen, which has killed over 230,000 people  in one of the very poorest countries on Earth. For more than 6 years,  the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen's civil war has been a key  driver of the largest humanitarian disaster in the world--the largest.   According to UNICEF, four out of every five children in Yemen need  humanitarian assistance--that is over 11 million children--400,000  children suffer from severe malnutrition; 1.7 million children have  been displaced from their homes by violence from this war; and some 15  million people, more than half of whom are children, do not have access  to safe water, sanitation, or hygiene.   United Nations humanitarian relief coordinator Martin Griffiths said  in September: ``The country's economy has reached new depths of  collapse, and a third wave of the pandemic is threatening to crash the  country's already fragile healthcare system.''   According to Griffiths, millions of Yemenis are ``a step away from  starvation.'' In other words, this poor country is hell on Earth. It is  the worst humanitarian disaster on a planet.   Under first the Obama administration and then the Trump  administration, the United States was Saudi Arabia's partner in this  horrific war. In 2019, Congress made history--and I am very proud of  that, and we did this in a bipartisan way--by passing the first-ever  War Powers Resolution through both Chambers of Congress, pressing then- President Trump to end this military support. It marked the first time  that Congress invoked the War Powers Resolution of 1973 to direct the  President to withdraw troops from an undeclared war.   Sadly, tragically, President Trump vetoed that resolution.   Many of us welcomed the Biden administration's announcement earlier  this year that it would end U.S. support for offensive military  operations led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen and name a special envoy to  help bring this conflict to an end, but the crisis has only continued.   American defense contractors continue to service Saudi planes that  are waging the war, and the U.S. military also continues to provide  intelligence to the Saudi Armed Forces. And now, tonight, we are  looking at a new $650 million arms sale to the Saudi Armed Forces.   Now, I am aware that ending U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia's  brutal assault will not alone end the multisided conflict in Yemen. The  Houthis are launching bloody attacks on the central Yemeni city of  Marib and increasing cross-border attacks on Saudi territory. Violence  has also erupted between rival factions in the south of Yemen. A U.N.  expert panel found that all parties to the conflict may have committed  war crimes.   U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia and this war should be clear: The  United States must do everything in our power to bring this brutal and  horrific war to an end. Exporting more missiles to Saudi Arabia does  nothing but further this conflict and pour more gasoline on an already  raging fire.   In my view, the United States must support an international observer  mission along the Saudi-Yemeni border and spearhead generous  international development efforts to rebuild Yemen. This aid should be  focused on bolstering local humanitarian and development initiatives,  like Yemen's Social Fund for Development.   We must also dramatically increase our diplomatic engagement to press  Saudi Arabia, the Riyadh-based Republic of Yemen Government, and the  Houthis to accept the U.N.'s roadmap as the basis for a compromise that  ends foreign military intervention and allows Yemenis to come to an  agreement. The war has gone on for too long, and it is time for the  United States to be bold and to be decisive in bringing about peace.   I also think that it is long past time that we took a very hard look  at our relationship with Saudi Arabia, a country whose government  represents the very opposite of what we profess to believe in. Saudi  Arabia is an extremely undemocratic country that is run by a  hereditary, authoritarian monarchy, one of the wealthiest families in  the world whose wealth is estimated to be over $1.4 trillion.   At a time when children in Yemen are starving to death, when that  impoverished country's healthcare system is collapsing, when the people  of Gaza are suffering mass unemployment and environmental devastation,  when people throughout that region lack clean drinking water, Saudi  Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman bought himself a $500 million yacht, a  $300 million French chateau, and a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci  painting. Mass starvation in the region that he helped create, children  do not have housing or drinking water, and this guy buys himself a $450  million da Vinci painting.   According to Freedom House, a respected human rights organization:   [[Page S8954]]              Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy restricts almost all       political rights and civil liberties. No officials at the       national level are elected. The regime relies on pervasive       surveillance, the criminalization of dissent, appeals to       sectarianism and ethnicity, and public spending supported by       oil revenues to maintain power. Women and religious       minorities face extensive discrimination in law and in       practice.    Freedom House also notes that working conditions for the large  migrant labor force are extremely exploitive.   Saudi Arabia is home to millions of migrant workers, many from  African countries but also from Pakistan, India, and elsewhere. These  workers constitute more than 80 percent of the private-sector  workforce, often as laborers and other service workers. They are  governed by an abusive system that gives their employers excessive  power over their mobility and legal status in the country. As a result,  these migrant workers are vulnerable to a wide range of abuses, from  passport confiscation to delayed wages and forced labor.   According to Human Rights Watch, under the government headed by Crown  Prince Muhammad bin Salman, ``Saudi Arabia has experienced the worst  period of oppression in its modern history.''   Human Rights Watch reported earlier this year that ``accounts have  emerged of alleged torture of high-profile political detainees in Saudi  prisons,'' including Saudi women's rights activists and others. The  alleged torture included electric shocks, beatings, whippings, and  sexual harassment.   And I think we all understand the nature of this government. Every  Member of Congress and I hope every American knows--and our own  intelligence services made this very clear--that Muhammad bin Salman  himself ordered the murder and the dismemberment of Washington Post  columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 in retaliation for Khashoggi's  criticisms of the Saudi regime. We all remember that terrible, terrible  murder of a Washington Post columnist.   We also know that the Saudi regime has waged a campaign of harassment  and attempted kidnapping against other critics, including on U.S. soil.   My simple question is: Why in the world would the United States  reward such a regime which has caused such pain in Yemen with more  weapons?   My friends, the answer is we should not. I urge my colleagues to  support S.J. Res. 31.
