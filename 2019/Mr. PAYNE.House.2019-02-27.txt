 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor America's health and  wellness coaches.   Approximately 70 percent of healthcare dollars in the United States  are spent on lifestyle-related diseases; but health and wellness  coaches can decrease those costs by helping people achieve their  personal health and wellness goals.   Far too many people suffer and struggle with poor health because they  don't have the motivation and resources or sustained support needed in  [[Page H2264]]  order to transform their habits. Healthy habits are not always easily  achievable when a patient is working alone, but health coaches are  there to ensure people succeed in taking control of their health  issues.   That is why, earlier in February, Congressman Mullin and I introduced  a bipartisan resolution to express our support for health and wellness  coaches. I am proud of our work together as co-chairs of the  Congressional Men's Health Caucus, and I encourage my colleagues to  join us in recognizing America's health and wellness coaches.                            ____________________
