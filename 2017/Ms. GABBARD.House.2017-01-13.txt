 Mr. Speaker, the American people have directly felt the  cost of our Nation's interventionist wars, a cost borne by our Nation's  sons and daughters who have served and by communities and people in  every part of this country.   We have spent trillions of dollars on regime-change wars in the  Middle East while communities like mine in Hawaii face a severe lack of  affordable housing, aging infrastructure, the need to invest in  education, health care, and so much more.   Our limited resources should go toward rebuilding our communities  here at home, not fueling more counterproductive regime-change wars  abroad. I have introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act, legislation  that would stop our government from using taxpayer dollars to directly  or indirectly support groups who are allied with and supporting  terrorist groups like ISIS and al Qaeda in their war to overthrow the  Syrian Government.   The fact that our resources are being used to strengthen the very  terrorist groups we should be focused on defeating should alarm every  American. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation  and stop this madness.                            ____________________
