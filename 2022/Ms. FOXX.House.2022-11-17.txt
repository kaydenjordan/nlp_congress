 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Randy Whittington, Gary  Foster, Angela Rogers, and Joey Haney of the Retail Solutions Group in  Wilkesboro, North Carolina.   I was proud to join them recently at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for  their fourth, and largest, warehouse.   In the last few years, Retail Solutions Group has grown from fewer  than eight employees to now over 200. This is a magnificent  accomplishment.   Madam Speaker, North Carolina remains a hub for entrepreneurship and  innovation, thanks to people such as Randy, Gary, Angela, and Joey.   Congratulations to Retail Solutions Group on this new and exciting  chapter. I look forward to hearing more about the strides you will make  in the days and months ahead.                            ____________________
