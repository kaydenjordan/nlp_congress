Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I came to the floor today to talk about  women's health. But before I do, I want to address an issue that my  colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, just talked about: President  Trump's nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.   This is a nominee the Democrats have significant numbers of concerns  about. In her hearing, where Republicans blocked us from asking  questions in an unprecedented and disappointing way, Mrs. DeVos gave  what has been widely seen as ill-informed, confused, and concerning  responses to serious and reasonable questions. She refused to rule out  slashing investments in or privatizing our public schools. She was  confused that Federal law provides protections for students with  disabilities. She actually argued that guns needed to be allowed in our  schools across the country to ``protect from grizzlies.'' And even  though she was willing to say that President Trump's behavior toward  women should be considered sexual assault, she would not commit to  actually enforcing Federal laws protecting women and girls in our  schools. So that nominee is absolutely not ``in the mainstream.'' She  is far from it.   When it comes to policy, many of us have serious concerns about  whether she would stand with students and parents who care about strong  public education for all or with President Trump and other millionaires  and billionaires like them. And that does not even touch on the serious  questions that remain regarding her ethics paperwork, her tangled  finances, and her potential conflicts of interest--questions that  Democrats have continued to demand answers to.   After her first hearing, Mrs. DeVos announced that she would have to  divest 102 separate assets, many of them investments in education  companies that Democrats were unable to ask her about. So Democrats  have requested another hearing to get information on those issues and  to do our job scrutinizing this nominee. I am hopeful that my  colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, does allow that to happen  because here in the Senate, we owe it to our constituents to scrutinize  these nominees. That is our job. It is not our job to protect them from  tough questions; it is our job to ask them tough questions.   While I suspect that my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee,  supports Mrs. DeVos and I respect that he is the chairman of the  committee, I am hopeful that he does not simply jam this nominee  through without allowing us to do our job.                            ____________________     Mr. President, having said that, I am on the floor today  with a number of my colleagues who will be joining me throughout the  time here today in the Senate to stand up and to be a voice for women.   I was so proud to march this weekend with millions of women and men  in a  [[Page S411]]  clear rejection of the hate and division that President Trump  campaigned on and in strong support of every woman's rights.   This past weekend, we also recognized the anniversary of the historic  ruling in Roe v. Wade, a decision that has empowered women and expanded  economic opportunity and security for families for more than four  decades.   I have heard story after story from Washington State and across the  country about what Roe v. Wade means for women. It means being able to  plan your family, to be able to pursue your dreams and give back to  your community. But perhaps most importantly, the decision in Roe v.  Wade sent a clear message that access to abortion--a woman's right to  make the most personal of all decisions herself--is fundamental to her  freedom and her ability to chart her own path.   Now we have already seen extreme politicians in State after State do  everything they can to undermine access to abortion. But, today, the  constitutionally protected rights these women have had now for 44 years  are, unfortunately, more at risk than ever as a result of President  Trump's extreme and deeply harmful agenda.   He has promised to pick Supreme Court nominees whose beliefs about  women's reproductive rights simply could not be more backwards or  damaging. Unfortunately, in what looks like a sign of things to come,  the President yesterday signed an Executive order limiting access to  safe abortion and other family planning services on women worldwide by  reinstituting the global gag rule.   I want to be very clear. If the President continues down this path,  women will be hurt. Their lives will be put at risk, and the same goes  for women around the world. So I am very concerned, and I am angry.   But if Saturday's march proved anything, it proved that women and men  across this country are more motivated than ever, and, frankly, so am  I.   Now, I can understand why President Trump may not have wanted to hear  from the hundreds of thousands of marchers who completely filled the  National Mall on Saturday or the millions more who marched nationwide  in every State--coast to coast--and on every continent. But if he  didn't get the message, this is just the beginning.   The millions of women and people who care about women's rights and  their access to health care are going to keep standing up, and we in  the Senate are going to continue to stand with them and fight back  every step of the way and do everything in our power to make sure that  our country does not go backwards. It will not be easy, but I know we  can do it if we keep marching together.   Thank you. I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
