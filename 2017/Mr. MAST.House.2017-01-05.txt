 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Georgia for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the current administration has  literally undermined peace with their shameful failure to veto U.N.  Resolution 2334.   Condemning Israel is condemning the most peaceful country in the  Middle East, and it is done simply to appease Palestinians--a group  that has been historically defined by their responsibility for terror-- and this does not bring us one step closer to peace.   I can tell you that after defending freedom in the U.S., I chose to  volunteer alongside the Israeli Defense Forces because our countries do  share the uncommon ideals of freedom, democracy, and mutual respect for  all people. During my time with the IDF, I did learn at the tables of  Israeli families just how much each one of them truly desire peace.   By failing to veto this hateful U.N. resolution, the administration  has sent a terrible message. We must counter this underhanded  condemnation of Israel with a unanimous show of support today for H.  Res. 11.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).
