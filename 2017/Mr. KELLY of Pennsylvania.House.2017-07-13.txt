 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  my amendment to H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2018, to prohibit Federal funds from being used to  implement the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty unless the Senate first  ratifies the treaty.   This language is identical to the version of my amendment that was  enacted into law in last year's NDAA and reflects the consistent will  of the American people and the unified position of Congress in  opposition to this misguided and dangerous treaty.   The U.N. ATT is a deeply flawed agreement signed by the Obama  administration in 2013. It would undermine our national sovereignty,  harm our most vulnerable allies, and threaten the Second Amendment  rights of every single American. Turning over our arms trade policy to  the United Nations is just wrongheaded.   The U.N. ATT would force the United States, the world's most  important defender of liberty and democracy, onto equal footing with  the world's worst dictatorships and terror sponsors. It would be  readily politicized by bad actors around the world to try to stop  America from providing arms to our friends and allies, including  Israel, South Korea, and others.   In short, just like gun control, it would stop the good from doing  good without stopping the bad from doing bad.   Congress has stood strong for the past 6 years on this issue.  Together, we were successful at stopping the Obama administration from  ever implementing this treaty or using hardworking American taxpayer  dollars to promote it.   Nevertheless, our work is not over. One of former President Obama's  parting shots as he left office was to submit the U.N. ATT to our  colleagues in the Senate for ratification, even though he knew it was  dead on arrival.   Regardless of who is seated in the Oval Office, renewing this ban is  important because no Presidency is permanent. A future administration  may well try even harder to put this treaty into effect.   Fortunately, in Donald Trump, we now have a President who believes in  protecting our sovereignty in every possible way. America should never  cede its sovereignty to the United Nations to determine its arms trade  policies.   Therefore, in addition to supporting this amendment, I strongly urge  President Trump and Secretary Tillerson to take the final step and  officially withdraw the United States from the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty  once and for all. It is time to tear it up.   I urge my colleagues to stand with me in support of the Second  Amendment and our Nation's sovereignty and vote in support of my  amendment.
