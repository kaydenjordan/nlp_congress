 Mr. Speaker, the responsibility of those of us in  Congress is to create a predictable and streamlined set of regulations,  such that we have an environment for the private sector, for businesses  to invest, to grow, and to hire more of our constituents. And when that  happens, Mr. Speaker, the folks in America live better lives with  fatter paychecks and better futures.   Now, we all know that small businesses need more help than large  companies when it comes to dealing with the regulatory environment  because they don't have the firepower, the horsepower, the manpower to  deal with these complex regulations.   When you start a small business, one of the most important  ingredients is access to capital. You need investment funds, whether  you are starting a bakery in Lewiston, Maine, or an auto body shop in  Oxford, Maine. Now, that is why H.R. 1219 is important, and I want to  congratulate Congressman Patrick McHenry for bringing this to the  floor.   By increasing the number of investors capped from 100 to 250  individuals who are qualified to make these investments to help small  businesses, it will provide more money, more funding, more capital for  small businesses and startups to grow, to start, and to create more  jobs for folks back home.   Government is in the business and should be in the business to help  our families, not hurt them. That is why I encourage all of my fellow  colleagues here in the House, Republicans and Democrats, to support  this good, commonsense bill.
