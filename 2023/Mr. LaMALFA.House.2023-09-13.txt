 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just  happen to be speaking about the subject of California.   Now, California is a beautiful place, beautiful climate and terrain  and territory. It is just that its politics have gotten so upside down  in the last--pick a number of years--40 years, 50 years. I am not  really there to serve the people anymore but to serve climate agendas  and other crazy agendas I will not go into here tonight.   I live in the rural part of California. I like to say, I live in the  normal part still in the far north where we farm and we ranch--we still  attempt to do mining--in order to produce the products that city people  need. If they didn't have us around to do those things then, I don't  know--they want to, I guess, import all of it, which seems to be the  direction here. Let's import it all from China.   One of the interesting things--I won't say funny, although the people  watching might think it is funny because we do this to ourselves--but  our California Air Resources Board released a rule requiring all new  cars in California that will be sold new to be zero-emission vehicles  by 2035.   Now, this was tried back in the eighties where they said, well, we  want--I believe maybe it was 1990--10 percent of all cars sold by the  year 2000, if my memory is correct, to be zero-emission vehicles.   So what did we end up with? Car companies are trying to make battery- powered vehicles that look like glorified golf carts or maybe those  little rigs you saw on ``Fantasy Island'' that Tattoo was driving  around in to be legitimate vehicles you would have out on the roadway.  You saw basically oversized golf carts with license plates on them  trying to somehow meet this mandate.   Well, CARB figured out at the time it wasn't going to get there so  they relented on it, but now they are not relenting.   So we have this mandate--not actually passed by legislature, signed  by the governor but made by the California Air Resources Board, which  is famous around the country for being heavy-handed on truckers and  off-road vehicles and everything else.   Here is the funny part: Just a few days after this mandate came out,  our esteemed Governor Newsom had to publicly beg electric vehicle  owners to not charge their cars due to concerns about the power grid  and blackouts. He told them, hey, please don't charge your cars right  now because our grid is overstretched during that particular time.   You have also a few months later when the winter came in residents in  Sierra Nevada lost power for many days due to heavy snowstorms knocking  the power out, so they couldn't heat their homes and do normal things  there. But if they had also had an electric vehicle they couldn't even  have gotten out of there to go someplace where it was warm or for other  needs, maybe emergency medical care or what have you.   We also have rolling blackouts that are common in the State due to  overuse and not enough power on the grid to keep things going.  Industries in California, many of them have agreements with the  utilities that they will voluntarily shut down if they are called upon  if the grid looks like it is going to be overtaxed at a particular  point. So you have manufacturers that have to lay off their workers for  the rest of the day, stop production in order to pull off-line and not  use power because we don't have enough of a power grid in California.    Then up in my area because we have a forest issue--which our forests  aren't managed as well as they should be, especially Federal land by  the U.S. Forest Service--where the power lines have been run through  for many decades, where there is hydrogeneration, et cetera, power may  be coming in from another State, we don't get to maintain around the  power lines like we used to because it might be an environmental  concern. We can't take the trees down that you need to to make sure  that they can't swing if they are falling; they might fall within the  path of those power lines if the tree, you know, is taller than what  the clearance is, right?   So I had to pass a bill a couple years ago to make the process just a  little bit easier to get a permit from the Forest Service to do that on  Federal land. It is still not easy, and it is not very timely, but it  got a little bit better. So we have that to deal with. They call it a  public safety power shutoff.   It especially affects part of my district. It seems like when I drive  through Tehama County sometimes during that time of year--now, they  have improved it a little bit--the whole county would be shut off  because the wind blew, and it might cause branches to blow into the  power lines, therefore, bad things happen such as the Camp fire, which  85 people died in Paradise, California, due to a power line problem a  few miles east of there with the wind blowing through. Then other fires  like the Carr fire near Redding, the Zogg fire, and many others.   Then we saw, of course, the effects, tragically, in Hawaii that we  just mourned this week--and that is what this red ribbon represents-- because we are not managing the lands around power lines.   This is happening right in California at the same time they are  mandating more and more electricity use, forcing us into vehicles we  can't afford or don't want. Also, they want to ban gas stoves and gas  water heaters and make them be on the grid, as well. I mean, you  couldn't get any dumber with the stuff we are doing in my home State,  my beautiful home State of California. Rolling blackouts.   By a miracle last year they decided we have to keep the Diablo Canyon  nuclear power plant going for another 5 years instead of maybe a 40- year permit--it was put in in about 1982 when I was going to school  down there in San Luis Obispo. It had a much longer life than what they  were allowing because, oh, we don't like nukes, nukes are scary, even  though they make zero CO2, as does hydropower.   Right now they are in the process of tearing dams out to make  hydroelectric power in my district, and they have their eyes on more up  in Washington and other areas because, oh, it might be an environmental  issue. It is really absurd what we are doing to ourselves. We are  putting ourselves into the Stone Age so we can go live in caves and eat  insects that these guys are prescribing for us, you know. It is  disgusting.                                time  1815    Now, they want to apply this toward our vehicles. We have got the  cleanest burning, most efficient vehicles ever being put out by the car  manufacturers, but they don't look at it that way. They don't give  credit for how much better and cleaner it is. The Los Angeles Basin's  air is cleaner than it has been. You remember the 1950s and 1960s and  all that. It is so much cleaner now. We have made so much progress on  this, yet they want to because they have the power to or arbitrarily  think it is a feel-good policy to take these vehicles away, to take car  choice away from people.   I remember the EPA under Andy Wheeler, just a few years ago, was  trying to make it where people could have more affordable cars and not  have this 54.5-mile-per-gallon mandate. What does a 54.5-mile-per- gallon vehicle look like to you? Is that a car choice to you when that  mandate was going to be fully fleshed out?   I mean, most cars that get pretty good gas mileage get 30, 35,  somewhere around there. A lot of others get 20, 25, depending on what  you want, but it isn't about your choice. It is about government  deciding what you need or what you should have; what is your  neighborhood going to look like; how much do you get to travel anymore,  all of these massive control issues.   We have public safety power shutoffs. We have them tearing down the  hydroelectric dams. The dams they still do have, they are requiring  more and more of the water to go out in such a way that they don't even  turn the turbines. Instead, we want the cold water to go out to lower  the temperature of the river maybe by 1 degree and it will be a little  bit better for the fish in the river or we want the water to come off  the top of the lake that can't go through the turbines because we want  to save that colder water for later in the season so it can be 1 degree  colder down the river for the fish. I mean, it is crazy.   When this first was announced by CARB, the Governor of California, we  sent him a letter and his CARB chair,  [[Page H4282]]  Liane Randolph, asking them to consider alternate policies to reduce  emissions that do not add additional strain to the State's energy grid  or restrictions on consumer choice. Choice, we all like that around  here, don't we?   I thank my California Republican colleagues for joining me on sending  a unified message, and I believe that this letter has helped us get a  bill on the floor this week, which is known as H.R. 1435. The bill  would prevent the U.S. EPA from issuing a waiver to California Air  Resources Board in order to enact that rule the State is trying to do,  without, again, legislation by the elected legislators.   This is what they have been using for a lot of years to put  California even under a tighter scrutiny than a lot of the rest of the  country, and it makes us uncompetitive in many aspects.   Though 95 percent of the vehicles on America roads are run on  internal combustion engines--they are using the acronym ICE these  days--States like California are trying to pass these egregiously  unrealistic emissions mandates to force American car manufacturers, and  foreign ones, too, to prioritize EV manufacturing.   Where are we going to mine the materials to make these? Are we going  to have the power on the grid to run them? You are going to change the  power grid in neighborhoods to have the massive amounts of transformers  and the wires and the poles and insulators and all of that in order to  have these charging units inside people's homes and in their garages.  They aren't taking that into account. It is just that la-di-da, pie-in- the-sky deal. We will just mandate it, and it will be great by 2035.   The idea that people just can't afford these vehicles, as many of  them are sometimes $17,000 to $20,000 more for the equivalent, same  size, same usage type vehicle, they don't care.   A whole bunch of the country's economy would be affected by this  because probably a bunch of other States would follow California's  ideas on this, with this waiver that they are seeking.   It is a real market manipulation that nobody has asked for other than  the do-gooders in Congress, at the State level, and others that are  forcing us in many ways in our lives. They want to force what kind of  home we live in, what we eat, what we drive, and how we power our  stoves and our water heaters.   Now, I mentioned a little bit ago how the grid got knocked out in  some of the mountainous areas after the storm there. You think, well,  at least people can go turn on their generator in order to provide some  electricity and some heat in their home perhaps. No, no, they want to  ban gas-powered or fuel-powered generators, too. I am wondering: What  are you supposed to run a generator on if you can't run it on gas or  diesel or natural gas or a propane tank or something you might have  nearby? What are you supposed to run it on when the power goes out?   If you live in a rural area where there are frequent public safety  power shutoffs or fire or other things happen that knock out the grid,  what are you supposed to do? They just make up the mandates. Governor  Newsom, who is maybe inspiring to be President--I warn people across  the country who are watching, don't fall for this stuff.   I like to joke around a little bit. I am from California. People,  don't do what we do, okay? It is going to affect your privacy. It is  going to affect your freedom. It will affect basic choices. It will  affect your economy of your household and of your State.   We don't even nearly have the EV charging systems that it would take  to have them close enough or enough of them onsite. You ought to see  the lines there. There is one place down in San Luis Obispo where you  can see the cars all lined up, all the Teslas and all these other folks  lined up waiting for the opportunity to plug onto one of these things  for 2 hours and then go on about their way, about their business as  they travel.   Mr. Speaker, you probably heard the story about the guy from, I  think, Michigan who bought the new Ford electric truck and was going to  go camping with it. He made it about one or two States away and finally  had to give up on it. I think he went and bought a Dodge Cummins diesel  in order to complete his family camping trip, because it was way  oversold as to what it could do versus what it could actually do.    Getting back to the bill. We don't want to empower California, and  perhaps up to 17 other States, with this EPA waiver, that they can  force this stuff upon the people and take away their choices, their  mobility to do what they need to do.   Ask a guy who is a contractor or a roofing company or a farmer or a  rancher or a miner or a logger if they need their F-250 or if they want  to get a fleet of five Priuses to go do the same job. They need to have  choices. This is at a time when we have got, as I said, the cleanest  running, most efficient vehicles we have ever made.   Oh, we have got to cut down on the CO2. Climate change.  Climate change, give me a break. CO2 is only 0.04 percent of  our atmosphere. They act like it is the end of the world.  CO2 is an important building block for plant life.  Everything is made out of carbon. They act like, because they have been  able to dream this up as a killer, that we have to stop all things that  make CO2.   I tell you what, if we are too good at this and we go below 0.2  percent, plant life starts dying off. Now, we will never be that good  getting rid of CO2, but we are going to spend trillions  doing it, and we are going to make ourselves a Third World country here  while China and others keep going ahead.   Our Governor Newsom is running over to China for a visit to talk  about climate change. Meanwhile, we have one of the worst homeless  problems in the State of California, and our economy and our water  isn't that greater either. Even though we were blessed with so much  rain this year, we need to build water storage for people. We need to  build that for our agriculture so we can supply this Nation with the  food it needs from California, with so many of our crops, 90-plus  percent, coming from California.   You wouldn't have your almonds. You wouldn't have your tomatoes. You  wouldn't have your pistachios. You wouldn't have many things that come  from California, but we are prioritizing this nonsense of taking away  people's vehicles.   Climate change gets preached on half the time around here, and every  policy in this place has to be run through a climate change filter,  even though it is nonsense that CO2, once again, is only .04  percent of our atmosphere and it is not a killer, because carbon is a  building block of everything we live off of.   Please, call your Congress Member and tell them to support H.R. 1435.  Don't empower California to control your State and your economy by  mandating what kind of vehicles you can drive because it is going to  affect you and it will ripple out from our whacked-out State to your  State what vehicles you are going to drive and how you are going to do  your business. Please check that out and support the bill.
