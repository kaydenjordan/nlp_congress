 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 937) to facilitate the expedited review of COVID-19 hate  crimes, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 937         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Following the spread of COVID-19 in 2020, there has       been a dramatic increase in hate crimes and violence against       Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders.        (2) According to a recent report, there were nearly 3,800       reported cases of anti-Asian discrimination and incidents       related to COVID-19 between March 19, 2020, and February 28,       2021, in all 50 States and the District of Columbia.        (3) During this time frame, race has been cited as the       primary reason for discrimination, making up over 90 percent       of incidents, and the United States condemns and denounces       any and all anti-Asian and Pacific Islander sentiment in any       form.        (4) Roughly 36 percent of these incidents took place at a       business and more than 2,000,000 Asian-American businesses       have contributed to the diverse fabric of American life.        (5) More than 1,900,000 Asian-American and Pacific Islander       older adults, particularly those older adults who are recent       immigrants or have limited English proficiency, may face even       greater challenges in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic,       including discrimination, economic insecurity, and language       isolation.        (6) In the midst of this alarming surge in anti-Asian hate       crimes and incidents, a shooter murdered the following 8       people in the Atlanta, Georgia region, 7 of whom were women       and 6 of whom were women of Asian descent:        (A) Xiaojie Tan.        (B) Daoyou Feng.        (C) Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonzalez.        (D) Paul Andre Michels.        (E) Soon Chung Park.        (F) Hyun Jung Grant.        (G) Suncha Kim.        (H) Yong Ae Yue.        (7) The people of the United States will always remember       the victims of these shootings and stand in solidarity with       those affected by this senseless tragedy and incidents of       hate that have affected the Asian and Pacific Islander       communities.       SEC. 3. REVIEW OF HATE CRIMES.         (a) In General.--Not later than 7 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall designate       an officer or employee of the Department of Justice whose       responsibility during the applicable period shall be to       facilitate the expedited review of hate crimes (as described       in section 249 of title 18, United States Code) and reports       of any such crime to Federal, State, local, or Tribal law       enforcement agencies.        (b) Applicable Period Defined.--In this section, the term       ``applicable period'' means the period beginning on the date       on which the officer or employee is designated under       subsection (a), and ending on the date that is 1 year after       the date on which the emergency period described in       subparagraph (B) of section 1135(g)(1) of the Social Security       Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5(g)(1)) ends, except that the Attorney       General may extend such period as appropriate.       SEC. 4. GUIDANCE.         (a) Guidance for Law Enforcement Agencies.--The Attorney       General shall issue guidance for State, local, and Tribal law       enforcement agencies, pursuant to this Act and other       applicable law, on how to--        (1) establish online reporting of hate crimes or incidents,       and to have online reporting that is equally effective for       people with disabilities as for people without disabilities       available in multiple languages as determined by the Attorney       General;        (2) collect data disaggregated by the protected       characteristics described in section 249 of title 18, United       States Code; and        (3) expand public education campaigns aimed at raising       awareness of hate crimes and reaching victims, that are       equally effective for people with disabilities as for people       without disabilities.        (b) Guidance Relating to COVID-19 Pandemic.--The Attorney       General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in       coordination with the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force and       community-based organizations, shall issue guidance aimed at       raising awareness of hate crimes during the COVID-19       pandemic.       SEC. 5. JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT.         (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Khalid       Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate,       Assault, and Threats to Equality Act of 2021'' or the       ``Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act''.        (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The incidence of violence known as hate crimes, or       crimes motivated by bias, poses a serious national problem.        (2) According to data obtained by the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, the incidence of such violence increased in       2019, the most recent year for which data is available.        (3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime Statistics Act       (Public Law 101-275; 28 U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the       Federal Government, law enforcement agencies, and the public       with data regarding the incidence of hate crime. The Hate       Crime Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd,       Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of Public Law 111-      84; 123 Stat. 2835) have enabled Federal authorities to       understand and, where appropriate, investigate and prosecute       hate crimes.        (4) A more complete understanding of the national problem       posed by hate crime is in the public interest and supports       the Federal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence       referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United States       Code.        (5) However, a complete understanding of the national       problem posed by hate crimes is hindered by incomplete data       from Federal, State, and local jurisdictions through the       Uniform Crime Reports program authorized under section 534 of       title 28, United States Code, and administered by the Federal       Bureau of Investigation.        (6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision of       inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the incidence of       hate crime through the Uniform Crime Reports program. A       significant contributing factor is the quality and quantity       of training that State and local law enforcement agencies       receive on the identification and reporting of suspected       bias-motivated crimes.        (7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is sufficiently       serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant       Federal financial assistance to States and local       jurisdictions.        (8) Federal financial assistance with regard to certain       violent crimes motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and       local authorities to work together as partners in the       investigation and prosecution of such crimes.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Hate crime.--The term ``hate crime'' means an act       described in section 245, 247, or 249 of title 18, United       States Code, or in section 901 of the Civil Rights Act of       1968 (42 U.S.C. 3631).        (2) Priority agency.--The term ``priority agency'' means--        (A) a law enforcement agency of a unit of local government       that serves a population of not less than 100,000, as       computed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; or        (B) a law enforcement agency of a unit of local government       that--        (i) serves a population of not less than 50,000 and less       than 100,000, as computed by the Federal Bureau of       Investigation; and        (ii) has reported no hate crimes through the Uniform Crime       Reports program in each of the 3 most recent calendar years       for which such data is available.        (3) State.--The term ``State'' has the meaning given the       term in section 901 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control       and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10251).        (4) Uniform crime reports.--The term ``Uniform Crime       Reports'' means the reports authorized under section 534 of       title 28, United States Code, and administered by the Federal       Bureau of Investigation that compile nationwide criminal       statistics for use--        (A) in law enforcement administration, operation, and       management; and        (B) to assess the nature and type of crime in the United       States.        (5) Unit of local government.--The term ``unit of local       government'' has the meaning given the term in section 901 of       title I of the  [[Page H2465]]       Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C.       10251).

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on S. 937.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act is important and timely  legislation to address the disturbing rise in violence directed at  Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Among other things, this legislation would help DOJ expedite review  of reported cases of hate crimes during the pandemic and provide  guidance to State and local law enforcement agencies for collecting  better and more accurate data.   It also incorporates the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, which includes  measures to encourage the adoption and implementation of the National  Incident-Based Reporting System to facilitate the reporting of hate  crimes by local police departments to the FBI.   The COVID-19 pandemic has taken almost 600,000 lives in the U.S. It  has also, unfortunately, deepened existing divisions in our country.  Racist, hateful rhetoric blaming the pandemic on Asian Americans fanned  the flames of discord and resulted in a disgraceful, sickening, and  ongoing spate of violence and discrimination against Asian people  across our country.   Stop AAPI Hate has collected reports of over 6,000 anti-Asian hate  crimes and incidents since the pandemic began in March 2020. Just this  month, they released four more heartbreaking attacks on Asian Americans  in New York City alone. These cases are, unfortunately, part of a  broader and deeply troubling uptick in hate crimes generally since  2015, with a surge in such crimes in 2019.   This legislation addresses this disturbing trend by helping  policymakers determine where critical resources should be focused,  identifying trends that can be interrupted, and directing public  education campaigns.   I thank my good friends, Congresswoman Grace Meng and Senator Mazie  Hirono, for championing this bill; Congressman  Don Beyer and Senator  Richard Blumenthal for their leadership on the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE  Act; Chairman   Steve Cohen, for holding an important hearing in his  subcommittee on hate crimes and violence against Asian Americans; and  Congresswoman Judy Chu, you, Madam Speaker, chair of the Congressional  Asian Pacific American Caucus, for your tireless advocacy for the AAPI  community.   The Senate passed this bill almost unanimously. I urge my colleagues  to do so as well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Meng).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  [[Page H2468]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jones).    Madam Speaker, I wish the gentleman from New York a happy  birthday.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu), one of the sponsors of this  legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, our country is experiencing a devastating rise in  hate, particularly against Asian Americans, throughout this pandemic.  The COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act responds to this urgent problem and will  help our government position itself to act quickly on reports of hate  crimes. It will ensure we have accurate data on the size and scope of  the problem. With this information, the Department of Justice will be  better positioned to act on reported hate crimes and to prevent future  ones.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  legislation and to send it to the President's desk without delay, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
