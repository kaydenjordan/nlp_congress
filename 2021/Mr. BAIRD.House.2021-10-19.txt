 Madam Speaker, I want to thank Kevin for coordinating this  Special Order, and I thank the gentleman for doing that.   Madam Speaker, this multitrillion dollar Big Government spending  package proposed by the Democrats isn't going to help our country. In  fact, it is going to be fundamentally harmful for generations of  Americans to come. Right now, America is saddled with skyrocketing  inflation rates that have left American families paying more for  everything, and supply chain shortages threaten to make the holiday  shopping season more difficult and expensive than ever.   Democrats are promising a package that will prolong labor shortages  and consequently inflation rates by continuing welfare benefits without  work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents at a time  when there are over 10 million jobs available.   How can we resolve labor shortages and rising inflation rates when  the Democrats continue to champion policies that encourage people to  remain unemployed?   Instead of addressing pressing issues that are having a true impact  on American families, Democrats continue to push partisan initiatives  that are nonstarters for many Americans, like mandating that taxpayers  fund abortions.   Madam Speaker, this package proves that many Democrats are out of  touch with both the needs and the values of the American people, and I  am proud to join my colleagues in standing in opposition to this  legislation.
