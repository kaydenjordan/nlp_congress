 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of our colleague, my  friend, John Lewis.   Everything John Lewis did was in the service of justice--a  courageous, compassionate man who gave everything, including his blood  and his body, to the civil rights movement.   From the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma to the floor of the House of  Representatives, John was never afraid to put it on the line,  everything, for what he believed in.   John was many things: a fighter, a leader, one of the ``Big Six,'' an  HBCU graduate, a ``good trouble'' maker.   He was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and over 50  honorary degrees, from Portland State University in Oregon to Bates  College in Maine, and yet he was always humble.   Many have called him a hero, a living legend, but most of us here  just knew him as John, our colleague, our friend. It was an amazing  privilege to serve in Congress with John Lewis.   John was not only a leader of the civil rights movement, he was a  modern-day Founding Father. Because, while the Founding Fathers assured  us that ``all men are created equal,'' it was the sweat and the blood  and the sacrifice of people like Congressman John Robert Lewis that  made that assurance true, that made our Nation more perfect and made  our form of government turn towards justice.   John Lewis earned the respect of men, women, and little children, and  he made our world and our community and our Nation much better than he  found it.   My prayers are with his family and every seeker of justice who mourns  him today.   Thank you, brother Lewis. Thank you.   Rest in peace.                            ____________________
