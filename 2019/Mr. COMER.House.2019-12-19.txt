 Madam Speaker, ever since President Trump struck a new,  pro-American trade agreement with Canada and Mexico over a year ago, he  has worked tirelessly with Members of both parties to get to the point  of passing the USMCA through Congress.   Make no mistake about it: The President's leadership on this issue  has put us on the brink of this tremendous accomplishment. Today, we  will pass a new trade deal that will create jobs, grow our economy, and  help our farmers.   Having strongly advocated for the passage of this deal, I am proud to  express my strong support for USMCA and all the opportunities it will  provide.   Kentucky will strongly benefit from USMCA. Estimates show that our  State, alone, will see over $260 million more in agriculture exports to  Canada and Mexico. New trade markets, more stability for our farmers  and manufacturers, and more accountability from our trading partners  will help our people and grow our entire economy.   As a farmer and Kentucky's former commissioner of agriculture, I know  firsthand the need for our country to establish new markets for our  farmers. I am proud to be a strong voice for the agriculture community  and represent their interests in Washington.  [[Page H12258]]    This is a great day for our farmers, for Kentucky, and for all of  America.
