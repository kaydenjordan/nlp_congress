 Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Mr. Danny  Cunningham, owner of Cunningham Farms in Calloway County, Kentucky, for  recently being named the 2018 Kentucky Farm Bureau Farmer of the Year.  This is the third year in a row a farmer in Kentucky's First  Congressional District has been recognized as Farmer of the Year.   After growing up on a small dairy farm owned by his father, Danny  Cunningham began his own farming operation in Calloway County. Fifty- eight years later, Cunningham Farms is a massive family-run operation.   Danny has been an active member of the Calloway County Farm Bureau,  serving on the board of directors for more than 30 years.   He was married to his late wife, Judy, for over 54 years and is the  proud father of three daughters.   I am honored to congratulate Farmer of the Year Danny Cunningham on  his unwavering work ethic, dedication to the Calloway County Farm  Bureau, and outstanding role in the agriculture community.                            ____________________
