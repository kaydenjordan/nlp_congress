 Madam Speaker, last week, family, friends, and  thousands of fellow firefighters gathered to bid a final farewell to  fallen FDNY Firefighter Timothy Klein.   We lost Tim in the line of duty, where he made the ultimate sacrifice  in the face of incredible danger, responding to a fire in the borough  of Brooklyn.   Tim was a 6-year veteran of the department. He came from a family of  firefighters, including his dad. He made an impression on everybody he  worked with, the junior men who he trained and the senior men and women  who he impressed.   Tim was the American Dream, fueled by the will to put on his uniform,  run toward danger, and put his life on the line to save others.   New York City rises today in Congress to honor his life, his service,  and the memory and legacy Tim left behind.                            ____________________
