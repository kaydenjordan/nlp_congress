 Mr. President, I actually listened to the comments that  were made by my good friend from Michigan, but I have to say this, that  she is talking about someone who is considered by me and many others as  arguably the most gifted jurist ever nominated to the U.S. Supreme  Court. I want to talk about that.   I have something else to talk about first because I think people know  Judge Barrett by this time, but they may not know a couple of people  they should know about.   Earlier this year, Aurash Zarkeshan or ``Zark.'' Because of the  complications of his name, he is called that by most of his close  friends.   He was overjoyed. He had just graduated earlier this year from the  Tulsa Police Academy and was sworn in as a police officer. That was his  life's ambition. He was a guy who was so excited that he was taking  that step. He was a shining example of everything that you want in a  new officer. He was bright, engaged, committed to public service. He  wanted to give back and make his community a better place. That was  him.   At the end of June, only 6 weeks on patrol, he pulled over a car for  a routine traffic stop. As we all know, there is no such thing as a  routine law enforcement process. He and Sergeant Craig Johnson pulled  over a car, and what happened next was horrifying and tragic. They were  viciously shot in the head during that stop, despite many attempts to  deescalate the situation.   Tragically, Sergeant Johnson succumbed to his injuries. While Zark  remained in critical condition, Sergeant Johnson left behind his wife  Kristi and sons, Connor and Clinton. That is him here on the left-- dashing young man.   In that moment of sorrow, the Tulsa community united in prayer and  hope for the recovery of Zark. Since the shooting, Zark has undergone  several surgeries. He spent months recovering in rehab. Throughout  these months, Zark provided us with updates of his recovery and the  progress he has been making. He even called into a class of new Tulsa  Police Department recruits. He also went in person to his squad meeting  and met with them.   His progress is truly remarkable. As Tulsa Police Captain Kimberly  Lee put it, ``He really is an example for all of us.'' That is exactly  right. Zark is a hero. He persevered through extraordinary pain and  strife and is now making a speedy recovery.   Last week, on October 15, Zark returned home from 3 months of rehab,  and he was met by friends and family and supporters who welcomed him  with open arms. Our mayor, G.T. Bynum, declared October 15 Officer  Aurash Zarkeshan Day in the city of Tulsa and proclaimed that Zark is  ``Tulsa's Hope.'' I couldn't agree more. Zark embodies everything that  makes Oklahoma great.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that proclamation be printed  in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Zark wanted to give back to his community, and he delivered. October  15 will hold a special place in the heart of the thousands of people  who call Tulsa home.  [[Page S6465]]    In August, I spoke on the Senate floor regarding the riots and  anarchy happening around the country, but I was specifically referring  to Portland, OR, and how these events and hateful rhetoric aimed at law  enforcement have endangered countless brave men and women who serve in  law enforcement and how they have certainly depressed them. They talk  about things like peaceful protests. Yet, in that case, they were  throwing bricks at officers. They sprayed officers, nearly blinding all  three of them. This was actually going on.   I highlight the contrast between the violence happening in Oregon  with how we appreciate our officers in my State of Oklahoma--what a  contrast. Oklahomans have great respect and admiration for our men and  women in blue. We know that law enforcement officers are our neighbors,  our friends, and our family. They have a dangerous job, and they go  beyond that job. I was talking to some of them the other day, and  different ones gave different messages. While they are on duty,  defending rights, a lot of them teach young kids how to play baseball.  They are really great citizens.   In the speech that I gave in August, I highlighted the attack on Zark  and Sergeant Johnson. These attacks are a painful reminder of the  sacrifices that law enforcement make every day. ``Defunding the  police'' rhetoric may be politically appealing to some on the left, but  we must remember that law enforcement is the first line of defense  against threats like what we saw in Tulsa in June.   I had the opportunity to talk to Zark this morning. He told me what  was going through his mind while they were being rushed to the  hospital. He said he was thinking: ``I hope our story reaches the  Nation.''   Your story, Zark, has reached the Nation. It has reached the world.  Right now, they know what happened.   Zark wanted people to understand what police and law enforcement risk  every day--a sacrifice too many take for granted. He wanted people to  know the stories of good, honorable police officers. While his tragedy  in Tulsa is a reminder of the threats our communities face, it is also  a story of hope, of Tulsa's hope.   Jerad Lindsey, who is the chairman of Tulsa's Fraternal Order of  Police, said it best: ``There's not a lot of times you get to use the  word `miracle'.'' Zark's recovery definitely fits that bill.   Perhaps, what is most telling and most inspiring is that Zark doesn't  lose sight of what was lost on June 29. On his return to Tulsa on a day  that was proclaimed to recognize his heroism, he wore a shirt that  honored Sergeant Johnson. It read: ``Fallen but not forgotten.'' Even  this morning, he talked about Sergeant Craig Johnson and how he had  wanted him to return to Tulsa with him as he himself did last week.   Now that Zark is back in Tulsa, he is going to keep up his recovery,  but he is also looking forward to enjoying these simple things: his own  bed, his dogs, his Whataburger--he has already been there twice--and  the love and support of all Tulsans.   While there are many challenges and hardships ahead for Tulsa and the  Nation with this tragedy, this is a story of optimism and faith in our  community and in our future. Both Zark and Sergeant Johnson are  American heroes, and they will always be American heroes. So we say  thanks to Zark.   Thanks, Zark. You are great   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                           The Honorable Gt Bynum                                 Proclamation         Whereas, on June 29, 2020, Officer Aurash Zarkeshan placed       himself in harms way to protect and serve the citizens of       Tulsa and the men and women of the Tulsa Police Department.        Whereas, Officer Aurash Zarkeshan endured more than three       months of rehabilitation and multiple surgeries. His bravery       and positive outlook throughout his journey are admirable and       have been an inspiration to the city.        Whereas, Officer Aurash Zarkeshan's strength and       perseverance have set an example to the Tulsa Police       Department and he has been a beacon of light for law       enforcement officers around the county.        Whereas, Officer Aurash Zarkeshan has been declared       ``Tulsa's Hope'' for his service, courage, and valor under       fire.        Whereas, Tulsans are excited on this day to welcome Officer       Aurash Zarkeshan home.        Now, therefore, I, Gt Bynum, Mayor of the City of Tulsa, do       hereby proclaim October 15th as ``Officer Aurash Zarkeshan       Day'' in the City of Tulsa.    Mr. President, I have already talked a couple of times  about this great nominee whom we have in Amy Coney Barrett, and I am  really proud to speak in support of President Trump's outstanding  nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court.   To say that Judge Barrett is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court  is an understatement. Judge Barrett is the definition of a leader. Her  record of accomplishments is second to none. Everybody knows it.   After we had a chance to really evaluate and talk to her and know her  and visit with her, we found that she was born in New Orleans. She went  on to graduate from Rhodes College in Memphis and also from Notre Dame  Law School. She graduated at the top of her class and always has been  at the top of her class. That is worth pointing out because, when  confirmed, she will be the only Justice on the bench who did not go to  Harvard or Yale. Now, that is a good thing. She clerked for one of  America's finest Supreme Court Justices--the late Antonin Scalia. Since  2002, she has taught law at Notre Dame, where she has been selected  ``Distinguished Professor of the Year'' three different times.   In 2017, after being attacked by the Democrats about her strong  faith, she was confirmed to the Seventh Circuit by this body--and with  Democratic votes, I might add. Let me repeat that. She was confirmed on  a bipartisan basis only 3 years ago. But, today, liberals are recycling  their same stale tactics in an attempt to tarnish another exceptional  nominee without having any basis in fact or truth. They are attacking  her Catholic faith. Some operatives have even attacked her for adopting  children from Haiti. I am not kidding. They are attacking her for that.  It should go without saying that Judge Barrett should be commended for  this loving, selfless act, not disparaged for it.   I personally know that adoption is one of God's greatest gifts. I am  the proud grandfather of Zegita Marie. I found her during a mission in  Ethiopia, and my daughter and son-in-law adopted her as a baby. She is  in college now and is one of my greatest blessings.   Yet, like clockwork, the Democrats use bogus propaganda to try to  scare the American people into opposing a Republican President's  Supreme Court nominee. Over the years, they have made outrageous  claims, like saying these nominees will take away America's healthcare.  They have done it time and again. They did it with Anthony Kennedy.  They did it with David Souter. They did it with John Roberts and,  recently, with Brett Kavanaugh. Now they are doing it with Judge  Barrett. Most Americans can see through this far-left hoax, but it is  important to set the record right. Judge Barrett is not and has never  advocated in favor of taking away anyone's healthcare--period.   Liberals have gone after Judge Barrett for her views on abortion.  First of all, Judge Barrett has every right to enjoy her religious  freedom. I think we all understand that. I am saddened to see the  attacks that she has received due to her Catholic faith. Nevertheless,  her record shows that she will thoughtfully apply the Constitution to  all cases while honoring Supreme Court precedent. At the same time, she  has proven that she impartially and faithfully exercises her duties as  an appellate judge. There is no reason to believe that she would not  continue to do so as a Justice.   Now I want to speak about the precedent for acting on today's  vacancy, which differs from the vacancy of 2016. The Democrats and  liberal media have called Senate Republicans hypocrites for opposing  the confirmation of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee in 2016 but  supporting the confirmation of the President's nominee today. What they  fail to recognize is that we followed Senate precedent. We followed it  in 2016, and we are following it again right now.   In 2016, we had a divided government. What a divided government means  is that we have different parties controlling the White House and the  confirming body, the U.S. Senate. In 2016, we had that divided  government, and  [[Page S6466]]  they were controlled by different parties. The Senate Republicans  followed the Biden rule then, which is that the Senate does not confirm  an election year vacancy in which the White House and the Senate are  controlled by different parties. Despite the Democrats' insistence on  confirming President Obama's nominee, Senate Republicans followed  precedent.   The reality is that, in the modern era, the Senate has not confirmed  a Supreme Court nominee under a divided government. It just hasn't  happened. The last time the Senate confirmed a nominee under these  circumstances was in 1888. Today, we have a united government. The same  party that has the Senate has the Presidency. The voters elected  President Trump in 2016. The Senate Republicans grew their majority in  2018. In nearly every instance in history in which there has been a  Supreme Court vacancy under a united government, we have voted to  confirm. In fact, the only time in history that the Senate did not  confirm a nominee under a united government was in 1968, wherein there  was bipartisan opposition on ethical grounds. They all agreed that the  nominee should be withdrawn, and he was withdrawn.   It is simply false to state that Senate Republicans are going against  precedent. As a matter of political convenience, the Democrats have  flip-flopped from what they said in 2016 and are adamantly opposed to a  vote during an election year. It is not surprising that the media has  ignored their about-face.   I am proud of the efforts by Leader McConnell and our Republican  majority, who have confirmed dozens of President Trump's exemplary  judicial nominations. I think the number right now is somewhere around  212, and that may be a record, but those are a lot of nominations   Senate Republicans and President Trump have followed through on our  promise to remake the judiciary with more judges who interpret the law  as written, not legislate from the bench. We all know what we are  talking about there. With Judge Barrett, we have the opportunity to  confirm the President's third Supreme Court nominee to the bench.   Everyone knows Judge Barrett is hard-working, principled, and  committed to serving her fellow Americans. In a 2017 letter, a  bipartisan group of law professors called her work ``rigorous, fair- minded, respectful, and constructive.'' I couldn't agree more. I know  she will serve our highest Court with honor and distinction, and I look  forward to voting to confirm the nomination soon. She is, I really  think, the most gifted, talented jurist to be found in America today.   My wife and I have been married for 60 years. We have 20 kids and  grandkids. They are the ones who are going to be the beneficiaries of  the service of Judge Barrett. She is going to be confirmed as an  Associate Justice on our High Court in a matter of hours, and this is  going to be a great thing for America.   I yield the floor.
