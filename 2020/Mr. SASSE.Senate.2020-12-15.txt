 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise because in a few minutes, I am going  to ask to enter into the Record a new report released last night by  Adrian Zenz of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. It isn't  often that we enter into the Congressional Record reports that are  really things that we want our constituents to read, but this report is  different. This report is a report that every American needs to know  about because it makes clear two things.   First, it makes clear that cotton from Xinjiang, which is about 20  percent of all the world's cotton; it is about 85 percent of all the  cotton coming out of China, but it is about 20 percent of the global  cotton, and it is a lot of the best cotton on the globe--is stained by  slave labor.   The second thing that it makes clear is that a lot of this cotton is  destined for the United States. We are the ones demanding it, and our  people are making a market for this blood cotton.   Under the guise of Orwellian terms like ``poverty alleviation,'' the  Chinese Communist Party is forcibly mobilizing minority labor--the  Uighurs--to replace the majority Han Chinese labor market that has  traditionally picked some of the Xinjiang cotton. Very young and very  elderly folks are often sent into facilities, and everyone in between-- everybody who has a body that can move into the fields--is being sent  into these cotton fields for the monthslong cotton picking season.   Picking cotton is backbreaking labor, and these Uighurs who are being  forced to do this as slaves are under constant surveillance. They are  subjected to very long work hours, and they are forced to participate  in political indoctrination sessions. Some of today's pickers have also  done shifts and turns in CCP internment camps as well.   We should be very clear about what is happening here. What is  happening here is an unmitigated evil. There isn't another  interpretation for this slave labor that is producing the Xinjiang  blood cotton. This is an unmitigated evil, and it is obviously far more  comfortable to ignore evil than to confront it head-on. Despite our  many promises, it is easy to forget the human toil of totalitarianism.  It is easier to just look away.   That is, of course, what the Communist leadership in Beijing is  counting on. They are counting on the fact that U.S. citizens and  corporate leadership and politicians will just be busy and will say:  Well, that would be messy to have to confront, so we should just look  away. We said we would never forget, but let's just not notice.   So we should state this truth over and over and over again. Chairman  Xi's dictatorship is enslaving more than half a million Uighurs, and  they are being forced to pick blood cotton. That is what this report  from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation last night clearly  demonstrates   The Chinese Communist Party is convinced that the American people and  that the institutions of the U.S. Government will simply look away, so  we need to say again and again that Chairman Xi's dictatorship is  enslaving more than half a million Uighurs. They are being forced into  slavery in the cotton fields. Much of that cotton is destined for U.S.  markets, and Chairman Xi and his underlings are counting on the fact  that although America raises a light of liberty in our rhetoric, they  are expecting that we will just look away in practice and in fact in  our marketplaces. We should not and we cannot give them that victory.   Beijing's Communist Party doesn't care about basic human dignity. The  genocidal leaders who are running the government in Beijing--and,  again, we need to distinguish that. Every time we talk about topics  like this, we need to distinguish between the leadership of the  Communist Party in Beijing and the regular 1.4 billion Chinese  citizens, many of whom have nothing to do with these evils and wouldn't  countenance them if they had the power. The genocidal leadership of the  Communist Party in Beijing is running systematically oppressive slave  regimes against the Muslims and against other ethnic minorities.   Their cruelty is unmatched. They are ripping families apart. They are  forcibly separating children from parents. They forcibly separate  husbands and wives. They send goons in to rape the wives whose husbands  have been sent away, hoping that they can impregnate them with other  ethnic children to sort of extinguish the Uighur population in this  region. They are brainwashing children, and they have weaponized forced  abortion and sterilization. They have systematically demolished  mosques.   What is happening in Xinjiang is not gray; what is happening in  Xinjiang is evil. Chairman Xi's underlings do not believe that the  Uighurs are human,  [[Page S7494]]  and the racist Communist Party in Beijing believes that these men and  women are little better than animals and that they can be exploited as  slaves. In Xinjiang, cotton is king.   How does Beijing try to explain this away? Well, of course, there are  a whole bunch of lies that they try to use to cover it up. According to  their propaganda, the Uighurs and other ethnic minorities are lazy  people, and they need help to overcome their laziness. They need to  learn about work, and they need to be helped out of poverty. These are  the sorts of topline versions of their disgusting lies. But they don't  really think that anybody is persuaded by these lies. What they expect  is that the money will do the persuading for them. They don't think  that these lies are ruled out in a way that is going to really be  compelling to anyone. What they really expect is that we won't pay  attention to where high-quality, cheap cotton often comes from and that  we will just look away.   And here is the painful truth: The global supply chains that have  benefited from this blood cotton have gotten some really good cotton at  really cheap prices. In 2019, an estimated 70 percent of Xinjiang's  cotton was picked by hand, making it some of the highest quality cotton  in the world and some of the most desirable cotton in any marketplace,  and it is incredibly cheap because it is picked by slave labor.  Xinjiang produces about 85 percent of China's cotton and about 20  percent of the world's cotton, and it is impossible to separate blood  cotton from the small minority that is not picked in these slave  fields.   Here is what it means in America and around the world: It means that  we are living in a sea of hypocrisy because we have a whole bunch of  U.S. companies that celebrate individuality, individualism, make some  unbelievably good commercials and talk about the expansion of human  potential, at the same time being cosponsors of slave fields. That is  what we are talking about here. We can't and we shouldn't simply look  away.   The extensiveness of the CCP's forced labor programs are such that  many U.S. companies, including at least 82 identifiable global brands,  have benefited from the Xinjiang slave cotton labor. Gap and Nike are  two of the companies that are most obviously singled out, and the CCP  has helped them cut their costs and expand their market access. In  exchange, what they ask for is a really polite ``see no evil'' policy.   The commercials that are aired in prime time at major sporting events  in the United States are aired by companies that at the same time say:  Please don't ask us about our supply chains. We don't want to have to  give any account for that.   These companies spend billions of dollars a year running ad campaigns  touting values like self-determination. Yet they are quietly importing  Communist values, particularly about the lack of human dignity. We  don't want those values imported into the United States. We don't want  to look away. We don't want to be people who say ``Never again and  never forget'' and then just casually say ``I am never going to  notice.'' We don't want to be those people.   Today, I have written letters to both Gap and Nike asking them to  help--asking them to please help make transparent to the American  people what they know about their supply chains and how we should clean  them up. We need to tackle the problem of this blood cotton from  Xinjiang, and we need to give the American public, the American  consumer, a transparent look into what these supply chains look like,  where they come from, and how much blood they are tainted with.   In the coming weeks, I and others will be reaching out to more  companies than Gap and Nike, but those are the two letters I sent  today. Americans in government and business and even Americans as we go  to the store with our wallets as consumers in the retail marketplace-- we need to be aware of what is happening. We need to be a people who  believe in defending human rights.   The unjust status quo is very profitable, so many companies are now  fighting this change. They are fighting this transparency. As attention  in Congress has turned towards supply chain integrity concerns in  recent months, companies have begun to deploy high-paid lobbyists on  Capitol Hill. Americans who believe strongly in human rights and  fundamental freedoms have been justifiably confused about these efforts  to weaken legislation that seeks to ban imported goods that are made  with Chinese Communist Party slave labor.    Businesses that claim a fundamental respect for human dignity ought  to share with their consumers and with their shareholders how they  ensure the integrity of their supply chains because, again, 20 percent  of the world's cotton comes from this part of China, and 85 percent of  that cotton looks like it is tainted by blood cotton.   Companies need to come clean if they have been asked by the CCP to  stay silent about the human rights abuses in China. Companies need to  reevaluate the costs and the benefits, and the costs are high of  partnering with the genocidal regime. They need to do it themselves.  These companies need to do it themselves because it is right, and they  need to be pushed to do it because it is hard and because the  competitive marketplace has many of their peer companies and competitor  companies also benefiting from this same slave cotton.   The U.S. Congress has become increasingly concerned about the Chinese  Communist Party's pay-to-play shakedown of American companies. There is  currently a bill under consideration in this body that forces a long  overdue review of supply chains, and there are going to be many more  bills and pieces of legislation like this coming. Companies, even if  they don't want to do it for the right reason, should do it for the  pragmatic reason of getting in front of this because this attention is  not going to go away. The concern in this body and in this Congress  about the blood in the slave supply chains in many of these industries  is bipartisan.   The United States celebrates the ideals of universal human dignity.  The Chinese Communist Party explicitly rejects these ideals. In this  ideological competition, Beijing is working to exploit something--they  are working to exploit the moral concessions of American CEOs. CEOs and  boards, you need to do better. American consumers, you need to ask hard  questions. And this Congress needs to do some serious investigating.   American and global companies that find their roots in these freedom- loving worlds and countries and that express public support for  fundamental human freedoms that produce their success must act now.  There is more to do than maximize the bottom line. That is not the only  value. And the Senate is increasingly willing to act to ensure that  American companies do not import misguided Chinese Communist Party  values to these shores.   Right now, it is too easy, it is too comfortable, and it is too  profitable for many American and global companies to simply ignore the  evil. We need to make the suffering in Xinjiang known. We need to speak  about the Uighurs. These men, women, and children have God-given  dignity, and we should not look away.   Americans need to know about this evil so that we can, together,  confront it. We need to dismantle Chairman Xi's lies, and we need to  make it unconscionable for American businesses to profit from Chairman  Xi's injustices.
