 Madam Chair, I have said it many times this  week, and I will say it again. The legislation before us today, H.R.  4606, the Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act, will help  the United States fully realize its economic potential regarding small- scale liquefied natural gas exports and associated technologies.   This bill addresses current permitting concerns, but it is also  forward looking. H.R. 4606 will help the United States to grow as a  reliable, trusted trading partner. It can help reduce trade deficits,  promote new job opportunities at home, and strengthen ties with our  allies abroad.   Specifically, this bill provides that applications under the Natural  Gas Act for the importation or exportation of small volumes of natural  gas will be granted without delay, but only if they do not require an  environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act.  This means that both FERC and DOE must continue to fully comply with  NEPA regulations and that they must evaluate the potential direct and  indirect impacts, consult with other agencies, and receive public  input.    Importantly, this bill is the product of bipartisan compromise and  work. During markups at the House Energy and Commerce Committee,  Representative Gene Green and I worked together so that both sides of  the aisle could support this commonsense legislation. I appreciate his  hard work, along with the work of many of my other colleagues.   As a result, this bill has support from a diverse group of  stakeholders, including the Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, the  National Association of Manufacturers, the Laborers' International  Union of North America, the American Petroleum Institute, and Citizens  for Responsible Energy Solutions.   Now, as the Representative for rural eastern and southeastern Ohio, I  have long recognized the benefits of excess natural gas exports.  Because of the shale gas boom, new opportunities are emerging for Ohio  and the surrounding States virtually daily, as ethane cracker plants  and ethane storage hubs begin to take shape.   Reports show that this trend will only continue, as one study  predicts that the region has sufficient ethane feedstock to support up  to five ethane cracker plants.   These opportunities are huge and have become viable thanks to new  technologies that have led to an increase in natural gas production.  But it is also due to an increase in production resulting from the  growing demand for excess U.S. natural gas.   In fact, natural gas production is at an all-time high, and reserves  are so large that they are predicted to meet domestic demand for almost  a century. Ohio alone reached new highs in October 2017, as natural gas  production reached 5.5 billion cubic feet per day.   H.R. 4606 can play a role in furthering America's economic progress  by allowing our domestic producers and gas providers to export small  quantities of natural gas to neighboring countries in a more efficient  manner.   Don't misunderstand this. There is an interest for U.S. natural gas  in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, although not in  the quantities that the current large-scale domestic exporting  facilities were built to address via conventional liquefied natural gas  tankers.   This bill will help our job creators meet that demand and take full  advantage of our economic opportunities throughout our Western  Hemisphere. And, with the certainty provided by H.R. 4606, companies  currently in operation or those exploring new small-scale possibilities  will be incentivized to move forward with new investments with the  increased certainty provided by H.R. 4606.   This is especially important considering that the Dominican Republic  is the only country in the Caribbean with a free trade agreement that  can get our excess natural gas easily. And, as Puerto Rico continues to  rebuild after the devastating hurricane in 2017, increased shipments  and availability of American small-scale LNG can help the island meet  its energy needs.   H.R. 4606 will also better allow our domestic providers the  opportunity to deliver a stable source of U.S. energy to countries  currently relying on Venezuelan fuel oil, which has been used to gain  influence within countries throughout the region.   This effort to increase U.S. energy opportunities within this area of  the world is not new, as the previous administration also sought  increased engagement through the creation of the Caribbean Energy  Security Initiative. Similarly, the Department of Energy recently  issued a final rule very similar to H.R. 4606.   Now I would like to quickly address a few concerns that we have heard  about this bill during debate. Some of my colleagues have said that the  bill is unnecessary because it would replicate a Department of Energy  regulation that was recently finalized, while at the same time arguing  that this bill would lead to an unrestricted natural gas export policy  with dire consequences.   I disagree with both of those statements, as it is important for  Congress to exercise its authority and not leave policy solely up to  the administration, and this bill by no means promotes an unrestricted  policy. What is telling about these conflicting statements is that they  simply cannot both be true at the same time, and it leads me to  question the sincerity behind the statements.   Additionally, I have heard arguments that this bill could allow  companies to skip the review process for larger projects by splitting  them into smaller pieces.   Now, these LNG companies are building to economies of scale. These  are expensive projects. The financial viability of stacking or  combining many small-scale trains is simply not viable, and the  operating costs would surely cause the cost of gas to be uncompetitive  in the global market.   Madam Chair, the benefits of natural gas exports are clear. As  numerous Department of Energy studies and various independent studies  have concluded, they are a net positive to our U.S. economy. These  studies have found that LNG exports support thousands of American jobs,  many of them within manufacturing.    In fact, the Department of Energy once again highlighted the benefits  of LNG exports with a study it released in June. This study, which is  in addition to four other studies commissioned by the DOE since 2012,  presented additional data that demonstrates how  [[Page H7889]]  LNG exports are a net benefit to our economy.   With U.S. natural gas reserves as large as they are, and with new  technological advancements allowing our producers to access an  increasing amount of natural gas each and every day, it is imperative  that the United States takes full advantage of this important and  abundant energy resource.   H.R. 4606 is a step in that direction. It will strengthen U.S.  geopolitical ties, increase job creation, and promote domestic economic  growth as a result.   Madam Chair, I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting  this important bipartisan legislation today.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment adds an additional  round of DOE hearing and public comment on proposed small-scale LNG  exports. Unfortunately, this amendment is designed to undercut the  important benefits of this legislation, and we simply cannot accept it.   H.R. 4606 was narrowly drafted with bipartisan input throughout the  committee process, as the ranking member knows very well. In fact, at  committee, I worked with Mr. Green and other Democrats on a bipartisan  amendment that ensures that DOE and FERC must fully comply with NEPA  and the Council on Environmental Quality's regulations under this bill.  This means they must evaluate the potential direct and indirect  impacts, consult with other agencies, and, most importantly, receive  public input.   Not only has this idea been vetted through hearings and markup on the  Energy and Commerce Committee, but, additionally, this concept has  already been thoroughly vetted and subjected to a fully transparent  rulemaking process at the Department of Energy, complete with public  comment and input.   We simply want to put this in the right lane. It should be the  Congress that is passing law, not putting it solely in the hands of the  administration.   Today's amendment serves only one purpose, and that is delay.   The purpose of H.R. 4606 is to help the United States fully realize  its economic potential regarding small-scale liquefied natural gas  exports and associated technologies. It will strengthen U.S.  geopolitical ties, increase job creation, and promote domestic economic  growth as a result.   This amendment jeopardizes those goals and it denies nations in the  Caribbean and Latin America the opportunity to have an inexpensive,  reliable source of energy from right here in the United States.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I include letters of support in the  Record.                                          CLNG, Center for Liquefied                                                     Natural Gas,                                                  December 11, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: Regulatory       certainty is vital to U.S. LNG and bipartisan legislation       like the Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act (H.R. 4605)       and The Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act       (H.R. 4606) take steps to provide a clear and straightforward       path for the industry. Providing a certain pathway for U.S.       natural gas to be sold abroad will create thousands of good       paying jobs right here in the United States, generate       millions in tax revenue for the federal, state, and local       governments, and supply our allies and trading partners with       a reliable, clean, safe source of energy.        The United States is awash with natural gas, with more       discoveries almost daily, and in order for the U.S. natural       gas industry to continue to be an engine for growth, reliable       exports offer a perfect solution. Legislation by Congress       that creates a more certain regulatory process enables our       country to capture this narrow window of opportunity to       export LNG internationally and sends a strong signal to our       allies and trading partners that the U.S. is committed to its       role as a global energy leader.        Bi-partisan support for LNG certainty highlights how       important the issue is. Policymakers from both sides of the       aisle can appreciate good paying jobs here at home and energy       choices for allies around the globe. Representatives Johnson       and Ryan have a long history of support for U.S. LNG and we       look forward to working with them and others in the future on       LNG issues.        We urge support for Representative Johnson and Ryan's       Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act and The Ensuring       Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act.            Sincerely,                                                     Charlie Riedl,      Executive Director, Center for LNG.                                   ____                                                           Liuna!,                                                  September 5, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the       500,000 members of the Laborers' International Union of North       America (LIUNA), I want to express our support for H.R. 4606,       Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act, offered by       Representative Bill Johnson of Ohio. This bipartisan bill       amends the Natural Gas Act by granting approval to       applications, without modification or delay, seeking to       export 0.14 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day or less, that do       not require an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an       Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) under the National       Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).        H.R. 4606 solidifies and provides certainty to a recently       enacted rule made by the Department of Energy (DOE) that       mirrors Rep. Johnson's legislation. This cuts the red tape       for small-scale exports and imports of liquefied natural gas.       This bill not only continues to promote our Nation's economic       growth, it also guarantees job security for the thousands of       skilled working men and women we proudly represent within the       energy sector.        LIUNA believes in an all-of-the-above energy policy. Our       members work across virtually every sector of our domestic       energy production. Whether it is solar-panel fields, wind       farms, pipelines, or hydro power, our members are working to       bringing our Nation's abundant energy resources to market.        This legislation has bipartisan cosponsors, and was voted       out of committee with even stronger bipartisan support. I       urge you to support H.R. 4606, Ensuring Small Scale LNG       Certainty and Access Act.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,      General President.                                   ____                                            Citizens for Responsible                                                Energy Solutions,                                  Washington, DC, September 5, 2018.      Speaker Paul Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of Citizens for Responsible       Energy Solutions (CRES), I am writing in support of H.R.       4606, Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act. CRES       urges the House to pass this legislation.        H.R. 4606 would expedite approvals for small-scale exports       and imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) up to 0.14 billion       cubic feet per day if no environmental reviews are required.       The legislation would help modernize U.S. energy policy by       facilitating exports and imports of LNG which is critical as       the U.S continues to position itself as a net energy exporter       over the next decade. The legislation would support the       growth of jobs in the LNG space because of greater certainty       in permitting and because it would allow for the greater use       of LNG terminals already built or under construction. This       economic growth would be achieved without substantively       greater risk to the environment due to a strict adherence to       National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements.        H.R. 4606 is important legislation for growing domestic       jobs and for elevating the U.S.'s position in global energy       markets. We encourage Congress to pass this legislation as       soon as possible.            Sincerely,                                                     Heather Reams,                                                 Managing Director.     Madam Chair, I have before me a letter from the  Center for Liquefied Natural Gas. It says: ``The United States is awash  with natural gas, with more discoveries almost daily, and in order for  the U.S. natural gas industry to continue to be an engine for growth,  reliable exports offer a perfect solution.''   They go on to say: ``Bipartisan support for LNG certainty highlights  how important this issue is.''   I also have a letter here in front of me from LIUNA, and they say  this: ``On behalf of the 500,000 members of the Laborers' International  Union of North America, LIUNA, I want to express our support for H.R.  4606, Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act.''   They go on to say: ``LIUNA believes in an all-of-the-above energy  policy.''   Madam Chair, that is exactly what H.R. 4606 promotes.   I also have a letter here in front of me from Citizens for  Responsible Energy Solutions. There is nobody any more concerned about  our energy policy than the American people. We talk about it here all  the time in Washington, D.C., oftentimes in political terms,  ideological terms, but it is the American people who are going to  benefit from the results of LNG exports, whether it is along the Ohio  River or all across America.   This is a job creator. It is an opportunity creator. It strengthens  our geopolitical ties. And we can't underestimate the strength of that  geopolitical tie factor in what we are doing.   We have countries like Russia that are using their energy resources  to hammer other countries, to use it as a leverage point to force them  into obedience. The last thing that we want is for countries in the  Caribbean and Latin America to have to face going to Russia or other  countries to get their energy resources when they could be getting  those from us.   Right here, this letter from Citizens for Responsible Energy  Solutions says: ``On behalf of Citizens for Responsible Energy  Solutions, CRES, I am writing in support of H.R. 4606, Ensuring Small  Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act. CRES urges the House to pass this  legislation.''   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
