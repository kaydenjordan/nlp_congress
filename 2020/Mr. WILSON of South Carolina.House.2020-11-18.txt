 Mr. Speaker, congratulations to former  Prime Minister Maia Sandu on being elected the new President of Moldova  on Sunday.   Correspondent Corneliu Rusnac has reported, ``Pro-Western candidate  wins Moldovan Presidential election,'' and that ``Maia Sandu, a former  World Bank economist who favors closer ties with the European Union,  has won Moldova's Presidential runoff vote, decisively defeating the  staunchly pro-Russian incumbent, according to preliminary results  released Monday.''   It should always be remembered that Moldova was the first victim of  Putin-maintained aggression by the occupation of Transnistria in 1991,  which was a tragic prelude to the illegal Putin occupation of  territories in the Republic of Georgia in 2008 and eastern Ukraine in  2014, where over 13,000 citizens have died. All three illegal Putin  occupations persist today.   Americans are so grateful for this renewed opportunity to work with  Moldova and congratulate the Moldovan people on their new President.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September 11th in the global war on terrorism.   God bless the people of Moldova.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 8438, the Belarus  Democracy, Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act.   I greatly appreciate Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey for  championing this bill. He is so well known as a visionary for freedom  around the world. I am also proud to join him along with my dear  friend, Chairman Eliot Engel, who has been such a valued champion of  democracy and with whom I had the rare opportunity to visit Pyongyang  in North Korea. Joining us are Representatives Kaptur, Kinzinger, and  Keating as original cosponsors of this important bipartisan piece of  legislation.   There is no question that Alexander Lukashenko rigged the  presidential election in Belarus this past August.   Since then, despite the terror inflicted upon them by the Lukashenko  regime, the Belarusian people have continued to peacefully protest in  historic numbers. And their calls for new free and fair elections are  only getting louder. Their courage is truly inspiring.   The Belarusian people know that a legitimate leader does not need to  use violence, arbitrary detention, or torture to cling to power.   They know that a legitimate leader does not need to curtail freedom  of expression and the right to peaceful assembly to silent dissenting  views   And they know that a legitimate leader does not need to block  independent media, disrupt internet access, and expel and detain  countless journalists to conceal the true scale of opposition to his  rule.   It is far past time Lukashenko comes to understand this as well.   This bill reaffirms that it is the U.S. policy to refuse to recognize  Lukashenko as the legitimate leader of Belarus. It also aims to assist  the Belarusian people in regaining their freedom and restoring the  country's institutions of democratic governments.   Moreover, we know that Vladimir Putin fears democratic movements  rising up against fellow dictators in his backyard. Any Russian move to  undermine the will of the Belarusian people or the country's  independence must be met with severe consequences.   That is why this legislation provides the President with the  necessary tools to hold accountable not only the Belarusian authorities  responsible for the violent crackdown but also their Russian backers.   This bill will create the necessary conditions to allow the  Belarusian people to chart their own future. As such, I urge all  Members to join me in supporting its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5919]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he  may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the very  courageous sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, again, there being no  further speakers, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for over 3 months, we have watched, being inspired, as  the Belarusian people have peacefully demanded that their voices be  heard and that new, free, and fair elections be held.   As we have seen, women dressed in white and carrying flowers have  formed miles-long solidarity chains to protest police violence.  Employees at state-run companies have gone on strike, despite the  threat of losing their jobs. University students have risked expulsion  to join the protests. State TV anchors have walked off the set, no  longer able to support the regime's propaganda campaign. Thousands of  courageous pensioners have marched in opposition to the Belarusian  dictator.   Today, led by the very talented and visionary Congressman Chris  Smith, we must stand and send a strong message to these brave men and  women that they are not alone and that the American people stand with  them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I might consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill which I am grateful to  have introduced with my colleague, Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, the  Ukraine Religious Freedom Support Act.   Russia's war in Ukraine and illegal occupation of Crimea have dragged  on for nearly 7 years. The human toll is staggering. The fighting has  killed as many as 10,000 soldiers as well as 3,000 innocent civilians.   Another casualty of Russian aggression in Ukraine has been the attack  on religious freedom.   Russian occupation authorities in Crimea continue to persecute and  intimidate the minority Christian, Muslim, and other religious groups,  like the Jehovah's Witnesses.   Putin's puppets in Crimea have subjected them to kidnappings,  torture, forced psychiatric examinations, and imprisonment. Recently,  eight Muslim Crimean Tatars were sentenced to between 13 and 19 years  in a Russian prison on the entirely baseless charge of terrorism.   Minority religious groups in the area of eastern Ukraine, controlled  by pro-Putin proxies, have also been forced to flee in order to escape  the oppressive conditions.   The religious persecution in Ukraine being committed at the hands of  Putin authorities is self-destructive and must be stopped.   Throughout our history, the United States has worked tirelessly to  advance religious freedom and protect religious minorities around the  globe. This bill follows that strong tradition by accomplishing two  things.   First, it brings international attention to the grave violations of  religious freedom in the territory of Ukraine--where, again, people  need to know, 13,000 people have been killed--that Putin illegally  occupies or controls through illegal armed groups.   Second, it helps ensure that Vladimir Putin and his cronies are held  accountable.   We cannot allow these grave violations to continue.   In closing, it is vital that the United States continues to be a  leader in advancing international religious freedom around the world.   This bill not only brings international attention to the religious  persecution being committed in the territory of Ukraine that Putin  illegally occupies or controls through illegal armed groups it  commands, but also ensures Vladimir Putin and his thugs are held  accountable.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Helsinki Commission, along with  Congressman and Chairman Alcee Hastings, I would also like to recognize  the Helsinki Commission for long championing this issue. In particular,  I would like to recognize Nathaniel Hurd of the Helsinki Commission  staff for all of his work to ensure that we hold Putin to account for  these egregious violations of religious liberty in Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of another bill I introduced  with my friend and subcommittee colleague Chairman Ted Deutch from  Florida, H.R. 4802.   This bill will expand the Rewards for Justice Program at the State  Department to authorize rewards for individuals coming forward with  information on sanctions evasion practices.   The bill was inspired by Bassam Barabandi, a courageous Syrian  patriot and former diplomat at the Syrian Embassy here in Washington  who worked with the antiregime activists to provide passports to  critics of the criminal Assad regime, promoting the best interests of  the people of Syria.   For years after his defection, Barabandi lobbied the U.S. Government  and provided detailed information on Syrian oligarchs close to Assad  and their sanctions evasion practices, including information on Samer  Foz, who was ultimately sanctioned by the Treasury last year. He has  courageously authored ``The Blacklist,'' which fully documents those  who repress the talented people of Syria.   Barabandi's case highlighted the need to create a clearer mechanism  to incentivize individuals to come forward with this kind of vital  information. H.R. 4802 will do just that. It will ultimately enhance  compliance with U.S. and international sanctions, increase confidence  in the rule of law, and bring criminals and rogue regimes seeking to  circumvent U.S. law to justice.   For sanctions to be successful, we must have the best information on  their ability to hit their intended targets. We must pass many  sanctions bills in this body, but it is far easier to pass a sanctions  bill than it is to enforce it.   Expanding the Rewards for Justice Program will allow us to acquire  information on illegal activity that supports the regimes of Iran,  North Korea, and other rogue states from the grassroots. Better  information equals better enforcement on behalf of the persecuted  persons of those countries. Better enforcement equals better results.   We should pass this bill and help make sure that the sanctions  policies are as effective as possible.   Mr. Speaker, there being no further speakers, again, I thank Bassam  Barabandi for his courage as a patriot for the people of Syria in the  face of the evil Assad regime. He is currently awaiting a decision from  USCIS regarding his request for asylum in the United States, and I hope  and pray that the Department of Homeland Security rewards this hero of  democracy for the people of Syria for his bravery.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7954, the Tropical Forest and  Coral Reef Reauthorization Act of 2020, led by Representative   Steve  Chabot from Ohio and Brad Sherman from California.   Congress first enacted this important legislation in 1998. The  legislation allows eligible developing countries to restructure certain  debt owed to the U.S. Government and, in turn, generates additional  revenue to support tropical forest or coral reef conservation projects.  These agreements also reinvest in locally led civil society and  conservation organizations that take ownership of this critical  restoration work.   According to The Nature Conservancy, agreements under this program  have saved more than 67 million acres of tropical forest in countries  such as Botswana, Brazil, the Philippines, and Indonesia.   Since first enacted, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act has  generated almost $340 million in local currency for tropical forest  conservation projects. These are substantial investments in the health  of our world's most critical forests and an investment in future  generations.   I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4  minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the sponsor of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I yield myself the balance of my time for the purpose of  closing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative   Steve Chabot, who is a proven  champion for conservation and for ecosystems beneficial to countries  around the world for offering this measure. With the expanded authority  to use debt-for-nature agreements to target tropical coral reef  restoration, there is much more work to be done.   This bill will ensure that the policy objectives and programs  outlined in the Republican-led, bipartisan legislation enacted in  December 2018 will be fully operationalized. This is a commonsense  approach that reduces eligible countries' debt burdens while  reinvesting those resources in local tropical forests and coral reef  conservation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
