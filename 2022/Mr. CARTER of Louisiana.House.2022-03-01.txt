 Down in New Orleans where the blues were  born, it takes a cool cat to blow a horn.   Down in LaSalle and Rampart Street, it is Mardi Gras combo with a  mambo beat.   Today is Mardi Gras, and as a New Orleanian, this is a special time  for our city and our region. It is a joyous time culminating today in  the dizzying, colorful explosion that is Mardi Gras Day--Fat Tuesday.  Everywhere else, it is just a Tuesday, but in Louisiana it is Mardi  Gras--a time for merriment, a time for joy, a time to party, and  recognize the culture that makes New Orleans so unique and makes  Louisiana so special.   It is a one-of-a-kind experience. Some might call this biased, but  objectively I think everyone should enjoy and experience Mardi Gras.   Today, people from all over the world come together, krewes of all  stripes and backgrounds work to pull off a day like none other.  [[Page H1183]]    After the challenges of isolation and the pandemic, this year's Mardi  Gras is a chance for us to reunite, reconnect, and celebrate what truly  makes New Orleans, New Orleans--the love, the peace, the culture, and  the energy of its people.   While I am in D.C. for House business and for the President's State  of the Union address, my heart is at home as the Zulu float turns on  Jackson Avenue and the oceans of people scream and yell: Throw me  something, mister. Our hearts are full of joy.   My heart is handing out coconuts at the Zulu parade as we speak,  although I am physically in Washington, D.C.   People attending balls, costuming, and letting everyone be themselves  is what Mardi Gras is all about. It is a time of love, a time of  expression, and a time of cultural explosion.   Happy Mardi Gras to one, happy Mardi Gras to all, have a safe and  happy Mardi Gras. Enjoy the beautiful weather.   For all of you watching, I invite you all to come to Louisiana, have  a slice, have a piece of Mardi Gras. No matter where you are or where  you are from, let's show each other some love this season.   And as we say in Louisiana: Laissez les bon temps rouler.                            ____________________
