 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   This week, our Nation is marking a solemn anniversary, 49 years since  the deadly Roe v. Wade decision.   For nearly half a century, pro-life Americans have been standing  strong to defend precious human life and the most vulnerable among us.   Right now we are facing some tough challenges. Under the current one- party rule in Washington, Americans are witnessing unprecedented  attacks on pro-life protections across the country.   Time and time again, I have come to this floor to oppose Democrats'  radical antilife agenda.   As many times as it takes, I will stand here to reject the attacks on  life, and I will vote ``no'' on taxpayer-funded services, including the  wicked proposal to permit abortion on demand at any time bankrolled by  the American people.   These are dark days in this country.   At the same time we have so much to be happy and hopeful for as we  look at this new year.   The Supreme Court, including my fellow Hoosier, Justice Amy Coney  Barrett, is currently considering the most significant challenge to Roe  v. Wade since 1973.   This could be the final anniversary that we mark under Roe v. Wade.   For five decades, we have been in a long battle against abortion, and  this is the time to restore the dignity of life and protect life once  and for all.   As a pro-life lawmaker, I am proud to stand alongside millions of  Americans in Indiana and across the country who believe in the inherent  value of life.   Our enduring commitment to life and the truth will prevail.
