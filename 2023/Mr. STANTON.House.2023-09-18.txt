 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life and legacy  of a great Phoenician, Frank Barrios.   Frank was a giant among us, a champion for the Latino community, a  renowned conservationist, and a historian who preserved the legacy of  generations gone by.   A second-generation Arizonan, Frank spent his career working to  preserve our most precious resource, water.   As a young hydrologist, he worked for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation  and later the Arizona Department of Water Resources. He played pivotal  roles during key moments in Arizona's water history, from planning the  Central Arizona Project to groundwater management. Even after  retirement, Frank found many ways to serve.   He was appointed by Governor Janet Napolitano to the Central Arizona  Water Conservation District Board of Directors, where he served with  distinction, ensuring that even amidst the State's rapid growth, our  water resources were well managed.   A man of deep faith, he spent his later years caring for our most  vulnerable neighbors as president of the enormously impactful St.  Vincent de Paul Society. Frank knew the healing power of St. Vincent de  Paul.   His deep love for Phoenix was obvious to anyone who had the good  fortune of crossing paths with him, particularly through his work  chronicling and preserving the rich Mexican-American history in the  valley. He fought to restore the historically Latino Sotelo-Heard  Cemetery in south Phoenix, after years of neglect, to honor those who  found eternal rest there.   He is perhaps best known for writing the book ``Mexicans in  Phoenix,'' documenting more than a century of Mexican-American life,  culture, and political activism in our valley. His meticulous research,  gathered oral histories, and archival photographs were endowed to the  Arizona Historical Society, a priceless gift for future generations.   There is no doubt that Frank Barrios lived a full and remarkable  life. What stands out most was not just his achievements on paper but  the way he achieved them--through his unwavering kindness, generosity,  and humility.   We lost Frank at the age of 81 on September 11, 2023, but his  profound legacy will always live on.                            ____________________
