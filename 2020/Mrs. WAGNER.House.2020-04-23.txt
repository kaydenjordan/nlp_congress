 Madam Speaker, I am here today to call on colleagues to  support the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement  Act, legislation that is poised to be a lifeline to my constituents in  Missouri's Second Congressional District during this pandemic.   This bill includes $310 billion in increased funding for the Paycheck  Protection Program, a program that has helped keep open thousands of  Missouri businesses, including Martha's Hands, a St. Louis-based home  healthcare provider with over 200 employees. My office worked with  Martha's Hands to secure these vital PPP funds so that they will be  able to pay their employees and keep their doors open to help the most  fragile in our community.   There are small businesses and workers just like them all over that  are dependent. They are the backbone of our economy.   Madam Speaker, we fought to also include $75 billion for hospitals  and healthcare providers so the frontline healthcare heroes are taken  care of and $25 billion for critical COVID-19 testing so we can better  understand the spread of this virus, to save lives, and to have the  confidence to reopen our communities.   Madam Speaker, I urgently ask everyone to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation.
