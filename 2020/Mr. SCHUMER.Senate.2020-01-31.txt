 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a parliamentary inquiry.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Democratic leader will state the inquiry.    Is the Chief Justice aware that in the impeachment trial  of President Johnson, Chief Justice Chase, as Presiding Officer, cast  tie-breaking votes on both March 31 and April 2, 1868?   The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am, Mr. Leader. The one concerned a motion to  adjourn. The other concerned a motion to close deliberations. I do not  regard those isolated episodes 150 years ago as sufficient to support a  general authority to break ties.   If the Members of this body, elected by the people and accountable to  them, divide equally on a motion, the normal rule is that the motion  fails.   I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from  a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that  result so that the motion would succeed.                              Amendment No. 1295    (Purpose: To subpoena certain relevant witnesses and documents.)    Mr. Chief Justice, I send an amendment to the desk to  subpoena Mulvaney, Bolton, Duffey, Blair, and the White House, OMB,  DOD, and State Department documents, and I ask that it be read.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will report.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S767, January 31, 2020, second column, the following  appears: The CHIEF JUSTICE.
