 Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the  Senior$afe Act, which I am pleased is included in the Economic Growth,  Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. My good friend Senator  Claire McCaskill and I have been working on Senior$afe for several  years now. This bill originated with testimony offered by Maine  Securities Administrator Judith Shaw in a hearing before the Senate  Aging Committee in 2015. I am the chairman of that committee, and  Senator McCaskill was the ranking member at that time. We introduced  the bill that year, and reintroduced it in January of 2017. Today, the  bill is cosponsored by almost a third of this body, balanced nearly  evenly on both sides of the aisle.   I am disappointed to learn that my colleague Senator Warren has filed  an amendment that would seriously undermine the Senior$afe Act by  restricting its provisions just to liability that may arise under the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. If this amendment were to pass, financial  service providers that report suspected frauds against seniors could  still face liability under other laws or causes of action, which would  discourage providers from making these critical reports. I understand  that the proponent of this amendment contends that Senior$afe could  somehow shield a financial service provider from its own fraud. That is  simply not correct.   In order to receive the protections of the Senior$afe Act, financial  service providers must train their employees to spot suspicious  activity that may indicate fraud targeting seniors, and make good  faith, reasonable reports of that suspicious activity to the proper  authorities. The bill is clear that it only shields reporting a  suspected fraud; there is no protection for committing a fraud.   Combating financial abuse of seniors requires consumers, regulators,  law enforcement, and social service agencies at all levels of  government to work collaboratively with the private sector. The stakes  could not be higher. According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting  older Americans is a growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated  $2.9 billion annually. Stopping this tsunami of fraud is one of the top  priorities of the Aging Committee. Over the years, we have held  numerous hearings exposing an endless variety of financial abuses  targeting our Nation's seniors. These range from the notorious IRS  phone scam that burst onto the scene in 2015, to the incredible ``drug  mule'' scam, where trusting seniors have been tricked by international  narcotics traffickers into unwittingly serving as drug couriers, and  then find themselves arrested and locked up in foreign jails.   Just last week, our committee heard the story of Stephen and Rita  Shiman from Saco, ME, who lost more than $1,200 in the notorious  grandparent scam. In this scam, fraudsters call a senior pretending to  be a family member, often a grandchild, and claim to be in urgent need  of money to cover an emergency, medical care, or a legal problem.   Sadly, not all scammers are strangers to their victims--in too many  cases, seniors are exploited by someone they know well. Sometimes, that  abuse is perpetrated by ``friends'' or family members who are handling  the victim's affairs informally. Other times, the abuse is committed  under the color of a fiduciary relationship, such as a power of  attorney or guardianship.   No matter the scheme, one factor is common to all: The fraudsters  gain the trust and cooperation of their victims. Without this, their  schemes would fail. The scammers also push their victims to act fast  and not to tell anyone what they are doing.   Unfortunately, due to the ruthless cunning of the scam artists, many  seniors do not see the red flags that signal fraud. Sometimes they are  too trusting or are suffering from diminished capacity, but just as  often, they miss the signs because the swindlers who prey on them are  extremely crafty and know how to sound convincing. Whatever the reason,  a warning sign that can slip by a victim might trigger a second look by  financial service representatives trained to spot common scams, who  know enough about a senior's habits to question a transaction that  doesn't look right. In our work on the Aging Committee, we have heard  of many instances where quick action by bank and credit union employees  has stopped a fraud in progress, saving seniors untold thousands of  dollars.   Let me give you an example. In 2016, an attorney in the small coastal  city of Belfast, ME, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for bilking  two elderly female clients out of nearly a half a million dollars over  the course of several years.   The lawyer's brazen theft was uncovered when a teller at a local bank  noticed that he was writing large checks to himself on his clients'  accounts.   When confronted by authorities, he offered excuses that the  prosecutor later described as ``breathtaking.'' He submitted bills for  ``services,'' sometimes totaling $20,000 a month, including charging  her $250 per hour for 6 to 7 hours to check on her house, even though  his office was just a 1-minute drive down the road.   In another example, a senior citizen in Vassalboro, ME, was looking  to wire funds from his account at Maine Savings Federal Credit Union to  an out-of-State location, supposedly to bail out a relative who was in  jail. Something about this transaction did not sound right to the  credit union employee. She asked the customer, and he said he had  received a call from an ``official'' at the jail, but that official had  instructed him not to speak to anyone about this. The official, of  course, turned out to be a con artist.   Fortunately, the credit union worker recognized this as a scam, and  her quick thinking saved her customer from falling victim and losing  his savings.   These stories demonstrate the critical nexus that financial  institutions occupy between fraudsters and their victims. Their  employees, if properly trained, can be the first line of defense  protecting our seniors from these criminals. Regrettably, various  Federal laws can inadvertently impede efforts to protect seniors  because financial institutions that report suspected fraud can be  exposed to litigation. The Senior$afe Act encourages financial  institutions to train their employees and shields them from lawsuits  when they make good-faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the  proper authorities.   There is no doubt that financial fraud and scams targeting seniors is  a growing problem. In 2016, the Aging Committee heard testimony from  Jaye Martin, the executive director of Maine Legal Services for the  Elderly, who told the committee that her organization had seen a 24- percent increase in reports of elder abuse in just 1 year. Many of  these cases involve financial fraud.   In a letter describing her support for the Senior$afe Act, Ms. Martin  said that:         In a landscape that includes family members who often wish       to keep exploitation from coming to light because they are       perpetrating the exploitation, the risk of facing potential       nuisance or false complaints over privacy violations is all       too real. This is a barrier that must be removed so that       financial institutions will act immediately to report to the       proper authorities upon forming a reasonable belief that       exploitation is occurring. These professionals are on the       front lines in the fight against elder financial exploitation       and are often the only ones in a position to stop       exploitation before it is too late.    I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Martin's letter be printed in the  Record following my remarks.   Our bill is based on Maine's innovative Senior$afe program, a  collaborative effort by Maine's regulators, financial institutions, and  consumer and legal organizations to educate bank  [[Page S1712]]  and credit union employees on how to identify and help stop financial  exploitation of older Mainers. This program, pioneered by Maine  Securities Administrator Judith Shaw, also serves as the template for  model legislation developed for adoption at the State level by the  North American Securities Administrators Association, or NASAA. The  Senior$afe Act and NASAA's model State legislation are complementary  efforts, and I am pleased that NASAA has endorsed our bill.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter from NASAA regarding the  Senior$afe Act of 2017 be printed in the Record following my remarks.   I am pleased that our bill has received bipartisan support in both  houses of Congress. Besides receiving broad support in Congress, our  bill has the support of a wide range of stakeholders, ranging from the  State securities administrators and insurance commissioners to  advocates for seniors, such as AARP.   The Senior$afe Act encourages financial institutions to train their  employees and shields them from lawsuits when they make good-faith,  reasonable reports of potential fraud to the proper authorities.   I am pleased the Senior$afe Act is included in the bill currently  before the Senate, and I look forward to it finally becoming law.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 Legal Services for the Elderly,                                      Augusta, ME, December 5, 2016.      Re Senior$afe (S 2216).       Senator Susan Collins,      Chair, Senate Special Committee on Aging,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: I want to thank you for inviting me       to speak with the Senate Special Committee on Aging about the       serious problem of financial exploitation of seniors by       guardians and others in a position of power. I also want to       thank you for your leadership in working to ensure there is       training of financial institution employees in reporting       elder abuse and an improvement in the timely reporting of       financial exploitation when it is suspected through passage       of the Senior$afe Act. I strongly support this legislation       that is based upon work done here in Maine.        I served for over two years on the working group that       developed Maine's Senior$afe training program for financial       institution managers and employees. It is a voluntary       training program. Through that work I came to fully       appreciate the very real concerns of the financial industry       regarding the consequences of violating, or being perceived       as violating, the broad range of state and federal privacy       laws that apply to their industry. I also came to appreciate       that absent broad immunity for reporting of suspected       financial exploitation, privacy regulations would continue to       be a barrier to good faith reporting of suspected financial       exploitation. In a landscape that includes family members who       often wish to keep exploitation from coming to light because       they are perpetrating the exploitation, the risk of facing       potential nuisance or false complaints over privacy       violations is all too real.        This is a barrier that must be removed so that financial       institution employees will act immediately to make a report       to the proper authorities upon forming a reasonable belief       that exploitation is occurring. These professionals are on       the front lines in the fight against elder financial       exploitation and are often the only ones in a position to       stop exploitation before it is too late.        I want to add that tying the grant of immunity to required       training for not just supervisors, compliance officers, and       legal advisors, but to all who come in contact with seniors       as a part of their regular duties, will have the direct       result of bringing more cases of exploitation to the timely       attention of the proper authorities because it will       significantly increase the knowledge and awareness in the       industry of the red flags for elder abuse. In Maine, where       our training program is entirely voluntary and carries no       legal status or benefit, we have already seen what a       difference training can make.        Senior$afe is a much needed step in the fight against       financial exploitation of seniors and there is no doubt it       will make our nation's seniors safer. I thank you again for       your leadership in this important area.            Sincerely,                                                    Jaye L. Martin,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                           North American Securities                                Administrators Association, Inc.,                                   Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.      Re The Senior$afe Act of 2017.       Senator Susan Collins,      Chair, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington,           DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the North American       Securities Administrators Association (``NASAA''), I am       writing to express strong support for your work to better       protect vulnerable adults from financial exploitation through       the introduction of the Senior$afe Act of 2017. Your       legislation will better protect persons aged 65 and older       from financial exploitation by increasing the likelihood it       will be identified by financial services professionals, and       by removing barriers to reporting it, so that together we as       state securities regulators and other appropriate       governmental authorities can help stop it.        Senior financial exploitation is a growing problem across       the country. Many in our elderly population are vulnerable       due to social isolation and distance from family, caregiver,       and other support networks. Indeed, evidence suggests that as       many as one out of every five citizens over the age of 65 has       been victimized by a financial fraud. To be successful in       combating senior financial exploitation, state and federal       policymakers must come together to weave a new safety net for       our elderly, breaking down barriers for those who are best       positioned to identify red flags early on and to encourage       reporting and referrals to appropriate local, county, state,       and federal agencies, including law enforcement.        The Senior$afe Act consists of several essential features.       First, to promote and encourage reporting of suspected       elderly financial exploitation by financial services       professionals, who are positioned to identify and report       ``red flags'' of potential exploitation, the bill would       incentivize financial services employees to report any       suspected exploitation by making them immune from any civil       or administrative liability arising from such a report,       provided that they exercised due care, and that they make       these reports in good faith. Second, in order to better       assure that financial services employees have the knowledge       and training they require to identify ``red flags''       associated with financial exploitation, the bill would       require that, as a condition of receiving immunity, financial       institutions undertake to train certain personnel regarding       the identification and reporting of senior financial       exploitation.        The Senior$afe Act's objectives and benefits are far-      reaching. Older Americans stand to benefit directly from such       reporting, because early detection and reporting will       minimize their financial losses from exploitation, and       because improved protection of their finances ultimately       helps preserve their financial independence and their       personal autonomy. Financial institutions stand to benefit,       as well, through preservation of their reputation, increased       community recognition, increased employee satisfaction, and       decreased uninsured losses.        In conclusion, state securities regulators strongly support       passage of the Senior$afe Act of 2017. Please do not hesitate       to contact me, or Michael Canning, NASAA Director of Policy,       if we may be of any additional assistance.            Sincerely,                                                   Mike Rothman,                                       NASAA President and Minnesota                                          Commissioner of Commerce.
