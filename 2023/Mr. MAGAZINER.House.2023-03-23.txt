 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an  extraordinary Rhode Island veteran, Duilio ``Dewey'' Turilli.   Born in Italy, Dewey immigrated to this country when he was only 6  years old. Shortly thereafter, he and his family settled in Rhode  Island. After graduating from Central High School in Providence, Dewey  was drafted as a radio operator for the 457th Fighter Squadron, a P-51  Mustang unit in the Army Air Force.   Dewey's base was the notorious island of Iwo Jima, and he was present  when U.S. forces raised the flag there on February 23, 1945, which also  happens to be Dewey's birthday.   Mr. Speaker, 78 years later, just one month ago, Dewey celebrated his  100th birthday surrounded by friends and family.   An avid golfer and painter, Dewey now resides in Warwick, Rhode  Island, where he is an active member of the local veterans support  group.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to please join me in saluting Dewey and  thanking him for his tremendous service to our Nation.                            ____________________
