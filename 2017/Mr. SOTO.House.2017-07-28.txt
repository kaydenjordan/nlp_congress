 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce a resolution for Tom  Flores urging he be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.   Tom Flores had an outstanding and successful career, both as a  quarterback and as a head coach. This resolution pays tribute to his  inspiring athletic talents.   Flores became the first Hispanic starting quarterback in professional  football history and played on two Super Bowl-winning teams. Also, he  was the first Hispanic head coach to win two Super Bowls, a feat he  accomplished on two separate teams, and he became the first Hispanic  manager in the National Football League. He left with an impressive  lifetime record and an 8-3 playoff record.   Tom has been a trailblazer for Hispanics in the NFL and has motivated  a generation of new players by showing they can compete and win. Let's  enter this trailblazer into the Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
