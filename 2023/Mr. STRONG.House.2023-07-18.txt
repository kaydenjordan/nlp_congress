 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jody Singer,  director of Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, on her  upcoming retirement following 38 years of dedicated leadership to NASA.   Director Singer's leadership, expertise, and vision were vital to the  success of the International Space Station, the James Webb Telescope,  the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer mission, the DART mission, the  Space Launch System development, and the Artemis I mission. It is also  with great pride that I commend her in leading over 110 space shuttle  launches.   For over three decades, she has advocated for human spaceflight,  science and technology development, and deep space exploration.   As an industrial engineer, she possesses the technical skills  necessary to excel in advanced exploration projects, science flight  mission programs, and technology demonstration missions. Through two  NASA fellowships, she also gained expertise in business operations,  project management, and executive leadership.   I congratulate Director Singer for her service to our community and  dedication to the future of space exploration. I have no doubt that her  successor will continue to advocate for Marshall. Together, we will  continue to uphold the Rocket City's legacy of human systems  development, scientific discovery, and technological advancements.                            ____________________
