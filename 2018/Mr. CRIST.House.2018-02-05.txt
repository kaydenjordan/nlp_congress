 Mr. Speaker, I rise to tell the story of a young teen who  came to our country with nothing but hope for a better future. No  English, no money, just a dream. This story may sound familiar, but it  is special to me. It is a story of my grandfather, Adam Christodoulos.   The story of America is a story of immigrants. Now we have a whole  new generation of immigrants who embody our American values: family,  hard work, service, love for the United States, and dreams for the  future.   Without immigrants, from the construction worker in St. Petersburg to  the CEO in Clearwater, there is no middle class. Let's remember the  golden rule, treating all of God's children the way we want to be  treated, fairly and with compassion.   Mr. Speaker, let's pass a clean Dream Act today. We have the votes.  We just need the will.                            ____________________
