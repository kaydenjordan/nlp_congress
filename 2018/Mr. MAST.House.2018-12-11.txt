 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for yielding me the  time and for his continued leadership on this critical issue. It has  been an honor to serve with him and to learn from him. Absolutely, I  couldn't say that more seriously. It has been an honor.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in support of H. Res. 1165. It is a  resolution condemning the Assad regime and its backers, including Iran  and Russia, for their continued support of war crimes and crimes  against humanity in Syria.   Now, after 7 years of war, as was already mentioned, the deaths of  more than half a million people have occurred. Now, let's do a little  bit of math on that. That would be over 70,000 people each year. When  you think of the march of killing each and every day, that is a  government march by the Assad regime of killing over 200 people every  single day of the year.   The atrocities of the Assad regime are still ongoing with the help of  Russia and Iran. And what do these atrocities look like: burning  individuals to death, having them buried under rubble, having an adult  put a 7.62 Kalashnikov round into a child, the use of chemical devices.  The United States must push for an end to this and must push to hold  these perpetrators accountable.   Currently, Iran is estimated to have deployed over 3,000 Islamic  Revolutionary Guard Corps soldiers into the area. Iran is also  responsible for directing Hezbollah and other militia fighters to  battle on behalf of the regime.   Should Iran be allowed to maintain a permanent military presence in  Syria, it will pose an even greater threat to Israel, to Jordan, and to  all United States interests in the region.   This resolution calls upon the President and the Secretary of State  to work towards a sustainable political transition in Syria and a  strategy to stop a permanent Iranian presence in the region.                                time  1530    The resolution also condemns the Russian Federation, which has  deployed more than 68,000 Russian personnel, for their continued  support of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria.   H. Res. 1165 reiterates Congress' opposition to U.S. assistance to  government-controlled areas in Syria.   Mr. Speaker, the United States must continue to work with our  partners to condemn the Assad regime's horrific abuses against the  Syrian people and counter Iran and Russia's malign influence in the  region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this critical  resolution.
