 Mr. Speaker, this entire charade is ridiculous.   Speaker Johnson is about to send Members of Congress home for the  rest of the year. Instead of lowering costs for families before the  holidays or protecting women's freedom to make their own health  decisions, House Republicans are taking orders from Donald Trump to  force through a partisan, political impeachment with no evidence, no  witnesses, and no wrongdoing on behalf of the President.   Meanwhile, as we speak, Kate Cox, a pregnant woman from Texas, is  being forced to flee her home as Republican leaders try to force her to  carry to term her baby, who was diagnosed with a terrible condition  that would result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or death soon after  birth.   We could have come to the floor today to pass legislation like the  Women's Health Protection Act to protect women like Kate Cox and to  prevent that kind of physical harm and trauma from being inflicted on  women living under Republican abortion bans, but House Republicans  choose impeachment. The American people won't forget.
