 Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be here with my partner,  Congresswoman Jayapal from the State of Washington, and we are running  the Progressive Caucus Special Order hour.   We are delighted to kick off this session, which is about the  extraordinary revelations this week and some breathtaking developments  in Washington, with a statement by our distinguished colleague from  Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for those  extremely thoughtful and lucid remarks. I also wish to associate myself  with the idea that, here on this issue, we cannot act purely as  partisans. I suppose I can make a partisan speech with the best of  them, but we are called upon during these very trying days to speak not  as partisans but as patriots and as constitutional patriots.   I have been a professor of constitutional law for 27 years at  American  [[Page H4348]]  University's Washington College of Law, and I am aware that the  Founders of this country were determined to see that while we acted as  partisans in the normal push and pull of legislative politics, when it  comes to the basic character of our democracy, all of us try to need to  act in a way that is consistent with the constitutional values that  unify us.   Thomas Jefferson said: ``If I could not go to heaven but with a  party, I would not go there at all.''   And George Washington said that we should never forget that the word  ``party'' comes from the French word ``partie.'' One part, each party  is one part of the whole, and we have to try to keep our mind focused  on the whole thing.   Well, the whole country is in danger right now. The events of the  last week have been breathtaking and extraordinary. So let's take a  moment to try to catch our breath to remember what is really at stake  with the Russian connection, with the firing of National Security  Advisor Michael Flynn after 24 days, with the firing of FBI Director  James Comey this week after he refused to drop the investigation into  Michael Flynn, and the Russian connection.   All of this is about, in the big picture, an organized and systematic  assault on the American form of government and our Democratic political  institutions.   During the 2016 Presidential election, 17 of our U.S. intelligence  agencies, including the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the  Defense Intelligence Agency, and more than a dozen of others, got  together and produced a report where they said, with a very high degree  of certainty, that Vladimir Putin and Russian agents had an organized  campaign orchestrated to engage in cyber espionage of the United States  of America and our political institutions, and cyber sabotage of our  political institutions with paid operatives working to disseminate fake  news and propaganda, and to engineer leaks of mixtures of real emails  mixed in with fake news, and so on.   All of it meant to throw the Presidential election, to destroy the  chances of Hillary Clinton, and to destabilize American political  democracy. We know that this modus operandi was used before the 2016  election in America, and it was used again after, as recently as the  election in the Netherlands with Mr. Wilders, who was the favorite of  Vladimir Putin, and then again in France with Marine Le Pen and the  National Front where Mr. Putin and his operatives did a data dump the  weekend before the French Presidential election.   Right before the blackout on campaigning, they again orchestrated  hacks of the Macron campaign, and then tried to put out, again, a  complete disinformation package on behalf of Le Pen.   Well, the intelligence agencies warned us that this was just a dress  rehearsal for 2020. This is what Vladimir Putin is doing. He is trying  to organize every dictator, despot, and kleptocrat on Earth together to  destroy the liberal democracies, from the outside and from the inside.    Now, militarily, he is no match for the United States of America.  Economically, he is no match for the United States of America.  Intellectually, in terms of our political institutions and the  democracy we have built, our Constitution, he is no match for America.   But he perceives a weakness, and the weakness is all about the  internet because the internet links the whole world together. And if he  can use the internet in order to hack into our institutions, both our  party institutions and our election systems, and the media, and  political campaigns, and then use that to sew confusion and propaganda,  then he may, indeed, be able to gain control over the direction of our  country, the sovereign people of America.   We were warned in that intelligence agency report, which is public,  which everybody can find online, that this is their plan. It wasn't as  if 2016 was a one-shot deal. This is exactly what Putin will continue  to do.   So that is the background. Now, why is the firing of FBI Director  James Comey so disturbing? He, of course, had a 10-year term, which was  abruptly and suddenly cut off by President Trump after Comey told him-- according Comey's account, at least--that he would refuse to drop the  investigation into Michael Flynn.   There are lots of people involved in this Russian connection story,  including Page, and Stone, and Manafort, and Jared Kushner that go way  beyond what we can talk about here tonight. But I just want to focus  for the moment on Flynn.   Why is this sequence of events so disturbing? Well, it came out this  week also that the Trump transition team, headed by none other than  Vice President Pence, knew that Flynn was under criminal investigation  at the time that they decided to hire him as America's National  Security Advisor. At a point when they decided to make him America's  number one national security operative, they knew he was under criminal  investigation for being a paid operative of the Turkish Government, a  paid agent of the Turkish Government. And nonetheless, they brought him  on.   And then when it was learned from the Acting Attorney General Sally  Yates that Mr. Flynn was vulnerable to blackmail by Russians for having  misled Vice President Pence about his entanglement with the Russian  Ambassador and his conversations with the Russian Ambassador, still  they kept him on. So they brought him on, knowing he was under  investigation, then they knew he lied about his connections to the  Russians, and still they kept him on.   When the media finally broke the story of Flynn's collusive actions  with foreign governments while he was the National Security Agency  Director, Trump finally fired him, grudgingly, let him go, but said  that Flynn was the victim somehow, and even tried to disassociate  himself from the firing of Flynn.   Then we learn that the President tried to get the FBI Director James  Comey to drop the investigation. Now, that is according to the FBI  Director James Comey, who has never been accused of lying or perjury.  So it is going to be his word against that of the President of the  United States, who has said things like: Well, Ted Cruz' father  participated in the assassination of JFK; and 5 million people voted  illegally in the United States, with no evidence at all; and Barack  Obama was born in Kenya, or Indonesia; and he had his phones tapped,  and so on.   And so that issue might come down to a swearing contest between the  former Director of the FBI, Mr. Comey, and President Trump. But in any  event, according to Comey, Trump said to him: Will you let it go? Will  you let the investigation of Flynn go? And Comey said he would not. And  then Comey was let go instead.   So the question is: What does Michael Flynn know that everybody bends  over backwards in the Trump administration to try to please him and  placate him?   This is an administration that doesn't mind insulting our longest and  most cherished allies in the world: NATO, which he has said is  obsolete; Mexico, which he has had no problem insulting and affronting;  Australia; and so on. Yet with Michael Flynn, everybody is tiptoeing.  Everybody is doing a tap dance. What does Michael Flynn know about  President Trump? It would seem as if he has got some kind of  information about the President that the President doesn't want to get  out there.   That is why a special counsel had to be appointed, and I am glad a  special counsel was appointed. And I believe that Mr. Mueller is up to  the task. And he has been known as a straight shooter, and a  nonpartisan, someone who will follow the facts where they will go.   Well, in the meantime, we have got to look at the much broader issue.  Because, of course, that is about the criminal deeds or actions of  particular people. And some people may end up facing prosecution for  what they did. But there is a much larger issue here. Because as a  country, we have got to stand up for strong democracy all over the  world.   But what is happening with all of these shenanigans, and sinister  contacts and connections with the Turkish Government, and the Russian  Government, and Orban in Hungary, and the killer dictator Duterte in  the Philippines who orders that people he thinks are drug users should  be shot on  [[Page H4349]]  sight in his country, who has been invited to the White House by  President Trump?   Well, our country has got to stand up for what is great about our  country: our Constitution and our Bill of Rights. President Trump said  this is a witch hunt. But I want to close by telling you about a real  witch hunt that is going on right now on the planet Earth.   And if we were not so distracted by the spreading staph infection in  the White House, we would be able to help in terms of this situation.  And I refer to you an article that was in the newspaper a couple of  days ago in The New York Times about the governor of Jakarta, one of  the largest cities in Indonesia.                                time  1730    He is Christian. He is the Governor of Jakarta. Someone was running  against him and said that all the Muslims should vote against him  because he is Christian. They should have to vote for a Muslim because  the Koran tells them to. The governor objected.   Mr. Basuki said: That is not right. The Koran doesn't say that  Muslims must vote for Muslims. Muslims can vote for me, even though I  am a Christian.   He was prosecuted, arrested for blasphemy against the Koran, against  Islam, and sentenced to 2 years hard time in a maximum security prison  in Indonesia.   In America, where we have a First Amendment and freedom of  conscience, free exercise of religion, separation of church and State,  we got rid of blasphemy a long time ago. But now we have got a human  being--a governor, no less--who is in prison for hard time in  Indonesia, one of our allies. We should not let that stand.   There are hundreds of people all over the Earth who are in prison for  blasphemy or apostasy or heresy--religious offenses--and we are saying  nothing about it. In Russia itself, there were just marches a month ago  against political corruption and authoritarianism. Tens of thousands of  people. Our government did nothing. Why? Some of them are on the  payroll of Russian autocrats, and others just don't care.   We should be on the side of the people of Russia who are fighting for  democracy, fighting for religious freedom, fighting for human rights.  That is what America should be about. That is what is really at stake  here.   Our government should not be consumed with self-interest and  promoting people's corporate agendas. It should not be consumed with  the personal vanity of the President. It should not be about private  agendas. It should be about the public good of the American people and  standing with democracies all over the Earth.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
