 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, every day when I anticipate the Agriculture appropriations  bill coming to the floor, I wake up with my usual admonition that this  is the day that the Lord has made. Let us rejoice and be glad in it.   Today as we take up this Agriculture appropriations bill, it  stretches my faith to say that this is a good day because I rise in  very, very strong opposition to H.R. 4368.   As the ranking member of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee,  I am extremely disappointed to see this bill does not meet the needs of  Americans who rely on this funding to ensure safe food and medicines,  healthy and resilient farmlands, and strong rural infrastructure.   The programs contained in the Agriculture funding bill are important  for all Americans, and they affect our country in so many ways.   These programs help Americans by helping American farmers produce the  highest quality, safest, most abundant, and most economical food and  fiber in the world through the assistance provided through the Farm  Service Agency in almost every county in America.   They help future generations by funding conservation practices, which  preserve our farmland and our national resources for years to come.   These programs are essential to those who live in rural areas and  ensure quality of life through access to clean drinking water,  electricity, telecommunication, broadband, sewer infrastructure, and  housing.   They help feed every American, including our most vulnerable  families, children, and seniors in difficult times.   They fund USDA meat and poultry inspectors and FDA inspectors of all  other food products so that the food on Americans' tables is safe and  nutritious. It funds the CFTC and the Farm Credit Administration, so  this bill affects our financial space.   I cannot think of a funding subcommittee with as broad a reach as our  bill has. A bill with such a broad reach deserves to have these  programs adequately funded.   However, the bill passed in our full committee markup only provided  $17.8 billion in funding, which takes us back to the 2007 funding  level.   That is entirely inadequate for the needs of the American people, and  it had no chance of being passed into law when it came out of  committee.  [[Page H4507]]    Unfortunately, rather than moving in a more productive direction, the  majority used a procedural gimmick to impose even greater cuts of 69  percent to the Food for Peace program and 14.2 percent to all other  discretionary programs.   Instead of improving the bill, the Rules Committee made it even  worse. In total, the cuts to the bill have reduced funding 41 percent  lower than last year. The bill before us today will take us back to  2001 levels. That is totally irresponsible.   The bill will harm rural America by taking money from programs  supporting rural communities such as it cuts $500 million from the  Rural Energy for America Program, the REAP program, and it eliminates  grants under the program, which will raise the energy costs for over  15,000 rural farmers and small businesses.   It takes $1 billion from rural electric cooperatives, 900  cooperatives that serve over 40 million people in 48 States.   It slashes $800 million from the WIC program, which drastically also  cuts the cash value voucher benefit for fruit and vegetable purchases,  affecting nearly 5 million hungry women and children.   It strips loan assistance needed by 100,000 economically distressed  farmers, which could literally cost folks the family farm.   It cuts rural development programs by over 40 percent, which means  thousands of rural families will no longer be able to get a loan to  afford a home.   Hundreds of projects meant to provide clean water and wastewater  systems will be eliminated, and thousands of families will not be able  to turn on the tap and count on drinkable water.   It completely guts the Food for Peace international food aid program.  It cuts the McGovern-Dole program by 14 percent, which will further  exacerbate the global hunger and instability and the risk of conflicts  abroad, which will weaken American security.   The bill also strips the Secretary, as you have heard, of  discretionary use of the Commodity Credit Corporation funding.   The CCC is a tool authorized by law to benefit our farmers and the  thousands of church and community food banks that it helps to fund.   No matter which party is in the White House, the only folks that  suffer when any administration is not allowed to use the CCC at its  discretion are our ag producers and American families.   Our farmers benefited tremendously under the Trump administration  when Secretary of Agriculture Perdue used the CCC to give our farmers  relief from the trade wars with China.   As I look at it, the path this bill has taken so far and the proposed  amendments that we will see tonight would make it even worse.   I ask myself for any farmers that are watching tonight who are trying  to do what is best for their land, for their businesses and their  family, what will they see?                                time  2045    For people in rural communities facing the challenges of providing  clean water, affordable housing, and dependable utilities, what will  they see?   For those same communities trying to ensure that their law  enforcement and first responders have the vehicles, the communications  equipment, and the other resources they need to keep their rural  communities safe, what will they see?   For struggling families trying to put food on the table for their  children, what will they see?   Sadly, if those Americans are watching us tonight, what they will see  is a majority which is focused on overriding medical science to take  away a woman's freedom to control their own reproductive health  choices, but not a majority focused on ensuring that those women and  their children are able to afford food.   They will see a majority that is focused on an undefined so-called  critical race theory while pushing this bill to jeopardize the safety  of our food and our medicine, slowing down our supply chain, and  ironically, making these things harder to get and more expensive to  buy.   Make no mistake, the majority would have a person who is watching at  home to believe that this bill fights against some undeserving citizens  who don't need the help. The hard truth is that this bill is a nuclear  bomb against the needs of every single American.   The majority wants the people to be distracted by their culture war  while they cut the crucial programs that every American depends on for  the safest, the highest quality of affordable food, fiber, and medicine  in the world. It appears that tonight we will see more amendments from  the majority that further push the bill in a terribly harmful  direction.   It astonishes me that we are 4 days away from a government shutdown,  yet we are not debating a bipartisan bill to keep the government open.  Instead, we are debating an extreme messaging bill that does nothing to  bring us closer to the bipartisan agreement we will need to eventually  pass a 4-year government spending bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  craft a responsible bill that meets the needs of all Americans.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my personal staff, including Tynesha Boomer,  and the subcommittee staff, including Martha Foley, Alex Swann, and  Tyler Coe for their hard work on this bill. I thank the majority staff  for their efforts. I pray that the majority Members of Congress and the  majority of Congress will have an epiphany and deliver a much better  work product to the American people by the end of this funding process.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, let me just say that we are in this deficit situation  largely because we don't collect the revenue from the people who owe  taxes, the wealthy millionaires and billionaires that the Republican  majority is protecting by not funding enough agents to collect the  money for the Internal Revenue Service so that we can fund the  government.   We wouldn't have the deficit that we have today were they willing to  put sufficient agents on the job to be able to collect the money that  is lawfully due. People should pay their taxes and they shouldn't  protect those tax cheats.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree), the ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee, and a member of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Energy  and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, and a member  of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  [[Page H4509]]  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Every time I hear Republicans talk, they are talking about the cost  of everything going up. Assuming, which is not true, that the $6  billion is the same as the last year, they say over and over and over  how much the cost of living has gone up, how much more it costs to buy  groceries. That is what they talk about every single day when they are  not talking about what they want to slash.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and a hardworking  member of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I hope that the people who are watching tonight will take note of the  fact that they don't have to take our word for it. The Congressional  Budget Office has scored this bill, and they have  [[Page H4510]]  scored the manager's amendment. The gentleman says that the bill is $22  billion. After the amendments that they are going to be offering on  this bill tonight, CBO has scored it at $15.1 billion. It is clearly  not what he is representing. After the manager's amendment, which is  the first amendment that we will be considering tonight, the CBO has  scored this bill at $15.1 billion, which is a drastic cut to the needs  of the American people.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Pocan), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Budzinski).    Mr. Chair, over the past two decades, our  country and the agriculture industry have grown. Our population has  grown, yet this bill initially withdrew funding for America's  agriculture, as you have heard, back to 2006 funding levels with an  allocation of $17.1 billion, which is nearly $8 billion below last  year's enacted bill.   Sadly, we are here tonight with a bill that the majority made even  worse this past weekend by gutting Congress' commitment to American  farmers, producers, rural communities, and families to levels last seen  in 2001. This bill keeps moving in the wrong direction.   Also, many of the amendments that we will be debating tonight, which  lower this allocation much lower than the American people need, will be  an attempt to circumvent the ongoing negotiations in the House  authorizing committee, the Agriculture Committee, which is working so  desperately to get our farmers, our rural communities, and our lenders  in America our 2023 farm bill, which is the blueprint that our farmers  and our stakeholders need to plan for agriculture in America going  forward.  [[Page H4511]]    This will jeopardize the consensus that we hope to build and to pass  for the 2023 farm bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to defeat this bill. Let's send it  back to the committee, and let's begin to put together a better work  product for the American people.   This bill is a disgrace. It really does not rise to the level that  the American people deserve. We have to continue to keep our farmers  and Americans in a position to consume and produce the highest quality,  the safest, the most abundant food and fiber anywhere, and to have the  safest medications and medical devices.   Mr. Chair, I urge us to defeat this. We need to do better, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this  amendment. This amendment includes 42 amendments--5 bipartisan, 17  Republican, 20 Democratic.   The agriculture funding bill has historically been a bipartisan bill,  and we will need to channel that same cooperation if my colleagues want  to pass appropriations bills into law.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering the amendments and his  cooperation in having this bipartisan en bloc amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Vermont (Ms. Balint).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. Perez).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. The amendment would cut funding for the Office of the Chief  Economist by an additional 46 percent. That is almost half.   The Office of the Chief Economist provides advice and counsel to the  Secretary on matters affecting the economy with respect to the  Agriculture Department. This bill already guts funding for USDA. Any  further cuts just make a bad bill worse.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is a bad amendment. It is  bad for the country. It is bad for the USDA.   Mr. Chair, I urge defeat of this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, when you cut the energy  assistance programs for our farmers and our rural communities, you  raise the cost of their production. When you raise the cost of their  production, you raise the cost of the products they produce to put on  the shelves of the grocery stores. This is not a good thing, so I urge  the defeat of this amendment, and I urge the defeat of this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would cut funding  for the Office of Civil Rights at USDA by an additional 19 percent. The  bill already guts funding for USDA. Any further cuts would just make a  bad bill worse.   The Office of Civil Rights at USDA is there for one purpose, and that  is to make sure that every American has an equal opportunity to access  the programs of USDA regardless of race, regardless of gender,  regardless of national origin.   USDA over the past decades has been required to pay billions of  dollars to folks who were stakeholders who were denied equal  opportunities to access these programs. If we cut this, we will be  hamstringing the ability of USDA to do the right thing. We want to stop  this before it spreads. It has already done too much damage to access  for minorities, for women, and for various ethnic minorities, so we  must fund this office.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. It is another  amendment that does nothing to serve farmers, nothing to serve rural  America, and it has no place in this bill. We should fund the USDA in a  way that makes its programs accessible and available to every single  American.   Mr. Chair, I urge that this amendment be rejected, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  2145     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment. It will cut funding for the Natural Agricultural  Statistics Service and the Census of Agriculture by an additional 8  percent.   This bill already cuts too much funding from USDA, and any further  cuts, again, will make a bad bill worse.   The Office of National Agricultural Statistics Service and the Census  of Agriculture serve very important functions.   The American people need to know--we need to know what we grow; we  need to know who is producing what we grow; we need to know where it is  grown; we need to know what the country will need.   This office provides very important data that informs us; it informs  governmental entities; it informs our private sector; it informs the  consumers. We don't need any more cuts here.   I urge Members to defeat this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in very strong opposition to  this amendment.   Cutting funding for the National Institute of Food and Agriculture by  an additional 17 percent is penny-wise and pound-foolish.   The bill already guts funding for USDA, but the NIFA, the National  Institute for Food and Agriculture provides grants for research to our  colleges and universities, and particularly the 1890s institutions that  were created under the Second Morrill Act.   This is a very useful agency. It provides essential research, the  tool that keeps American agriculture on the cutting edge. In America,  we produce the safest, the highest quality of food and fiber anywhere  in the industrialized world, and we do it because we fund research.   Our research is cutting edge. Why would we cut it by 17 percent? We  need research like we never needed it before because of the climate  challenges that we are facing. We have got challenges that we must  overcome in order to continue to produce the food to feed the people in  this country and around the world.   This research is essential, and we need to continue to fund it. We  don't need this 17 percent cut.   I urge the defeat of this amendment. Let's defeat this amendment, and  let's pass a useful bill that is responsible that meets the needs of  the American people and the American producers.   Mr. Chair, I urge that this amendment be defeated, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, these amendments just go to  undermine the ability of USDA to do what it is supposed to do for the  American people.   This is another amendment that cuts funding, and if you keep cutting  funding, you will totally make this agency unable to deliver on its  promises to the American people.   Mr. Chair, it is a bad amendment. It is a cut that doesn't need to  happen. I urge opposition, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   Cutting funding for the Natural Resources Conservation Service by an  additional 8 percent will just, again, make it worse.   This is a very important agency. It provides very valuable services  to our communities as well as to our farmers. You have a number of  programs that are so vitally important.   They have the conservation innovation programs.   They have the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, which helps  farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners to integrate conservation into  their working lands.   They have the grants that support the development of new tools and  new approaches, practices and technologies to further our natural  resources conservation on private lands.   They have the Conservation Stewardship Program, which builds on  conservation efforts to strengthen the farmers' operations.   They have the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, which is a  Federal emergency recovery program that helps local communities recover  after natural disasters strike. Look at what we have endured over the  past year, the past 2 years. Communities have been struck by floods,  wildfires, and hurricanes.   We have problems, and the Watershed Rehabilitation Program is there.  It needs to be fully funded, particularly this year with what we have  experienced with climate change.   They have watershed and flood prevention programs, the wetland  reserve easements. We have to help with this. We have to protect our  forests and, of course, the forest programs and the grazing funds for  our livestock.   This is just penny-wise and pound-foolish. We must protect the  conservation programs because they protect our environment and our  farmers and help them to be sustainable.   Mr. Chair, this is a bad amendment. I urge its rejection, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  2215     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this bill, our funding bill, funds  rural America. We, as Members of Congress, ought to be committed to  ensuring that people who live in rural communities are not  disadvantaged simply because of their rural ZIP Code.   I urge us to defeat this amendment because affordable, decent housing  is something that every American ought to have access to regardless of  where he or she lives.   Of course, this funding for rural America is comparable to the same  programs that urban Americans have access to. It provides support for  families so that they can afford to have decent housing.   To cut this is to punish people who need help for decent housing and  who happen to live in rural America. This is something we should not  do.   Rural Americans should have the same opportunities to realize the  American Dream as any other American anyplace they live.   Mr. Chair, I urge the defeat of this amendment. It is a bitter, nasty  amendment that hurts people who need a hand up.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment should be  defeated. It will cut funding for the Rural Business-Cooperative  Service by an additional 44 percent.   Agricultural cooperatives provide effective marketing and local  supplies and services to their member-owners. Cooperatives bring  electricity, eConnectivity, affordable housing, capital, financial  services, telecommunications, healthcare, food, hardware, building  supplies, and countless other goods and services for people who live in  rural communities.   An example for electricity: There are 900 co-ops, electric membership  cooperatives, that serve 42 million people in this country in 48 of the  50 States, and they cover 51 percent of the land area in the United  States of America.                                time  2230    We need the Rural Business-Cooperative Service to help support these  rural co-ops that help bring business and help marketing in our rural  communities.   Agriculture is a very, very lucrative business, it happens in our  rural communities for the most part, and we need this cooperative  service and we need the support for it.   Mr. Chair, this is a bad amendment. It is penny-wise and pound- foolish, and I urge its defeat.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I certainly rise in opposition to  this amendment. The amendment would reduce funding for the Foreign  Agriculture Service, which reduces the services promoting United States  agricultural exports, developing overseas markets, and increasing  global food security.   This cut would directly harm American farmers because they would have  less opportunities to market their commodities abroad. There is already  a 14.15 percent cut from the House levels imposed by the majority in  this bill, and these cuts would only further harm our American farmers.   Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think it is interesting to  hear the discussion about a $2 trillion deficit when that was created  by the tax cut that they passed in the last administration--$2 trillion  because they cut the taxes and reduced the amount of revenue. Come on.   You balance the budget with revenues as well as with spending  reductions. Let's be real here. This is just a subterfuge. We need to  defeat this amendment and we need to move forward and try to produce an  agriculture bill that really addresses the needs of the American people  in 2023.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   As a reminder, the bill already cuts the Food for Peace program by 69  percent from the level passed in the full committee. During a time of  increased need and difficult decisions ahead for prioritizing funding  from this program, this amendment would further cut Food for Peace.  Additionally, today, we have already considered three other stand-alone  amendments to cut the program.   I not only oppose this amendment due to its effects on people without  food security across the globe, I also oppose it due to its effect on  our farmers here at home. U.S. commodities are a key pillar of this  program, and cutting funding would directly harm those farmers who  produce these commodities that go to this program. There is an  international aid shortfall of commodities, including millions of  commodities that American farmers proudly produce, such as wheat, rice,  corn, sorghum, lentils, beans, and peas.   This amendment shortchanges America's farmers as well as America's  values, our Judeo-Christian values. I urge opposition to this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment. As I said in my opening statement, this bill already  cuts the Agriculture funding bill back to a level last seen in 2001.  [[Page H4537]]    Apparently, those cuts are not enough because this amendment would  cut 50 percent from the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education  and Child Nutrition Program. That is a 50 percent cut from funding  supporting schoolchildren abroad.   This is a proven, successful program, a bipartisan program which  takes concrete steps to ensure that the program activities continue  after U.S. support is no longer provided. This money is not wasted. It  is not indefinite for any one location. It is a sound investment to  promote the health and education of schoolchildren, especially girls,  in need around the globe.   We are 4 days away from a government shutdown, and instead of  debating a bipartisan path forward, we are debating further cuts to  programs that have broad, bipartisan support. I urge all of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. It is  unnecessary and harmful.   While there is a global commodity shortage and conflict that fuels  hunger around the world, this bill has already been cut by 14.15  percent. Further cuts will only cause further impacts to efforts to  improve the food security and education of children around the world.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have extremely strong opposition  to this amendment.   If there are not sufficient jobs for people in the State, who are we  to take that State's judgment away?   The other side is always talking about States' rights. Well, these  are not people that are living high on the hog. They are not people  that have excess money.   I cannot and I will not support this amendment, nor will any of my  Democratic colleagues. It is mean and it is cruel to ask people to do  something that is not possible. If there aren't jobs, they can't be  employed and they can't comply with this. The States should know better  than we in Washington. If the State requests a waiver, which is a  request, it is not a mandate, certainly the Department can examine it  and determine whether or not there is sufficient cause to justify the  waiver.   We shouldn't just sua sponte on our own decide that a State doesn't  have sense enough to know what is going on within its borders.   We should not support this, and if it is included in the final  conference agreement, I doubt my Democratic colleagues would provide  the necessary votes for final passage, nor that the President would  sign the bill.   I urge us to defeat this amendment. It really makes no sense, and it  is mean, and it is cruel.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  this amendment.    Mr. Chair, electric vehicles produce no carbon  dioxide or other harmful emissions when driving, and they create a  healthy environment for all Americans by reducing air pollution.  Electric vehicles require less fluids and lubricants, which keeps our  drinking water cleaner.   Why would anyone object to having cleaner air or cleaner water for  our children and our grandchildren?   This amendment doesn't save the American taxpayer any money because  it prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from purchasing electric  vehicles that will reduce fuel costs for the Department of Agriculture.   It is estimated that by 2035, most of the world's automakers will  offer nothing but electric vehicles. While that is  [[Page H4542]]  12 years away, there is no reason to prohibit the Department of  Agriculture from replacing retiring vehicles with electric vehicles to  build our fleet for the future.   We are all witnessing the impacts of climate change through drought  and extreme weather events. Let's not prevent any steps that would help  us address climate change.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2340     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. This  amendment would prohibit funding for carrying out the recommendations  of the interim report of the USDA Equity Commission.   The Equity Commission has made 32 initial recommendations on a range  of topics such as environmental justice, increasing financial support  for minority-serving institutions, and ensuring farmworkers have access  to nutrition programs, among other topics.                                time  2350    These recommendations are a great first step toward addressing  historic inequities and we should all support them.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to claim the time in  opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, setting aside whether this  amendment is misplaced in the Agriculture appropriations bill, this  amendment is simply bad policy.   We are still fighting the lingering effects of a once-in-a-lifetime  pandemic and attempts to cut funding for the World Health Organization  would hamper work to monitor any new variants of COVID-19.   Moreover, the World Health Organization's work extends far beyond  just responding to COVID. Cutting funds for the World Health  Organization will affect efforts on other diseases and illnesses,  including polio or the flu.   Efforts to disengage with the WHO through our bill are misguided and  do nothing to address any concerns about accountability, transparency,  or cost efficiency.   This is not a good amendment. I urge its defeat, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to claim the time in  opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prevent the  closing of offices of the Farm Service Agency for any reason.   Although it mentions COVID-19, the prohibition amendment would not be  limited to closures related to COVID.   The Crawford amendment is duplicative of the stronger, clearer  proviso on page 25, lines 8 through 10 of the bill that is being  considered where it says: Provided further that none of the funds  available to the farm service agencies shall be used to close Farm  Service Agency county offices.   Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary because it would create a  restriction that the legislation already contains.                                time  0100    We don't know what the future of COVID or any future pandemic or  disaster may hold, so we shouldn't impose such a broad restriction.  This is duplicative.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, the amendment prohibits the  administration from finalizing any rules with significant economic  impacts. The amendment adds to the pile of bad policy riders aimed at  tying the administration's hands when it comes to carrying out the laws  passed by Congress.   It will stop USDA, FDA, and CFTC from finalizing regulations that are  designed to keep the food and drug supply safe, the environment  healthy, and markets stable.   This amendment has little to do with an appropriations bill, and even  less to do with supporting farmers or rural America.   While I can understand the gentlewoman's intentions, I must  respectfully oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the  same.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition.    Madam Chair, I am a strong supporter of our  Nation's dairy farmers in the southeast and in Georgia, but I must  regretfully decline to support this amendment.   The Agricultural Marketing Service, from which the funds will be  taken, is equally as important, and it supports farmers in all segments  of agriculture.   The Initiative, which goes to entities only in four States got $80  million from the American Rescue Plan just 15 months ago. The offset  from the Agricultural Marketing Service is one that many, many Members,  certainly on my side, deeply value.   It does great work, particularly for our specialty crop producers,  and it is already underfunded due to the manager's amendment.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I ask my  colleagues to vote ``no'' also.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0110    Unfortunately, my great colleague is not conflating or confusing  apples and  [[Page H4552]]  oranges, it is almonds and cheese curds. These moneys are designated to  make sure that our dairy industry is intact. We either support small  family farms or we do not. Money talks, and I will not finish the rest  of that colloquialism.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, USDA's climate hubs were created  to promote robust and healthy agricultural production and natural  resources under increasing climate variability and climate change.   Climate hubs develop and deliver science-based, region-specific  information and technologies to USDA agencies and its partners,  including Federal and State agencies, extensions, and Tribes to make  our communities and our Nation more resilient to climate change.   They provide outreach and education to farmers, ranchers, and forest  landowners on the effects of climate change on their working lands.   We are all witnessing drought, extreme weather events, and changing  growing seasons, so why would we want to prohibit aiding farmers,  ranchers, and forest landowners understand and respond to climate  change on their working lands? Why would we want to prohibit these 10  regional climate hubs from providing usable regional data and forecasts  to underserved and vulnerable communities, Tribes, and individuals that  can help their land be more productive?   This amendment does not save the American taxpayer money. In fact, it  jeopardizes our food security, our economy, and the lives and  livelihoods of many across the Nation. I urge my colleagues to reject  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment.   The amendment targets a dedicated leader in nutrition for apparently  doing her job as the law required. With all the challenges that we face  in feeding our Nation, we should not obstruct the agency charged with  carrying out our nutrition policies.   This House should hold its actions to the highest standards and not  engage in attacks on individual officials in the executive branch.  [[Page H4554]]    Madam Chair, I urge the defeat of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, this Workplace Safety Plan was  developed according to the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention. Decisions regarding the safety of Federal workers and  returning to work should be driven by science and the methodical  recommendation of experts not by broad Congressional mandates.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    I claim the time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    The USDA Equity Commission was set up in 2022  to address the historic inequities in implementation of the programs by  the Department of Agriculture.   The Department has a long and storied history of discrimination, as  evidenced by the billions of dollars that it has had to pay out as a  result of discriminatory policies over the years.   To quote directly from the USDA website regarding the commission:  ``At USDA, we acknowledge we have not done enough to provide all  farmers and ranchers an equal chance of success and prosperity. We are  committed to changing that, actively working to build a USDA that  ensures none of our customers are ignored or left behind.''   What is so threatening about that?   The bill already came out of committee bearing harmful policy riders  restricting the administration's efforts related to diversity, equity,  and inclusion.   The continued assault on equity initiatives at USDA is not helping  our farmers. This amendment is a distraction from the real issues that  are facing our farmers, and it does nothing to move us closer to a  bipartisan conference agreement, an agreement we know we must reach to  pass these appropriations bills.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Madam Chair, I am perplexed that anyone would  not want to provide good-paying jobs that will help our Nation tackle  the climate crisis and build a stronger country.   The goal of the Civilian Climate Corps is to put more than 20,000  young people on career pathways in the growing fields of clean energy,  conservation, and climate resilience.   In launching this effort, President Biden is calling on Tribal,  State, and local governments, labor unions, nonprofit service allies,  the private sector, and philanthropy to collaborate with the Federal  Government to build on current relationships and expand skills-based  training partnerships to ensure that our workforce is ready to meet the  climate crisis.   We have seen the devastation to coastal communities impacted by  hurricanes and tropical storms. Why would we not want to train our  youth to restore coastal wetlands that can protect communities from  storm surges?   We know the damage and the loss that accompanies wildfires across our  Nation, so why would we not want to train youth to manage forests, to  improve health, and prevent catastrophic wildfires?   We know the power of skills-based training as a tool to expand  pathways into good-paying jobs. Let's not deny our youth this  opportunity, and let's not deny our country the resources for our  future.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in extremely strong  opposition to this amendment.   This amendment would take away all State waivers for able-bodied  adults without dependents, the so-called ABAWDs. If employment is over  10 percent or there are not sufficient jobs for people in the State,  again, who are we to take that State's judgment away?   If you think we will never experience these conditions again, think  again. Neither you nor I can foresee the future. If these conditions do  occur, what are the chances that these folks will find jobs?   I cannot and will not support this amendment, nor will any of my  Democratic colleagues. If it is included in a final conference report,  I doubt my Democratic colleagues will provide the necessary votes for  final passage, nor will President Biden sign it into law.   It is a bad amendment. Let's vote it down.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  gentlewoman's amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment prohibits funds  from being used to carry out President Biden's climate change executive  orders, specifically:   Executive Order No. 13990 relating to Protecting Public Health and  the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis;   Executive Order No. 14008, relating to Tackling the Climate Crisis at  Home and Abroad;   Section 6 of Executive Order No. 14013, relating to Rebuilding and  Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of  Climate Change on Migration;   Executive Order No. 14030, relating to Climate-Related Financial  Risks;   Executive Order No. 14057, relating to Catalyzing Clean Energy  Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability;   Executive Order No. 14082, relating to Implementation of the Energy  and Infrastructure Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022;  and   Executive Order No. 14096, relating to Revitalizing Our Nation's  Commitment to Environmental Justice for All.   Who could be against that? Oh, well.                                time  0200    The scientific consensus is clear, however, that we need to take  significant steps to reduce carbon emissions moving forward while also  working to mitigate the damage from climate change that we are already  experiencing.   Extreme weather events and changing temperatures and weather patterns  are extremely relevant to America's farmland. The Department of  Agriculture should be at the forefront of ensuring that our farmers  remain productive and successful on the global market in the years to  come.   Tackling the climate crisis is an essential part of that work. Our  farmers are on both the front line of dealing with the effects of  climate change as well as taking steps to reduce carbon output and to  promote sustainability.   This amendment being offered on both appropriations bills brought to  the floor this week would hamstring our government's response to  climate change.   This amendment is shortsighted and does nothing to help our farmers.  In fact, it hurts our farmers.   Madam Chair, I urge the defeat of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. It targets a career civil servant for apparently doing their  job as the law requires. This House should hold its actions to the  highest standards, and attacks on the civil service have no place in  this House.   This is a bad amendment. It sets a bad precedent. It is beyond our  duties. It is ultra vires.   Mr. Chair, I urge the defeat of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I do rise in opposition to this  misguided amendment.   The amendment would eliminate research funding into novel approaches  to keeping livestock healthy.   Livestock disease costs hundreds of millions of dollars per year.  Producers  [[Page H4560]]  lose revenue and consumers pay higher prices as a result.   An ongoing avian influenza outbreak has devastated poultry producers  across the country, devastating that industry in many areas.   Innovative research on methods to cost effectively protect livestock  benefits both producers and consumers.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to defeat this misguided amendment  and let USDA work to keep livestock healthy for producers and prices  low for consumers.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate and share the  gentleman's support for our meat and poultry producers. However, this  is an amendment to permanent law that, with very rare exceptions,  should not be in an appropriations bill. This issue should be  considered in the context of the next farm bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Who in the world knows what ``woke'' means? I  think all of us should be awake to the dangers of overreach in this  appropriations bill.   This amendment would prohibit funds for courses, books, or study  guides on 17 topics related to inclusion, diversity, and supporting  LGBT employees.   These topics include issues such as empathy, fostering an inclusive  workplace, or becoming an ally to all.   I do not believe we should be spending our time here on the floor  today debating ways that we can cut back on teaching empathy. Instead,  what I think would serve our constituents the most would be a  discussion on how we can better help American farmers remain  competitive globally, help put food on the tables of those in need,  and, yes, help foster an inclusive and welcoming workplace for all at  the Department of Agriculture.   Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment. The National Farm to School Network supports the work of  farmers, teachers, and community leaders.   The Racial Equity Learning Lab is a learning program regarding racial  inequities in our food system. USDA's support from the program seeks to  address racial equity in our farm to school system.   I would think that making sure that all schoolchildren have access to  adequate meals would be an easy, bipartisan priority. I am disappointed  by this amendment. I urge all Members to oppose it. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise to claim the time in  opposition to this amendment.   I oppose this amendment. Members of the LGBT community have  historically faced higher rates of food insecurity.   USDA has taken steps to clarify that discrimination on the basis of  sexual orientation and gender identity are prohibited in programs  administered by USDA such as SNAP.   It is concerning to me that the Democratic amendment striking harmful  policy riders was not put forward by the Rules Committee for the  debate, while a large number of Republican amendments adding further  policy riders were allowed to be considered.   These amendments have no chance of becoming law and only move us  further from bipartisan conference agreement which can pass both  chambers of Congress.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit USDA  from implementing an executive order on tackling the climate crisis.   This year, our country has experienced more billion-dollar climate  disasters than ever before in our history. In only the first 8 months  of the year, 23 weather disasters devastated regions across the  country, and in every case, the agricultural sector was harmed.   This summer, we witnessed catastrophic floods in the Northeast  decimate farmers' crops. Extreme drought in the West continues to  impact ranchers' ability to sustain their livestock. Tragically, we  watched helplessly as the Maui wildfires ravaged thousands of acres of  farmland and took nearly 100 human lives.   This amendment would block Federal efforts to help farmers develop  climate-smart agricultural and forestry practices that are critical to  combating the climate crisis. If we are to address the climate crisis,  help farmers, and strengthen our economy, we cannot be hamstrung by  funding limitations that deny that climate change is real.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   The amendment would attempt to cut overall funding of the bill by an  additional $717 million. Not only that but it would do so without  specifying where the cuts would come from. This would effectively turn  the decision from where the cuts would come from over to the executive  branch, to the administration that the other side is so critical of,  robbing Congress of its constitutionally mandated power of the purse, a  violation of the separation of powers.   This is something that we should not include in any appropriations  bill. The bill already guts funding for USDA, and any further cuts  would just make a bad bill worse.   We should kill this amendment. We should enact a reasonable,  responsible appropriations bill so that we can take care of the needs  of the American people and make sure that the Department of Agriculture  is adequately funded to serve the needs of the American people.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
