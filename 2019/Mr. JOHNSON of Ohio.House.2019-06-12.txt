 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would address the  ongoing opioid crisis by funding the Regional Centers of Excellence in  Substance Use Disorder Education, which was authorized last year as a  part of H.R. 6. This program aims to increase the amount of education  that health professional students receive on substance use disorder,  pain management, and addiction.   While health professional students are eager to address addiction and  the opioid epidemic, only a handful of medical schools have robust  curriculums on the diagnosis and treatment of substance use disorders.  By recognizing institutions that have put a focus on these areas and  sharing their strategies publicly, we hope to ensure that the next  generation of health professionals are fully prepared to address the  opioid epidemic and other forms of addiction.   Healthcare providers are in a unique position to recognize a patient  suffering from addiction, and it is important that their training fully  prepares them to take on this important and potentially lifesaving  role.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank my colleague for supporting  the amendment. I, too, urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   I thank Representative Tonko for working with me on this program in  the Energy and Commerce Committee and on this particular amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
