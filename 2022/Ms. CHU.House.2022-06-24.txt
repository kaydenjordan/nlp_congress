 Mr. Speaker, I stand here in strong support of the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.   It was just 1 year ago when a young man went into the store, bought a  gun, and, just hours later, went to an Asian spa in the Atlanta,  Georgia area to murder Asian women. Then, he drove 27 miles away to two  more Asian spas to kill more Asian women. In all, he killed eight  people, including six Asian women.   They were mothers, grandmothers, daughters, and I will never forget  the tears and sobs of their loved ones when we went down to Georgia to  visit.   To see that again in Buffalo and Uvalde, where families had their  lives ripped apart in an instant, is more heartache than our country  can bear.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is an important step forward.  There will be enhanced background checks for gun purchasers under 21.  It provides funds for States for red flag laws. It closes the boyfriend  loophole.   This bill will save lives.
