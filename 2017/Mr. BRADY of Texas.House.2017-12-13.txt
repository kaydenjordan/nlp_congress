 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained to cast  my vote in time. Had I been present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on  rollcall No. 676.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.                                Recorded Vote
