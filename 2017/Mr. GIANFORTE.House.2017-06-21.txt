 Mr. Speaker, I thank you and Majority Leader McCarthy.   I am humbled and honored to have been elected by the people of  Montana to represent them here in this House.   I am joined today by my wife, Susan, who is in the gallery. We have  been married 29 years. We have four grown children. Two of them are  with us today, along with our daughter-in-law. We raised them hunting,  fishing, and hiking on the great public lands in Montana.   I am a business guy and an electrical engineer. I am trained to solve  hard problems, not to argue about them, just to get things done.   Susan and I did start a computer software company in our home over 20  years ago in Bozeman, Montana, and it grew to over 500 employees there  and became one of the State's largest employers.   I am Montana's lone voice here in this House, sent by the people to  do the work of the people. The MT comes before the R or the D after my  name. I promised the people of Montana that I  [[Page H5017]]  would come back and drain the swamp. That is why today three of my  first actions are bills: no balanced budget, no pay; term limits; and a  ban on lobbying by Members of Congress after being out of office.   We need to bring accountability to Washington, D.C.   I feel a deep sense of obligation to serve, and I look forward to  being a strong voice for all of Montana.                            ____________________
