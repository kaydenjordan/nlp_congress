 Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I have not been on the floor to hear all of the debate, but it is  interesting to hear how proworker the debate is from a party that has  been responsible for opposing workers' protections, workers' wages,  minimum wages, and almost every other thing that lifted workers up.   I will remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that the best  times for the middle class were when the unions had the largest number  of members. Why? Because employers could not just tell them: You are  going to get this. No, there had to be a bargaining saying: Look, we  are making a lot of profits. We want to share in those profits because  we enabled those profits.   So, yes, we are for giving workers the right to organize. We are for  everybody who benefits from that, paying part of the taxes for that.  There are a lot of people who don't like the policies we pursue. But  they have to pay taxes because the majority decides that that is what  we are going to do. And that is the policy of the United States. And  you can't say: Well, I don't like the policy, so I am not going to pay.   I rise in very strong support of this bill. This is a bill about the  middle class. This is a bill about working people. You talk a lot about  working people. This is what lifts up working people, giving them some  ability to negotiate on somewhat of an equal plane.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation which will  protect workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively. That  right is at the heart of American opportunity. Furthermore, I would  suggest there is not a robust democracy in the world that does not have  a trade union movement. It is what made prosperity possible for  generations of working people and their families.   This administration and Republicans in Congress have been working to  undermine that right and erode the protections won by the workers'  rights movement. Today, I am proud to bring this legislation to the  floor to make it clear that Democrats will not allow that to happen.   We stand with the men and women of organized labor, and all workers  who benefit through their efforts, and we will fight on their behalf to  protect workers' rights.   I want to thank Chairman  Bobby Scott of the Education and Labor  Committee for introducing this legislation and shepherding it through  the committee where Members helped strengthen it and ensure broad  support across our caucus.   In addition to banning employers from forcing workers to participate  in anti-union activities--perhaps my friends in the House who believe  in freedom think maybe that is wrong. I don't know. We will see--the  PRO Act ends the practice of management misclassifying workers in order  to deny them benefits and fair pay. I challenge anybody to get up and  say that doesn't happen.   It puts the National Labor Relations Board back on the side of  workers, stopping the Trump administration's use of that board to  subvert workers' rights. When they say ``deregulation,'' regulation is  making sure workplaces are safe; making sure that products that are  sold are safe--that is regulation--making sure that automobiles are  safe to be on the road. That is regulation.   By the way, we all know about regulations. We watch a football game.  It is a regulation that you can't cross the line until the ball is  hiked. That is regulation. It makes the game fair. This bill  strengthens unions' hands in negotiations by prohibiting employers from  hiring permanent replacements for striking workers. In other words, do  it my way, kid, or get out.   That is the way it used to be before the 1930s where some people died  walking lines. They were trying to picket or trying to make the case  for their employees. Yes, some people died, and some people bled so  that other workers would have a fair shot, fair pay, safe workplace,  and some long-term security.   In short, the PRO Act is the workers' rights legislation our Nation  has been waiting for. If we are for the middle class, we need to make  sure that the middle class has some bargaining power. It is the  legislation our country needs to confront the assault of unorganized  labor that has been ramped up under this antiworker President.                                time  1630    When we have strong unions, workers--even those not in unions--end up  with higher wages, better healthcare, more secure retirement benefits,  and safer workplaces.   They had to fight for that, and as I said, some people died for that.  That is why we need legislation like the PRO Act.   When the Democratic-led House passes this bill, it will join other  proworker legislation waiting for action in the Senate. These include  the Raise the Wage Act to bring the Federal minimum wage up to $15.  There is not one of us who could live on $15 an hour, but we have kept,  over the 12 years that the Republicans were in the majority, $7.25 as  the minimum wage. I challenge anybody in this House to live on $7.25 an  hour for 40 hours.   We ensured equal pay for women in the Equality Act, which bans  discrimination against LGBT workers. Martin  [[Page H889]]  Luther King said to judge on the content of character and effort, not  on some extraneous character trait that may have nothing to do with  whether you can perform the job.   We also passed the Butch Lewis Act to protect multiemployer pension  funds, as well as the SECURE Act to help more workers save for a secure  retirement.   Let's not forget we passed legislation protecting coverage for  Americans with preexisting conditions. The President said he was for  preexisting conditions, but he wanted to repeal the Affordable Care  Act. They tried, and they had a big celebration down at the White House  right after they passed it from the House to the Senate.   Guess what happened 2 weeks later? The President said: That is a mean  bill.   Check the Record, Mr. Chairman. All of these bills are sitting on  Senator Mitch McConnell's desk. I call on Senator McConnell to restore  democracy and let Senators vote.   I urge my colleagues to send the PRO Act to the Senate with strong  support. This is proworker, pro-middle class, profamily, and pro- American. Vote ``yes.''
