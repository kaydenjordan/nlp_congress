The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Mr. President, last week the Senate confirmed Kyle  Fortson to be a member of the National Mediation Board.   The National Mediation Board, established by the 1934 amendments to  the Railway Labor Act of 1926, is an independent U.S. Federal  Government agency that facilitates labor-management relations within  the Nation's railroad and airline industries.   Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, National Mediation Board programs  help to resolve disputes to promote the flow of interstate commerce in  those industries through mediation, representation, and arbitration of  labor-management disputes.   A dedicated public servant, Kyle Fortson is eminently qualified to  serve on the National Mediation Board. I am fortunate to say that Mrs.  Fortson currently serves on my staff as labor policy director at the  U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--HELP--Committee,  after serving in that position from 2010 to 2013 for Senator Mike Enzi.  I have benefitted from Mrs. Fortson's experience, knowledge, and  counsel.   Mrs. Fortson previously served as labor counsel at the same committee  from 2004 to 2010. Before that, she was a policy analyst at the Senate  Republican Policy Committee from 2003 to 2004 and served as counsel to  Senator Tim Hutchinson from 2001 to 2003. She also served as judiciary  counsel to Congressman Spencer Bachus from 1999 to 2001.   Mrs. Fortson graduated with a B.A. in history from the University of  Colorado in 1996 and with a J.D. from George Washington University in  1999.   Mrs. Fortson was nominated on June 26, 2017. On July 3, 2017, the  committee received Mrs. Fortson's Office of Government Ethics  paperwork, including her public financial disclosure and ethics  agreement. Based on these documents, the Office of Government Ethics  wrote to me that Kyle Fortson ``is in compliance with applicable laws  and regulations governing conflicts of interest.'' The committee  received Mrs. Fortson's HELP Committee application on July 27, 2017.  Mrs. Fortson was favorably reported out of the HELP Committee on  October 18, 2017.   While the National Mediation Board will be very fortunate to have  Mrs. Fortson as a member, her departure will be a loss to the U.S.  Senate and the HELP Committee. I am proud to support Kyle's nomination,  and she will serve on the National Mediation Board with distinction.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today we celebrate the 25th  anniversary of high-performance computing at Oak Ridge National  Laboratory's Leadership Computing Facility.   For a quarter century, Oak Ridge has led the way globally, pushing  the boundaries of computational performance and continually giving  scientists more powerful platforms for simulation and discovery at  every scale--from the smallest building blocks of atoms to the vastness  of galaxies--in biology, chemistry, physics, materials science,  cosmology, industrial modeling, nuclear power, and more.   Using Oak Ridge's computing facility, scientists have expanded the  scale and scope of their research, solved complex problems in less  time, and filled critical gaps in scientific knowledge.   The Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility has led the rapid  evolution of scientific computing that has produced a millionfold  increase in computing power and has been home to both the first  teraflop--1 trillion calculations per second--and the first petaflop--1  quadrillion calculations per second--systems for scientific computing.  Oak Ridge has twice placed two supercomputing systems at the top of the  international TOP500 list, where supercomputers are ranked by their  number-crunching performance.   Today computer simulation is an essential part of modern science, but  in 1992, when Oak Ridge established its Center for Computational  Sciences, which was later renamed the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing  Facility, not many people thought that the next great center for high- performance computing would be located in east Tennessee.  [[Page S7059]]    As I have said many times, this region has one of the most formidable  concentrations of brainpower anywhere in our country.   The Department of Energy unleashed that brainpower when, later that  year, it selected Oak Ridge, along with its partners, three national  labs and seven universities, to lead one of the Office of Energy  Research's--now the Office of Science--new high-performance computing  research centers to serve scientists from national laboratories,  universities, and private industry.   Meanwhile, in 2002, Japan introduced its Earth Simulator, which was  at the time five times more powerful than any other high-performance  computer in the world.   I traveled with former Senator Jeff Bingaman to Japan, and we were  briefed on the significance of Japan's investment in the Earth  Simulator.   Japan's development of the Earth Simulator meant that the United  States no longer was the clear leader in high-performance computing,  and for the first time, American researchers were looking abroad to  obtain access to the latest computing tools.   Senator Bingaman and I made it a priority to recapture the lead in  high-speed computing by introducing and passing the High-End Computing  Revitalization Act of 2004.   This legislation paved the way for Oak Ridge to regain the lead in  supercomputing. Within a few years, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing  Facility deployed a supercomputer called Jaguar that would break the  petaflop barrier--a quadrillion calculations per second--in 2008 and  take back the top spot on the TOP500 list in 2009.   For the past 25 years, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility  has not only been home to some of the world's most powerful computers,  but it has also been a global leader in the development of software  applications and tools for scientific research. That is important  because it is not just about having the fastest computer, it is also  about having the experts who know how to program and use them.   Each year, the facility provides computer systems 10 to 100 times  more powerful than most other computers available for research for the  lab's own scientists, as well as international teams of scientists  trying to make breakthroughs on the toughest science challenges.   Those scientists publish new science discoveries in nearly 500  research papers per year.   Beyond basic science, dozens of companies, from small businesses to  Fortune 500 giants, have used Oak Ridge supercomputers to accelerate  their own research and development and gain a competitive advantage in  the global market.   For example, these high-performance computers have allowed companies  to develop an add-on for long-haul trucks to optimize airflow, which  improves fuel mileage by up to 10 percent.   Other companies were able to use simulations to extend the shelf life  of consumer products and to analyze combustion in gas turbines to  improve performance and lower emissions.   Not only does supercomputing help scientific discoveries and  companies, supercomputers at our national laboratories can be used by  Federal agencies as a ``secret weapon'' in the effort to combat issues  like Medicare and Medicaid waste, fraud, and abuse; to find terrorists  and criminals; and to help the National Institutes of Health find cures  and treatments for disease.   Other countries have taken notice of the Oak Ridge Leadership  Computing Facility's success, tried to duplicate it, and now threaten  our lead in scientific computing.   The United States faces a choice between falling behind competitors  like China or advancing technologies that can make us safer and more  competitive.   In the June 2017 ranking of the world's most powerful supercomputers,  China maintained the top two places, Switzerland was third, and Titan  at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is the fastest  supercomputer in the United States, moved down to fourth.   In 2018, the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility will complete  Summit, which will be more than five times faster than Titan and will  help researchers better understand materials and nuclear power and  support more energy breakthroughs.   The fiscal year 2018 Energy and Water Development Appropriations  bill, which I wrote with Senator Feinstein, prioritizes supercomputing  and recommends $150 million for the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing  Facility, as well as $381 million to support the delivery of the first  exascale machine.   I am very proud of the men and women from all over the world who have  come to east Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to make the  Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility a world-leading center for  computational scientific research.   I thank them for 25 years of hard work and dedication, and I look  forward to their continued success answering some of the hardest  scientific questions.                            ____________________
