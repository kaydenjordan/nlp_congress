 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act.   Mr. Speaker, the day our country witnessed the brutal murder of  George Floyd was a critical tipping point for America. His murder has  sparked a movement--one  of renewed calls for civil rights and justice  for all.    Hundreds of thousands of Americans have been marching in the streets.  They are not asking for incentives for studies or for task forces. No,  they are asking and marching for and demanding meaningful change and  meaningful reform. And it is up to us to rise up and deliver on change  that will meet this moment.   Mr. Speaker, I pray that our Republican colleagues have a change of  heart and decide to join us on our journey toward true reform. This  bill is only the beginning and we need to push for a whole-of- government response--from Congress, to the statehouse, to the city  halls all over America.   Mr. Speaker, our country deserves no less. This moment deserves no  less. George Floyd deserves no less.
