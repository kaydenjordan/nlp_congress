 Mr. Speaker, I am disheartened by what Congress is  doing here today.   My number one goal has always been to ensure Iowans have access to  quality, affordable care. This legislation does not do that. It  implements an age tax, raising costs on older Americans. It cuts nearly  $900 billion from the elderly, nursing homes, and disabled children.   This is unacceptable. Exactly those who need health coverage the  most--middle class families, people with disabilities, and those who  are less fortunate--are the ones who lose out in this Republican bill.   I remain committed to working to improve healthcare coverage so it  works better for Iowans and all Americans. We cannot go back to a time  when Iowa families had to choose between putting food on the table and  getting medical care for their children. Unfortunately, that is just  what this bill does.   I urge my colleagues to vote this bill down.
