 Mr. President, today I am introducing the Water for  Agriculture and Conservation Act to help expand critical water  conservation infrastructure that helps improve water use efficiency,  fish and wildlife habitat, and agriculture productivity.   Throughout the West, communities are experiencing high levels of  drought that are hurting agriculture and conservation efforts. The  Water for Conservation and Farming Act aims to help communities better  plan and prepare for the increased demand for clean water by funding  projects that improve dam safety, create more resilient watersheds, and  benefit agricultural and urban water users.   States, Tribes, and local communities are working diligently to  upgrade crumbling water infrastructure but have lacked the critical  resources to make meaningful improvements that last. The Water for  Conservation and Farming Act would provide $120,000,000 over three  years for disadvantaged communities to increase environmental  protections, support agriculture, and make significant steps to improve  the water supply for their communities.   The Water for Conservation and Farming Act would create a Bureau of  Reclamation fund of $300 million to support water recycling projects,  water-use efficiency projects and dam safety projects, as well as  expanding existing programs, like WaterSMART, to get more bang for the  conservation buck.   The bill would establish several new programs at the Bureau of  Reclamation, which are designed to help disadvantaged communities plan  and implement water conservation projects, a program to help farmers  improve migratory bird habitat, and programs to implement aquatic  ecosystem restoration projects.   At a time when the nation is suffering increased droughts, when  farmers and ranchers are asked to do more with less, and critical  habitats are suffering from less and less water, this bill will make  needed investments in water conservation infrastructure that reduces  demand for water, improves biodiversity, and helps farmers and ranchers  plan and prepare for droughts. I look forward to getting this bill  across the finish line.
