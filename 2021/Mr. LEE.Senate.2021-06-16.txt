 Madam President, 100 years ago, in 1921, a young and newly  married couple named Percy and Verabel Knudson saw the need for a  gathering place in their community. Knowing they could make money  selling ice cream and candy, they started Idle Isle Ice Cream and Candy  Store.   A few years later, after raising the necessary funds, Percy and  Verabel Knudson--with the help of David H. Call and his wife LaRita-- shifted their business from sweets to full-service meals, and Idle Isle  Cafe was born.   Over the course of the last century, Idle Isle Cafe has endured  remarkable events in history and served important people. It survived  the difficulties of the Great Depression and World War II, all while  serving locals and national celebrities alike, including Wallace Beery,  Charlie Chaplin, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, and Paulette Goddard.   During the fifties, Idle Isle even served ``The Duke'' himself, Mr.  John Wayne, who stopped in on a number of occasions while visiting Utah  on hunting trips and movie shoots.   In those years, the cafe also served as a meeting place for members  of the Brigham City unit of the Utah National Guard, who were later  called to  [[Page S4579]]  serve their country in the Korean war. Idle Isle Cafe has endured both  good times and bad over the last century. But whatever the times, it  has always been a place where people from every walk of life could  share a meal, enjoy friendship, and bear one another's burdens as they  endured the ups and downs of life together.   As the cafe celebrates its 100-year anniversary this year, it is  worth recognizing all the good that it has done for Utah and for  Brigham City. Of course, bearing one another's burdens is one of the  things that Utahns do best.   Travis and Jana Porter, the current owners of Idle Isle Cafe,  epitomized this spirit. Everyone who befriends or works with the  Porters quickly sees their love of community and their dedication to  their country. Nearly everything they do, both inside of the restaurant  and outside, stems from their passion for helping others and their  optimistic outlook on life.   Even with their five kids and the business of running the restaurant,  the couple finds intentional time each day to love and serve those who  work in the cafe and all who come to visit. As a result of their  service, Idle Isle Cafe endures.   We, as Utahns, are engaged in the work of enduring together. In fact,  the State's economy is so robust, in large part, because neighbors care  for neighbors, friends care for friends, and strangers even look out  for strangers. It doesn't matter who you are. In Utah, you belong.  Whether in the cafe or the community, there is a place for you at the  table. Our doors are open. So, too, are our hearts. You see, Utah is  one of these places where it doesn't matter how long your family has  been in the State or whether you have been here for 5 minutes; to us,  you are a Utahn.   The endearing spirit of Utah is not inspired by government. No, it is  inspired by moms and dads, teachers, small business owners, friends,  and neighbors.   Earlier this year, when neighbors in West Valley City were  overwhelmed at the prospect of revamping and reclaiming their  community, an opportunity presented itself. Aging homes, with peeling  paint and cracked up driveways, broken fences, and neglected yards,  needed to be refinished. So in typical Utah fashion, neighbors came  together.   After identifying problems, reviewing resources, and communicating  with community leaders, an initiative was born--Operation My Hometown.  Operation My Hometown is a neighborhood improvement coalition made up  of residents, city workers, and volunteers from various churches and  other organizations. It runs entirely on private initiative and  volunteerism, two of Utah's hallmark strengths. Their process is  simple: see something in need of repair, note it and join the group to  help fix it and then, of course, fix it.   Repair requests can be submitted online, and anyone can help. The  projects are significant. And, quite remarkably, they are being  completed. To quote one news report:         Six days a week, the church is converting its meetinghouse       in the neighborhood into a community center. Corporations are       donating cash and goods. A new park is planned. The city is       adding street lights. Funds are being raised to finance home       ownership. And volunteers are streaming in from all over the       Salt Lake Valley to work side by side with residents.    Neighborhood resident, Bonnie Shaw, stated:         I am so encouraged, so hopeful, so blessed, I can't even       believe this is happening.    Another resident, Nickolaus Orwin, shared, as follows:         We live in a strange world these days. We hear this       ideology that if you don't look like me, talk like me, act       like me and vote like me, then we must be enemies, but       throughout all of this social upheaval . . . this community       has worked together and served one another in such a       brilliant and beautiful way that it just defies the ideology       that we're different and we have to segregate ourselves out       into groups. Even in the dark days of COVID . . . this       community service was such a bright, shiny star. Through all       of that hard, we have this, this really beautiful and safe       community service that was happening.    It has been said that ``the greatness of a community is most  accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members.'' If  that is the case, then Utah is truly a great place.   To honor this tradition of greatness, I myself am grateful to host  the annual Flavors of Utah event in partnership with Operation My  Hometown in West Valley City later this summer. My office has partnered  with this and other great community groups to collect food from local  producers and distribute it to those in need. I encourage other Utahns  to join me in this effort as we together look for opportunity to  thrive.   The spirit of Utah, the enduring spirit of Utah, is borne from a rich  history of hard work, industry, innovation, and ingenuity--even against  great hardship. Few individuals embody this spirit more than the late  Obert Clark Tanner.   Born in Farmington, UT, in 1904, O.C. Tanner was the youngest of 10  children. Despite his position in the family, from a young age, Tanner  felt an obligation to provide for his family. He did so by performing  odd jobs around the city, including stoking furnaces. One of the people  for whom Tanner stoked the furnace was a jeweler. The jeweler became a  friend and a mentor to Tanner and, with time, schooled the young Tanner  in the jewelry business. Tanner was a quick study. He swiftly  implemented the lessons taught to him and began selling graduation pins  and class rings from the back of his car.   In 1927, he officially founded the O.C. Tanner Company. Though still  an undergraduate student at the University of Utah, he used what little  time he had outside of his classwork to make ends meet--and make ends  meet, he did. The company quickly grew and endured the difficulties  that put others out of business.   Throughout the years, the enduring spirit of O.C. Tanner has been a  guiding light and inspiration to many, and the company has achieved  truly great heights.   In 2002, the O.C. Tanner Company crafted the medals for the Winter  Olympics, which were hosted in Salt Lake City. In 2019, O.C. Tanner  designed a copper spike replica of the original golden spike that was  ceremonially driven at the joining of the two branches of the first  transcontinental railroad.   Today, the O.C. Tanner Company maintains offices in the United  States, Canada, England, Singapore, Australia, and India. The company  is one of the largest manufacturers of retail and corporate awards in  the United States, and it employs over 1,500 people.   Through the dark nights of hardship, O.C. Tanner has endured and even  succeeded, thrived. Through the difficulties of community building, the  volunteers of Operation MyHometown endure, and they are succeeding.   Through 100 years of historic highs and unforgettable lows, the Idle  Isle Cafe endures and, yes, the cafe is succeeding too. As goes the  saying, those who endure conquer.   Similar to O.C. Tanner, volunteers of Operation MyHometown, the Idle  Isle Cafe, and all Utahns have endured the difficulties of the last  year with utmost faith and fortitude, and they are emerging victorious.  The enduring spirit of Utah is strong.   The 2020 pandemic, earthquakes, civic discord, confusion, and  contention presented daunting challenges in the lives of all, and yet  Utahns are breathing a collective sigh of relief as we embrace the  shining horizon that lies yet ahead.   Since the onset of the virus over a year ago, Utahns have seen near- continual drop in unemployment. Utah's unemployment rate fell to 2.8  percent in April--less than half the national number.   Though earthquakes shook homes and businesses last year, Utah's  economy has still been rated the best in the United States by several  nationally recognized outlets. And while the discord, confusion, and  contention seem to dominate the airwaves, Utah's citizens have banded  together to bridge the partisan divides that can be so difficult to  overcome.   Utah and Utahns are remarkable.   If you are seeking a place to start a business, ask those at Idle  Isle Cafe. Utah is the place.   If you are seeking a place where community matters, ask those at  Operation MyHometown. Utah is the place.   If you are seeking a place where opportunity is abundant, read the  story of O.C. Tanner. Utah is the place.   I am very grateful for the privilege of representing the State of  Utah here in the U.S. Senate. It is my hope that the successes and the  enduring spirit of  [[Page S4580]]  Utah will continue to serve as an example for the Nation.   I yield the floor.
