 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of  National Police Week. Tens of thousands of law enforcement officers  from across the country are in Washington in honor of National Police  Week.   Established by joint resolution of Congress in 1962, National Police  Week pays special recognition to those law enforcement officers who  have lost their lives in the line of duty for the safety and the  protection of others.   National Police Week is a collaborative effort of many organizations  dedicated to honoring America's law enforcement community. It is also a  time where we pause to remember officers who have made the ultimate  sacrifice and lost their lives in the line of duty protecting and  serving others.   This week honors the men and women in blue who gave everything to  protect their country and their communities. Our officers put on their  uniform each day knowing that they can be in harm's way at any moment.   Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to all of our officers who answer the  call to serve, and I wish each and every officer a happy National  Police Week.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman of the  Agriculture Committee so much for yielding, and for his tireless work  on this important legislation in order to support rural America and our  most vulnerable.   Over the past 3 years, the Agriculture Committee has spent countless  hours talking with constituents, performing outreach, and holding  hearings with stakeholders to see how we can improve upon the 2014 farm  bill.   Contrary to the claims of some, this legislation was not created in  the dead of night or without input from my friends across the aisle.   Mr. Chairman, I have before me a letter that was sent to Chairman  Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson with priorities identified by the  Democratic Members that I am proud to serve with on the Agriculture  Committee. I am proud to see--under nutrition specifically--all of  these, and I believe all of these titles, these priorities were  incorporated into the farm bill.   Over this 3-year period, we held 21 hearings and heard from 81  witnesses at the Nutrition Subcommittee alone. Members of the  Agriculture Committee traveled to every corner of the country to  participate in listening sessions and obtain vital input from our  farmers, our ranchers, and our growers.   As the farm bill was in development at the committee, every Member  had the opportunity to provide input and that input was considered  during this process. Yet, even with an open process, no amendments were  offered during the committee markup by my  [[Page H4049]]  friends across the aisle. That is an opportunity for refinement, as is  being on the House floor an opportunity for refinement.   From voluntary insurance programs, to conservation in rural  development programs, to agriculture research, H.R. 2 contains critical  supports for our Nation's farmers, ranchers, and rural America.   On the farm side, I am especially pleased with the continued reforms  to the Margin Protection Program for Dairy, as well as the forestry  provisions in title VIII. Now, while I could go on about all of these  good policies contained in H.R. 2, this legislation ultimately is about  supporting American food--both on the farm, and on the consumer side.   Food is a national security issue. And whether we realize it or not,  every American shakes hands with a farmer at least three times a day.  As chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, I am proud that we maintain  nutrition assistance for our most vulnerable through the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program. Approximately 65 percent of these dollars  directly provide food to children, the elderly, and persons with  disabilities who rely on benefits of SNAP when times get tough.   H.R. 2 also does make historic changes to SNAP by providing new job  opportunities for work-capable adults. This bill does this by  reinvesting significant dollars within our budget into education and  training programs.   By providing the States the increased resources to do this, every  work-capable SNAP recipient will be guaranteed a slot in a job-training  program, leading to ultimate food security. By doing this, we can help  folks elect a pathway to long-term employment, self-sufficiency, and a  way out of poverty.   Mr. Chair, I ask that Members support H.R. 2.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.    Mr. Chairman, Chairman Conaway, and  Ranking Member Peterson, I am grateful for the opportunity to be here  today and speak on this amendment.   Chronic wasting disease is a wildlife health disorder impacting the  cervid populations in 24 States, including Pennsylvania. The disease  attacks the brain and nervous system of these animals, which include  deer, elk, and mule and moose species, and always results in death.   Currently, we don't have a way to live test, and there is no cure or  vaccine for the disease.   First identified in Colorado in the 1960s, CWD, as it is known,  wasn't detected in Pennsylvania until 2012. However, the problem  continues to grow as the State Game Commission has found a doubling of  instances between 2016 and 2017.   If this trend continues, we will see devastating impacts on our  cervid populations as well as related ecological consequences.   Title VII, the research portion of the farm bill, provides important  support for innovation, research, and development at our Nation's land  grant universities and agricultural colleges.   To help wildlife managers and States combat the problem of CWD, my  amendment simply adds chronic wasting disease to section 7208, high- priority research and extension initiatives.   According to the CBO, this amendment would have no change in direct  spending or revenue. However, this amendment would help focus some  resources toward chronic wasting disease research.  [[Page H4129]]    A number of organizations have endorsed this amendment, including the  Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Wildlife Management  Institute, The Quality Deer Management Association, National Deer  Alliance, National Wildlife Federation, and the Association of Fish and  Wildlife Agencies.   I appreciate the opportunity today to offer this amendment and  request the support of my colleagues.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking  member for that question. It is an important part of this discussion.  Actually, first of all, it is important for people to understand that,  let me just say upfront, chronic wasting disease is not transmitted to  humans. There is no case of that. I know that wasn't your question, but  I think that is important. It is not transmitted to humans.   I think it is important for those who might be listening to  understand that. I don't want to create a fear factor here.   The research of the USDA so far shows there has never been a  documented case of a farm deer transferring CWD to wild population.    Will the gentleman yield?    All farm deer must be CWD certified,  meaning testing for over 5 years, to be eligible for interstate  shipment and commerce, and there is a USDA Federal rule, all farm deer  in the Federal herd certification program must test 100 percent of  their death loss for CWD, and State and Federal fish and wildlife  agencies test a low percentage of wild deer for CWD.   So the focus on this is the wild deer. If a farm deer is determined  to be CWD positive, in almost all cases, the entire herd is put down,  as you had mentioned in your experience, leaving the farmer without a  source of income or business.   The goal of the amendment, however, I think would help in that  situation because the goal of the amendment is to find a live test or a  cure for CWD since scientists believe it is naturally occurring in the  wild. If we had a vaccine, we could then increase the number of  sportsmen and -women in the field to help with the Pittman-Robertson  funds that go to conservation.   The total economic impact of the farmed cervid industry is $7.9  billion a year in the U.S. and employs almost 57,000 people who  contribute greatly to rural American, State, and certainly Federal  economies as well.   The outcome of this would benefit both farm but also wild CWD  instances and cases, and prevent them.    Will the gentleman yield?    Yes.    I yield back the balance of my time.
