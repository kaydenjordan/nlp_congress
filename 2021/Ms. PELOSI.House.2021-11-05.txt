 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his great  leadership in bringing this important legislation to the floor, a rule  of the House, to expand opportunity for so many people in our country,  to protect our planet for future generations, to do so with great  equity in a way that builds back better for women.   Madam Speaker, thanks to the tireless work of so many in the House  Democratic Caucus, all of our Members, our chairs of the committees of  jurisdiction, the members of those committees worked so hard bringing  their years of experience, knowledge, and judgment on how we would go  forward to fulfill the President's vision.   President Biden has a big vision for America and for our future, a  vision that has equity in it so that we are building with fairness for  all in our country to participate in the increased prosperity of our  Nation.   We thank the President for his great leadership, the vision that he  has put forth, the knowledge of all of his years in the Congress, and  as Vice President, in terms of legislation, and his respect for all of  our Members, paying so much attention to their concerns and, more  especially, to how we can work together to meet the needs of the  American people. This is build back better with women, build back  better for the people.   It will be one of the most significant legislative undertakings that  any of us has ever been part of. And I say that with great proprietary  attitude toward the Affordable Care Act, which was transformative and  historic. This is even bigger than that. In fact, it strengthens the  Affordable Care Act.   So if you are talking about how we want to have immediate and  enduring difference for the workers and families, creating jobs,  securing middle class tax cuts, lowering costs for families, and making  the wealthiest pay their fair share, all while contributing to reducing  the national debt--making everyone pay their fair share.   Did I hear a laugh over there? Did I hear a laugh from those who  added $2 trillion in tax cuts for the richest people in America, 83  percent of it going to the top 1 percent?   This is paid for. And more than paid for.   In terms of jobs, together with the also historic bipartisan  infrastructure bill, it will create an estimated 2 million jobs each  year, 20 million jobs into the next decade. And that is just  immediately to this legislation, not talking about what it will  generate as many more women are in the workplace. If you look at any  piece of the bill, it would be extraordinary.   Madam Speaker, if we came to the floor and just talked about  protecting our planet for our children, it is always about the  children, the green aspects of this bill are for the children and their  future. It is about creating good-paying jobs. It is about, again, a  generational challenge that we have. It is about healthcare, the air  our children breathe, the water they drink, an atmosphere in which they  can thrive. It is about jobs--again, good-paying, green jobs, making  America preeminent in the world in the new green technologies and  sharing that information with other nations and underdeveloped  countries, so that they can succeed as well.   It is also about security. National security experts come to us and  say that we must treat this as a security issue. Years ago, when I was  still on the Intelligence Committee itself--I am still ex-officio--but  then in the committee, we were even seeing the need for using our  technology and our knowledge in terms of protecting our country,  recognizing the assault on our planet that the climate crisis would be.   And why? Because as you know, with rising sea levels, encroachment of  deserts, drying up of rivers, the great rivers of Asia, all of the  things that are happening, the thermal management of the planet, the  list goes on and on, all of this has created, in many ways, drought,  famine, floods, violent storms of record proportion.                                time  2140    So the experts say that the competition for habitat and resources  that this causes can increase conflict. Migrations and the rest can  cause conflict. We must anticipate that as a security concern, as it is  already.   And then when we talk about health for the children, jobs for their  families, security for our country, we also recognize that this is a  moral issue for us all. If you believe, as do I, that this beautiful  planet is God's creation, then we have a responsibility to be good  stewards.   But even if you don't share that religious belief, we all agree that  we owe it to our children--I would hope we all agree--that we owe it to  our children to pass this planet on to them and future generations in a  responsible way.   So even if this bill were just about that, it would be historic in  its proportion and its transformative nature, and worthy of just voting  for that. But it isn't about just that. We will make historic progress  to universal healthcare coverage in America, strengthening the ACA to  make coverage more affordable for those who buy insurance on their own.  It also contains the Medicare hearing benefit, making a major  difference for seniors.   As you probably know, Madam Speaker, I know you do, but there are  some States that would not expand Medicaid. This is a great  disadvantage to children, not only children but seniors who depend on  Medicaid for long-term healthcare and the rest. In this legislation we  expand not just Medicaid but the Affordable Care Act to draw those  people into the plan at practically no cost to them, except their  participation in an appropriate way.   Build Back Better contains historic Medicare prescription drug  negotiation. For the very first time, the Secretary of Health and Human  Services would have the power to negotiate lower prices for some of the  most expensive medicines our seniors use.   What is in the bill is a compromise. I have, for a generation, been  fighting for this important provision, for the Secretary to negotiate  for lower prices, really since, on this floor, we passed Medicare part  D, which was a real giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry. This now  reins that in.   Under this agreement, when people go to the pharmacy, instead of  paying hundreds and hundreds of dollars for their insulin, their bill  will be capped at just $35 a month. Think of what the difference that  makes in people's lives and how important insulin is to them.  [[Page H6226]]    In total, the most that any senior would be allowed to pay for their  medications in Medicare part D per year is $2,000 and not one penny  more. Big Pharma's outrageous price hikes above inflation will be  halted, not only for seniors, but for all Americans. That is  remarkable. That was one of the strong points of this agreement. There  we are with healthcare.   Under the green framework, we talked about climate. Under the health,  we talked about the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, et cetera, and the  prescription drug benefit. Now we are talking about Build Back Better.   There is a hashtag: Care can't wait. Indeed, it can't, and help is on  the way. In terms of family care, Build Back Better is the most  transformative initiative in children and caregivers in generations.  For decades, hardworking families have been struggling under a system  that stacks the deck against them. A situation made even worse by the  COVID pandemic. And that COVID pandemic sort of pulled back the veil on  how hard it was for people to deal with many of these challenges.   Our legislation, the Build Back Better, builds back better because it  saves most families more than half of their spending on childcare;  delivers free pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in America. Just on  those two scores, parents earning, children learning. It is possible  because of childcare and the universal pre-K; giving more than 35  million families a major tax cut by extending the expanded Biden child  tax credit; putting money in the pockets of families with children;  expand access to high-quality home care for older Americans and  Americans living with disabilities.   Madam Speaker, even some of my colleagues in this body on both sides  of the aisle have frequently told me that they spend more time caring  for their parents when they are sick than they did when their children  were small and they were sick because their parents are older and more  in need of that attention.   Well, this not only provides the high-quality care for older  Americans and Americans with disabilities, it also recognizes the value  of those people who are providing that care, treating them with respect  and with proper pay.   Then we make a significant contribution to workforce development. If  we are going to build back better, even in this bill, the bipartisan  infrastructure framework, it is important to have people be trained for  the jobs; and not only in construction, but in home healthcare and in  other ways.   In doing so, it was very important to President Biden and to all of  us, but this was a must for him in every aspect of the legislation, to  advance equity and opportunity with investments in maternal care,  nutrition, housing, and more. That equity is part of what is happening  in the infrastructure bill and here. We must have equity. We cannot  perpetuate disparities in income and living conditions and the rest,  and to do so with respect for work, honoring work, and to do so in a  way that has equity.   We have included permanent universal paid family and medical leave,  which is a pillar of our work for families. I hope that this will stay  in the bill.   We must get children learning, parents earning, as I mentioned, in a  way that assures women can follow a career path as they meet their  family needs. Just think of the liberation that this is, that women  will be able to go to work, follow their career path, help provide for  their families--maybe they are a single parent--provide for their  families, all the while knowing that their children, or if it happens  to be a parent, are well cared for. I am very excited about what it  does in that regard.   Again, I talked about the climate, and I won't go back into it,  except to say that with all that we want to do in the climate sector,  we have to meet our goals. If we are going to be true to any promise to  our children, grandchildren, or future generations, Build Back Better  will enable us to do so by cutting greenhouse gas pollution by over a  gigaton, helping meet the President's vision to cut pollution in half  by 2030, and protecting our children's health. It will drive forward  the clean energy economy, creating good-paying jobs and lowing  families' energy costs. It will advance environmental justice, back to  that equity issue, as it will educate a workforce for the future and  advance housing initiatives that are resilient and green.   The Build Back Better is fully paid for and reduces the national  debt. According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, this  legislation is fully paid for with its tax increase provisions in the  bill raising $1.5 trillion over 10 years, not including the additional  savings from the prescription drug pricing and the IRS tax enforcement.   Further analyses, based on CBO estimates, show that the legislation  reduces the deficit by over $36 billion over the next 10 years--are you  ready for this, Madam Speaker--then by at least $2 trillion over the  second decade.                                time  2150    As it reduces the debt and grows the economy, Build Back Better will  not increase inflation, according to experts. As 17 Nobel Prize-winning  economists recently wrote: ``Because this agenda invests in long-term  economic capacity and will enhance the ability of more Americans to  participate productively in the economy, it will ease longer term  inflationary pressures.''   Inflation is very important. We must pay attention to it. That is why  it is so essential to pay for the legislation. But I am a pay-as-you-go  person. I always want to be able to pay for and offset any new  investments that we have, so this legislation is consistent with that.   President John F. Kennedy once said that to govern is to choose. To  craft and pass this bill, choices had to be made. We see it is big; it  is transformative; and it is historic, so it will be challenging.  Different Members will have different views of how we go about  prioritizing and the rest.   In this very Chamber, when people come here, I love to tell them  about the history of this Chamber. This is a chamber that abolished  slavery, a chamber that declared war in World War II and before. It is  a historic chamber, a place that we all must treat with great respect.  And we will enhance the luster of this institution if we pass this  historic, transformative legislation.   No piece of legislation contains everything, and once we pass Build  Back Better, more work will remain to strengthen the financial security  of America's working families, to improve families' healthcare, to  protect the planet, and more. But we cannot and will not miss the  opportunity to build back better for women, for children, and for the  people.   The Build Back Better agenda creates more jobs, secures more major  tax cuts for the middle class, and lowers costs to families while  making the wealthiest pay their fair share. It is not punitive; it is  fair share.   It is an agenda for workers, for families, for children, for the  planet, and, as I said, for women. The passage of this rule will take a  strong step in achieving this goal.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule. I do so  with, again, special congratulations and gratitude to the distinguished  chair of the Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern; the distinguished chair of  the Budget Committee, Mr. Yarmuth; and so many of the chairs that you  have heard from here this evening: Mr. Richie Neal from Ways and Means,  so important in all of this; Frank Pallone of the Energy and Commerce  Committee; and  Bobby Scott in terms of the Education and Labor  Committee--these are three really important committees in the  legislation--and housing, Maxine Waters and her contribution in that  regard; Mr. Grijalva, in terms of climate issues, from the Natural  Resources Committee. The list goes on and on.   It is a list that is really a gallery of heroes, of people who have  brought their knowledge, their experience, their judgment, and their  legislative skill to bear to get the job done for the people.   We do all of this in such a way that it has equity.   We thank the President of the United States for his extraordinary  leadership, his encyclopedic knowledge of what is in the legislation  because he has been working on these issues so long, affording the  opportunity it will provide for families, children, dads, and moms who  need to have help at home and to do so in a way that treats people with  respect, respect for their work, respect for their families, and  respect for their future.  [[Page H6227]]    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the legislation.
