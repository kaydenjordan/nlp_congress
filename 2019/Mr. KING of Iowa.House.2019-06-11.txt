 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on June 11, 2019  as I had another commitment that did not allow me to make it back to  D.C. in time for votes. Had I been present, I would have voted as  follows: ``no'' on rollcall No. 245; ``no'' on rollcall No. 246; ``no''  on rollcall No. 247; and ``yes'' on rollcall No. 248.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
