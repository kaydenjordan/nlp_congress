 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  two Penn State University students who received critical language  scholarships following their completion of the U.S. Department of  State's Critical Language Scholarship Program in the summer of 2016.   The following students were two of the 564 total selected  participants. A total of 5,700 students applied.   Janet Purdy, of State College, reached an intermediate level of  Swahili while studying in Tanzania; and Erika Pugh, of Boalsburg,  achieved an advanced level of Arabic while studying in Russia.   The Critical Language Scholarship Program is a crucial component of  our Federal Government's goal to encourage Americans to master  languages that are essential to our national security and economic  prosperity. These students study abroad in rigorous summer institutes,  learning these critical foreign languages, while engaging with citizens  of the host countries to further their cultural educations.   We are proud of these two outstanding students from the Pennsylvania  State University for their achievements. Congratulations, Janet and  Erika.                            ____________________
