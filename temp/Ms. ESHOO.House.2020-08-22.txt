 Madam Speaker, I am here today to speak on behalf of the  Postal Service in our country.   I am here today because I view it as a Democratic institution in our  country.   I am here today because the Framers placed it in the Constitution.   I am here today because my constituents are not receiving their  prescription drugs, businesses are not receiving their mail, and people  are not receiving their mail.   I am here today to speak on their behalf because they are outraged.  They are outraged about two things that have happened, that the  President has said and attacked mail-in votes.   Guess how votes are counted?   They are carried by the mail service.   The Postmaster General, instead of building it up, is dismantling it.  It is over the top to see pictures of postal boxes being unhinged.   Vote for the Delivering for America Act. The people deserve it.
