 Madam President, I am pleased that today the Senate  passed S. 47, a bipartisan package of conservation and natural  resources bills that will help preserve irreplaceable historic sites  and conserve unique wildlife throughout my State of Maryland.   I worked with my counterpart, the junior Senator from Maryland, to  secure multiple provisions in the bill recognizing the historical and  cultural significance of great places, including Baltimore's President  Street Station, the oldest surviving urban railroad terminal in  America, as well as Public School 103, the elementary school where  Justice Thurgood Marshall first learned many of the lessons that would  make him a legendary lawyer and American jurist.   For years, we have worked to move Justice Marshall's elementary  school and President Street Station closer to improved, permanent  preservation so that current and future generations can learn the facts  about Baltimore's role in the American Civil War and in the Civil  Rights movement. In addition, the public lands package includes  permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund,  which has been a vital tool for securing public access in the  Chesapeake Bay Watershed through the creation of treasured parks,  refuges, community green spaces, battlefields, and habitat conservation  and restoration projects.   S. 47 also includes reauthorization of the Neotropical Migratory Bird  Conservation Act, which promotes long-term conservation, education,  research, monitoring, and habitat protection activities for more than  380 species of migratory birds, including Maryland's State bird, the  Baltimore Oriole.   The Baltimore Oriole and other migratory birds are critical  indicators of the health of Maryland's ecosystems, agriculture, and  outdoor recreation economy.   I am also delighted the package includes the Appalachian Forest  National Heritage Area Act, legislation I cosponsored led by my  colleagues in the Senate delegation from West Virginia. This bipartisan  legislation proposes to protect forest management heritage in portions  of West Virginia, as well as two counties in western Maryland, and to  develop interpretive and recreational themes. This will bring visitors  and small business development to this remarkable region.   No compromise is perfect, but this package will advance priorities in  every corner of my State that have been years in the making. I applaud  Senate passage of this landmark legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Protecting  Employees Security Clearances Act of 2019 (PESCA). I am pleased to have  Senators Leahy, Jones, Baldwin, Kaine, Feinstein, Hirono, Klobuchar,  Durbin, Shaheen, Cortez Masto, Hassan, and Van Hollen as cosponsors.  Our measure would protect federal employees and contractors from losing  their security clearances due to financial reasons, such as poor credit  scores, that are attributable to a lapse in federal appropriations. The  bill directs the Security Executive Agent to ensure that a lapse in  appropriations (including the one that ended last month) is considered  as a mitigating factor for initial or continued security clearance  eligibility during the adjudication process. More specifically, the  bill states that ``No head of any agency may revoke the national  security eligibility of a covered employee because of a reduction in  the credit score or negative information in a consumer credit file of  the covered employee that is attributable to disrupted income payments  as a result of a lapse in appropriations.''   Nearly 80 percent of Americans live from one paycheck to the next.  They cannot afford to miss even a single paycheck. Federal workers and  contractors are no different. ``Excepted'' employees--those individuals  who are compelled to work without pay during a shutdown--are guaranteed  retroactive pay. The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (Public Law  116-1), which I authored, now guarantees retroactive pay for furloughed  federal workers. I have co-sponsored S. 162, Senator Smith's bill to  provide retroactive pay for lower wage contractor employees. Currently,  there is no guarantee that contractor employees will be paid after a  shutdown ends.   Many federal workers and contractors are subject to high security  standards that include rigorous and routine financial background  checks. Missing payments on debts could create delays in securing or  renewing security clearances. We shouldn't punish these hard-working,  patriotic Americans because they are forced to go without pay during a  shutdown they bear no responsibility for causing. Providing retroactive  pay is the right and fair thing to do, but forcing these individuals to  miss one or more paychecks causes real financial harm. At a minimum,  their security clearances shouldn't be jeopardized as a result.   Last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association  (FBIAA) published a report entitled, ``Voices From The Field: FBI Agent  Accounts of the Real Consequences of the Government Shutdown.'' The  report warned of the dire national security consequences of the  shutdown. It also documented the financial hardships FBIAA members were  facing. Two comments from the FBIAA's Central Region summed up the  situation. One Agent wrote, ``My wife and I are both FBI employees who  were recently transferred to a new city and finally bought our first  home. Now we can't pay the mortgage for it. We contacted our lender,  and they are refusing to work with us. They don't want our `Hardship  Letter', they want money, period.'' Another wrote, ``There have been  several employees who have gotten zero assistance from their mortgage  lenders and banks regarding home and car loans and still have to make  payments on time or get penalized. They are truly struggling to make  ends meet.''   Last December, when President Trump met with Leader Schumer and soon- to-be Speaker Pelosi, he boasted about shutting the government down,  saying, ``I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down.''  While President Trump was proud ``to take the mantle,'' innocent  victims were taking it on the chin. Here we are, less than five days  away from another potential shutdown. I earnestly hope we can avoid  another shutdown. But in the interim, we urgently need to mitigate the  real harm federal workers and contractor employees suffer when they are  forced to go without their pay. Passing PESCA is one way to do that.  Just 13 days elapsed between the time I introduced the Government  Employee Fair Treatment Act and President Trump signed it into law. I  hope we can act with the same alacrity with respect to PESCA.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Protecting  Employees Security Clearances Act of 2019 (PESCA).
