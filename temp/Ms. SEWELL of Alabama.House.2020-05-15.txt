 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support our  HEROES Act.   This bill will provide $375 billion in support directly to local  governments, which would mean millions of dollars for my counties and  my towns in my district of Alabama.   These funds will help our communities with their lost revenues while  protecting the jobs of those essential workers.   Mr. Speaker, I stand with the heroes and sheroes of Alabama, and I  ask for all to support this bill, because we are dying in numbers, and  we need to make sure that we are doing all that we can to protect the  lives and livelihoods of all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the HEROES Act. Let's stand  with our heroes.
