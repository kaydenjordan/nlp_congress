 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the people who have called themselves  Latvians have been in existence for centuries and centuries, but the  nation state that we call Latvia has only existed for 100 years. So I  come to the floor to express the fact that on Saturday, the Republic of  Latvia celebrates 100 years as a country.   As cochair of the Senate Baltic Freedom Caucus, I recognized the  centenary of Estonia and Lithuania in February, and I mentioned that I  would be back this November to talk about Latvia's 100th anniversary,  like I did Estonia and Lithuania back in February.   On November 18, 1918, the People's Council of Latvia proclaimed  independence. However, the establishment of a separate Latvian state  did not come out of the blue. The movement toward an independent Latvia  was a process of continuous historical development going back to the  Latvian national awakening in the 1850s.   At that time, between local German-speaking nobles and the Russian  Imperial Government, and divided by the internal political boundaries  between the Russian Empire, Latvians did not control their political  fate. However, Latvians increasingly began to focus on promoting unity  around their distinct language and culture.   With the collapse of the tsarist government in Russia, Latvians began  to push for a united autonomous territory, although independence did  not yet seem feasible. When the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia and  attempted to consolidate control of Latvia, the time came to declare  independence. However, as we Americans know well, declaring  independence means being prepared to defend that decision of  independence.   Much as our Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and  their sacred honor to the cause of American independence, the Founding  Fathers of Latvia knew they would have to defend their independence  with the force of arms. In fact, they had to fight invasions by both  Soviets and Germans.   If this sounds familiar, it is because it is pretty much the same  story I described in February with the Estonian War of Independence. In  fact, the Latvians and Estonians coordinated closely and fought side by  side.   Latvia also received help from Lithuania and Poland. Soviet Russia  ultimately signed a peace treaty recognizing the independence and  sovereignty of Latvia and renouncing forever all claims to the  territory that is  [[Page S7037]]  now Latvia. Sadly, it wasn't long before the treaty was violated.   Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide up their neighbors between them in  the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.   The Soviets annexed Latvia and the other Baltics in the lead-up to  World War II. Then, of course, Hitler broke his end of the bargain and  invaded. At the end of the war, Stalin had taken back the Baltics and  made clear he was there to stay.   Despite courageous resistance of the Latvian forest brothers for many  years while Latvians held out hope of assistance by the United States  and the Western allies, Latvia remained occupied by the Soviet Union  for the next 50 years after World War II. However, the United States  never recognized the legitimacy of the Soviet occupation of Latvia.   Throughout the Cold War, we maintained diplomatic relations via  Embassy staff who had been accredited to the United States by Latvia  before the Soviet occupation.   I should note that if anyone is interested in learning more about the  Latvian or Baltic history, there are books on the subject written by a  professor emeritus at Iowa State University. The professor's name is  Andrejs Plakans.   After World War II, Latvians who had fled the Soviets or otherwise  found themselves outside their country were unable to go home to a  country under foreign occupation.   The Displaced Persons Act allowed refugees to come to the United  States, provided they had a sponsor, and about 700 of them came to my  home State of Iowa. There is a Latvian-American community in Iowa to  this very day.   In fact, the first Latvians to come to the Des Moines area were the  family of the current pastor of the Iowa Latvian Evangelical Lutheran  Church congregation, Leo Pelds.   After his family's initial arrangements for a job at a creamery in  Birmingham, AL, fell through, they heard that Iowa would be a good  choice as the climate would be what they were used to. So that family  moved to Des Moines. Other Latvians soon arrived, and they sponsored  further Latvians until there were 300 to 400 just in the Des Moines  area.   The Latvian Society of Iowa was formed in 1950, and the Latvia  Lutheran congregation was formed in 1952 after the arrival of the  Latvian pastor. Like in other Latvian diaspora communities around the  world, cultural events were organized to keep the Latvian culture  alive, and a Saturday school was established to teach Latvian language,  history, geography, and folk dances. Song festivals have played an  important role in the preservation of Latvian culture going back to the  national awakening, so naturally there was also a choir.   The Latvian Society of Iowa was part of the larger effort of the  Latvian, Estonian, and Lithuanian American communities to keep the  plight of the Baltics on the radar of our American political leaders.   Then, in 1991, thanks in part to the external pressure from the  United States, as well as the courageous efforts of Latvians themselves  and others in the Soviet Union demanding their freedom, the ``Evil  Empire'' collapsed. Latvia is now back in the family of free democratic  European nations, where it belongs.   Latvia is a member of NATO in excellent standing, both in terms of  meeting its financial commitment of 2 percent of GDP and in terms of  its soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder with Americans and other  allies in places like Afghanistan and Iraq.   Even while Latvia is looking toward a bright future, its large  neighbor to the east is ruled by a man who sees the fall of the Soviet  Union, including losing Latvia, as, in his words, the ``major  geopolitical disaster of the century.''   Those are the words of Vladimir Putin. He appears to be stuck in an  old-fashioned way of thinking that assigns smaller countries to the  Russian sphere of influence. He bullies neighbors that do not toe the  Russian line. In fact, he has even occupied the Ukrainian region of  Crimea, which the United States does not recognize, just as we didn't  recognize the Soviet occupation of the Baltics.   Vladimir Putin resents the fact that Latvia and the other Baltics  naturally choose to align with fellow European countries to their west,  with which they share a common European history, culture, and outlook.   Given their past and current experience dealing with KGB thugs like  Putin, the Latvians can provide invaluable insight as we grapple with  how to combat Russian disinformation. In fact, it is appropriate that  Riga is home to NATO's StratCom Centre of Excellence, which provides  analysis and solutions for NATO on strategic communications and  countering disinformation.   So, as I conclude, I look forward to continuing the strong  partnership between Latvia and the United States, and I offer my best  wishes to all the Latvians as they celebrate 100 years of Latvian  statehood.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to highlight the excellent  work being done by the Justice Department under this administration in  ensuring an accountable asbestos bankruptcy trust system.   In 1994, in response to widespread asbestos litigation in our  Nation's courts, Congress created a system of asbestos bankruptcy  trusts. The purpose of these trusts is twofold. First, they provide an  effective means for victims of asbestos exposure to obtain compensation  from the companies they worked for years earlier or whose products  caused their injuries. This helps provide some measure of justice for  those whose lives have been dramatically impacted by asbestos exposure.   At the same time, the companies, who otherwise face crippling  liability, obtain a degree of certainty as they emerge from bankruptcy  and reenter the stream of commerce.   Most importantly, these trusts are designed to ensure that all  victims, current and future, have access to compensation for their  injuries.   If the available funds are depleted unfairly through fraudulent  claims, abuse, or mismanagement, it is the future victims, or those  whose injuries have yet to manifest, who will feel the impact.   Unfortunately, the asbestos bankruptcy trust system has largely  lacked any meaningful, independent oversight to ensure that trusts are  not deceived into--or willingly engage in--paying erroneous claims to  unscrupulous lawyers. For years, I have called out this problem and the  need for more sunshine to deter potential abuse.   That is why I applaud the Justice Department's recent actions to  stand up for victims of asbestos exposure by ensuring an accountable  trust system.   In a recent letter to 20 State attorneys general who had called for  action, the Department forcefully criticized the ``problematic lack of  transparency in the operation and oversight of asbestos trusts'' and  acknowledged ``alarming evidence'' of ``fraud and mismanagement inside  trusts.''   On September 13, 2018, the Justice Department filed a statement of  interest in a case concerning a proposed asbestos bankruptcy trust in  North Carolina. The Department objected to the trust's formation,  arguing that the plans failed to include sufficient safeguards to  prevent fraud and abuse of the trust funds.   The Department further stated that the United States will object to  any plan that ``lacks critical provisions to ensure transparency and  accountability and to prevent fraudulent claims and mismanagement of  the trust funds[.]'' This includes ensuring that trusts comply with any  obligations under the Medicare Secondary Payer Statute, avoid conflicts  of interest, and prevent excessive administrative costs and attorney's  fees.   Shortly thereafter, on September 26, 2018, the Justice Department's  U.S. Trustee Program, for the first time ever, objected to the  appointment of a proposed future claimants' representative in a  separate asbestos bankruptcy case based on the candidate's apparent  conflicts of interest and close ties to lawyers representing current  claimants.   According to Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Jesse  Panuccio, ``[t]o best protect all victims, those appointed in asbestos  cases should be held to the same conflicts prohibitions and standards  of independence that are  [[Page S7043]]  required of other fiduciaries under the Bankruptcy Code.''   I couldn't agree more.   Asbestos bankruptcy trusts are created to compensate victims, not to  line the pockets of lawyers who file claims or administer the trusts.  Fraudsters and poor management cannot be allowed to cheat victims of  asbestos-related diseases out of the assistance Congress established  for them.   So I am pleased to see the Justice Department stepping up and using  its existing authority to push back against trust plans that fail to  put the victims' interests first. I applaud its commitment to  investigate conduct related to asbestos trusts that is illegal under  Federal law.   It is time the asbestos trust system protects the interests of the  victims, as Congress intended.   To be sure, however, Congress's job isn't finished. There are  commonsense steps we can take to better ensure that the Department has  the tools and authority it needs to police against fraud and  mismanagement.   Earlier this year, I cosponsored S. 2564, the PROTECT Asbestos  Victims Act, which would codify needed accountability measures for  asbestos trust oversight. This bill, introduced by Senator Tillis,  deserves strong bipartisan support. Among other reforms, it strengthens  the U.S. Trustee's statutory authority to investigate the  administration and operation of trusts. If the U.S. Trustee believes a  false claim or demand was paid by the trust, he or she may refer the  matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office. It criminalizes a knowingly and  fraudulently false claim or representation to a trust. It better  ensures that the right people are appointed as future claims  representatives, in other words, those who understand that their duty  is to future victims, not to their trial lawyer friends.   These are commonsense reforms, and I invite all of my colleagues to  join in support.   In the meantime, I fully expect the Justice Department to keep up its  great work in protecting asbestos victims and the American taxpayer by  policing against waste, fraud, and mismanagement in the asbestos  bankruptcy trust system.                            ____________________
