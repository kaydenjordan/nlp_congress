 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you and the Members of this  distinguished body for welcoming me. Representing the people of  Arizona's Eighth Congressional District is truly an honor, and I am  eager to work with you all to ensure that we accomplish what my  constituents sent me here to do: secure our borders, strengthen our  military, and create a strong economy.   Earlier today, I met with Mike and Colleen Sutter from my district.  Mike and Colleen have been small-business owners for over 27 years in  Arizona.   Due to the recent tax cut package, Mike and Colleen were able to give  across-the-board pay increases and bonuses to their employees,  including a $3 an hour increase for hourly employees. The tax cuts have  meant real dollars getting into the pockets of Americans and small  businesses.                            ____________________
