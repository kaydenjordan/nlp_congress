 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of  the House majority whip the floor schedule for next week.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn) my friend, the House majority whip.    Madam Speaker, as we look at some of the bills that are  going to be coming to the floor next week, I know there has been a lot  of talk about infrastructure.   As we saw over these past few days, there is a bipartisan bill that  is being worked through mostly in the Senate, where a number of  Republicans and Democrats had seemed to reach an agreement on what  would be considered traditional infrastructure without tax increases.  It has now become a little more confused by a suggestion that maybe the  Speaker has said it has to be tied to a budget reconciliation bill that  would possibly raise taxes, which is surely not where we are. It  doesn't seem to be where the bipartisan group in the Senate is.   I would ask the gentleman: Is there any expectation--because we don't  have a budget that has moved through the House, and a budget would have  to move first to create the ability for a budget reconciliation bill to  move through the House or the Senate, if that even happened.   Is there expectation there would be a budget resolution coming to the  floor in the upcoming weeks?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.                                time  1100     Madam Speaker, for decades, we have never really had a  disagreement on what infrastructure means. I think most Americans would  recognize the definition that we have always gone by on a bipartisan  basis, and it is roads and bridges, waterways and ports.   I think, recently, both sides would agree that broadband is something  that we would include in that definition, but that is what always was  the traditional definition of infrastructure by both parties.   It seems like on the majority side they are trying to change that  definition to include a lot of extraneous things of which were not part  of the Senate bipartisan agreement. But the other new addition seems to  be this idea that a bill, a shell reconciliation bill to raise taxes,  would now be something that would maybe hold hostage the rest of the  bipartisan agreement.   I hope that is not the road we go down, especially considering there  does  [[Page H3149]]  seem to be a lot of bipartisan movement on something that we would all  agree is traditional infrastructure.   I know the bill next week that is being brought to the House floor  does not meet that bipartisan test of what Senators and others who are  trying to work together have reached agreement on. So, hopefully, this  doesn't get bogged down in a fight on things that are not considered  infrastructure.   I don't know if the gentleman has anything to add to it. I would hope  we would go down the road where both parties could come to an agreement  and we could actually get something done.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate that. I hope as we look  toward something that we could all agree on, that that is the road we  stay on, so to speak, as we talk about infrastructure, not extraneous  things that we don't agree on.   Clearly, we have looked at and agreed on things like broadband, and  we have seen the FCC take good steps to continue to expand broadband,  especially in rural areas where there is a true digital divide that we  are trying to overcome.   I know Congress has come together many times in the last few years to  try to put more money in place to bridge that gap on the digital  divide. There is still more work to do. Especially during the pandemic,  we saw there are more needs. But if we could keep it focused on those  things, I think you will see a lot of bipartisan agreement. Once it  gets beyond that, that is where things break down.   What I want to ask about, something that is going to expire at the  end of next week, and that is this proxy voting scheme that has been  going on since May of last year.   From what the majority had presented when this got created was the  reason that proxy voting was there is because we had a pandemic and  things were shut down, and people had trouble getting around and maybe  were concerned about the virus and not wanting to leave maybe their  home or their local community.   Obviously now, with a vaccine readily available for any American who  wants to take it, with more States opening up, and you are seeing even  here in Congress many committees that were not having in-person  hearings are now getting back to in-person hearings.   So what I would ask the gentleman is: When proxy voting expires on  July 3, can we let Congress get back to the normal work and not renew  proxy voting?   Because, as we have seen, there is a lot more cooperation, a lot more  agreement you can reach when you are here in person working together  that you just can't get on a Zoom or Webex call or just somebody  staying at home proxy voting and not coming here to Washington when now  everyone, who wants to, can come.   We have looked at what this has done. It has hurt the institution, in  our opinion. But there are six Democrats who, since this got started  last year, have never come to vote in person except for the vote for  Speaker of the House because that is a vote that you cannot cast by  proxy. So if they were able to get here for the vote for Speaker in  January, yet on every other vote have not cast a single vote in person,  then it is clear it is not because they have no ability to get to  Washington.   It feels like there is an abuse of this proxy voting that has shown  it needs to end. I don't know if there is an expectation next week that  the majority would renew this. We would urge strongly that we let it  expire on July 3, and then get back to the work that we do in person.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate that. Hopefully, we just let  it expire. Clearly, that is our hope. We urge the majority to consider  that because, if you look at voting, it is good that we are finally  limiting the time so we can have a normal voting schedule or at least  get closer to that.   As we look at the appropriations process, for example, where  appropriations bills will start moving out of committee in July, may  start coming to the floor in July, as we know, if we have a robust,  open process for appropriations bills, typically you might have 100  amendments on a given appropriations bill, and so many times we have  late-night votes. We have 2-minute votes because, if Congress is truly  going to process those amendments in an orderly way, even 15-minute  votes or 5-minute votes haven't worked. So we went to a 2-minute voting  schedule.   You can't do that if we have proxy voting because, as the gentleman  knows, it does eat up a lot more time and delays our ability to move  through a normal appropriations process.   So looking toward that, the July 3 date is there. If it expires, as  we hope it does, I think that would help Congress to more effectively  work through some of the big bills that we have on our calendar ahead.  I know you all will be considering that. I think the gentleman knows  where we are and what we would hope happens.   I do want to ask about some of the crises that we are seeing around  the country. You look at inflation continuing to be a growing problem.  We had in our committee the Federal Reserve Chairman Powell just a few  days ago, who talked about the concerns with 5 percent inflation we  continue to see.   Whether it is gasoline prices, double-digit increases, everything we  buy at the grocery, you are starting to see larger increases in costs  for grocery items. Housing, if you are just trying to buy a house, to  renovate your house, those costs are higher. If you want an appliance,  you might have to wait for 6 months.   Much of that is because of the labor shortage. Every small business  you talk to says the biggest impediment they have to getting their  businesses back up again is that the Federal Government is paying  people more money not to work than to go back to work. When you have  millions of job openings, it doesn't seem to make sense that we are  allowing people to be paid not to work when businesses are trying and  struggling to get back on their feet from this pandemic.   I don't know if there is an anticipation to bring legislation to  start confronting some of those problems.   Clearly, we see the Vice President at the border today. While she is  not at  [[Page H3150]]  the areas of the border where you see the biggest increases in illegal  crossings, we know that there is a crisis in the United States. And it  is not just people in South and Central America coming across. We are  seeing people from Middle Eastern countries. There have been people on  the terrorist watch list who are coming. I hope that as she comes back  from that trip--hopefully she has met with Border Patrol agents.   People have told us what the problems are. The President could  address all of this today by reversing some of his executive actions  that have opened the border. But if he doesn't, I hope Congress would  look at bringing legislation to confront a lot of those challenges that  I talked about.   I am not sure if you all anticipate bringing bills like that, but I  would ask the gentleman if he had any comment on that.   Madam Speaker, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As we know, the Federal Reserve Chairman has some tools available to  him, if need be, to address problems in the economy that we are  starting to see, but we also know that those tools are very harsh.  Hopefully, those tools would be a last resort.   So it is important for us, as policymakers, to not just sit back and  wait for problems to occur that then the Federal Reserve Chairman has  to address because we haven't. Because we know if he does those things,  whether it is limiting money supply, interest rate increases, those are  all things that would hurt hardworking families all across the country.   So as he even recognized, right now the enhanced unemployment  benefits that are, by all accounts, the reason that we are having a  worker shortage, the reason that every small business is having trouble  getting more people back to work so they can meet that supply demand  that is starting to create inflation, he did acknowledge that when  those enhanced benefits run out, then you will see the worker shortage  get better and improve and people start going back to work.   We could end those earlier, acknowledging there are millions of job  openings. We shouldn't be paying people money to not work when there  are jobs that are available right now and they can't find takers.   What we have seen is a majority of States now have said: We are going  to end those benefits on our own so that people can get back to work,  so that we can get our economies moving.   Many large States--Florida, Texas, Tennessee, and many other States-- by the end of next week will do that.   I am proud that yesterday in my State, our Governor, who is a  Democrat, signed a bill working with Republicans to end our enhanced  unemployment benefits in Louisiana by the end of July.                                time  1115    He acknowledged, as a Democrat, that you can work together, and that  this is a problem, so let's address this problem. While States are  addressing it, some are not. Many have.   But, hopefully, Congress can look at ways where we can address some  of these problems earlier so that it doesn't fall in the lap of the  Federal Reserve Chairman, and then he has to take harsh steps to deal  with the problems that we should be fixing as we see them coming.   I yield to the gentleman if he has anything else. That is all I have.    I appreciate that because I work well with our Governor.  We might not see eye to eye on everything, but Governor John Bel  Edwards is addressing those problems adequately. He worked with the  Republican legislature. They got an agreement, and it was a good  agreement.   I know you have a good relationship with your Governor. You and I  have a good relationship. Hopefully, we can use those good  relationships to prove people wrong who look at Congress and say: Why  can't they get agreements on things?   Again, we are seeing some positive movement on the Senate side. I  haven't seen the details, and the details are very, very important.  But, hopefully, on these big issues, we can work together and build  those relationships so that we can actually solve these problems and  solve them in a way that doesn't harm families, where it could end up  in a harsh place if we don't confront those problems. I know we will be  talking more about that in the future.   If the gentleman is not the one doing the colloquy in the future--we  hope the majority leader is back--I have enjoyed this colloquy with  you. We, obviously, enjoy our relationship on many fronts, but it has  been a pleasure to work with you on the colloquy.   Hopefully, the majority leader is here next time, and he has big  shoes to fill. I yield to the gentleman.    He will probably be moving around even faster. I will  not challenge him to a race. I am not quite where he is yet, but I am  working to get there.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
