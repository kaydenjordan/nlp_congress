 Mr. President, I join in the wonderful words of my  colleague from California, a true leader. He is someone who has served  as an election official and the secretary of state for the biggest  State in our Nation. He knows how important it is to count the votes  and to make sure we allow everyone to vote.   I come to the floor today to join him and to join Senator Leahy and  other of our colleagues to honor the legacy of Congressman John Lewis  and to continue his fight to make sure that every American can make  their voice heard at the ballot box.   As my colleagues have mentioned, it has been just over a year since  John Lewis passed. I have always been in awe of him. This past week, I  had the opportunity to reflect on his monumental contributions to our  Nation when the Senate Rules Committee held a field hearing on voting  rights in his home State of Georgia at the National Center for Civil  and Human Rights, a place that commemorates the civil rights movement.   Today, as we celebrate his legacy, I am reminded of his persistence,  his resilience, and his faith that this country could be better if only  we put in the work. It was his faith in our country that led him to  Selma, AL, where he helped lead 600 marchers across the Edmund Pettus  Bridge on that dark day that became known as Bloody Sunday. Several  times, several years, including the last year that he came to that  bridge before he died, I was able to stand with him on the bridge in  awe of everything he had done.   The horrific events of that day shocked the Nation, with marchers  attacked with clubs and tear gas. Congressman Lewis's skull was  fractured. He bore the scars until the very end of his life.   Soon after, President Lyndon Johnson came to the Capitol, and, as he  said, ``with the outrage of Selma still fresh,'' urged Congress to  guarantee the freedom to vote. Months later, with the help of former  Minnesota Senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the Voting Rights  Act was signed into law.   One of the times I visited was, in fact, the 48th year anniversary of  that march. That weekend, after 48 years, the police chief of  Montgomery handed his badge to Congressman Lewis and apologized for not  protecting him and the other freedom marchers. Forty-eight years is a  long time, and it only happened because Congressman Lewis never quit  fighting for progress, for civil rights, for economic justice, and to  defend the voting rights of every American.   But now, more than five decades since that day in Selma and since the  Voting Rights Act became the law of the land, so much of the progress  that Americans have fought and even died for is at stake. Throughout  our country's 245-year history, we have had to course-correct and take  action to ensure that our democracy--for the people, by the people-- actually lives up to its ideals.   We all had that moment, that night after the insurrection when this  Chamber, which we are standing in, was taken over by those who did not  believe in our election processes and in our democracy. And we not only  came back to this Chamber that night, but, 2 weeks later, we stood  under a beautiful blue sky and declared--Democrats or Republicans or  Independents--that we stood with our democracy.   And as I said that day, that was a day where our democracy stood up,  brushed itself off, and we went forward as ``one nation under God,  indivisible, with life and liberty for all.''   That is why earlier this week, believing that the job is not done,  especially when over 400 bills have been introduced across this country  in nearly every State, with 28 of them already signed into law,  including an egregious example in Georgia--that is why--for the first  time in two decades, we took the Senate Rules Committee on the road and  held a field hearing in Atlanta to shine a spotlight on what is  happening in Georgia and in States across the country to undermine the  freedom to vote.   We heard from State legislators and a former election official who  had lost her job after a change in law meant that local election  officials were taken away from their posts. And we heard from a voter,  a veteran who had stood in line for hours and hours just to cast his  vote. And when I asked him, when he signed up for the Air Force, was  there a waiting line, he said no.   Well, there shouldn't be a waiting line to vote in the United States  of America, and that is why it is so critical that Congress pass basic  Federal standards--that is the For the People Act--to ensure that all  Americans can cast a ballot in a way that works best for them and that  is safe for them, whether it is early voting, whether it is vote by  mail, which so many Americans in red States and blue used across the  country during the pandemic.   And as we know the history of that, in States like the Presiding  Officer's State of Colorado, or States like Utah, known as a red State,  or States like Oregon, that has been the way they have been doing  business safely for a long time. And many of us, for the first time,  voted in that way   But there are other ways as well, with dropoff ballot boxes. Some  people have not registered way early because maybe they moved to a  State, as we know happens in the United States, or maybe they are a  young person at college, or maybe they forgot to register and they have  to catch up and do it. None of those reasons, those simple reasons that  could happen to anyone in their everyday life, should be reasons to ban  people from voting, and that is why these basic Federal standards are  so important.   When we were in Georgia, we heard from Helen Butler, who I mentioned  was a former election official from rural Morgan County, who pointed  out that it was only after Black voters increased their vote-by-mail  numbers in the 2020 election that the Georgia Legislature imposed new  restrictions on mail-in ballots, after all those years.  [[Page S5005]]    Georgia State Senator Sally Harrell also testified about how the bill  was rushed through--this restrictive voting bill--through the Georgia  Legislature without meaningful debate.   We heard about the provisions of the bill that basically say that  nonpartisan--that is already required, and that is correct--nonpartisan  volunteers can't even give voters water when they stand in line,  despite the fact that there were voters that we heard from the day  before, with Senator Merkley and Stacy Abrams, and those voters stood  in line for 3 hours, for 4 hours, and for 7 hours.   We heard about the runoff changes. The runoff used to be 9 weeks in  Georgia. It was reduced to 28 days. And during the runoff period, you  can't vote, under the new law, on Saturdays and Sundays. You can vote  that way during the general election. All of this--all of this--is  done, in the words of one North Carolina judge, many years ago, in a  decision, who said: This law discriminates with surgical precision-- literally going through ways that people voted, literally noticing that  70,000 new voters registered during the runoff, and then banning that  because you have to register now 29 days ahead, when the time for the  runoff is 28 days. How obvious can you get?   Where you live and what your ZIP Code is should not dictate whether  or not you can vote for President or U.S. Senate or Congress or  Governor or any election. We owe it to the people of this country, and  to those across the country who stood in line for hours to cast a  ballot, to take action and protect the fundamental right to vote.   I know a little bit about that because, in my State of Minnesota,  nearly every single election has the highest voter turnout in the  country. And guess what. We have elected Republican Governors with  those rules that allow for more people to vote and the highest voter  turnout. We have elected Democratic Governors, and we have elected  Jesse Ventura. What I have noticed is not who wins, given that we are  the only State in the country that has one State House that is  Republican and one State House that is Democratic, given that our  congressional delegation in the House is split evenly and has changed  over time. It is not really who wins. It is how people feel about  elections. They are part of the franchise we call democracy.   So they will come up to me and say, ``You know, I didn't vote for  you, but whatever; you are doing OK,'' or ``I have this concern.'' But  they feel like they are part of the action. That is what our goal  should be, to have all Americans feel like they are part of the action.   We must meet this moment. As President Biden said in Philadelphia  last week, this is the ``test of our time.'' So what do we do? Well,  first, we must pass the For the People Act, which Senators Schumer and  Merkley and I introduced, along with many others, to ensure that all  Americans can cast their ballot.   It is nothing radical. You know why it is not radical? It is firmly  based in the Constitution. On the basic voting rights, the Constitution  literally says that Congress can make or alter the rules and the manner  in which Federal elections occur. That has never been questioned. It  has been affirmed time and time again.   The other bill, the bill we are focused on today, Congressman Lewis's  bill, that is the Voting Rights Act, and you restore the Voting Rights  Act after a Supreme Court decision struck down parts of that bill. I  didn't agree with it. I agreed with then-Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's  dissent, but you fix it with the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  Act.   It is now Congress's responsibility--the Supreme Court decision made  that clear--to restore and modernize the Voting Rights Act and provide  the Federal Government with the necessary tools to combat the assault  on Americans' right to vote. We must recommit to the original goal of  the Voting Rights Act to end discrimination in voting in America. We  know this is something, historically, until recent years, that brought  everyone together. The Senate reauthorized the Voting Rights Act in  1982 by a vote of 85 to 8, including 43 Republicans; in 1992, by a vote  of 75 to 20, including 25 Republicans; and in 2006--2006--with a  unanimous 98 to 0 vote, including 51 Republicans. And I don't think  anyone with a straight face can say: Well, the reason we don't need to  do this anymore is that we don't have any discriminatory laws being  enacted on the State basis or there aren't any laws being enacted that  limit voting.   Truly, maybe you should read some of the court decisions, if you  think that.   I would say there is a stronger argument to do this, both sides of  the aisle. John Lewis's bill is so important, and it isn't a substitute  for passing the For the People bill, but we must do that, as well as  include election infrastructure funding in the reconciliation bill,  which I believe will be coming our way soon.   I will end with this. Last Sunday, I had the privilege of attending  services at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where I got to hear  Reverend Warnock. There was a guest preacher, but for me it was like he  was also preaching. And I got to hear him say something I will never  forget. He said this:         A vote is a prayer; it's a prayer for a better world, a       prayer for your kids' education, a prayer that you're going       to finally be able to do something about this world's       environment.    So during the last election, we saw an unprecedented number of people  go to the polls to do just that. Not every one of their candidates won,  but they believed enough in our democracy, in the middle of a public  health crisis, that they went and cast their vote.   In Congressman John Lewis's words, ``The right to vote is precious  and almost sacred, and one of the most important blessings of our  democracy.'' Today, we must be vigilant in protecting that blessing.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
