 Madam Speaker, 244 years ago women were  left out of our Constitution by the men who drafted it. But since then,  generations of women and men have blazed a steady trail towards  equality in this country; but we still do not have constitutional  equality.   I attended many ERA events representing the League of Women Voters in  the 1970s, and if someone would have told me then that we would still  be fighting for this in 2020, I would have said that it was a failure  of justice.   Why is anyone against rights for everyone?   Madam Speaker, equal rights for women transcend your politics, they  transcend your age, where you are from, and your gender.    Women in this country continue to receive unequal pay, suffer from  harassment in the workplace, endure discrimination for pregnancies, and  fight long legal battles over domestic violence cases. A correction of  our Constitution is clearly long overdue.   Liberty and justice for all must apply equally to women and men in  this country. Let's pass this resolution.
