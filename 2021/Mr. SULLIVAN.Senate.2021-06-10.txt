 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is Thursday, and it is that time of  the week. I know a lot of our reporters in the Senate like this because  it is the signal of kind of the end of the workweek here. Of course, it  is also a signal that I get to come to the floor and do what is one of  my favorite elements about being a U.S. Senator: talking about someone  who makes Alaska what I believe to be the greatest State in the  country. We call this person our Alaskan of the Week.   Before I get to talking about our Alaskan of the Week--an  extraordinary young man named Michael Martinez--let me tell you a  little bit about what is going on in Alaska right now.   Today, in Anchorage, the Sun rose at 4:44 a.m., and it will set  tonight at 11 p.m. It was light almost all day. Blackout curtains are  up, and 12 midnight Sun celebrations are abounding. It is a great time  of the year to be in Alaska. You can't believe the energy you feel.   We were recently able to pass a cruise ship bill--and I appreciate  the Presiding Officer's doing that a couple of weeks ago--that enables  cruise ships to come back to our State this summer. So we are going to  have tourists coming, and you should, too, America. If you are watching  on C-SPAN, come on up. Alaska is safe. It is beautiful. If it is on  your bucket list, make it happen this summer. You will love it. You  will see breathtaking scenery and some of the most generous, innovative  people in the country. You will not be disappointed. So come on up.   You will be in a State where 21-year-old Michael Martinez, our  Alaskan of the Week, was born and raised--one of the many, many reasons  I remain optimistic about the state of our State and the state of our  country. So let me tell you a little bit about Michael.   His mother, Mary, is from the village of Kotlik in the Yukon- Kuskokwim Delta. She is Yupik. His father, Eufemio, is from Central  Mexico. So those two met and married in Anchorage, and that is where  Michael was raised.   As I said, he is 21 years old now and has one more year to go before  he receives his bachelor of science degree in chemistry from the  University of Alaska Anchorage--a great university. Although he has  been very successful so far in his already having won many awards for  his research, he plans on going to graduate school. There is so much  for him to study, after all, and his interest in science runs very  deep, as it has since he was a young boy when he began winning science  fairs.   An Alaska reporter wrote a story in 2016--so 5 years ago--already  documenting then young Michael's successes. The first award was for an  experiment demonstrating how weight and length affect the throwing  distance of traditional hunting spears used by Alaska Natives. Isn't  that a cool research topic? In eighth grade, he won an award for  designing a robot.   Eventually, he moved on to bigger and better things, like, at the  tender age of 16, trying to find a cure for cancer and getting  mentorship from his high school teachers at Service High School in  Anchorage and, very importantly, in the Alaska Native Science and  Engineering Program--what we call ANSEP--in Alaska. He won the Emperor  Science Award, which is a prestigious science research award offered  through PBS Learning Media and Stand Up to Cancer.   Michael worked with his mentor, Dr. Holly Martinson, Ph.D., from the  University of Alaska Anchorage, to make a database for Alaska Natives  suffering from cancer. It was his introduction to the world of  research, and he fell in love with it. He entered ANSEP.   Let me talk to you a little bit about ANSEP. It is a program that  attracts young Alaska Native students from all over Alaska and provides  extraordinary educational opportunities for them in science, in the  STEM fields. ANSEP students have been enormously successful and have  gone on to do incredible, incredible things. I can't say enough about  this tremendous program.   Eventually, Michael was introduced to another mentor, Dr. Brandon  Briggs, a professor of biological sciences and the director of the  Advanced Instrumentation for Microbiome Studies. It was his work at Dr.  Briggs' lab that led him to his current passion of finding better  environmentally friendly ways to extract much needed, even critical,  materials from the Earth.   Increasingly, both here in Congress and across the country, we have  been focusing on metals and minerals that are needed to power our  future, particularly rare earth elements and critical minerals. So much  of our economic future and our national defense depends upon these  minerals. The problem--although we have many of these minerals, rare  earths included, in our country and particularly in Alaska--is that our  mining industry has had incredibly difficult times in terms of being  able to access them, whether it be with permitting delays that take  years, with far-left environmental lawsuits that prohibit the  extracting of them, or with the lack of production capacity. The result  is that China, like it is in so many other areas, is dominant,  controlling up to 90 percent of some of these critical minerals.   Like many of the challenges we face and confront with China, we need  the best minds in America working on these things. Our young minds hold  the promise of our future.   That is one of the reasons we recently passed a bill right here in  the Senate this week to fund research institutions, so that we can  unleash this talent and creativity.   This is where our Alaskan of the Week, Michael, comes in. It was  recently announced that Michael won first place in the High North Young  Entrepreneur Award at the High North Dialogue, an international pitch  competition for Arctic-related business ideas. Here is what he won it  for: forming a company with his adviser-mentor, Dr. Briggs, called  Arctic Biotech Oath, which is working on sustainably extracting rare- earth elements, as I said, which are in abundance in Alaska.   How does this work? What is the science and chemistry that he is  already working on? In a lab, they are using microorganisms, fungi,  which dig into the ore, breaking it up, and releasing the rare-earth  element into a solution, which is a more natural and sustainable  process to extract these rare-earth elements.   This process is still in research and development, but it has  incredible potential for our Nation and for our State, and he has  founded a company that is doing this, and Michael is just 21 years old.  Michael could be anywhere doing this, but he is staying in Alaska  because Alaska is home, and he is committed to contributing to our  State.         That is why I'm still here. And that's why the company will       be here and will be based in Alaska. I was born and raised       here. I am trying to improve our State and see Alaska soar       and thrive within the next couple of decades. I want to see a       green energy sector evolve in Alaska.    So that is Michael. He wants to be part of this, and he is part of  this at the tender age of 21.   So to Michael, thanks for all your hard work.   By the way, thanks to all the mentors in Michael's life and ANSEP and  UAA, which have helped him along the way.   Good luck in your endeavors, and congratulations, Michael, for being  our Alaskan of the Week.    Mr. President, here is how this excellent editorial  begins:         The U.S. is barreling toward one of the greatest self-      inflicted wounds in our country's history.    I could not agree more.   The editorial goes on to list the different actions that I just  mentioned--restricting energy production in America, including in  Alaska, with ANWR, restricting pipelines, encouraging defunding of the  energy sector. It is not good for the country.   The editorial also notes that this will have no impact on global  greenhouse gas emissions. None. None. It is virtue signaling at the  expense of working families, working Americans, and our national  security.   Right now, we are beginning to import more oil from Russia than we  ever have. How does that make any sense? How does that help a working  family in Alaska or Maryland or anywhere? It doesn't. It does one  thing: It empowers countries like Russia and Putin and Saudi Arabia at  the expense of the United States. This is a fact. Yet, every day you  hear a new action. You read a new quote from someone in this  administration focused on killing the energy sector of the United  States. Again, as the Wall Street Journal just mentioned, this will be  recognized in history as one of the greatest self-inflicted wounds,  with no upside. No upside.   We have the highest environmental standards in the world in Alaska  when we produce oil. Highest in the world. Russians have the lowest,  and yet we are now preferring Russian oil over American oil.    Can anyone tell me how this makes sense? It doesn't.   Here is how the editorial concludes:         Progressives want to surrender one of America's [most]       strategic economic advantages in the name of [so-called]       saving the climate. But banishing fossil fuels in the [United       States] won't eliminate carbon emissions, which will [just]       be produced [elsewhere]. So will . . . jobs [and] economic       growth and [the] geopolitical [advantage that comes with our       energy dominance].    Let me conclude by saying this. As I mentioned, I agree with  President Biden and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. We need to  address challenges, particularly with our adversaries like China and  Russia, from positions of strength. Two of the most prominent positions  of strength--the U.S. military and our energy dominance--right now are  being undermined by this very administration.   They need to change course, and if they do, we will support their  actions.   I yield the floor.
