 Mr. Speaker, we have all heard that life is about  making choices. Serving in Congress requires making big choices on a  big stage that are forever chronicled in our votes. Take out all the  rhetoric and all the policy disagreements and, at the end of this  debate, every Member of the House will have a choice to make and a vote  to cast.   Making choices is about setting priorities. House Republicans have  made it clear that cutting spending, securing the border, and keeping  the government open while we finish the yearlong spending bills are our  priorities.   It is no secret, based on previous actions, that my friends across  the aisle prioritize out-of-control spending and an open border. I  anticipate their priorities will outweigh their desire to keep the  government open. That is their choice.   Since President Biden took office, our debt has skyrocketed,  inflation is strangling our citizens, and thousands of pounds of  fentanyl and millions of illegal immigrants, including more than 150 on  the terrorist watch list, have poured over our southern border and into  our communities. This immigration crisis is so bad that the Biden  administration has resorted to building migrant shelters in our  national parks and waiving environmental laws to do it.   This has to stop. The choices are clear. The conservative solution  will  [[Page H4891]]  avoid a government shutdown, secure our borders, and keep us on track  to restore fiscal sanity. Let me be clear that a vote against this bill  is a vote to continue down the path of out-of-control spending, to keep  our borders open, and to shut down the government.   Mr. Speaker, I have made my choice to vote ``yes,'' and I encourage  others to do the same.
