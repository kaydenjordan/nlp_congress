 Mr. Speaker, it is with a very heavy heart that I offer my  prayers and sincerest gratitude to Ms. Jenn Wickre, a longtime staffer  on House Science, Space, and Technology Committee.   I had the honor of working with her under former Chairman Lamar Smith  and now under Chairman Frank Lucas and their leadership. Jenn has been  an integral part of the committee, and her departure will leave a void  that will be absolutely impossible to fill.   Over the years, my staff and I have grown very close to Jenn, often  relying on her expertise and strong work ethic. We have traveled  together on several very meaningful and informative codels, very  interesting ones, and I have always appreciated Jenn's input to and her  service on these wonderful trips that we have taken.   She is reliable. She acts with thoughtfulness and has always been  able to provide an insightful perspective in approaching policy.  Throughout her time on the committee, Jenn has shown an unshakeable  passion for serving our Nation and advocating for the goals of  our Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Her professionalism and one-of-a-kind personality have left an  enduring mark, and she will be greatly missed in the Halls of Congress.   I am sure that I speak for many in expressing my very deepest  appreciation for Jenn and her years of service and lasting  contributions. She is a shining example, without question, of public  service. Whether she knows it or not, she has made a significant  difference in the lives of many Americans.   We wish her and her family the very best during this time, and she is  in our deepest prayers.   I thank Jenn. We are praying for her, and may God bless her always.
