 Mr. President, Senators' bipartisan discussions  continued all day yesterday and through the night. Both sides'  negotiators, with the administration, are continuing to work toward a  bipartisan agreement on major legislation to support American workers  and families, protect small businesses, help to stabilize our economy,  and put more resources on the frontlines of our healthcare battle  against the coronavirus.   As of now, an agreement has yet to be finalized, but our committee  chairs, their Democratic counterparts, and President Trump's  representatives are making important progress.   Yesterday, I took action on the floor to keep the process moving  along with the urgency that it demands. By rule, it set up our first  procedural vote for tomorrow, and then, on Monday, the Senate will vote  on passage.   It has only been 2 days since Senate Republicans introduced the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act to give shape and  structure to these urgent discussions. We put forward four objectives:   First, put emergency cash in the hands of individuals and families as  quickly as possible.   Second, deliver the major relief that American small businesses need  at this unprecedented time, and deliver it fast.   Three, help bring some stability to our economy and prevent as many  layoffs as possible.   Four, continue to rush resources to the frontline healthcare workers  and providers who are actually treating patients.   And perhaps most important of all, we looked specifically for  policies that could do all of the above as quickly as humanly possible.   Small businesses all across the country have made it clear: If they  are going to keep their lights on and keep their employees on payroll,  they need help, and they need it now.   Americans who have already been laid off due to this crisis have made  it clear they need help and they need it now. Key national industries  which are hemorrhaging business through no fault of their own but due  to the government's own public health guidance have made it clear: In  order to retain their workers, they need help, and they need it now.   In particular, every single American who has opened a newspaper or  turned on the television in the last week has heard from our brave  nurses, doctors, first responders, and public health experts: If our  Nation is going to punch back and beat this virus, the people on the  medical frontlines need our help, and they need it now.   Senate Republicans put out our starting proposal as fast as we could.  Then I created a structure for bipartisan discussions to begin as fast  as they could. No legislation will move through the Senate that does  not contain ideas from both parties. That is the way this body is  designed. So these bipartisan talks have been essential, and they are  ongoing, but what we need to do now is move forward.   Now, 2 days ago the press reported that a senior Member of the House  Democratic leadership told his colleagues: ``This is a tremendous  opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision''--a senior Member  of the House Democratic leadership.   Well, let me suggest that that is exactly--exactly--the wrong  approach right now. That is the kind of thinking that could bog down  these urgent discussions. That is the kind of mindset that the American  people cannot afford for their elected representatives to adopt. I hope  it does not describe the view of our own Senate Democratic colleagues  as we try to close out these talks.   More Americans are being laid off every day. More small businesses  are being forced to shed payroll every day. Our nurses and doctors are  running lower on key supplies every day. This is not a political  opportunity. This is not a political opportunity. This is a national  emergency. It is time to come together, finalize the results of our  bipartisan discussions, and then close this out.   Earlier this week, I had the Senate move quickly to pass the more  modest bill that came over from the Democratic House of  Representatives. I didn't believe it was perfect--far from it. But  Senate Republicans did not delay it needlessly. We did not try to  originate our own version and burn several more days trying to fit them  together. Instead, we treated that bill with the bipartisanship and  urgency this crisis requires. Since then, the situation has only grown  more dire, so I hope that our Senate Democratic colleagues and the  Democratic House will bring equal bipartisanship and equal urgency to  this legislation as well.    In closing, I think all of us could take a lesson from our  constituents. As we finish negotiating and finalize this bold  legislation, we should look to the American people. Everywhere you look  these past days, individuals, families, and organizations are stepping  up to the plate and finding creative ways to serve those in need.   One of my fellow Kentuckians is a woman named Erin Hinson. Erin lives  in Louisville. She is someone whom doctors have told to be particularly  careful these past few days, so her opportunities to pitch in were  somewhat limited, but she was determined to do her part. Here is what  she said: ``I may never have the capacity to develop a vaccine or a  magic pill to get rid of COVID-19 . . . but I can master a  spreadsheet!''   Erin created a website--Louisvillecovid19match.com. There is one  signup sheet for neighbors who are older or at heightened risk and  another signup sheet for neighbors who are young and healthy. And Erin  is performing a kind of matchmaking service. If someone needs a  prescription pickup or some groceries delivered or even a friendly  phone call, she helps make the connection.   With a little help from local media, Erin is already tracking more  than 400 volunteers--400 volunteers--from every Louisville ZIP Code. It  is the perfect manifestation of Kentucky's State motto: ``United we  stand, divided we fall.'' United we stand--even if we have to stand 6  feet apart for a few weeks--and divided we fall. Brave and generous and  creative Americans all across our Nation get it. They just need  Congress to get it too.   I am impressed and heartened by the speed and bipartisan spirit that  has characterized the past day's discussions, but we need to keep it  up. We absolutely cannot let up now. We need to finish these  negotiations and move forward.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
