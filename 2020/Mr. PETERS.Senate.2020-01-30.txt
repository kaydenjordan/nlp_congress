 Chief Justice, on behalf of myself and Senator Cornyn, I  send a question to the desk for both House managers and the President's  counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Peters and Cornyn for both parties reads:         How would the verdict in this trial alter the balance of       power between the executive and legislative branches in the       future?    The President's counsel goes first.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. A verdict--a final judgment--of acquittal  would be the best thing for our country and would send a great message  that will actually help in our separation of powers. Here is why.   As I have said repeatedly--and according to the standard articulated  so well during the Clinton impeachment--what are we dealing with here?  We are dealing with a purely partisan impeachment with bipartisan  opposition, no crime, and no violation of law in an election year. It  has never happened before--no investigation, no due process, nothing.   What they are telling you--I mean, we can talk all we want, and we  will, but what are we talking about at the end of the day? We are  talking about removing the President of the United States from the  ballot in an election that is occurring in months. Who thinks that is a  good idea, particularly when you are dealing with a purely partisan  impeachment that was warned about from the Framers?   The only appropriate result that will not damage our country  horribly--maybe forever but certainly for generations--is a verdict of  acquittal.   Here is the other point. In getting back to the question of  witnesses, Mr. Schiff is up here: Let's make a deal. How about we have  the Chief Justice--and we have the greatest respect for the Chief  Justice. Here is the problem. We are talking about critical  constitutional rights that have been protected by the Supreme Court  over our history. So what is he really saying? Think about these  questions.   The Senate can decide about executive privilege by a vote--by a  majority vote. With the greatest respect--with the greatest respect--if  the Senate can just decide there is no executive privilege, guess what?  You are destroying executive privilege. Can the Senate decide the  House's speech or debate protection? I mean, when we ask for documents  from Mr. Schiff and his staff and he says ``speech or debate,'' are you  going to decide that? Is that how we are going to do this? Are we going  to flip a coin? Is that going to be your next suggestion?   We are talking about an election of the President. There are critical  constitutional issues that will alter our balance of power for  generations if we go down that road.    Down this road is the path provided by the Democrats so wisely during  the Clinton administration.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, it may be different in the  court than it is in this Chamber and in the House, but when anybody  begins a sentence with the phrase ``I have the greatest respect for,''  you have to look out for what follows.   We trust the Justice will make the right decision. The Justice has, I  think, conducted these proceedings in an eminently fair way.   There is nothing in the Constitution that would preclude us from  taking a week to hear from witnesses and allowing the Chief Justice to  make those calls.   I would say also, with respect to an argument counsel made about the  Porteous impeachment trial, where, yes, the Senate designated 12  Senators to hear the witness testimony, the implication is, you can't  do that in an impeachment of the President. That is only half correct.  The other half is, you can do depositions in which only a couple of  Members of the body need participate. So it is a false argument to say  or to suggest that the whole body would need to conduct the whole of  the depositions. So much as we would like live testimony, we have  offered a compromise.   With respect to the question about what this will do to the balance  of power, I would say this: As I mentioned earlier, our relationship  with Ukraine will survive this debacle. But if we hold that a President  can defy all subpoenas, can tie up the Congress endlessly with bad- faith claims of privilege--claiming here one thing and claiming in  court something else--it will eviscerate our oversight power. If the  President is allowed to decide which subpoenas they will deign to  consider valid and which they will deign to consider invalid, your  oversight power and our oversight power is gone. That is an irrevocable  change to the balance of power.   What is more, if we adopt their theory of the case that a President  can abuse his power and do so by holding another country hostage by  withholding congressionally appropriated funds and can violate the law  in doing so as long as they think it is in their interest, imagine what  that will do to the balance of power. Article II will really mean what  the President says it means, which is he can do whatever he wants.   So, yes, the stakes are big here. Article II goes to whether our  oversight power--particularly in a case of investigating the  President's own wrongdoing--continues to have any weight or whether the  impeachment power itself is now a nullity.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Florida.
