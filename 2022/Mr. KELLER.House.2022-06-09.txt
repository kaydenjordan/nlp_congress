 Madam Speaker, a survey by The Wall Street Journal found  that 83 percent of Americans describe the state of the economy as poor  or not so good. President Biden's approval ratings are in free fall,  and the American people are correct in holding him accountable for  skyrocketing prices.   Since entering office, President Biden's policies of Big Government  spending and attacks on American energy have weakened America's economy  and placed enormous burdens on working families.   My Republican colleagues and I have called on President Biden to  reverse course. The President should take immediate steps to unleash  American energy, stop the out-of-control spending, and focus on the  real issues that are hitting Americans in their pocketbooks.   President Biden is completely out of touch. What is worse, our  children and grandchildren will be responsible for paying for his mess.  President Biden must stop blaming others for his failures and start  embracing the solutions that are in the best interests of the American  people.                            ____________________
