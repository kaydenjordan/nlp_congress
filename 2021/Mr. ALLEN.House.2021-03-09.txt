 Mr. Speaker, my Democrat colleagues have, apparently,  decided committee work doesn't matter for the 117th Congress because  they, once again, brought legislation to the House floor without first  holding a single committee hearing or markup.                                time  1245    As the Republican leader of the Health, Employment, Labor, and  Pensions Subcommittee, I would have welcomed the opportunity to debate  and amend this flawed legislation in committee.   H.R. 842, also known as the PRO Act, is a radical proposal aimed at  appeasing big union bosses who fund the far left's political agenda.  From 2010 to 2018, unions sent more than $1.6 billion in member dues to  hundreds of left-wing groups like Planned Parenthood, the Clinton  Foundation, and the Progressive Democrats of America, instead of  spending that money on worker representation.   That is right. Union leaders are lining their pockets and their  friends' pockets with the dues workers are forced to pay. No worker  should be forced to participate in union activity or pay for  representation they do not agree with. That is un-American. But the  pro-union bosses act would overturn right-to-work laws in 27 States,  including my home State of Georgia.   That would be devastating for Georgia's post-COVID economy. That is  why I will offer an amendment protecting the right-to-work laws. In  fact, I introduced a total of five amendments to this bill that would  put workers first; but, unfortunately, Democrats only allowed one to be  considered on the House floor for debate even though last Congress they  allowed more than one to be voted on this House floor.   But the American people deserve to know the other amendments that the  Democrats blocked.   First is protecting employees' right to secret-ballot elections. An  amendment requiring all unions to win a secret-ballot election in order  to be certified because no worker should face retribution because of  how they cast their ballot.   Codifying a sensible joint-employer standard. An amendment that  strikes  [[Page H1139]]  the section of the bill which defines joint employment using the  indirect control and replaces this provision with the direct and  immediate control to protect franchisees and treat them as any other  small business owner.   Employee privacy protection. An amendment requiring employers to  receive express consent from employees before sharing their personal  information with a union because the bill currently does not require  that consent.   And worker retirement protection. This amends the bill to state that  mandatory arbitration agreements cannot force the members of a  bargaining unit into a multiemployer pension plan.   All of my amendments would bring much-needed accountability and  transparency, and I am disappointed a majority of them were not even  allowed to be offered on the House floor. Furthermore, the PRO Act  would further disrupt our economy, which is in desperate need of full  reopening.   Mr. Speaker, today, I stand with small business owners and our  workforce, and I oppose this bill.    Madam Speaker, I stand here today disappointed but not  surprised that my Democratic colleagues and their union boss allies  want my home State of Georgia to look just like New York and  California.   This is made abundantly clear in the PRO Act where the bill outright  bans State right-to-work laws.   I can tell my colleagues one thing: Not on my watch.   Georgia has been a proud right-to-work State since 1947, and it is  one of the many reasons workers have prospered. That is why I rise  today to offer my straightforward amendment that strikes the ban on  right-to-work States.   No American should be forced to pay for representation and political  activities that they do not agree with, and that is what will happen if  we do not adopt my amendment.   It is a no-brainer: workers should be in control of their earnings  and how they spend it. Americans want choice.   I urge my colleagues to support worker choice and vote ``yes'' on my  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back in the classroom.
