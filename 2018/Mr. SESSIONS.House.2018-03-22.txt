 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 796 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 796         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       1625) to amend the State Department Basic Authorities Act of       1956 to include severe forms of trafficking in persons within       the definition of transnational organized crime for purposes       of the rewards program of the Department of State, and for       other purposes, with the Senate amendment thereto, and to       consider in the House, without intervention of any point of       order, a motion offered by the chair of the Committee on       Appropriations or his designee that the House concur in the       Senate amendment with an amendment consisting of the text of       Rules Committee Print 115-66. The Senate amendment and the       motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be       debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening       motion.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from       March 23, 2018, through April 9, 2018 --         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.        Sec. 4.  Each day during the period addressed by section 2       of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar day for       purposes of section 7 of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C.       1546).        Sec. 5.  Each day during the period addressed by section 2       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XIII.        Sec. 6.  The chair of the Committee on Appropriations may       insert in the Congressional Record not later than March 23,       2018, such material as he may deem explanatory of the Senate       amendment and the motion specified in the first section of       this resolution.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, last night, at a late hour, the Rules  Committee met, where we had expert testimony that was offered on behalf  of the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations,  the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentlewoman from New York.   I would like to, if I could, express to my friend, Mr. McGovern, the  professional nature not only that he but Judge Hastings, another member  of the committee, represented the Democratic side at a time that is  very difficult for them with the passing and loss of a tremendous  leader in the House of Representatives, the gentlewoman from New York,  Chairwoman Louise Slaughter.   Mr. McGovern and Mr. Hastings not only conducted themselves, in my  opinion, in a professional straightforward manner, but represented  their party quite well in a time of distress and a time of need. I want  to express my complete confidence not only in Mr. McGovern, but also  thank Judge Hastings for his professional demeanor last night as we  worked through very, very difficult issues till late in the night, till  early in the morning. And compliments also to the gentlemen, the  chairman of the committee and the ranking member for their professional  conversations that were had that were in the best interest not only of  the House of Representatives but the American people. I want to thank  Mr. McGovern publicly at this time for his professional cause and  substance.   Mr. Speaker, today we rise in support of this rule and, of course,  the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of the  Senate amendment to H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of  2018.   Mr. Speaker, this is funding the government for the rest of the year,  through September 30. This is an important measure. This is an  important measure not only for the American people, but it is important  for Members of Congress.   There are a lot of ways that we could stand and say what we are for  or what we are against, but the bottom line is that this is a piece of  legislation that has been worked on, on a bipartisan basis, Republicans  and Democrats, give and take, and has been worked on the other side of  the Capitol with the United States Senate.   It is in no way a perfect bill. That, I think, I learned a long time  ago, is hard to get through to be signed by the President. But with  that said, it yielded amazing results in a process that needed to come  to a conclusion.   This 12-bill appropriations package provides funding for fiscal year  2018 at levels consistent with the bipartisan budget agreement and the  National Defense Authorization Act.   After years of neglect, this body has taken the important step of  reshaping and rebuilding the United States military by providing them  $659.6 billion worth of funding for our national defense. But it is for  more than just national defense. It is also trying to give better  protection to the men and women who protect us, the men and women who,  today, are in cold, lonely, hot, dangerous places around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, a much-needed $65 billion increase over 2017 fiscal year  spending was essential. Mr. Speaker, the numbers speak for themselves.  More members of our armed services gave their life in defense of this  country in training exercises than they did in combat last year. This  is a hardy reminder for Members of Congress and the American people to  understand that our men and women not only fight hard, but they train  hard. And in that defense, we need to do a better job to make sure that  the equipment, the training, and the needs that they have are top  flight year-round not just in combat areas, but in training missions  where they are preparing to protect this country. Mr. Speaker, we have  come a long way to that, and I am proud of the work that we have done.   The agreement ends, I think, the irresponsible practice of pairing  dollar-for-dollar increases in defense spending with nondefense. This  is a hard fight. This is a hard fight not only Republican-Democrat, but  across this country. We have tried to make some balanced decisions. We  have tried to err on the side of using money for the best interest of  research and development and to move this country forward.   The bill strengthens missile defense. It strengthens and funds new  weapons systems for the military. And it heavily increases designated  counterthreats around the globe. As you know, Mr. Speaker, we are  facing down one of the greatest threats to the world right now, North  Korea. Now is not a time to  [[Page H1760]]  shy away. Mr. Speaker, we will not shy away. These colors don't run.   It funds additional national security priorities, including nuclear  modernization, new nuclear submarines, and other important shipbuilding  and aircraft procurement for our United States military. Quite  honestly, Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger) and her  counterpart from the appropriations committee looked at the exercise  that is necessary and came up to streamline and make sure that the  money that would be given would be necessary and only in defense of  this Nation.   This legislation also includes a long overdue 2.4 percent pay  increase for our troops. The men and women who care for our veterans  know that they need the help, and their service to this country will  not be without a thank-you, thus providing a record level of VA  funding, while increasing oversight to make sure that the benefits and  treatment of our veterans is properly taken care of.    The new Secretary Shulkin of the VA is very concerned about the duty  that they have to our veterans, and he has assured us this amount of  funding will allow he and the Department that opportunity to fix,  correct, and, long term, know that the long-term safety for our  veterans and their facilities will be accomplished.   It provides robust funding to fight terrorism. It enhances criminal  law enforcement and secures our borders by increasing funding for  border security and the enforcement of immigration law. This  legislation also includes new infrastructure funding for highways,  waterways, airways, railways, and other infrastructure priorities to  ensure public safety is taken care of and to promote economic growth.   Mr. Speaker, it provides $4 billion, the largest investment to date,  to combat the opioid crisis. We have spent a great deal of time not  only working on this Member to Member, but also State organizations  working with their members; Federal law enforcement; and the National  Institutes of Health, through the direction of Dr. Shiva Singh, their  chief medical officer who spent a great deal of time working with  Members of Congress, opioid task forces, substance abuse task forces,  and perhaps, most of all, the problems that we have that face this  great Nation, where we have addiction problems. These are addressed  within this spending bill.   Increase in funding by $3 billion, certainly the head of the NIH, Dr.  Francis Collins, believes that this investment in the National  Institutes of Health, including the National Eye Institute and other  important parts of NIH, will receive the funding that is necessary to  ensure that the men and women of this country who suffer long-term  effects of aging and other medical problems, that we can address them  and live up to our responsibility.   I thank Dr. Francis Collins and Dr. Shiva Singh for their instruction  to our important Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman  Tom Cole for his  great work at the NIH--$2.3 billion in new funding for mental health  training and school safety efforts help our children to make sure that  our schools are safe.   This is a brief rundown, Mr. Speaker, of the kind of work not only  that we have dug in and done on a bipartisan basis, but the kind of  work that I believe the American people want, need, and expect.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Massachusetts, I not only accept  his advice about process and procedure, but I certainly would join in  with him to thank our appropriators, the men and women who, on a  bipartisan basis, Mr. Speaker, took time to wander to the other side of  the Capitol to engage their colleagues.   I can tell the gentleman, and he knows this probably on a firsthand  basis, much was discussed. This was a big process. This was at the end  of the year that I do agree with that should have taken place on  October 1, not on March 22, that we decided where we are headed.   But the discussion, the decisionmaking, the ability for both sides,  both parties, to deal on the same issues has gotten tougher and  tougher.   I support our Speaker and what he is attempting to do. He has opened  up the process. He has tried to make it to where the discussions take  place on a bipartisan basis. And the Speaker, I believe, has tried to  place before us, as Members of Congress, the opportunity to be heard,  to represent our thoughts and ideas.   I didn't win some of the issues that I was for. I held some ideas out  about a number of issues that we had been working on that were  contained in the bills that came out of the House only to come back  months later from the Senate in a different priority, in a different  way, and perhaps not exactly what I would have wanted.   It would be easy for me to say, however, that the greater good of  what we are attempting to accomplish is why we are here. Ultimately, we  have a duty, Mr. Speaker, we have a duty and a responsibility, to  ensure that which we finalize is in the best interest of the American  people. The overriding concern here is to make sure that the efforts of  government, albeit that we as Americans, I don't think, want to get all  that we pay for from government, we still recognize that there are  people in our midst that need a government--and I do, too--a government  that works well and is funded properly.   Mr. Speaker, last night we had an opportunity to hear from a number  of my colleagues on the Republican side, a number of Members of  Congress who spent hours waiting their time before the Rules Committee,  not an unusual intuitive process from a number of our Members who had  questions, comments, and concerns.   I promised to address one of them. The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Massie) brought forth what was a discussion about what is known as the  NICS fix, or, as we refer to it, fixing NICS, a NICS fix.   Well, this is the database that is responsible for holding names and  giving approvals for those people who purchase weapons across the  United States. I agreed to provide some bit of an answer today and I  hope some clarity on the issue that relates back to December of 2017.    I told the gentleman last night that I believed that, while his  arguments were important and I supported exactly the underlying ideas,  and that is that we do not believe that agencies by themselves should  have the ability to deny an American citizen the right, the  constitutional right, for them to properly, legally own a weapon, as we  do know and remember back during a previous administration, at least  two agencies, the Social Security Administration and the Veterans  Administration, developed procedures by which they believed were  appropriate, but that I think have proven incorrect, to deny people a  weapon based upon a criteria that they established.   This fix NICS provision was corrected and is still in law, and, to  the best of my ability in double-checking, I would now like to notify  the gentleman from Kentucky that I believe it is properly done.   I would not be a part of making a change in the law, as I told him,  that would deny an American citizen under these two agencies without  lawful consideration of a hearing and with due process, and based upon  the law and constitutional requirements of our Constitution to deny  someone their right to keep and bear arms.   Mr. Speaker, please consider that I appreciate the gentleman who  showed up last night until late, late in the morning, and that he was  doing his duty, which I respect and admire, and I am trying to respond  back to him.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't want to digress too much, but the gentleman from  Massachusetts referred to a process that just was embarrassing and did  not work. I recall, last night, testimony from the ranking member, the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey): ``This is one of the best  processes that I can recall. We have products that we can be proud of.  We worked together.''   Mr. Speaker, it is hard doing business in this town. It is hard doing  business because we have disagreements. But let us not also  misunderstand that it was President Trump who challenged Congress when  our previous administration simply went about writing their own rules  and regulations that made the circumstances on our border not only more  dangerous, but very costly for every single American by encouraging  tens of thousands of people to travel through Central America to come  to the United States, and for us to take them into the United States  with illegality that has been ruled on by Federal courts in this  country.   A legal and lawful process is what President Trump is attempting to  have this Congress do. He understands that power under Article I and  the power under Article II. I believe that President Trump personally  invoked hours of his time to make sure that he properly worked with  Congress--key people from the House, key people from the Senate-- televised day after day to get  [[Page H1763]]  closer on the issue that he felt could gain resolution. It is a hard  issue. But to suggest in any way that President Trump is a culprit of  anything except leading to the best I believe would be an unfair  statement against his intended desire to resolve the issue.    Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee, under the strong  leadership of the gentleman from Georgia,  Rob Woodall, and the strong  leadership of Tom Cole, provided evidence-based information not just to  sustain the document that we are here for, but actually to continue the  explanation of what we are doing and why, including the balances of  budgeting and those necessary items but also the content.   Our vice chairman of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from  Oklahoma, Tom Cole, doubles in his duty to Congress, and he serves as  the lead appropriator, the chairman of the subcommittee that is  responsible for health, NIH, and research and development. Mr. Cole's  professional attributes really shined last night as he, with great  pride, discussed major, hard issues facing this Nation, facing the  United States, and facing the medical community in this country. I was  very proud of not only his content with the substance, but also with  the delivery of the product.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) to discuss this seemingly impossible work that he  made possible.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Oklahoma an  additional 2 minutes.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire of the time  remaining on both sides.    Mr. Speaker, I have one additional speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall), the Rules Committee designee to the Budget  Committee, a gentleman who has served this Nation well and will  continue to serve the Budget Committee well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank not only the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern) but also thanks to the minority whip for coming and engaging  in this issue.   Mr. Speaker, let us not forget that this last summer, last summer, we  engaged in all 12 spending bills on the floor of the House of  Representatives. The Appropriations Committee received over 700  thoughts, ideas, so to speak, amendments for them to consider. It was  an open process. Mr. Speaker, on the floor, 232 amendments were a part  of the process of the 12 bills.   Last night, Nita Lowey, the ranking member, sat before the Rules  Committee at about midnight and said: It is late, but the process  worked. The process worked for Democrats. The process worked for  appropriators to work on a bipartisan basis, and the process worked in  the United States Senate.   Mr. Speaker, two members of the Appropriations staff, Shannon O'Keefe  and Nancy Fox, are sterling members of the professional staff of the  House of Representatives who did one heck of a job to make sure our  Rules Committee--staff and Members--got the information we needed.   I agree the process should be better. I urge my colleagues to support  this rule and the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, when the Committee on Rules filed its  report (H. Rept. 115-614) to accompany House Resolution 796 the  Committee was unaware that the waiver of all points of order against  consideration of the motion to concur in the Senate Amendment to H.R.  1625 included:   A waiver of section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act, which  prohibits consideration of legislation providing new budget authority  in excess of a 302(a) allocation of such authority.   A waiver of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, which  prohibits consideration of legislation that would cause the level of  total new budget authority for the first fiscal year to be exceeded, or  would cause revenues to be less than the level of total revenues for  the first fiscal year or for the total of that first fiscal year and  the ensuing fiscal years for which allocations are provided.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 796 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order  [[Page H1766]]       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What it Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
