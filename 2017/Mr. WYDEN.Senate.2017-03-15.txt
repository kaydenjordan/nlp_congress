 Mr. President, I know both sides are working on trying to  get an arrangement for the vote.   Mr. President, I also want to tell my colleague from Texas that I  listened very carefully to his remarks with respect to transparency in  government. He has had a long interest in the Freedom of Information  Act and the like. I noted that he made a comment about the Bay of Pigs,  about which information is still classified, and I know something about  this because my dad wrote a book about the subject. My hope is that my  friend from Texas and his interest in transparency will also extend to  some other areas.   As I indicated, I am very familiar with my colleague's record with  respect to Freedom of Information Act issues, which really is  impressive. I  [[Page S1814]]  hope to get him involved in some other areas of transparency--perhaps  in campaign finance reform and the issue I am going to be speaking  about today, that of getting the American people the information--after  6 years of stonewalling--on how many lawful Americans are getting swept  up in what will be Dan Coats' top priority, that of the reauthorization  of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.   I want my colleague to know, in my being very much aware of his good  work on the Freedom of Information Act issues, that we are going to try  and conscript them into some other transparency issues as well.    Mr. President, of course.   I will tell my colleague, as to what the majority and the minority  have agreed to, as soon as those consent requests are ready, then we  will take a time out from my remarks and make sure that matter is  resolved.   As we wait for the matter Senator Cornyn has mentioned, I will begin  the discussion of the nomination of Dan Coats to be the Director of  National Intelligence.   I have known Senator Coats for many years. He has been the lead  cosponsor of the bipartisan Federal income tax reform proposal, which  has been a special priority of mine. I do not know of a single U.S.  Senator who does not like Senator Coats. He is honest, a straight  shooter, and gracious. My remarks are not about my personal affection  for Senator Coats.   The reason I am voting against the nomination is due to the matter I  just touched upon with the Senator from Texas, which is, for 6 years,  it has been impossible to get the intelligence community to provide the  Congress and the American people information that is absolutely  critical to the debate on reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act. For 6 long years, Democrats and Republicans, both in  this body and in the other body, have been trying to get this  information.    So this morning, given the fact that this legislation would be the  top priority of Senator Coats, as he said in the Intelligence  Committee, I want the Senate and the country to understand why this  issue is so important.   First, I am happy to yield to my friend from Texas.    I thank my colleague.   Now, as we consider the nomination of Senator Coats, and recognize  that his top priority, by his admission, would be the reauthorization  of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--particularly section  702--I want to begin this discussion by saying that it is because the  intelligence community has stonewalled Democrats and Republicans in  both this body and in the other body for 6 years on the information  that we need to do good oversight that I have come to the floor to  outline what I think the central issue is all about.   I am going to begin my remarks by way of saying that, at a time when  Americans are demanding policies that give them more security and more  liberty, increasingly, we are seeing policies come from both this body  and the other body that provide less of both.   A good example would be weakening strong encryption. Weakening strong  encryption is bad from a security standpoint, and it is bad from a  liberty standpoint. When government creates policies that give the  American people less of both--less security and less liberty-- obviously, the American people are not going to react well.   My view is that when the government--particularly intelligence  agencies--don't level with the American people about large-scale  surveillance of law-abiding Americans, our people are justifiably  angry. When the government tries to keep this information secret--as I  have pointed out on this floor before--in America, the truth always  comes out. Leveling with the American people is the only way for  agencies to have the credibility and the legitimacy to effectively do  their jobs. They have critically important jobs in keeping our people  safe from threats.   Now, with respect to Senator Coats, at his confirmation hearing,  since he said the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act would be his  top priority, I asked our former colleague how many Americans-- innocent, law-abiding Americans--have actually been swept up in the  surveillance program known as section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act. Under section 702, the government conducts  warrantless surveillance of foreigners who are reasonably believed to  be overseas. It does this work by compelling telecommunications  companies and internet service providers to provide the content, phone  calls, and emails, and other individual communications.   Now, there are several different ways this happens, and I will get to  that in the course of these remarks. What we are talking about--what I  want people to understand--is that this goes to the content of  communications. This is not about metadata collection. Congress, as the  Senate knows, reformed that in the USA FREEDOM Act. This is  surveillance without any warrants, and once the FISA Court signs off on  the overall program, the details are up to the government.   Now, this was not always the case. For decades, individual warrants  were required when the government needed the assistance of the  country's telecommunications firms. Then the Bush administration  created a secret, but legal, warrantless wiretapping program.   After the program was revealed, the government then went to the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court to get approval. But when  the government ran into some trouble with the court, the Bush  administration argued that the Congress should create the current  program. It was first passed in 2007 under the name Protect America  Act. That became the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments  Act of 2008.   Now, fortunately, the Congress included a sunset provision, which is  why it was up for reauthorization in 2012, and that is why it is up for  reauthorization this year. This year it is Senator Coats' top priority,  if confirmed. Whoever is the head of the intelligence community will be  the point person for this legislation.   I want it understood that the reason that I am going through this  background is that I believe the American people deserve a fully  informed debate about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  reauthorization. You cannot have that debate--you cannot ensure that  the American people have security and liberty--unless you know the  impact of section 702 of that bill on the constitutional rights of law- abiding Americans.  [[Page S1815]]    So for 6 years, in this body, Democrats and Republicans--and in the  other body, Democrats and Republicans--have been asking the same  question: How many law-abiding Americans are having their  communications swept up in all of this collection? Without even an  estimate of this number, I don't think it is possible to judge what  section 702 means for the core liberties of law-abiding Americans.  Without this information, the Congress can't make an informed decision  about whether to reauthorize section 702 or what kind of reforms might  be necessary to ensure the protection of the individual liberties of  innocent Americans.   At Senator Coats' nomination hearing before the Senate Intelligence  Committee, I asked Senator Coats whether he would commit to providing  Congress and the public with this information. I will say, because of  my respect for Senator Coats and our longtime cooperation on issues  like tax reform and a variety of others, I hoped that Senator Coats  would be the one--after 6 years of struggling to get this information-- to make a commitment to deliver it to the Senate Intelligence Committee  before work on the reauthorization began. Instead, Senator Coats said:  ``I will do everything I can to work with Admiral Rogers at the NSA to  get you that number.''   If confirmed, I hope that happens. But after asking for the number of  law-abiding Americans who get swept up in these searches for years, and  getting stonewalled by the executive branch, hoping to get the  information we need to do real oversight is just not good enough.   The problem--the lack of information on the impact of this law on the  privacy of Americans--goes all the way back to the origins of the  authority. In December of 2007, the Bush administration, in its  statement of administration policy on the FISA Amendments Act, stated  that it would likely be impossible to count the number of people  located in the United States as communications were reviewed by the  government. In April of 2011, our former colleague Senator Mark Udall  and I then asked the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper,  for an estimate. In July of that year, the Director wrote back and  said: ``It is not reasonably possible to identify the number of people  located in the United States whose communications may have been  reviewed under the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act.''   He suggested reviewing the classified number of disseminated  intelligence reports containing a reference to a U.S. person, but that  is very different than the number of Americans whose communications  have been collected in the first place. And that is what this is all  about: How many law-abiding Americans--innocent, law-abiding  Americans--are getting swept up in these searches? It will be an  increasingly important issue as the nature of telecommunications  companies continues to change, because it is now a field that is  globally interconnected. We don't have telecommunications systems just  stopping at national borders. So getting the number of Americans whose  communications have been collected in the first place is the  prerequisite to doing real oversight on this law and doing our job, at  a time when it is being reauthorized and the American people want both  security and liberty and understand that the two are not mutually  exclusive.   So Director Clapper then suggested reviewing the classified number of  targets that were later determined to be located in the United States.  But the question has never been about the targets of 702, although the  mistaken targeting of Americans and the people in our country is  another serious question. The question that Democrats and Republicans  have been asking is about how many Americans are being swept up by a  program that, according to the law, is supposed to only target  foreigners overseas.   So let me repeat that. That is what the law says. The Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act says that the targets are supposed to be  foreigners overseas, and Democrats and Republicans want to know how  many law-abiding Americans, who might reside in Alaska or Oregon or  anywhere else, are getting swept up in these searches.   (Mr. SULLIVAN assumed the Chair.)   So this bipartisan coalition has kept asking. In July of 2012,  anticipating the first reauthorization of section 702 of the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, I and 11 other Senators from both  parties wrote to Director Clapper. This bipartisan group wrote:         We understand that it might not be possible for the       intelligence community to calculate this number with       precision, but it is difficult for us to accept the assertion       that it is not possible to come up with even a rough estimate       of this number. If generating a precise estimate would       require an inordinate amount of labor, we would be willing to       accept an imprecise one.    We asked about imprecise estimates, just a ballpark: How many law- abiding Americans are getting swept up in these searches that the law  says are designed to target foreigners?   We asked about orders of magnitude: Is the number closer to a hundred  or a hundred thousand or a hundred million?   We still got no answer, and section 702 was reauthorized without this  necessary information. So last year, looking at the prospect of the law  coming up, there was a renewed effort to find out how many law-abiding  Americans are getting swept up in these searches of foreigners.   In April 2016, a bipartisan letter from members of the House  Judiciary Committee asked the Director of National Intelligence for a  public estimate of the number of communications or transactions  involving U.S. persons collected under section 702 on an annual basis.  This letter, coming from the House--Democrats and Republicans--again  asked for a rough estimate. This bipartisan group suggested working  with Director Clapper to determine the methodology to get this  estimate. In December, there were hints in the news media that  something might be forthcoming. But now, here we are, with a new  administration, considering the nomination of the next head of the  intelligence community, who has said that reauthorizing section 702 is  his top legislative priority, and there is no answer in sight to the  question Democrats and Republicans have been asking for over 6 years:  How many innocent, law-abiding Americans are getting swept up in these  searches under a law that targets foreigners overseas?   Having described this history, I want to explain why this issue is so  important, starting with the many ways in which innocent Americans can  be swept up in section 702 surveillance.   The first are targeting mistakes in which, contrary to the law, the  target turns out to be an American or someone in the United States. The  full impact of these mistakes on law-abiding Americans is not readily  apparent. The most recent public report on section 702 noted that there  were compliance incidents involving surveillance of foreigners in the  United States and surveillance of Americans. This is in violation of  the law, and it happens.   The second way in which Americans can be swept up in section 702  collection is when they communicate with an overseas target. This is  usually called incidental collection and is often mischaracterized. I  have heard many times that the program is intended to find out when  Americans are communicating with ``bad guys''--and I want it  understood, I am not interested in some kind of ``bad guys caucus.'' I  know of no Senator who is not interested in protecting our country from  those kinds of threats. If a known terrorist overseas is communicating  with someone in the United States, we ought to know about it. But  section 702 is not just a counterterrorism program. The statute  requires the collection be conducted ``to acquire foreign intelligence  information.'' As implemented, the standard for targeting individuals  under the program is that the government has reason to believe those  persons possess, are expected to receive, or are likely to communicate  foreign intelligence information. Obviously, that is broad. It doesn't  even require that a target be suspected of wrongdoing. So if someone  tells you that your communications will be collected only if you are  talking to al-Qaida or ISIS, that is just factually wrong.   It is also important to note that the government is prohibited from  collecting communications only when the sender of an email and everyone  receiving that email are in the United States. So an American in the  United States could send an email to another American in the United  States, but if  [[Page S1816]]  the email also goes to an overseas target, it is going to be collected.   That then brings us to the different kinds of collection under  section 702 and how they affect the liberties of our people in  different ways. In one form of collection known as PRISM, the  government orders an internet service provider to provide the  government with messages to and from a specific email address. Then  there is something known as upstream collection, which is when the  communications are collected off the telecommunications and internet  backbones. In other words, phone calls and email messages are collected  in transit. This kind of collection raises a number of other reasons to  be concerned about how many law-abiding Americans are getting swept up.  For one, it is through upstream collection that the government can  collect emails that are neither to nor from a target. The email merely  has to be about a target, meaning, for example, it includes a target's  email address in the content. In other words, the government can  collect emails to and from Americans, none of whom are of any interest  to the government whatsoever, so long as the target's email address is  in the content of the email. The law requires only that one of the  parties to the communication, who, again, could be another American, is  overseas, and even that requirement is harder for the government to  meet in practice.   The implications here ought to be pretty obvious. You don't even have  to be communicating with one of the government's targets to be swept up  in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act collection. You don't even  have to be communicating with a foreigner. You or somebody emailing you  just needs to reference a target's email address.   I have now mentioned that this target is not necessarily a terrorist  because the law allows for surveillance ``to acquire foreign  intelligence information.'' That has been interpreted to allow the  targeting of individuals who the government has reason to believe  possess, are expected to receive, or are likely to communicate foreign  intelligence information. It is a broad standard, and the government  could then collect the communications of all kinds of foreigners around  the world. Think about how easy it would be for an American business  leader to be in contact with the broad set of potential targets of this  program. Consider how easy it would be for Americans, communicating  with other Americans, to forward the emails of these people. All of  this could be collected by the government.    The upstream collection also includes the collection of what are  called multicommunications transactions. This is when the NSA collects  an email that is to, from, or about a target, but that email is  embedded among multiple other communications that are not. These  communications may have nothing to do with the target, but the  government just kind of, sort of ends up with them--and some of them  are sent and received entirely within the United States.   These are the ways in which law abiding Americans--innocent, law- abiding Americans who have done absolutely nothing wrong, both overseas  and in the United States--can have their communications collected under  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. These are law-abiding  Americans, innocent Americans, not necessarily suspected of anything,  and it is their privacy and their constitutional rights that have  caused Democrats and Republicans in this body and in the other body to  seek the actual numbers of how many law-abiding Americans are getting  swept up in these searches that are supposed to target foreigners  overseas.   The reason this is important is that the program is getting bigger  and bigger. The exact numbers are classified, but the government's  public reporting confirms steady increases in collection. At some  point, the size of the program and the extent to which Americans'  communications are being collected raises obvious concerns about our  Fourth Amendment. The question is not if the program raises  constitutional concerns, but when. And that gets to the heart of what  our bipartisan coalition has been concerned about: If it is not  possible for the Senate to know as part of reauthorizing this law how  many Americans are being swept up by this program, we cannot determine  whether the government has crossed a constitutional line.   The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, an agency the  Congress has tasked to look at these issues, has raised the very same  concerns I am outlining this morning. In the 2014 report by the Board-- the nonpartisan organization tasked by the Congress--concluded that the  lack of information about the collection of the communications of law- abiding Americans' communications under section 702 ``hampers attempts  to gauge whether the program appropriately balances national security  interests with the privacy of U.S. persons.''   They went on to say:         The program [is] close to the line of constitutional       reasonableness. At the very least, too much expansion in the       collection of U.S. persons' communications or the uses to       which those communications are put may push the program over       the line.    They recommended exactly what our bipartisan coalition has been  calling for--that the government provide to the Congress and, to the  extent consistent with national security, that the public and the  Congress get data on the collection of these communications of law- abiding Americans.   The most frequently heard argument against what our bipartisan group  of House and Senate Members has been calling for is that, whatever  number of communications are being collected on law-abiding Americans,  it is minimized, which implies that information about Americans is  hidden.   This is a particularly important issue. I have heard my colleagues on  the other side say frequently: Well, if law-abiding Americans are  having their communications swept up, we shouldn't get all concerned  about that because this array of Americans' communications is being  minimized. Somehow that means it is not getting out; it is being  hidden. That is not necessarily what happens. To begin with, all that  collection does not stay at the National Security Agency. All the  emails collected through the PRISM component of section 702 go to  several other agencies, including the CIA and the FBI. Then we have  those three agencies, in particular, authorized to conduct searches  through all the data for communications that are to, from, or about  Americans: Look for an American's name, telephone number, email  address, even a key word or phrase. They can do that without any  warrant. There doesn't have to be even a suspicion--even a suspicion-- that an American is engaged in any kind of wrongdoing. The FBI's  authorities are even broader. The FBI can conduct searches for  communications that are to, from, or about an American to seek evidence  of a crime. Unlike the National Security Agency and the Central  Intelligence Agency, the FBI doesn't even report how many searches for  Americans it is conducting. Moreover, neither the FBI nor the CIA  reports on the number of searches for Americans that it conducts using  metadata collected under section 702.    The authority to conduct searches for Americans' communications in  section 702 data is new. Before 2011, the FISA Court prohibited queries  for U.S. persons. I am going to repeat that. Under the Bush  administration and in the first 2 years of the Obama administration, it  was not possible to conduct these backdoor, warrantless searches of  law-abiding Americans. Then the Obama administration sought to change  the rules and obtained authority to conduct them.   In April 2014, the Director of National Intelligence's response to  questions from me and Senator Mark Udall publicly acknowledged these  warrantless searches. By June the House voted overwhelmingly to  prohibit them. That prohibition didn't become law, but I can tell you  that it is sure going to be considered in the context of this  reauthorization. The House voted overwhelmingly to prohibit these  warrantless searches.   So the question really is this: What exactly is the privacy impact of  these warrantless searches for Americans? In 2014, I managed to extract  from the intelligence community some, but not all, necessary  information about how many Americans had been subject of the searches.  That was a step forward, but what the data doesn't tell us is who the  subjects of these searches are. More to the point, it doesn't tell us  how many Americans are potentially the subject of these searches. If  the number  [[Page S1817]]  is small, the potential for abuse, obviously, would be smaller. If the  number is large, the potential for abuse is much greater. Without an  understanding of the size of the pool from which the government can  pull the communications of law-abiding Americans, there is just no way  of knowing how easy it would be for the government to use this law as a  means to read the emails of a political opponent, a business leader, a  journalist, or an activist.   I now want to turn to the ultimate form of abuse, and that is  something called reverse targeting. It is prohibited by law and defined  as collection ``if the purpose of the acquisition is to target a  particular, known person reasonably believed to be in the United  States.'' This prohibition also applies to U.S. persons. The question,  though, is how this is defined and how the public can be assured it is  not happening.   If you look at the language, you can see why there has been  bipartisan concern. The collection is only prohibited if the purpose is  to get the communications of Americans. The question obviously has  risen: What if getting the Americans' communications is only one of the  purposes of collecting on an overseas target? What is actually  acceptable here?   This issue was concerning in 2008, when the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act Amendments Act passed with a prohibition on reverse  targeting. But that was before the country knew about the collection of  emails that are only about a foreign target and that could be to and  from Americans. That was before the Obama administration sought and  obtained authority to conduct warrantless searches for communications  to, from, and about Americans out of section 702 PRISM collection.   That makes an important point to me. This bipartisan coalition--of  which I have been a part--has fought back against executive branch  overreach, whether it is a Democratic administration or a Republican  administration. I cited the fact that President Obama brought back  something with the great potential for abuse and that President Bush  said he wanted no part of. As we look at these issues, it is important  to understand exactly what the scope of the problem is. Each of the  agencies authorized to conduct these warrantless searches--the NSA,  FBI, CIA--are also authorized to identify the overseas targets of  section 702. The agencies that have developed an interest in Americans'  communications, which are actually looking for these communications,  are the same agencies that are in a position to encourage ongoing  collection of those communications by targeting the overseas party.   I believe our bipartisan group believes that there is very  substantial potential for abuse. Because of these decisions taking  place in the executive branch without any judicial oversight, it is  possible that no one would ever know.   To quote the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board: ``Since the  enactment of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, the extent to which the  government acquires the communications of U.S. persons under Section  702 has been one of the biggest open questions about the program, and a  continuing source of public concern.'' The Board noted that the  executive branch has responded with any number of excuses for why it  couldn't provide the number of how many innocent law-abiding Americans  get swept up in these searches. One excuse has been the size of the  program. But as Members--Democrats and Republicans--have said  repeatedly, an estimate, perhaps based on a sample, is sufficient.  Nobody is dictating how this be done.   Another excuse has been that determining whether individuals whose  communications have been collected are American would itself be  invasive of privacy. Now this is something of a head-scratcher. I will  just say that, as to the value of knowing how many law-abiding  Americans get swept up in these searches, privacy advocates have stated  that this far-fetched theory, this far-fetched excuse for not  furnishing it, doesn't add up in terms of the benefit of finding how  many Americans are swept up in these warrantless searches.   The government is genuinely concerned about the privacy implications  of calculating the number. I and many of my colleagues, both Democrats  and Republicans, have been willing--and we renewed this in the last few  weeks--to have a discussion about the methodology under consideration.    In the months ahead, the Senate is going to be debating a number of  issues relating to this topic, such as U.S. person searches, reverse  targeting, and the collection of communications that are just about a  target. The Senate is going to discuss how to strengthen oversight by  the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the Congress, and the  privacy board. The Director of National Intelligence will be right in  the center of the debate.   There is more information that the American people need. There is  more information that this body needs in order to carry out its  responsibility to do real oversight here. The center of these  discussions about the reauthorization of the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act involves one question: How many innocent, law-abiding  Americans have been swept up in this program that has been written and  developed to target foreigners overseas? Congress's judgment about the  impact of section 702 depends on getting this number. An assessment of  the program's constitutionality rests on the understanding of the  impact it has on Americans. A full grasp of the implications of the  warrantless searches of Americans requires knowing how many Americans'  communications are being searched through. Countless questions related  to the reauthorization of the program all require that the public have  this information.   I am just going to close by way of saying what those questions are  because if you want to do real oversight over a critically important  program, you have to have the information to respond to these  questions. The questions are these: Should there be safeguards against  reverse targeting? Should Congress legislate on ``upstream''  collections and the collection of communications about targets, which  raises unique concerns about the collection of the communications of  law-abiding Americans? Are the rules related to the dissemination, use,  and retention of these communications adequate? Should there be limits  on the use of these communications by the FBI for non-intelligence  purposes?   Just think about that one for a minute. What does it mean to people  in our part of the world where people feel that liberty and security  are not mutually exclusive, but they are going to insist on both? What  does it mean to them on the question of whether there ought to be  limits on the use of this information by the FBI for non-intelligence  purposes? That is exactly the kind of question that people are going to  ask.   I am heading home today for townhall meetings in rural areas, and  those are exactly the kind of questions that Oregonians ask. People  understand this is a dangerous time. That is not at issue.   I serve on the Intelligence Committee, along with Senator Feinstein,  and I have been one of the longer serving members. The fact that this  is a dangerous world is not a debatable proposition. There are a lot of  people out there who do not wish our country well. But what I say to  Oregonians and what I will say again this weekend is this: Any  politician who tells you that you have to give up your liberty to have  security is not somebody who is working in your interest because smart  policies give you both.   That is why I started talking about the benefits of strong  encryption--critically important for security. These questions are ones  that I don't think are particularly partisan. That is why a big group  of Democrats and Republicans here and in the other body have been  seeking the information about how many law-abiding Americans get caught  up in these efforts to target a foreigner overseas. We are now at a  critical moment. A government surveillance program, with very obvious  implications for privacy and constitutional rights, is up for  reauthorization by the end of the year. While more information may be  part of the answer, we have to have the best possible estimate to  answer those questions that I just outlined.   The American people want Congress to get to the bottom of questions  that go right to the heart of our having  [[Page S1818]]  policies that promote both their security and their liberty. I think  the public expects a full debate. You can't have a full and real debate  over the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act unless you have some  sense of how many law-abiding Americans are getting swept up in these  searches of foreigners.   I believe the American people expect serious oversight over it. They  want assurances that their representatives in Congress have a sense of  what is actually being voted on. After years of secret surveillance  programs being revealed only in the news media, I think the public has  rightly insisted on more openness and more transparency.   So getting the information that I have described today, which will  deal with Senator Coats' top priority of reauthorizing the Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, is a critical first step. Once the  Senate knows the impact of this program on Americans, then you can have  a full and real discussion--a real debate in Congress--with the public  and with the Director of National Intelligence.   I took the view in the committee, despite very much liking Dan Coats  and his being the bipartisan cosponsor of what is still the only  Federal income tax reform proposal we have had in the Senate since the  1986 law was authored, I said that I cannot support any nominee to be  the head of national intelligence if that nominee will not guarantee  that before this reauthorization is brought before the Senate and  brought before the Intelligence Committee, that we have the information  needed to do our job, to do real oversight, to show the American people  it is possible to come up with policies that promote security and  liberty. For that reason, despite my friendship with Senator Coats, I  cannot support the nomination.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
