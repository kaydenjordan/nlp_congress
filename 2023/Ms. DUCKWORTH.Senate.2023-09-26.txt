 Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the  importance of the Rehabilitation Act and to recognize the law's  significance as we celebrate its 50th birthday today.   The Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against people with  disabilities in programs that receive Federal funding. It helped lay  the foundation for the Americans with Disabilities Act, which wasn't  signed into law until almost two decades later. But aside from that,  the anniversary of the Rehabilitation Act also serves as a reminder  that we are where we are now because of the sheer willpower of  disability activists from across the country--activists like my late  friend Judy Heumann, whom I can't help but remember today.   Even though the Rehabilitation Act was signed into law in 1973, it  was not implemented until 4 years later, and that was only after  hundreds of disabled activists sat in and occupied Federal buildings  across the country. At San Francisco's sit-in, which lasted for weeks,  protestors like Judy refused to be moved. Authorities shut off the  phone lines. They shut off the water so those protesting went thirsty.  But our community stuck together and stayed strong. I am grateful these  dedicated activists persisted despite difficult obstacles, and their  persistence and determination should inspire our country to push  further towards achieving the ultimate goal of full accessibility and  inclusion.   People with disabilities continue to face discrimination every day.  From lack of access to healthcare, to disparately low employment rates;  from inaccessible websites and official documents, to suffering the  indignity of having airlines destroy wheelchairs and assistive  equipment on flights, our Nation must push past complacency and work to  ensure the letter and spirit of the Rehabilitation Act and Americans  with Disabilities Act are applied to all aspects of life in the 21st  century.   Our community is already more than 61 million strong--a number that  will continue to grow in the years ahead--because the truth is that  every American is just 1 day away from becoming disabled and everyone  should hope to live long enough that they eventually gain some sort of  disability. Our Nation's laws and policies should reflect that. That is  one reason why I am proud that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services acted on my request that Medicare finally cover seat elevation  systems in power wheelchairs. It is why I am proud that the Government  Accountability Office agreed to study health disparities experienced by  people with disabilities. And it is why I will keep working with the  disability community to honor and carry on the work of Judy and all the  advocates, activists, and allies who helped get us to this point.   So here is to 50 years of the Rehabilitation Act and to everything we  do in the next 50.                            ____________________
