 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague  from Georgia for leading this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act is having in east Alabama and across America.   After working under an outdated Tax Code for over 30 years,  businesses and  [[Page H1687]]  families from the Third District of Alabama and the entire country are  feeling some relief. From bigger paychecks to bonuses and raises, many  companies in the U.S. have already distributed over $4 billion in  bonuses.   In my district, Russell Lands in Alexander City distributed $500  bonuses to each of their 500 employees as a direct result of the tax  overhaul.   Three companies in Columbus, Georgia, which is right across the State  line from my district, have already rewarded their employees because of  tax reform, including, as you have heard earlier, Aflac, Synovus  Financial, and Total System Services. This is putting more money back  in the pockets of some of my constituents right across the State line  in Russell County.   Regions Bank and Protective Life in Birmingham, Alabama; Cogent  Building Group in Point Clear, Alabama; Overseas Hardwoods in Stockton,  Alabama; and DTI and Xante in Mobile are other companies across our  great State that have been giving bonuses to their employees.   I am proud of Ben Russell of Russell Lands and the other companies I  mentioned leading the way on this important front.   Because of the tax reform, over 4 million workers have already  received a bonus or a pay increase across our great country. These  bigger paychecks and bonuses can help families save for their kids'  school or help pay for a new household appliance. It helps with making  a car payment or paying off student debt.    This extra money represents opportunity. At a time when every penny  counts, I am proud to see tax reform is giving hardworking Americans  more money to take home to their families.
