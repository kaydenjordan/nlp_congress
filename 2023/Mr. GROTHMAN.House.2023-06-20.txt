 Mr. Speaker, I urge this body to take up H. Res. 461  and pass it as quickly as possible.   Every year in this country the Federal Government, perhaps  inappropriately, spends billions of dollars on elementary and secondary  education. These buildings are designed and intended to be funded to  teach the young children of this country, and not-so-young people, to  read, to do math, to prepare themselves for a job.   It has been brought to our attention that local officials all around  the country, in an effort to ease the mass invasion of illegal  immigrants across our southern border, are now using these schools as a  shelter for people, who in  [[Page H2983]]  many cases--in almost all cases--should not have come to the United  States in the first place.   I think it is very important that Congress weigh in immediately,  since we are providing billions of dollars to these educational  institutions, and say no. These educational institutions are to be used  for education only, and we are not going to spend any more of that  money to support people who shouldn't be here in the first place.                            ____________________
