Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  1490, the 504 Modernization and Small Manufacturer Enhancement Act of  2021.   504 loans are an important SBA capital access product, allowing small  businesses to affordably purchase machinery and equipment, acquire real  estate, or take on other fixed asset costs.   The loan has a three-party structure where an SBA-backed 504 lender  provides 40 percent of the financing, a third-party lender provides 50  percent of the financing, and a small business borrower provides 10  percent. This unique structure has helped thousands of entrepreneurs  expand their businesses and hire more employees, especially businesses  with significant fixed costs.   Last Congress, the Committee on Small Business's Subcommittee on  Oversight, Investigations, and Regulations held a hearing to review the  current status of the 504 loan program. We heard from a panel of 504  lenders who reported concerns with the loan closing process,  specifically that closing delays have caused loans to fall through and  businesses to lose out on affordable financing.   To that end, Ms. Craig put forth a strong proposal to streamline the  504 loan closing process and make compliance easier for CDCs,  borrowers, and third-party lenders, who are essential to the 504 loan  structure.   Two of the provisions of that bill, which passed unanimously through  our committee and the House, were also included in the Economic Aid Act  that was enacted in December.  [[Page H1771]]    The version of the bill before us today is identical to the version  we passed last Congress, but for those provisions included in the  Economic Aid Act.   The changes under consideration today continue to address the issues  we have heard in our engagement with 504 lenders and their borrowers in  our districts, and I am pleased we are taking a vote on them today.                                time  1445    These include increasing the maximum loan size for small  manufacturers from $5.5 million to $6.5 million and easing the job  retention or creation requirement for them, which helps make 504 loans  easier to access.   We should be doing everything that we can to make navigating and  utilizing this program as simple as possible. As a member of the Small  Business Committee, I am committed to helping our small businesses and  manufacturers weather this current crisis and to helping Main Street  come back even stronger.   It is why I fought to secure $10 billion for the Defense Production  Act in the American Rescue Plan Act to ramp up domestic production of  PPE and other critical supplies. It is also why I introduced the  SUPPLIES Act, which would promote the manufacturing of PPE and medical  supplies by small businesses here in the U.S. I am proud to be a  cosponsor of the bill to help small businesses and manufacturers so  they can help us.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota and the gentlewoman  from California for their hard work, and I applaud their efforts to  make bipartisan improvements to this valuable program.   I recommend a ``yes'' vote to all my colleagues in the House.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, the SBA's 504 loan program has made a significant  impact on our Main Streets in its 62-year history.   In addition to partnering with banks to extend affordable fixed-asset  capital, most CDCs in the program are also actively involved in  promoting local economic development, especially for underserved  business communities.   I am proud of the opportunity we have today to continue supporting  the work of CDCs. I want to applaud the work by the gentlewoman from  Minnesota, the gentlewoman from California, and their bipartisan effort  on the 504 program.   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1482) to amend the Small Business Act to enhance  the Office of Credit Risk Management, to require the Administrator of  the Small Business Administration to issue rules relating to  environmental obligations of certified development companies, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1482         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  1482, the 504 Credit Risk Management Improvement Act, which clarifies  the oversight role of the SBA's Office of Credit Risk Management in  respect to CDCs.   To improve oversight of the SBA business loan programs, including the  7(a) and 504 loan programs, the agency established the Office of Credit  Risk Management--OCRM--within the Office of Capital Access. OCRM  conducts periodic reviews of SBA lenders to ensure they are complying  with program requirements.   In 2018, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to codify the office  and gave it the tools it needs to conduct proper oversight and hold  noncompliant lenders accountable.   It was our intent to boost the office's enforcement powers to help  minimize the likelihood that business loan programs would face losses  and reduce the need for Congress to appropriate funds.   I should point out that these programs are designed to operate at  zero subsidy, meaning they come at no cost to the taxpayer, and we  intend to keep it that way.   I am pleased that the gentleman from North Carolina, along with the  gentlewoman from Minnesota, worked together to bring this bill to life  last Congress. This bill clarifies OCRM's oversight role and shifts  loan closing file review responsibilities to the office and, in turn,  keeps the program running at a zero subsidy. I applaud their  bipartisanship and, more importantly, their commitment to America's  small businesses.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers at  this time, and I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, in its 62-year history, the  SBA's 504 loan program has helped thousands of entrepreneurs acquire  heavy machinery and equipment, expand to more locations, and hire  workers. It has long been a strong-performing SBA program and has  enjoyed consistent bipartisanship support.   We must continue to take all steps needed to preserve the integrity  of the 504 program and ensure it will be an option for the next  generation of entrepreneurs. Passing the bill before us today will help  us do so.   I thank Mr. Bishop and Ms. Craig for their hard work and  collaboration in bringing this bill to the floor today. I also thank  Mr. Luetkemeyer for his leadership today and his unwavering commitment  to our Nation's 30 million small businesses.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.
