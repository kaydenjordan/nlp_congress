 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6364) to amend the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area  Improvement Act to extend the exception to the closure of certain roads  within the Recreation Area for local businesses, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6364         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. USE OF CERTAIN ROADS WITHIN THE DELAWARE WATER GAP                     NATIONAL RECREATION AREA.         Section 4(b) of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation       Area Improvement Act (Public Law 109-156; 119 Stat. 2948) is       amended in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking       ``Until'' and all that follows through ``subsection (a)'' and       inserting ``Until September 30, 2026, subsection (a)''.       SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  [[Page H8160]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include additional material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6364 introduced  by my colleague, Representative Matt Cartwright. This bill will amend  the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Improvement Act to  extend the use of Highway 209 within the recreation area until 2026.   Mr. Speaker, in 1981, the section of Highway 209 that runs through  the recreation area was transferred from the State to the National Park  Service.   In 1983, Congress enacted a provision of law that closed that section  of Highway 209 to commercial traffic, with an important exception for  vehicles serving businesses located in or adjacent to the recreation  area. Since then, the United States Congress has extended the exemption  multiple times, with the latest exemption set to expire on September 30  of this year.   Mr. Speaker, without this exemption, commercial vehicles have limited  acceptable alternatives. Commercial traffic would have to travel a  minimum of 10 extra miles to avoid the recreation area.   This permitted access contributes to economic vitality that impacts  that community, the public safety, and the quality of life of the  park's adjacent communities.   I, again, thank my good colleague, Representative Cartwright, for  introducing this important legislation and championing this bill on  behalf of his constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), the main sponsor of the  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1638) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer certain  National Forest System land to the State of South Dakota, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1638         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1638, the Gilt Edge  Mine Conveyance Act, introduced by my colleague, Representative  Johnson.   The bill will authorize South Dakota to purchase approximately 266  acres of U.S. Forest Service land in Lawrence County, South Dakota.   Any proceeds received by the Forest Service from the conveyance will  be deposited in a fund for the maintenance and improvement of the Black  Hills National Forest in South Dakota.   Mr. Speaker, the conveyance is necessary due to the Gilt Edge Mine,  which is located within the Black Hills forestry boundary. Since Brohm  Mining Company abandoned the mine and its responsibilities to address  contaminated water in the late 1990s, South Dakota and the  Environmental Protection Agency have worked together to conduct a  cleanup effort of the mine and contaminated water.   Mr. Speaker, currently, the mine encompasses a patchwork of Forest  Service lands and lands owned by South Dakota. Consolidating ownership  of the entire Gilt Edge Mine with South Dakota will make it easier for  the State to fulfill its obligation for site remediation and  monitoring.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good colleague, Representative Johnson, for  introducing this important legislation and championing this bill on  behalf of his constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1638, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
